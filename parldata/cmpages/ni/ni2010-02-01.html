      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The Assembly met at 12.00 noon (Mr Speaker in the  Chair).</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Members observed two minutes&rsquo; silence.</p>
      <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="1"></a>Assembly Business</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Acting First Minister and deputy First Minister wrote to me this morning to  advise me that, due to exceptional circumstances, they will be unavailable to  appear at Question Time as scheduled today. Members will know that Question  Time to the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister (OFMDFM) was  scheduled to take place at 2.30 pm, followed by questions to the Minister of  the Environment at 3.00 pm. Following discussions this morning with the Whips,  it has been agreed that, when the Business Committee meets tomorrow, it will  reschedule for next week the questions that were due to be answered by OFMDFM  today. Question Time for the Minister of the Environment will be brought  forward to begin at 2.30 pm today. Given the circumstances, I ask the House for  its understanding.</p>
      <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="2"></a>Committee Business</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  This morning, I received notification of the resignation, with immediate  effect, of Mr Thomas Buchanan as the Deputy Chairperson of the Committee for  Employment and Learning.</p>
      <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="3"></a>Executive Committee Business</p>
      <p class="H4StageHeading">Work and Families (Increase of Maximum Amount) Order (Northern Ireland)  2009</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning (Sir Reg Empey)</strong>: I beg to move</p>
      <p class="Q3Motion">That the Work and Families (Increase of Maximum Amount) Order  (Northern Ireland)  2009 be approved.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I am seeking the Assembly&rsquo;s approval of this Order, which  is subject to the confirmatory procedure as laid down in the parent  legislation, the Work and Families (Northern Ireland) Order 2006. It  was made on 10 September 2009 and came into effect on 1 October 2009.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It will be helpful if I outline to Members the background  to the Order. First, however, I note the resignation of Mr Buchanan as the  Deputy Chairperson of the Committee for Employment and Learning and thank him  for his co-operation in the short period that he has occupied that post.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In the 2009 Budget, the UK Government announced that they  would increase from &pound;350 to &pound;380 the limit on the maximum amount of a week&rsquo;s  pay used to calculate certain awards made by employment-related tribunals,  including awards for redundancy or unfair dismissal, and other amounts payable  under employment legislation by government &mdash; in this case, the Department for Employment  and Learning in Northern Ireland &mdash; where an employer is insolvent. Northern Ireland has traditionally maintained  parity with Great Britain in  this area, and arrangements remain in place to ensure that payments in Northern Ireland keep pace with those in the  rest of the United Kingdom.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Northern Ireland  primary legislation is framed in the same way as that in Great Britain,  with the annual increase in the weekly limit generally being linked to the  retail price index (RPI). However, on this occasion, in both Great Britain and  Northern Ireland, a one-off power is being used to raise the weekly limit by an  amount greater than the rate of the RPI and, as a consequence, to suspend the  annual RPI-linked change that would otherwise have been required. If this  suspension had not taken place, the effect of that annual change would have  been to reduce the weekly limit from &pound;350 to &pound;340 due to the fall in the RPI.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Unfortunately, the current economic downturn has generated  an exceptionally high level of redundancies, which has convinced me of the need  to revise the basic entitlements of individuals who are facing the dreadful  reality losing their jobs. Inaction would result in redundancy payments being  reduced at a time of considerable hardship. I am, therefore, seeking Members&rsquo;  agreement to this measure today to provide much needed entitlements in line  with the rest of the United    Kingdom.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The uprating from &pound;350 to &pound;380 was implemented across the UK on 1 October  2009. As the amount is used to calculate various payments and awards, including  unfair dismissal awards and payments made to employees where their employer has  become insolvent as well as statutory redundancy payments, this is a positive  measure at a time of undoubted economic hardship. It ensures that people in Northern Ireland continue to have the same  entitlements as their counterparts in England,  Wales and Scotland.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">An equality screening exercise has been carried out and has  concluded that there are no differential impacts on section 75 groups. A regulatory  impact assessment has ascertained that there are costs to employers in the  region of &pound;1&middot;9 million to &pound;2&middot;7 million, with Exchequer costs of between  &pound;800,000 and &pound;1&middot;3 million. I emphasise, however, that, for the economy as a  whole, those financial impacts, with the exception of one-off implementation  costs of around &pound;60,000, are offset by benefits to employees. Although there  are associated costs for employers, I have looked and will continue to look for  opportunities to reduce the regulatory burden on business in line with the  principles of better regulation. My Department is considering deregulatory  measures relating to employment agencies that would reduce the administrative  burden experienced by employers. A fundamental review of mechanisms for resolving  workplace disputes has just been completed, and I hope to announce proposals  shortly that will reduce costs to employers and offer a wider range of  alternatives to what can be lengthy and expensive tribunal proceedings.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I return to the matter at hand. The provisions of the  proposed Order are considered to be compliant with section 24 of the Northern  Ireland Act 1998, which is entitled &lsquo;Community law, Convention rights, etc.&rsquo; I  am grateful to the Committee for Employment and Learning and the Examiner of  Statutory Rules for scrutiny of this statutory rule. I am also grateful to the  Committee for its recommendation that the Order be confirmed by the Assembly.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Speaker, you will recall that last week, sadly, there  were two further significant announcements, as more than 400 people lost their  jobs in manufacturing. That is of great distress to them and of great regret  and concern to all Members. When we are considering the proposed Order, we must  remember the circumstances in which many find themselves, particularly those  who will be greatly challenged to find alternative employment. It may be asked  why I have decided to increase the amount when the retail price index is  falling. However, in addition to the argument based on parity, I must point out  that those people are in the most vulnerable situation they will ever find  themselves in throughout their career. The amounts involved are comparatively  modest, yet they may contribute in some measure to alleviating the financial  distress in which many of those people will find themselves.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Employment and Learning (Ms S Ramsey)</strong>: Go raibh maith  agat, a Cheann Comhairle.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Like the Minister, I want to commend Thomas Buchanan, the  former Deputy Chairperson of the Committee for Employment and Learning. I thank  him for the help and support he gave me, as Chairperson, and I also say that on  behalf of the Committee staff. I am getting a little worried: this makes three  Deputy Chairpersons I have seen down during my time as Chairperson. Is it me?  Should I take this personally? Keep bringing them on. Thomas is returning to  the Health Committee, and, as a member of that Committee, I welcome his return.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">On behalf of the Committee for Employment and Learning, I  support the motion. The Minister has set out its purpose clearly, so I do not  want to waste time repeating that. The Committee is conscious that the Minister  has taken a sensible decision, in view of the economic downturn, to increase  the weekly base for maximum payment beyond the rate indicated by the retail  price income. The Committee commends the Minister for that.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee considered the SL1 background note to the  Order at its meeting on 9 September 2009 and agreed to support the proposed  statutory rule at its meeting on 7 October 2009. Therefore, on behalf of the  Committee for Employment and Learning, I support the motion.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McClarty</strong>:  I thank the Minister for outlining the measure. I, too, welcome the Order.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As the Minister has said, the measure ensures that  statutory redundancy payments and various compen&shy;sations due to employees do  not decline in line with inflation at this time of recession. The Minister  outlined that there will be some cost to employers and some to the Department.  It will be noted that, in the circumstances, both figures are modest. That  money will be going directly to people who have lost their job, and it will  therefore help them if they are unemployed for a period, and it will, as a  result, benefit the economy.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The measure is one that I am sure the whole House will  welcome. When the Committee discussed it, no problems were found. I thank the  Minister for his work on the matter.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lo</strong>: I  support the motion and the approval of this Order. It is important not only that  we keep parity with Great Britain but that Members show support for those  facing redundancy or who have just experienced it and demonstrate that the  House cares about those people. It would be unthinkable to decrease the maximum  amount payable from &pound;350 to &pound;340. Therefore, we warmly support the increase of  &pound;30 per week.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">12.15 pm</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: I have attended more rigorous debates. Before you  came in, Mr Speaker, I sat alone in the Chamber wondering whether we would even  get a quorum.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee assessed the Order in considerable detail.  Under the six-month rule, we had to bring the measure to the House before  April. Therefore, we decided to bring it to the House at this stage.  Consequential issues will arise from awards made at tribunals as a result of  the Order, and those will work themselves through the system.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As I said, given the regrettable circumstances that we  face, I am sure that many workers who are facing redundancy or reaching the end  of their working life will find it extremely difficult to find a job with  comparable wages. Therefore, any modest assistance that can be given at this  stage will help those people to get through a difficult time.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the Committee and Members for their contributions.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
      <p class="Q3Motion">That the Work and Families (Increase of Maximum Amount) Order  (Northern Ireland)  2009 be approved.</p>
      <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="4"></a>Committee Business</p>
      <p class="H4StageHeading">Statutory Committee Membership</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  As with similar motions, the motion on Statutory Committee membership will be  treated as a business motion. Therefore, there will be no debate.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
      <p class="Q3Motion">That Mr Thomas Buchanan be appointed as a member of the  Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety; that Mr Jonathan Bell  be appointed as a member of the Committee for Employment and Learning; and that  Mr Jonathan Bell replace Mr Adrian McQuillan as a member of the Committee for  the Environment. &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Mr Weir.]</span></p>
      <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="5"></a>Private Members&rsquo; Business</p>
      <p class="H4StageHeading">Education Bill</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Business Committee previously agreed to allocate additional time to motions  for which two or more amendments have been selected. As two amendments have  been published on the Marshalled List, the Business Committee has agreed to  allow up to one hour and 45 minutes for the debate. The proposer will have 10  minutes in which to propose the motion and 10 minutes in which to make a  winding-up speech. The proposer of each amendment will have 10 minutes in which  to propose the amendment and five minutes in which to make a winding-up speech.  All other Members who wish to speak will have five minutes.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I beg to move</p>
      <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly notes with grave concern the failure by  the Minister of Education to secure consensus on the Education Bill; further  notes the unacceptable nature of the Minister&rsquo;s interim governance and  management arrangements; believes that these interim arrangements undermine the  authority of this Assembly; and calls on the Minister of Education to urgently  seek a resolution that is acceptable to all parties in the Executive.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Since the introduction of the Education Bill, the Ulster  Unionist Party has outlined serious reservations about its content and general  direction. In light of the Minister&rsquo;s initial proposals, we opposed the first  Education Bill at Second Stage. Early in the process, we realised that the Bill  had the potential to cause deadlock and confrontation. Unfortunately, we have  been proven right.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">At Second Stage of the Education Bill, my colleague Mr  Basil McCrea said:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;I urge all other parties to reflect seriously on the  practical, democratic and inclusive ramifications that the Bill will have for  our entire educational system and for our society.&rdquo; &mdash; <span class="Italic"><span style="font-style:normal; ">[Official Report, Bound  Volume 36, p10, col 2]</span></span>.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I appreciate that other parties are coming to terms with  how potentially disastrous the Minister&rsquo;s proposals are. However, I am afraid  that much of the opposition has come too late. Instead of sending the Minister  back to the drawing board at the earliest possible opportunity, we are now  stuck in the quagmire of incompetence with an Education Bill that is  bureaucratic and overly centralising. It will weaken the ability of schools to  manage their own affairs and to achieve the best educational outcomes for  children in Northern Ireland.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The parties have spent more than a week in talks dealing  with an issue about which most people in Northern Ireland are not overly  concerned. However, our education system is on the brink of collapse. People in  the streets are confused about what motivates and drives their politicians, and  they are right to question the commitment of certain parties to good  government.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I will explain why we opposed the original Bill. The way  that the Minister has handled the passage of the first Education Bill and the  second education Bill has been nothing short of a disgrace. Her proposals have  been ill thought-out, and the introduction of the first Bill before adequately  thinking through the content of the second has been unsuccessful. Throughout  her ministerial career, the Minister has claimed that she is all about change.  However, when it comes to the crunch, she is unsure of the change that she wants.  That is no way to run a Department.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Education Bill will create the largest quango in Europe  in that it will deal with the administration of an education system in a  country that has a total population of 1&middot;7 million citizens. The Minister has  repeatedly stated that the education and skills authority (ESA) is being  created to tackle educational underachievement. However, by reducing the  abilities of a school and its board of governors to manage their own affairs,  maintain the school ethos and make meaningful decisions, the Minister has again  missed the crucial point, which is that educational underachievement must be  reduced.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Ulster Unionist Party originally supported a  streamlining of the administration of the education system in Northern Ireland.  However, the draconian powers that will be assigned to the ESA do not reflect  the original proposals. The failed process has meant that, effectively,  progress on the introduction of proposals for the second education Bill has  been stalled. There are serious concerns that the Minister&rsquo;s proposals will  ultimately remove the ethos basis of our schools in the long term. The  Minister&rsquo;s treatment of the controlled sector has raised serious concerns about  the entire review of public administration (RPA) project. We need equal  representation from all sectors; no one sector should be above another.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister has failed to get consensus, so she has  decided to ignore the correct legislative process. By introducing interim  governance and management arrangements, the Minister has, effectively, bypassed  the House. In their respective amendments, the SDLP and the Alliance Party have  sought to remove the reference to interim arrangements undermining the  authority of the Assembly. However, both those parties are wrong, so we  respectfully reject both their amendments.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister has undermined the Assembly by giving  authority over the reformed education and library boards to the  chairperson-designate and the chief executive-designate of the ESA. We  recognise that it is good practice for people to be appointed as designates in  anticipation of forthcoming legislation, as was the case when the Health and  Social Care (Reform) Bill was proceeding through the House. However, designates  to bodies should not have power over existing structures. That is what the  Minister is proposing. Therefore, the Minister is bypassing both the House and  the Committee structure in the Assembly, and she is doing a grave disservice to  our democratic system.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">When the Minister made her statement, the Ulster Unionist  Party asked her a number of questions that she refused to answer. Many of those  questions remain unanswered, so I will ask some of them again.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  The Member&rsquo;s speech thus far has been full of broad and sweeping statements  about the Minister bypassing legislation. First, which Act has the Minister  bypassed? Secondly, the Member said that the Minister&rsquo;s ESA Bill removes the  power and authority of boards of governors. I ask the Member to quote the  clauses in the ESA Bill that remove those powers. Those clauses do not exist,  but, if the Member knows different, I ask him to quote them. Secondly, is the  Member aware that significant clauses of the ESA Bill are sponsored by his  party colleague the Minister for Employment and Learning?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  The Member made three points; he may have failed to count them all. He knows  full well that the Committee has been treated disgracefully since the beginning  of the process. Where is the Bill? If he was so confident about his arguments,  the Bill would be in front of us. However, it is nowhere to be seen. When will  the House debate the Bill? It should be debated in and sponsored by the House  after having been through the Education Committee. It was tabled to come to the  House in November 2009. It was pulled from the schedule then and again  subsequently. Where is it today?</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Questions are outstanding about the legal status of the  chief executive and chairman designate. What powers do those offices have?  Given that they have not been legally constituted, should they have any powers  over existing structures? The Minister must answer those questions in the House  today. We need answers to questions about the structures and the legal  implications of all the mess and chaos that has been created. The Minister is  proposing to give power to designate members of a body that does not legally  exist. Do education and library boards or the new reform structures that the Minister  has announced report back to a chief executive and chairman of the ESA, which  is in shadow form and has no legal framework for existing? Such questions must  be addressed.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Some other problems with the interim relations include the  fact that people are leaving education and library boards either because of  retirement or because their time is coming to an end. Can we guarantee that we  can fill the positions adequately? The Minister has exhibited a mixture of  shambles and authoritarianism; that must stop if this place is ever to become a  symbol of stable and good government.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">To gain consensus, the Minister must go back to the drawing  board on this issue. The ESA has the potential to completely alter education  provision in Northern    Ireland. It concentrates unacceptable powers  with the Minister and is no longer merely a part of an RPA process of streamlining.  It creates structures that will facilitate the greatest change in education in Northern Ireland  for a generation. In the absence of consensus for her Bill, the Minister has  decided to force reforms through by decree. Northern Ireland&rsquo;s political system  will work only if all political parties value co-operation and have a desire to  build consensus.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member should bring his remarks to a close.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  It is obvious that some parties value decree and diktat more. However, we must  all move to change that.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lunn</strong>: I  beg to move amendment No 1: leave out all after the first &lsquo;Minister of  Education&rsquo; and insert</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&lsquo;and the Executive to secure consensus on the  Education Bill; further notes the unacceptable nature of the Minister&rsquo;s interim  governance and management arrangements; and calls on the Minister of Education  and the Executive to agree urgently an acceptable resolution to allow the Bill  to proceed.&rsquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We do not have enormous difficulty with the motion as it  stands. However, we propose the amendment to make the point that the blame for  the impasse lies not only with the Minister but with her Executive colleagues,  perhaps even more so.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The ESA Bill is probably the most important of the 45 items  that we believe are logjammed at Executive level. It seems to be an undisputed  fact that the Executive have not had a single discussion on education for two years.  That is a disgrace. As a result, there are two areas of chaos in the education  system: the well-documented transfer mess and the failure to progress the ESA  Bill, which is the subject of this debate.</p>
      <p class="B3SpeakerinChair">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr Dallat] in the Chair)</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The motion notes with grave concern the failure to ensure  consensus. Our amendment would lay the blame on the Executive without letting  the Minister off the hook entirely. There is no doubt that consensus has not  been achieved on some aspects of the Bill, as John McCallister said. There are  genuine concerns on the unionist side about the situation in the controlled  sector and the rights of transferors, not to mention the usual suspicions that  the maintained and Irish language sectors are getting a better deal.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Surely the way to sort out those matters and others is to  bring the Bill before the House for full discussion and resolution.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">12.30 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">John McCallister said that the Committee for Education had,  in some way, been sidelined on the issue, but we have spent more than a year  scrutinising the Bill, and we have looked at it line by line.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  Does the Member accept that the Committee was promised sight of the second  Education Bill a long time before it arrived?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lunn</strong>:  That is a fair point. We were promised the second Education Bill at the  beginning of June 2009, but we did not receive it until the last day of September  2009. I agree that that is no way to do business. However, there were more than  100 amendments listed to the first Bill; it is not as if it has not been  scrutinised. The Minister has also tried, more than once, to bring the first  Bill to the Assembly. I ask: who is at fault? Who is holding it up?</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">A few weeks ago, when the Minister made her statement on  that issue, we discussed the interim arrangements for continuity of  administration of the system. My party has reservations about the temporary  arrangements, about the limited number of appointees to the education and  library boards and the possible illegality of the whole exercise. At the end of  the day, the situation was forced on the Minister by Executive intransigence.  The administration system had to be maintained in some form.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">My party does not believe that the interim arrangements undermine  the authority of the Assembly. We see them as a temporary expedient to cover a  difficult situation. The bigger problem will arise if no resolution is found.  Where do we go from here if we do not have the ESA? Do we go back to having a  smaller number of education and library boards? We are heading for chaos again.  The final part of our amendment merely changes the emphasis again, and lays the  responsibility on the Minister and the Executive to allow the Bill to progress.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">A tremendous amount of work and preparation, to say nothing  of significant expenditure, has gone into making the ESA a reality. Given the  attitude of the Ulster Unionists at the start of the process, when Basil McCrea  vowed at a Committee meeting to fight the proposal tooth and nail, it is  heartening to assume &mdash; by the wording of the motion, if not by the wording of  Mr McCallister&rsquo;s speech &mdash; that that party is now prepared to consider the  Bill&rsquo;s passage, even if it has to be suitably amended.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  It has to be seriously amended.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lunn</strong>: OK.  I will change that to &ldquo;seriously amended&rdquo;.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I look forward to hearing the DUP&rsquo;s attitude to the  situation, and particularly the views of the Chairperson of the Committee for  Education, who has now joined us. Two weeks ago, during a Committee meeting,  Mervyn Storey announced, with what appeared to be considerable satisfaction,  perhaps relish or even glee, that the ESA Bill was dead in the water and was  not coming back. That is, more or less, a quote. The ESA is now central to the  future of our education system, but it is being threatened with extinction  without even being allowed to come into existence. I have not heard any  concrete suggestions for an alternative, except for the status quo or some  vague amendment to the existing structures.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Much has been said recently about the relevance of private  Member&rsquo;s motions. I attended a Business Committee meeting not long ago during  which Lord Morrow expressed the strong view that there were too many private  Member&rsquo;s motions and that the Assembly was becoming a talking shop. I agree  with him, but surely the lack of Executive business and legislation is making  room for those motions.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  Bring the Bill.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lunn</strong>:  Bring the Bill. I hope that events elsewhere this week may provide the goodwill  that is necessary to allow important business, such as the ESA Bill, to come  before the House. I also hope that the motion before us, suitably amended by my  party, will be discussed in a constructive way and that the message that goes  back to the Executive and the Minister is that the whole House wants progress  on the ESA.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Our education debates normally degenerate into a  combination of Minister-bashing or justifying the Minister, with no winners or  losers. Perhaps this debate will be different. Mr McCallister set a reasonable  tone in his contribution, but if Basil McCrea had been here, it might have been  different. The motion seeks consensus: in the Alliance Party, we have time to  look at these things, and that word is derived from the Latin word consentire,  which means to agree or to feel together.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I have a vision in my head, which may take some time to  realise, of Basil McCrea, Mervyn Storey and Caitr&iacute;ona Ruane feeling together  and agreeing, but we will have to wait for that. In the meantime, I ask the  House to support our amendment.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. T&aacute; an-&aacute;thas orm leas&uacute; uimhir  a d&oacute; a mholadh don Tion&oacute;l inniu.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I beg to move amendment No 2:</p>
      <p class="Q3Motion">&ldquo;leave out all from &lsquo;believes&rsquo; to &lsquo;Assembly;&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The position surrounding the Education Bill is symptomatic  of much that characterises the Executive; namely, the stasis that lies at the  heart of government here. That leads to instability and concern among the  general public and the agencies that are affected by the lack of agreement. The  situation with the review of public administration is similar. It is holding up  the reform of local government and causing consternation among those affected.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As Trevor Lunn said, the Committee for Education devoted a  great deal of time, including an extension to the normal period of examination,  to ensure the proper scrutiny of every clause of the Bill. It is extremely  disappointing to me, as a member of that Committee, and, I am sure, to  colleagues, that the matter has not been progressed to date. The delay has  caused a great deal of anxiety to the staff of the education and library boards  and to those who work in and are responsible for schools. They are uncertain  about what lies ahead, and they need certainty in this situation.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Many people have also raised concerns with us about the  interim arrangements that are holding things together. On average, the interim  boards have only six to nine members, made up of transferors, trustees and  teacher representatives, but they are expected to govern the education and  library board areas until the so-called transition boards come into place in February  or March 2010. We are told that interviews are under way to fill those  positions, but there is no definite commencement date for new board  arrangements. Indeed, prospective members of the interim boards do not know how  long they will have to continue in that role.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The lack of certainty creates an atmosphere of insecurity,  and it does not inspire confidence in the Minister, her Department or  government in general. At a time of economic recession, the last things that we  need are further uncertainty and insecurity surrounding arrangements that were  supposed to deliver savings that would benefit front line services.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Much responsibility has been placed on the shoulders of the  interim boards, and many people are now asking whether the arrangements are  robust enough legally to oversee the delivery of services. I see that, for a  change, at least one official is present to advise the Minister. Perhaps,  therefore, the Minister will tell us whether she has had a comprehensive risk  assessment carried out on the temporary arrangements. If so, will she tell us  the results of that assessment? If no such assessment has been carried out, why  not?</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Turning to the democratic deficit in the new arrangements,  schedule 2 to the Education and Libraries Order 1986 requires the Department to  &ldquo;have regard to the population&rdquo; of each district council area when determining  the number of council members to sit on education and library boards. Has the  Minister taken regard of the population of each council area in determining the  numbers of councillors on the boards? Why is there only one nominee for Moyle  District Council and Derry City Council, for example, whereas Belfast City  Council has four? That was the case at the beginning; I hope that it has  changed in the interim.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee for Education also raised the issue of  teacher appointment committees. Once again, I ask whether the Minister has  fully addressed that issue. Has she given due consideration to the impact that  the creation of smaller boards would have on the representative requirements  for statutory teaching appointments as set out in schedule 3 of the 1986 Order?  There is a requirement to have three teachers on those committees, and that has  to be facilitated in the new boards. What impact will that have on the make-up  of smaller boards?</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">A further question raised by the Committee was that of  transferor representatives and the requirement for all boards to have at least  two transferors. What action has the Minister taken to resolve that issue?</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Those are just some of the questions arising from the  temporary arrangements. However, the real issue is the logjam at the heart of  government; the situation that has led to the Bill being mired in disagreement.  Time has caught up with the ESA. It was to have delivered savings of &pound;20  million a year to front line services. It seems that those savings have gone up  in smoke. We are in a situation whereby not only are the savings no longer  available but we face new and deeper cuts that will go to the heart of front  line services.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister needs to deliver on the ESA, special needs,  transfer, literacy and numeracy, school improve&shy;ment, and the strategy for the  nought-to-six age group, to name but a few issues. So far, there has been a lot  of paperwork and even more words, but the time for action has come. Theory is  fine, but it is now time to put it into practice. It is time for delivery for  our children; they need it, and our people demand it. If there are  disagreements over parts of the Bill, let us resolve them through engagement.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There has been a lot of talk of partnership in the past  week. Now is the time to practise partnership working in order to resolve the  outstanding issues. We can no longer allow the Bill to remain in abeyance. It  must be brought to the House and agreed, so that the arrangements that arise  from it can be put in place. If that is not done, it will reflect very poorly  on the Minister and the Executive. The public mood over the past week has  clearly indicated that the public are fed up with the logjam at the heart of  government here and that they want issues to be resolved. I urge the Minister  to take the necessary action to ensure that the issues around the Bill are  resolved without further delay. Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Education (Mr Storey)</strong>: The Committee undertook  substantial scrutiny of the Education Bill and published a comprehen&shy;sive report  on 30 September 2009. The report&rsquo;s executive summary started by agreeing key  amendments to the Bill to recommend to the House. The Committee&rsquo;s main theme  was the need for clarity, certainty and confidence in the ESA&rsquo;s role in regard  to several areas of the Bill where those were clearly lacking, as evidenced by  the education stakeholders.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee&rsquo;s main concerns included the ESA board  membership; the role of its committees; proposed schemes of employment and  management; the general duties of the ESA; and issues regarding controlled  schools.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As regards the Minister&rsquo;s interim governance and management  arrangements that were put in place because the ESA was not established on 1  January 2010, the Committee initially wrote to the Minister on 25 November 2009,  and to departmental officials on 4 December 2009, following the Minister&rsquo;s  statement to the House on 1 December 2009.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">At a Committee meeting on 2 December 2009, some members  raised concerns with senior departmental officials regarding the membership of  the transitional education and library boards, namely how that will reflect the  community that they serve and whether adequate account was taken of population  levels in the various councils, as outlined by the Deputy Chairperson a few  moments ago. Other issues that were raised included the absence of a teacher  appointments committee for the Belfast Education and Library Board and the  anomaly that enables such a committee to operate in a suspended South Eastern  Education and Library Board.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">12.45 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee wrote to the Department on 4 December 2009 to  seek clarity on all those issues of concern. The letter included questions  about the role of the chairperson designate of the ESA and the chief executive  designate of the ESA as an additional accounting officer of the Department, and  it requested information on interim governance arrangements and other education  bodies, such as the Council for Catholic Maintained Schools (CCMS) and the  Council for the Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment (CCEA). Having received  no response to those questions, the Committee, at its meeting on 13 January 2010,  agreed to write to the Minister to request an urgent written update on the  position regarding the implementation of interim governance arrangements across  all sectors, including council representation on the education and library  boards. The Committee still awaits answers to all its questions.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, the Minister of Education wrote to the  Committee on 26 January to inform us that she had received a convergence  delivery plan from the chairperson designate and the chief executive designate  of the ESA. At last week&rsquo;s meeting, the Committee noted the Minister&rsquo;s views  about the importance of the convergence plan to the delivery of savings in the  Department&rsquo;s 2010-11 budget. However, members raised concerns that the plan is  being progressed without prior consultation with the Committee and before the  education and library boards have been reconstituted. There will not be an  opportunity, therefore, to consult the boards properly.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I will make my concluding remarks as a Member of the House,  and, indeed, I wish that I had more time to tease out the issues that need to  be raised on the Floor. Let me pose a question: why is there no ESA? Mr Lunn  said that, at a Committee meeting, I announced with some &ldquo;glee&rdquo; that the ESA is  in the bin. I support the motion and thank the Members who tabled it. It is not  only that the Minister of Education has failed to secure consensus. Even worse,  the Minister of Education has failed to deliver equality. We have a Minister  who struts the world stage as the champion for equality. Education was to be at  the heart of everything that she does. However, when it comes to the sector in  which 95% of Protestant children are educated, there is either no equality or  the Minister&rsquo;s own version of equality.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I would like to deal with three issues of concern. I  outlined these issues in a letter three or four months ago, but I still await a  reply from the party on the Benches opposite. The first issue is the controlled  sector. The Minister tells me that I abdicate my responsibility with regard to  working-class Protestant areas. Let me make it abundantly clear: I represent  people in those areas, I come from one of those areas, and I am proud of that.  I assure the Minister that she will not be able to continue to discriminate  against those people in the way that she has done to date. The place of the  transferors, as of right &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I ask the Member to bring his remarks to a close.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Education</strong>: Two legal rights were conferred on the  transferors.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Time.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Education</strong>: The first right conferred on the  transferors is their place on the board of governors. The second is their place  on the legal structures, which will be maintained and &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. As Mr Lunn said, private Member&rsquo;s  motions in the House have thus far not proven to be effective or relevant. If,  as all Members hope, the discussions going on in another place prove successful  and politics continues to be conducted through this avenue &mdash; at least, I assume  that that is what all Members hope &mdash; politicians in the Chamber will have to  realise that they are legislators and that it is unacceptable to bring forward meaningless  motions without credible alternatives.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  Give me one second.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is also unacceptable for Members to deliver speeches  that contain broad, sweeping statements that have no basis in reality or fact.  In his great speech, Mr McCallister, a Basil McCrea substitute, made broad  statements about the education service being in crisis, about the Minister  ignoring the Committee for Education, about the ESA Bill removing the powers of  boards of governors, and so on. At no stage did he refer to the clauses in the  Education Bill that back up that statement; nor did he refer to any Act, of  this legislature or any other, that the Minister has ignored. He did not do  that because they do not exist. Why let facts get in the way of a good story?  If those facts existed, and if I were him, I would have quoted each of the  clauses and the Act of which the Minister was in default, and I would have made  that my case. When there are no facts, however, people make broad statements  and hope that they get away with it. They throw in a few lavish comments about  crises and hope that the media picks up on them and prints the stories on the  front pages of newspapers.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">If Members are opposed to the Minister&rsquo;s interim  arrangements, they should bring forward alternatives. If there are no  alternatives, bringing forward a bland resolution such as this is no good. If  the interim measures are unacceptable, Members should state where they are so.  In the absence of the Education Bill, is it unacceptable for a Minister to  introduce an effective and efficient way forward for the administration of  education? I, for one, do not think that it is. Mr Storey&rsquo;s party talks about  needing an efficient and effective way to run government and how we need to cut  away the layers of bureaucracy. However, every time he and his party are  presented with a plan that brings forward measures that sweep away bureaucracy,  they oppose it.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Education</strong>: Will the Member give way?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  No.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">They oppose those plans, in the case of the education boards,  because it is about jobs for the boys. It is about jobs for DUP councillors &mdash;  it is usually boys in the case of the DUP &mdash; sitting around education boards and  administering education. The education service is administered by five  35-member boards &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Education</strong>: Will the Member give way?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>: I  will not.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is an ineffective and inefficient way of delivering the  service.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. The Member should take his seat. Where it is obvious that a  Member does not wish to give way, other Members should not persist.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  The Minister brought forward plans because she had to. The Bill has been  blocked at Executive level. Until it is implemented, the Minister has  responsibility for the delivery of &pound;20 million worth of savings through ESA. Mr  Bradley referred to those savings during his speech. Mr Storey may roll his  eyes; perhaps &pound;20 million is nothing to him, but I know a lot of people to whom  &pound;20 million is a whole lot of money.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">At the end of the day, the Minister has to find &pound;20 million  worth of savings. They can and will be found through the interim arrangements,  and they will be delivered to front line services. In the absence of a plan  from everyone else, Mr Bradley&rsquo;s prediction will come true: those savings will  be lost and added to the &pound;75 million that already has had to be taken out of  the budget. As the result of an Executive agreement, all Departments are losing  significant amounts of money. When that is added to the &pound;75 million that the  Minister already has to find, we are into serious problems in our classrooms.  It then becomes reality.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Some Members have talked about the failure of the Education  Bill to look after the controlled sector, but what have the five education  boards done, over their 30 years of service, to look after the controlled  sector? Six months ago, the DUP beat on our door and said that the controlled  sector has been left behind. I agree. How do we bring the controlled sector  forward, look after it and ensure that educational attainment in the controlled  sector is brought up to the standards that are achieved in the maintained  sector?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Bring your remarks to a close, please.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>: I  looked for one document when I prepared for this debate. It was not a research  paper for this debate; I looked for the research paper on underachievement in  education.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Your time is up.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  That is what Members need to keep focused on.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>: The  Ulster Unionist Party motion mentions the failure of the Education Minister to  find consensus on the Education Bill. It is not novel for this House to believe  that the Minister of Education has failed to achieve a consensus, or even tried  to get consensus on some issues. Trevor Lunn said that there are a number of  educational issues on which there is no agreement, not just post-primary  transfer. Therefore, it is not novel that we find ourselves, once again,  talking about a crisis, or whatever one wants to call it, in education because  we cannot find any agreement.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I joined the Education Committee towards the end of its  scrutiny of the Education Bill: I am making a habit of that, I joined the  Committee for the Environment when it was considering the Taxis Bill. There  were many months of line-by-line consideration and scrutiny of the Education  Bill, and it was clear, even at the tail end when I joined, that issues had  been left unresolved. There were issues on which the Committee could not find  consensus, and some of them required the Minister to take action to find a  conclusion.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">That is the process that every legislature in the world  must follow. After a Bill is introduced in the House, it is debated in the  Chamber before going to the Committee, at which stage amendments are proposed by  parties, and bits of the Bill are taken out or changed.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  The fact that that is the normal process is key to our motion. Mr O&rsquo;Dowd talked  about this being a &ldquo;legislative Assembly&rdquo; and he referred to &ldquo;meaningless  motions&rdquo;. Where is the legislation?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>: The  issue is this: when does it become clear to the Minister that she has not got  consensus? It was very clear to the Committee that the Minister needs to amend  the proposed legislation to try to build consensus. Until the Bill is  acceptable to the majority of Members, it will not be brought forward and  agreed. That is the issue.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">If we look at what is on the agenda of the House tomorrow,  we will see that amendments to the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions)  Bill proposed by the Minister and Members are due to be debated. That is how  the process works. The Democratic Unionist Party tabled a number of amendments  to the Education Bill when it was due to be brought before the House, because  the Minister had ignored our party&rsquo;s request for changes.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In moving the motion, the Member for South Down Mr  McCallister said that the first Education Bill was almost finished before we  got sight of the second one, even though the Committee had been promised that  it would see the second Bill well in advance, so that members would know what  they were working on. Again, we were disappointed.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There are a number of issues with which there are problems.  Those problems have been expressed inside and outside the Committee and we want  to see progress made on them. They relate, in particular, to the controlled schools  ownership body and the controlled sector.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill, as currently worded, removes the transferors from  the ownership of the controlled schools estate, which they gifted to the  Northern Ireland Government in the 1930s and the 1950s. As part of that gift,  the TRC nominated representatives to boards of governors in primary and  secondary schools and to education and library boards. That was very much to  protect and safeguard the interest that they had in education and to reflect  that the estate was initially theirs.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">On the Catholic maintained side of education, the Catholic  Bishops will be trustees, with significant power over the schools estate. We do  not want to see an imbalance created in the schools estate system between the  Catholic maintained and the controlled sectors. We have seen no movement on  that issue from the Education Minister, and she is refusing to come back with  any amended plans.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Education</strong>: The situation is worse. During the interim  arrangements, and before the reconstitution of the education and library boards  &mdash; because there will be no such a thing as transitional boards &mdash; the Minister  has failed to appoint councillors. Therefore, the teacher appointments  committee, which is responsible for appointing staff in controlled schools,  cannot meet. In the maintained sector, the Minister has not followed her  statement of 1 December 2009 to tell the House what she is doing with the CCMS.  Then her minder, John O Dowd, who is sitting behind, talks about &ldquo;jobs for the  boys&rdquo;. That case must be explained.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>:  That point has been made continually, and it seems to be ignored by the  Minister and her party continually. The membership of the ESA board has also caused  concern. Not only do we want TRC representatives on it, as of right, but the  representation of councillors to provide that local democracy element is  important as well. The councillors who are there represent their wider  community and party strengths, which is another issue on which we have not seen  a great deal of movement.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Until we see such movement, and until the Minister  recognises that she must listen to, and act on, the concerns of the other side  of the House in order to get legislation through, there will be very little  progress on the Bill. That is how the Assembly operates. She cannot go off and  do as she wants: she needs to try to build consensus and to take action that  will win the support of this side of the House.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">1.00 pm</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I remind Members that interventions must be made through the  Chair. I will not tolerate remarks being made across the Floor.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kinahan</strong>:  When this Assembly received its mandate, nominated an Executive and set about  its work, it had three major projects that it needed to complete before its  dissolution next March: Health Service reform; local government reform; and  reform of the education system. In 2008, Minister McGimpsey succeeded in the  first of those tasks by seeing the Health and Social Care (Reform) Bill through  the House. Without the Ulster Unionist Party&rsquo;s&rsquo; involvement in the Executive,  it looks increasingly likely that they would now be on course to fail utterly  to reform anything.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Leaving aside local government and focusing on education  reform, I must say that the Executive are failing. However, unlike reform of  local government, with which the hold-up is almost totally down to the  Executive&rsquo;s general dysfunctionality, the failure to reform education is, for  the most part, down to the Minister&rsquo;s inability to compromise and to come to an  agreed solution that might pass through the House. Almost any other Member  would have done a better job of consensus building than the Minister.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kinahan</strong>:  No, I am going to carry on.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Education Bill is stuck in the Executive for the simple  reason that the Minister knows that it would be pulled apart and that she would  be forced to a consensus position with the other parties. Amendments to the  legislation may have brought the Bill to the point at which a clear majority of  Members would have been in a position to support it. However, as a result of  the Minister&rsquo;s dogmatic approach to her office, she will get nothing through.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Members on these Benches will oppose both amendments  proposed to the motion. However, there is broad agreement among the parties  that tabled them and my party, and we welcome their engagement, so we  respectfully disagree with them and hope that they will support us in the vote  on the motion.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We firmly believe that the interim arrangements undermine  the House&rsquo;s authority. The House has accepted in principle that an education  and skills authority should be established, and it is accepted practice that  the Minister can make preliminary shadow appointments once that has been done.  Minister McGimpsey did just that during the course of his reform agenda.  However, the spirit of showing such latitude to a Minister should not extend to  those shadow appointees, who are acting as if their positions have statutory  authority. They do not. The Assembly has not established an education and  skills authority. The appointments to it are in shadow form and are intended to  provide those shadow appointees with a chance to form the structures of the  planned body. They are not entitled to be told to administer existing  structures.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The interim arrangements undermine the House&rsquo;s authority  because it has not yet changed the existing structures. When it does, the  Minister should act to implement the House&rsquo;s will. Until then, she must  continue to implement the letter and spirit of existing laws. Mr Lunn said that  the measures are temporary, but how long is temporary and how long must the  whole education system wait?</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, I shall focus on the last line of our motion,  which:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;calls on the Minister of Education to urgently seek a  resolution that is acceptable to all parties in the Executive.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That means achieving consensus. All eyes are on the  Minister. The whole of Northern    Ireland wants consensus and for us to get  somewhere, and everybody is screaming for an agreed way forward. I firmly support  the motion.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Craig</strong>: I  support the motion, which mentions:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;the failure by the Minister of Education to secure  consensus on the Education Bill&rdquo;.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">However, there seems to be very little consensus on  anything to do with education.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">When I joined the Education Committee, a little over five  months ago, the lack of consensus and the lack of work on the question of  transferor representatives jumped out at me. It was astounding to see the  amount and the level of work that had been done with the bishops in the  maintained sector and the protections that were put in place for them. Yet,  there was no protection whatsoever for the representatives of the Churches that  had handed their properties and their education system over to the Government a  number of years ago. Indeed, there was a lack of consensus not only on that  issue but on the arrangements for the make-up of the board. I found it  astonishing that, only months before the Bill was to be brought before the  House, there was no agreement on the number of board members or on the members  from political parties who were to sit on the board.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Education</strong>: Will the Member add to that list, as a  third element, the confusion that reigns with the party opposite in respect of  the Catholic certificate? The Minister says that she has no resources, and the  deputy First Minister tells us that there is a review. Therefore, they cannot  agree among themselves how they will deal with that inequality, and, all of a  sudden, they are trying to bury the issue.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Craig</strong>: I  thank the Member for his intervention; it leads me to the other issue that I  wanted to talk about, which is equality. It goes to the very heart of those  reforms and the lack of consensus on them. If there is to be equality of  treatment, a lot of things need to be sorted out. We need equality of treatment  for the controlled sector, and we will get it, because the House will not allow  anything else to go forward. We also need equality of treatment across the  board in the education sector. We cannot have any sector ring-fencing and  looking after itself by requiring qualifications that nobody else is allowed to  have. That is not equal or fair, and it needs to be dealt with.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In the five months since I joined the Committee, I have  seen no efforts to reach consensus on any matter that has come forward from the  Minister. That leads to the public&rsquo;s perception that this place is not  functioning, and, unfortunately, in some cases, that perception is absolutely  correct. There seems to be no way forward on the education issue, and until the  Minister gets the idea planted in her head that there must be agreement, the  reforms will go nowhere.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I appeal to the Minister to sit down, start listening to  what other parties are saying and reach consensus on the way forward. No one  here is arguing about the need to reform education, and no one is arguing about  the fact that we need to make savings in the education system. However, we want  equality and fairness of treatment with regard to those arrangements.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I was not pleased by what the Minister&rsquo;s helper had to say  about the education boards. The education boards have done a very good job, and  they have looked after the controlled sector for the past 30 or 40 years, under  very difficult circumstances. There were Government-sponsored attempts to  undermine that sector, and they gave preferential treatment to other sectors in  education, yet the boards did the very best that they could with what little  they had, and they looked after the controlled sector remarkably well. I have  nothing but admiration for the people who worked under those conditions and  delivered for that sector. They delivered for my education, and they are  delivering for my children&rsquo;s education, and they do so under enormous strain,  some of which has been caused by the Minister who is sitting here today.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I have no difficulty in commending the motion to the House.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education (Ms Ruane)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. San am  gairid at&aacute; agam le freagairt ar an d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht, ba mhaith liom d&eacute;ile&aacute;il le  tr&iacute; shaincheist.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In the brief time that is available to me to respond to the  debate, I want to deal with three issues.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Ba mhaith liom freagairt ar chuid de na point&iacute; a rinne  Comhalta&iacute;, agus ba mhaith liom a mh&iacute;ni&uacute; c&eacute;n f&aacute;th a bhfuil leas&uacute; oideachais,  agus acht&uacute; an Bhille Oideachais go h&aacute;irithe, chomh t&aacute;bhachtach. Ba mhaith liom  a mh&iacute;ni&uacute; don Uasal McCrea, don Uasal McCallister agus d&aacute; gcomhghleacaithe c&eacute;n  f&aacute;th, in ionad a dtaca&iacute;ocht a thabhairt do thairiscint den chine&aacute;l seo, gur  ch&oacute;ir d&oacute;ibh bheith d&iacute;ocasach le tac&uacute; le mo mholta&iacute;.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I want to respond to some of the points that were made by  Members, and I want to explain why education reform, especially the enactment  of the Education Bill, is so important. Furthermore, I want to explain to Basil  McCrea, who is not in the Chamber, Mr McCallister and their colleagues why they  should be to the fore in supporting the proposals rather than supporting the  motion that is before the House. I will say a few words about what I have been  trying to do in bringing forward proposals within the context of the review of  public administration (RPA). The proposals are firmly rooted in three important  concepts.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Ba mhaith liom caighde&aacute;in a ard&uacute;. I want us all to raise  standards. It is frightening to hear complacency such as that just expressed by  Mr Craig. It worries me to hear such complacency, because far too many young  people are being failed by the education system. It is complacency such as that  shown by the Member who has just spoken, Mr Craig, that is helping to create  the conditions in which it is OK, or people think that it is OK, for children  from working-class communities to be failed. Nothing could be further from the  truth. We have to move away from that argument of complacency and understand  that if we are to change things, we need to get off the fence and bring about  the changes that are so badly needed. We must do that rather than try to  justify inaction on such issues as school improvement.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">On reaching school-leaving age, half our children secure  neither the qualifications that are necessary to continue in education nor  those that are sought by most employers. Some 52% do not achieve five GCSEs at  grade C or above, if we include the necessary qualifi&shy;cations in mathematics  and English. That is unacceptable. Therefore, there should be no complacency.  Such a situation exists, despite the best efforts of the teachers and classroom  assistants who battle against the disadvantage that the system places against  them. They have to battle because the parties opposite refuse to engage on the  real issues about our selective system that discriminates against our children,  the systemic failure and institutions that are more interested in their  reputations than the children whom they are supposed to serve.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Schools that have the highest percentage of children from  socially and economically disadvantaged backgrounds and the majority of  children with special needs are doing the best that they can under difficult  circumstances. Some of our secondary schools are among our highest-performing  schools, but others are facing serious difficulties. Action has to be taken to  ensure that children are not failed in our system.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I cannot justify spending billions of pounds every year on  a system that fails half the children whom it is designed to serve. We need to  close the attainment gap between those schools that serve some of our children  well, in some cases very well, and which leave others to the vagaries of an  outmoded model of child supervision, free child-minding and underachievement.  In some post-primary schools, less than 15% of pupils achieve basic  school-leaver qualifications. In similar schools that have the same profile of  pupil intake, management type and social environment, the figures are two or  three times better. Even those figures are not good enough. Why must we settle  for a school lottery that means that children in some parts of the North of  Ireland have to settle for a one in six, or less, chance of securing an  education that will offer them realistic life chances?</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Those are not small matters. Research shows that children  who do not succeed in school are more likely to suffer from poor health and  lower life expectancy, be more economically inactive and may be more likely to  be caught up in the criminal justice system. In short, if we do not improve our  schools, we condemn our children to poor outcomes, poverty and second-class  citizenship.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">1.15 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Ineffective education services for the individual means  ineffective outcomes for the individual, the economy and society. Those who  seek to maintain the status quo seek to maintain a system that fails. Please do  not continue to seek to maintain the status quo.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I want to generate greater efficiencies in the way in which  we use the resources that are available to us. I do not need to tell Members  how difficult the financial environment is. As a consequence of the  implementation of the RPA reforms, &pound;8 million in efficiency savings were to be  realised in the current year, &pound;30 million next year, and &pound;20 million every year  thereafter. Under a unitary system of delivering education, RPA would almost  halve the number of senior managers in the education sector, which would mean  more money for front line services. I want to see less management and improved  educational outcomes.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Members will recall, however, that the education budget was  reduced in the expectation that those savings from reforms would be realised  with the establishment of the ESA. The delay in setting up the ESA has,  therefore, a direct impact on education services, and those who continue to  delay and block the ESA have questions to answer. I will not allow the  convergence process to be blocked, and that is why I brought forward proposals.  I am not prepared for another generation of children to be treated in the way  in which previous generations were treated.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Education</strong>: Will the Member give way?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: The Executive&rsquo;s recent decisions to reduce budgets for 2010-11  adds to the significant pressures facing education next year. We must protect  the classroom and front line services. Those who proposed the motion, and those  who support them, need to decide whether they want managers or teachers. The  new authority will change the way in which services are managed and delivered  to realise further efficiencies in the way in which services are delivered.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Savings can be achieved by establishing common services in  financial management, personnel, catering, transport, the management of the  schools estate and many other areas. Those changes will offer improvements in  what we do, and savings from reduced bureaucracy can be redirected to support  pupils where they need it most: in the classroom. That is the approach that I  support.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Mh&iacute;nigh an R&aacute;iteas a thug m&eacute; don Tion&oacute;l ar an gc&eacute;ad l&aacute; de  mh&iacute; na Nollag c&eacute;n f&aacute;th nach mbeadh s&eacute; ind&eacute;anta sprioc-dh&aacute;ta an Tion&oacute;il chun an  t-&uacute;daras nua um oideachas agus scileanna a bhun&uacute; roimh an gc&eacute;ad l&aacute; de mh&iacute;  Ean&aacute;ir na bliana seo. Chuir m&eacute; in i&uacute;l daoibh an r&uacute;n at&aacute; agam le socruithe  idirthr&eacute;imhseacha a thabhairt isteach.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">My statement to the House on 1 December 2009 explained why  it would not be possible to achieve the Executive&rsquo;s deadline of establishing  the new education and skills authority (ESA) by 1 January this year. I  announced my intention to bring in transitional arrangements. The motion  criticises those arrangements. However, those who tabled the motion and those  who support them do not offer a workable alternative and ignore the difficult  financial situation faced by public services here, as confirmed in the recent  statement by the Minister of Finance and Personnel.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Executive determined that there must be more  streamlined administration in education. Transitional arrangements are being  established to allow that administration to operate, to perform its mandatory  functions, and to address the very challenging financial context until some  Members in the House catch up with the reality that change is necessary, change  is happening and change will continue to happen. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As part of those transitional arrangements, I had asked the  Chairperson &mdash; the Cathaoirleach &mdash; and the chief executive designate, to produce  a convergence delivery plan to bring a much stronger focus on those convergence  activities, which should be taken forward before the ESA is established. I have  received a plan that provides the basis for moving forward and it has been sent  to the Committee. My officials are engaged in briefings with the education  organisations on the convergence process and how it will be moved forward.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">My colleague John O&rsquo;Dowd dealt with the sweeping statements  that Members on the opposite Benches made to justify their attempts to maintain  the status quo and to accept the complacency of current arrangements.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Education</strong>: Will the Member give way?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: Therefore, we must keep on the path of the convergence  activities across &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. The Minister should resume her seat.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I remind the House that whenever it is obvious that another  Member does not wish to give way, Members should not persist in trying to make  interventions. I also remind the House that courtesy, good temper and  moderation must be shown at all times.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister should continue.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. John O&rsquo;Dowd  mentioned the sweeping statements that Members on the opposite Benches made. I  agree with him. The Members on the opposite Benches feel that those statements  protect them and that the public do not know what is happening. However, I  visit schools in every sector, and I am aware that the public know exactly what  is happening. They also know who is attempting to block change and what parties  are failing working-class children in Protestant, Catholic and ethnic minority  communities. The Members on the opposite Benches can continue to put their  heads in the sand, but Sinn F&eacute;in will not do that, and I, as the Minister of  Education, will not allow that to happen.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Education</strong>: What about equality?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: The Member mentioned equality. Equality for all our children is  the way forward; we cannot continue with a system in which inequality is the  cornerstone. There is a new cornerstone now, and that is comhionnanas,  comhionnanas agus comhionnanas &mdash; &ldquo;comhionnanas&rdquo; is the Irish word for  &ldquo;equality&rdquo;.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Education Bill was introduced with the agreement of the  Executive, and the Assembly voted overwhelmingly to agree its Second Stage. Mr  Basil McCrea&rsquo;s party voted against the Bill at that Stage, but to date it has  offered no alternatives, no new policies and no new ideas. However, all the  other parties supported the need for change, and by a 6:1 ratio, Members voted  for the principles that are enshrined in the Bill. Is that not agreement and  consensus?</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Either way, I have asked the Executive to consider all the  proposed amendments that the Committee for Education, other Members and I have  suggested. I agree that we must agree on how to move forward, and I look forward  to discussing that at the Executive. However, I will not wait for Members on  the opposite Benches to stop trying to block change. We must work for our  children.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The mindset of the proposers of the motion is that we face  dissension rather than agreement and that we face wrangling and political point  scoring rather than serious debate about how best to serve our young people.  Today in the Chamber, and over the past few weeks and months, we have heard  much about justice. This is a debate about justice. It is also a debate about  health, the economy, equality, the future and the political process that can  make the future better. If education improves, health improves. If education  improves, the economy grows. The Executive will get credit for that, and we can  stop failing our children. Every policy that I bring forward is interconnected,  and although people believe that change is not taking place in education,  massive change is happening every day. As the Minister of Education, I have  brought forward, and I will continue to bring forward, a series of radical  reforms that are aimed at the education system and a series of interconnected  policies that put the child at the centre.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Whenever the parties on the opposite Benches speak of what  they protect, they protect narrow interests and those who can articulate their  own wants. They protect those who have built and managed a system that  perpetuates failure. I will not accept that. I am Minister of Education for all  children, not just for some. I also speak for the disadvantaged, the vulnerable  and those who have been condemned to poverty, poor health and further injustice  in the past.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">At all times, the Department has engaged with the  Committee, and we have kept it informed. We will continue to do so as the  interim arrangements are developed. The Department is working to ensure that  all sectors have equality, and it is working very closely with the transferors  to deal with their genuine concerns. However, the parties on the opposite  Benches must not hijack genuine concerns for the sake of political expediency.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Minister should bring her remarks to a close.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: Equality is at the core of everything that the Department will  do.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>:  I support amendment No 2. I have no intention of reiterating everything that my  colleague Dominic Bradley said regarding the problems our party has with the  Education Bill and its content, but it is important that the Minister finally  gets the message that there are problems that she must address soon. It is not  acceptable for a Minister to stand in the House to respond to a motion and deem  that she has heard the usual rant from any Member. If we are ranting, it is  clear that there is a problem.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is difficult for Members to understand the Minister&rsquo;s intentions  exactly. That being the case, how can the public be expected to understand? It  is frustrating when constituents ask us for guidance and assistance and we  explain to them that we, as Committee members, are as much in the dark as them.  How stupid does the entire system look when young qualified teachers ask us  whether they can apply for jobs in schools where they know there are vacancies?  Such appointments cannot be made until the governing bodies of those schools  are properly constituted by appointing public representatives to the boards.  However, one local newspaper reported that the non-creation of the ESA is a  disaster, and that, furthermore, the Department is continually producing layer  upon layer of administration, which clearly illustrates all the negatives that  the Minister has told us she wanted to eradicate.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Puzzling arrangements have been put in place to steer  boards through these troubled waters, and it is looking more and more likely  that those arrangements will not be as short-lived as the Minister hopes. Our  P7 children who chose to sit one or more of the transfer tests are anxiously  awaiting the results. We are in limbo, and it almost feels as if we too in the  House are awaiting the outcome of a testing time, although we are much more  able to deal with the stress and strain of that. However, if we do not find a  common pathway through the Education Bill maze, we will still be lost this time  next year.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The points made here today express the concerns of the  representatives of the temporary boards, the statutory teaching appointments  committees and the representation of the transferors. They also express the  need for partnership to resolve the outstanding issues regarding the progress  of the Bill. Progress needs to be made; there is no doubt about that. As my  colleague said, we heard a lot about partnership in the past week. Partnership should  not end at the door of Hillsborough   Castle; it must be  brought to the heart of government, particularly to deal with the issues  surrounding a Bill such as this.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I urge the Minister to listen to the genuine concerns of  all Members that have been expressed today. Our children are at the heart of  the issue. I am not talking about any one set of children, but about all of the  children of Northern Ireland.  It is very important that everyone knows that our ambition is to deal with all  of the children and not with one particular group.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We have not come to the House to engage in a rant, which  the Minister claims to have heard from Members. I am not ranting about the  issue; I am saying what other Members are thinking. It is time that the  Minister listened and made the changes. She should bring the Bill before the  House for Members to deal with all of the issues, so that the children can have  what people in any free country should have: the freedom of choice; the freedom  of speech; and the freedom to disagree with the Minister.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lunn</strong>: I  do not want to repeat everything that I have said; unusually, I have to make a  winding-up speech on the amendment that I introduced. That amendment calls on  the Minister of Education and the Executive to agree urgently an acceptable  resolution to allow the Bill to proceed. That is not really any different from  the motion, which is the point I would like to emphasise, because it will be  some time before the Bill comes to the House. Alastair Ross seemed to indicate  that he wanted the Minister to make the Bill acceptable to the unionist  population before bringing it to the House. However, then it would not be  totally acceptable to the other side of the House.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">1.30 pm</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Education</strong>: Why would that not be acceptable to the  entire House? I get weary of the Minister for a number of reasons, including  the number of times that she has told us about equality. The problem is that  she cannot deliver equality &mdash; or she can but is not prepared to. It is her  version of equality. On three issues &mdash; the controlled sector, the ESA board and  the Catholic certificate &mdash; she has failed miserably to prove that she can  deliver equality. Everything else that she says is hot air.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lunn</strong>:  Yes, hot air indeed.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Education</strong>: Does the Member not want equality?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lunn</strong>: I  am all for equality. I shall continue, because there was too much in the  Member&rsquo;s contribution for me to comment on.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">My problem is that sometimes I agree with one side of the  House and sometimes with the other side. I am not alone in that. For instance,  Jonathan Craig talked about the rights of the transferors and the need for the  ESA board to be completely representative. The Minister has, to some extent,  given way on the board issue, and she has said that she is working on the  transferors problem. I completely agree with the unionist side on that, but the  Minister is right to talk about raising standards. The point always comes up  that the Protestant working class underachieves, and that is partly a result of  the existing structures and processes that provide education. It is  disingenuous for unionist politicians to appear to make the case that they want  things to stay as they are when they are not working correctly.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Danny Kinahan said that the Minister of Health had been  successful in reforming the Health Service. I am not sure that I totally agree  with that. We do not get the minutes of Executive meetings, so I wonder what  attitude the Health Minister has taken at the Executive to the efforts to  progress the Education Bill.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  Mr Kinahan may not be aware that the RPA on health was so successful because  Sinn F&eacute;in approached the issue sensibly, did not play party politics and  ensured that the Bill went through. If the Ulster Unionist Party were to take  the same approach to the RPA on education, it would find that the journey was  far smoother.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Education</strong>: You are playing party politics.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order, please. I have tried to keep the debate good-natured, but  it has got to the stage where I will have to apply the rules of the House to  any Member who persists in shouting across the Table. I also suggest that, when  referring to the Minister, Members say &ldquo;Minister&rdquo;, rather than &ldquo;she&rdquo;.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lunn</strong>:  Perhaps I will get five extra minutes now, Mr Deputy Speaker.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Dominic Bradley summed it up well. He called for engagement  and said that the public were completely fed up. The public are completely fed  up with this place, rather than being fed up specifically with the wrangling  over the ESA. In fact, I doubt that half of the public know what ESA stands  for. However, it is a major issue for us, and, sooner or later, it must come to  the Floor of the House. The Minister and the parties that disagree with her  should have the courage of their convictions and allow it to be debated in the  Chamber.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Most of the 100 amendments came from the Committee for  Education, and they did not follow party lines absolutely. There were areas of  crossover, and it was not, nor should it have been, a straightforward unionist/nationalist  confrontation. It is far too important for that. I urge the Minister and her  Executive colleagues to allow the Bill to proceed. That is the thrust of the  motion and the one issue on which all Members agree. It is time to move on and  discuss the Bill here in a parliamentary way.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  In light of your remarks, Mr Deputy Speaker, I shall try to conduct my speech  in a good-natured manner.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As my colleague Mr Kinahan and I have consistently repeated,  we have not been opposed to the establishment of an ESA or to the streamlining  of the structures of education administration. No one is opposed to that. We  all think that we can do better. There is money to be saved, and we want to  realise those savings. What we did not want to see was a super-quango taking  over everything. The ESA has, effectively, taken on a life of its own. That is  what we have opposed in the Bill.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As Mr Lunn mentioned, when the Bill was in Committee and it  came to a vote, there was crossover and support from various parties on  different issues. It was not a simple orange/green divide. Everyone in the  House believes that we should and must address educational underachievement.  The debate is about where that educational underachievement is occurring, its  causes and how we address it. The views of the Minister and her party that some  of that underachievement can be addressed through blunt instruments, such as  using free school meals as a sole measure, differ from those of others.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I will follow up on some of the comments made by Members. I  think that all Members agreed that education is in a mess.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  No.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  Sorry, I beg your pardon, Mr Deputy Speaker.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. Is it important that Members reflect  accurately the mood of the House and contributions from other Members?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I am sure that Mr McCallister will bear that in mind.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I am grateful to the Member for that point of order. I was about to say, &ldquo;All  Members on these Benches but not Sinn F&eacute;in&rdquo;. As others mentioned, Mr O&rsquo;Dowd was  here mainly in his role as the Minister&rsquo;s minder or helper &mdash; I think that that  was the phrase used.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. As I am sure you are aware, Mr O&rsquo;Dowd  is here as an elected Member of the House. Would it be useful for Members who  are contributing to the debate to be aware of that?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I am sure that the Member is aware of that.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I had no idea that Mr O&rsquo;Dowd was so sensitive. I recognise that he is an  elected Member and congratulate him on his election.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In moving amendment No 1, Mr Lunn discussed many things:  the controlled sector; the maintained sector; Irish language; and some of the  failures that we have had and some of the delays, which I spoke about, in  bringing the second Bill to the Committee. It was initially to come to the Committee  in June and was delayed to the end of September. In his winding-up speech, Mr  Lunn also mentioned the crossover in party support on the various issues, which  I thought was a useful point.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Bradley talked about the uncertainty and the fact that  we needed to bring certainty. That is the crux of the debate: we have to bring  certainty to our education system. There are big concerns about the interim  boards and how those link in, about whether any regard has been given to the  population of council areas, and about teacher appointments. Mr Bradley  mentioned the &pound;20 million of savings, which, the Minister admitted, will be  difficult to achieve. Mr Bradley spoke about the special educational needs  (SEN) review, the strategy for children aged nought-to-six and other policies.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Storey spoke initially as Chairperson of the Committee  for Education and gave some of the background to the scrutiny of the Education  Bill. The three main principles that the Committee sought were clarity,  certainty and confidence, and it considered its role in trying to achieve  those. He then spoke, as a Member, of the delay in finding out how the  structures in the interim arrangements will work.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr O&rsquo;Dowd complimented me and said that I had made a great  speech. I thank him; I am most grateful to him for his kind remarks. If he  wants to intervene, he could tell me that again. He challenged parties to make proposals.  However, on the transfer issue, all the parties, except his own, are involved  in trying to make proposals to resolve the transfer issue.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  It is rather the case that all the other parties have asked someone else to  bring forward transfer proposals for them. They have none of their own.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  Even the Member will admit that it is good to see someone working to bring  forward proposals. There is agreement from four of the main parties to try to  find a solution to the transfer problems. Mr O&rsquo;Dowd might ask himself what he  has been doing to address the impasse in education.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lunn</strong>: We  in the unofficial group of which Mr O&rsquo;Dowd so disapproves have set up another  body to give us expert advice. Perhaps you could learn something from that. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. The Member will resume his seat. No sooner have I settled  Members on one side than the other side starts up. I remind all Members that  the rules on speaking through the Chair apply equally. I will have equality all  round.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I am grateful to Mr Lunn for his intervention.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr O&rsquo;Dowd spoke of &ldquo;jobs for the boys&rdquo; in respect of councillor  representation on education and library boards.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Ross spoke of the failure to find consensus. Legislators  around the world make proposals to work with the executive branch of government  to find consensus. The Minister&rsquo;s colleague, the Minister of Agriculture and  Rural Development, had to change her proposals and accept amendments to her  Diseases of Animals Bill. Similarly, the Minister of Health, Social Services  and Public Safety had also to adopt changes to his legislative proposals. That  is how the democratic legislative process works.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Education</strong>: Is it not ironic that the Minister tells  the House that we are playing politics when speaking about the transferors?  Does the Member agree that, just after Christmas, the party opposite put a  proposal to the transferors and that that proposal was rejected? The party  opposite has been unable to get consensus from an organisation that represents  95% of Protestant children in Northern    Ireland.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I am grateful to the Chairperson for that important point. I am willing to give  way to the Minister if she will tell us how she will move that issue forward. I  do not see any movement from her.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I will touch on some of the Minister&rsquo;s points. She spoke of  raising standards, the financial arrangements and why the ESA was to be  established by 1 January 2010. There is no dispute about raising standards in  education; every Member is committed to it. She spoke at length about the  importance of good education for health, the economy and life expectancy. I  know, from serving on the Health Committee, that those are crucial. The  Minister spoke of interlinked policies. However, if a major policy link or  several major links in the policy do not work, all will end in failure. The  special needs review, the transfer process and the nought-to-six strategy were  mentioned. The Minister said that there are serious problems in the classroom  and that we need to protect our children; some might say that we need to  protect them from the Minister.</p>

      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Business Committee has agreed to allow up to one hour and 30  minutes for the debate. The proposer of the motion will have 10 minutes in  which to propose and 10 minutes in which to make a winding-up speech. All other  Members who are called to speak will have five minutes.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  I beg to move</p>
      <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly calls on the Minister of Finance and  Personnel to instruct the performance and efficiency delivery unit to assist  the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety by investigating  potential non-front line savings within the DHSSPS remit and producing initial  recommendations within three months.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It would be fair to characterise some debates on health in  the Chamber, particularly those that deal with the Department&rsquo;s budget, as  perhaps not being the most convivial or cordial. Indeed, some Members may  suggest that they have, at times, not been the most constructive of debates.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel (Mr S Wilson)</strong>: Puerile.</p>
      <p class="B3SpeakerinChair">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr Molloy] in the Chair)</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  The Minister of Finance and Personnel suggests that those debates have been  puerile, and they have been childish at times. I am not saying that I will not  be distracted by other Members&rsquo; comments during the debate, but I brought the  motion to the House because I want to achieve a common goal on health expenditure.  I will start off on that basis and I hope to finish in the same way. I hope  that the debate continues in the same vein.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We must all recognise the constraints that are placed on  public expenditure at all times, particularly as we move forward in Northern Ireland.  We must also recognise that there is a deep concern across the community about  the effect of efficiencies and constraints on our Budget in future. We all  recognise that there is a particular concern about healthcare, even when trusts  sometimes make sensible savings suggestions. There is an understandably emotive  response to such suggestions, because of the way in which health services  affect us, our loved ones and those vulnerable people in society about whom we  care.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As we face and recognise those facts, there have been, to  borrow the words of the Minister of Finance and Personnel, puerile calls simply  for more and more resources. That will not suffice, particularly in such  economic times.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We need to have a debate about how to move on and achieve  more with the resources that we have, rather than simply looking for more, and  going to a well that is getting drier all the time. Now is a good time to start  that debate, particularly when there are indications of models of best practice  in health expenditure elsewhere in the United Kingdom. We do not have to  look too far to see such models. I refer, of course, to the recent report by  the Nuffield Trust, a well respected organisation, into health differences  since devolution across all four constituent parts of the United Kingdom.  That report underscores the need to focus full square on driving further  efficiency into the NHS in Northern    Ireland.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Some of the Nuffield Trust&rsquo;s report&rsquo;s headlines clearly  show that, despite &pound;1,764 being spent on health per head of population in Northern Ireland compared with &pound;1,514 in England, the NHS in England is more productive. The  report compares a feast of spending on health in Northern   Ireland and other devolved regions with a relative famine  in England.  In spite of that, even though England  has fewer doctors, nurses and managers per head of population, the Health  Service there makes much better use of its resources. A key example in the report  states that, in 2006, no patients in England  waited more than three months for an outpatient appointment, while 61% of  patients in Northern Ireland  did. Professor Nick Mayes, who was involved in compiling the report, said:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Northern Ireland for a long time has had higher  spending, more resources, more beds, more doctors, more nurses, more GPs and  tends to have longer waiting times and lower levels of productivity as measured  by the relationship between the number of staff and what we measure in terms of  the services delivered.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">That is a good synopsis of that report. However, it is not  just that report. That report in isolation would be one thing, but there are  other examples. The Nuffield Trust report echoes what the Appleby review said  about staff productivity in Northern Ireland being 17&middot;4% lower than that in  England in 2006-07. There is also the work of the productivity working group.  That begs the question that if everyone &mdash; Appleby, Nuffield and others &mdash; says  that there is less productivity in the NHS in Northern Ireland, they cannot all  be wrong, and there must be serious validity to the points that they raise.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I read recently in the &lsquo;The Economist&rsquo; about the  &ldquo;love-bombing&rdquo; of cash on the Health Service, not just here in Northern Ireland but across the United Kingdom  post-1999. It is clear that Northern    Ireland has not made the most of that.  However, that is entirely understandable. If a body is being lavished with  cash, maybe efficiency is not foremost in its mind, and it will spend the cash  to do just what it can, without thinking about driving efficiency or best  practice. That is understandable, given the severe increase in expenditure  post-1999, particularly with a Labour Government coming into power. However,  those days are gone. Things have to change, and we have to have efficiency and  productivity in the forefront of our minds.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Devolution is about making a difference, and the Health  Minister has tried positively to make differences, particularly with the likes  of free prescriptions. That is one difference that we have compared, maybe,  with other regions, particularly England. However, a severe  difference in the productivity of our Health Service is not a difference that  we want to sustain throughout devolution.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Work is needed in three broad areas. The first is better  performance management. Every argument put forward by the Nuffield Trust&rsquo;s  report talks about instilling better performance management in the health  services in regions such as ours. The argument in the report is that because England faced  expenditure constraint over the past decade, it had to have much better  performance management or the system would have collapsed. The report states  that that standard of performance management is not in place in Northern Ireland  and needs to be put in place.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">That is where, as stated in the motion, the performance efficiency  delivery unit (PEDU) could play a key role in moving the Department of Health,  Social Services and Public Safety (DHSSPS) towards better performance management,  in a not dissimilar way to the way in which the Prime Minister&rsquo;s delivery unit  (PMDU) in Westminster operates. I do not think it a coincidence that the PMDU  worked at that sort of problem in the middle of the past decade, and that there  was better performance management, delivery and productivity in the NHS in England.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">If the Department of Health in Northern Ireland is too  close to the issue to see where efficiencies can be made, then it is a good  idea to invite or instruct someone, such as PEDU, to do that job on its behalf;  someone who comes from a different perspective and who will not be shackled by  the inertia that is sometimes present in our Departments.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Savings could be made, or things could be done better, in  other areas, such as tackling wasteful administration and bureaucracy. I  acknowledge that reducing the number of boards and trusts in Northern Ireland,  as instigated by the current Minister, will reduce administration in the long  term. However, I must express my concern that evidence has been presented to  the Health Committee suggesting that the new trusts saw management costs rise  by 13% in their first year of operation. That is not what we expected or what  we were promised, and it had better not continue in the future. If  reorganisation under RPA is to mean anything, it is that savings are made. That  promise has not happened. On top of that, between 1998 and 2007, there was a  96% increase in managers and an 85% increase in senior managers. I have heard  that there are 57 PR managers being employed across the various trusts. It is  clear that savings could be made.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">However, that is not enough. How things are done needs to  change too. Even though we admire the dedication of our health professionals, I  am sure that all Members have an example, from personal experience or from that  of their loved ones, of waste and inefficiency, and of how things could be done  better in the Health Service. That is needed more than cutting out wasteful  administration and bureaucracy. Yes, the latter is the first step, but things  need to be done differently and in a more productive way. That is the lesson  from the Nuffield Trust report.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Will the Member draw his remarks to a close?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  If the NHS in Northern    Ireland is as efficient as the Health  Minister tells us, then what has he got to fear from inviting PEDU to look at  the scope for further efficiencies? If PEDU finds his argument to be right,  surely that would bolster his position and give him a better argument with  which to face the Finance Minister?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  I urge the House to consider the motion carefully and give it backing in the  common cause that we all have, which is to have a more efficient and effective  Health Service in Northern Ireland.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McLaughlin</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">My party recognises and accepts that the Executive must  respond to the straitened economic circumstances. The relatively benign  economic conditions that pertained at the time we negotiated and agreed the  Programme for Government have changed dramatically for the worse. It is  absolutely incumbent on the Executive and respective Ministers to be seen to  respond to that, and to be alive to that challenge.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We are equally clear that efficiencies are a pre-requisite  response among a range of options that the Executive must consider. Sinn F&eacute;in  is adamant that front line services must not be detrimentally affected in any  way. A reduction in front line services cannot be described as efficiency; it  can only be accurately described as a cut. That is a defining issue for Sinn F&eacute;in.  My party believes that we can identify further efficiencies.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: Do  not tell me that that is on the agenda as well.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McLaughlin</strong>:  I am glad that you picked up on that point.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">My party believes that additional savings can be  identified. I will not pick on a particular Department because that will  exclude the political affiliation of that individual Minister, but, spending  Departments are responsible for dispersing significant sums, and it is clear  that additional savings can be achieved. We have not come to the end of that  process by any means.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">2.15 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I take on board the points made by the proposer of the  motion about the independent studies that indicate that there are significant  savings to be made. Indeed, in respect of the Health Department, that point can  hardly be denied. However, I take issue with the motion in that we should take  a broader scope and operate on a broader palette. There is a danger that the  motion will be seen as partisan or even, God forbid, part of an internal  unionist pre-election squabble.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: I  am surprised that the Member has missed the convergence of unionist unity on  this issue; I await Mr McNarry&rsquo;s speech on the matter. The motion has sincere  motivations, and, indeed, the proposer tried to word the motion in such a way  that it would not be regarded as having a go at the Health Minister.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member will have an extra minute added to his speaking time.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McLaughlin</strong>:  I really look forward to seeing this unionist convergence in due course.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I support the concept of PEDU. It is a good initiative that  was brought forward by the then Finance Minister, and it has already  demonstrated its value. To better recognise the collective responsibility of  the Executive, it would be better if PEDU examined potential for savings on the  basis of invitations from respective Ministers. I am convinced that there are  possibilities for savings without the collateral effect of a reduction in  service quality.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The key definition of genuine efficiencies is to spend less  money for the same outputs. PEDU has a role to play, but it should not in any  way impinge on Ministers&rsquo; rights to address their respective responsibilities under  the Programme for Government and the supporting public service agreements.  Further conflict, confusion and controversy within the Executive team of  Ministers could be created inadvertently if the Finance Minister directs PEDU  to come in.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">A much better and more collaborative approach would be for  PEDU to come in and play a role when there is acceptance that we can do no  other than cut our sails to suit our cloth. Each Minister should see the role  of PEDU as a resource rather than a threat, and each Minister should have the  right to invite PEDU to come in and offer advice, expertise and assistance. On  that basis, my party cannot support the motion.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  Confrontational motions of this type are, at best, unhelpful. The motion  implies widespread and serious maladministration in the Health Department,  which, according to the Minister, is quite simply not true. The motion runs  counter to the attainment of a new spirit of co-operation in this place, which  we are all trying to advance. It can only be deeply damaging to that spirit of  co-operation.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Members will judge the intention behind the motion for  themselves and recognise, as I have, that it does not mention any other  Departments. Are the Members who proposed the motion not concerned about  potential non-front line savings in the Department of Education, which is  having serious difficulties with its budget? Are they not concerned about the  Department for Regional, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment,  the Department for Social Development or the Department for Agriculture and Rural  Development?</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">When announcing the formation of PEDU on 15 April 2008, the  then Finance Minister Peter Robinson stated:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The core approach of PEDU will be collaborative in  nature, working with Departments and, through them, with the wider public  sector to get the best public-service outcomes for our community.&rdquo; &mdash;<span class="Italic"><span style="font-style:normal; "> [Official Report, Bound Volume 29, p247, col 1].</span></span></p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">He went on to say:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;I envisage that from this moment on, PEDU will fade  into the background in a public sense. Its role is to collaborate with Departments.  It is not there to say &lsquo;PEDU has arrived&rsquo;. PEDU is not the story.&rdquo; &mdash; <span class="Italic"><span style="font-style:normal; ">[Official  Report, Bound Volume 29, p249, col 1]</span></span>.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Is the Members&rsquo; motion reflective of the words of  their party leader?</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">If we are to build a more collaborative, co-ordinated and effective  Executive, surely we must stop unnecessarily throwing stones at each other. The  proposers seem keen to pursue the subject of assistance, so how about a focus  from the Finance Minister on the rate arrears that are accumulating in his  Department? What is the actual figure of arrears? Apparently, it lies somewhere  between &pound;124 million and &pound;137 million. What is the written-off figure for  uncollected rates? What impact is the shortfall against targets having on the  Executive right now? What will it be in future years?</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The constant carping criticism of the Health Department by  certain Members of this House is deeply damaging to the morale of my  hard-working, hard-pressed constituents who work in the Health Service. The  people who framed this motion made reference to making savings other than in  front line services, but that smart dressing up is a calculated insult to  health workers, and the Members concerned should be ashamed of themselves. To  make such a distinction totally misses the point that the service as a whole  depends on the front line and support services to operate effectively. It is a  Health Department that operates in a population of 1&middot;7 million and cannot,  therefore, access the kind of savings that can be achieved across a much larger  mainland population of 60 million. Economies of scale that operate across such  a large population are simply not possible in a restricted area the size of  Northern Ireland, yet people expect, and have a right to expect, the same level  of service.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">This motion takes no account of the considerable  efficiencies that are already achieved in the Health Service here. Trusts in Northern Ireland have, for example, met their  break-even duty far more consistently than their counterparts in England. Those  are not my words; they are the words of a report of the Northern Ireland Audit  Office. Those break-even duties are achieved despite the fact that our trusts  have a far more rigorous regime in place. It focuses them to break even every  year, whereas those in England  only have to break even, on average, over a three-year period.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Back in September last year, the Health Minister, in  response to a question from Patsy McGlone MLA, revealed that the cost of the  reform of public adminis&shy;tration to health was some &pound;73 million, which was  mostly in voluntary redundancy payouts, but that it would generate some &pound;53  million of recurrent annual savings. It is working and it can be done.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I remind the House that health savings and efficiencies have  been effected against a background of a rising demand for services. I oppose  this unwarranted motion today, and I recommend strongly that the House do  likewise.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  The SDLP is opposed to this motion, particularly in relation to the implication  that PEDU will be imposed upon the Department of Health. We have not yet seen a  great deal from PEDU, but its role should be to advise and assist all  Departments.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Finance Minister has made it clear that, because of the  economic crisis, budgetary cuts have become inevitable. We have already had an  announcement from the Minister about some of them. It is vital that we, as  elected representatives, make sure that those cuts do not impact negatively on  front line services and ordinary people. We have to make sure that it is not  the weak and the vulnerable who are first to suffer here, which is often the  case when cuts are imposed by central government. Ordinary people must not bear  the brunt of any cuts.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We accept that the Department of Health, Social Services  and Public Safety should not be immune from cuts, particularly given that it  receives around 42% or 44% of the overall Budget. However, because of the  essential nature of the Health Service, and given the demands made upon it, we  must do everything possible to protect its front line services. We urge the  Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety to do more to close the  14% efficiency gap between our Health Service and the Health Service in England. The  excessive bureaucracy that remains in some parts of our Health Service must be  targeted.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  I want to make the point that we are not comparing like with like. One key  difference, for example, is that social services in England are delivered by the local  authorities, not the Health Service. Mr Hamilton made no reference to that.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  My colleague has raised a good point, and she is correct to say that Mr  Hamilton did not highlight that important difference.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  I am not giving way again. I want to go back to the issue of a three-year  Budget. The SDLP was the only party in the Assembly to oppose and vote against  the Budget. We did so because we felt that it was not in the best interest of  service delivery to lock the Assembly, or any of its individual Departments,  into a three-year spending straitjacket. As we have seen, various situations  can arise during that locked-in period.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">A one-year run of the Budget would be a much better and  more realistic way of addressing such difficulties when they arise. The recent  cold weather, for example, increased the pressure on accident and emergency  services, particularly on the departments that deal with fractures. That caused  extra, unnecessary pressure.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Looking to the future, it is clear that public services  face more cuts, particularly if there is a Conservative Government in London. We should put any  pressure that we can on the Westminster Government to examine their own  spending priorities before they begin to wield the axe on our Departments.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In my constituency, for example, there are 11,000 elderly  people, 2,500 of whom receive care. The level of that care can only be  described as threadbare. The number of referrals grows week by week &mdash; in the  past couple of weeks, it increased at the rate of 100 a week. However, the  budget has not increased. The level of front line service for those people is  not what it ought to be, and it should be increased. However, giving PEDU a  role in the Health Service is not the way forward.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: As Question Time will commence at 2.30 pm, I suggest that the  House take its ease until that time. The debate will resume following Question  Time, when Mr McCarthy will be called to speak.</p>

      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Further to the Speaker&rsquo;s announcement at the start of today&rsquo;s  business, I remind Members that the Business Committee will tomorrow reschedule  for next week the questions that were due to be answered by the Office of the  First Minister and deputy First Minister. Today&rsquo;s questions to the Minister of  the Environment have been brought forward.</p>
      <p class="H3SectionHeading">Environment</p>
      <p class="H4StageHeading">Belfast  Metropolitan Area Plan</p>
      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">1. <strong>Mr B Wilson </strong>asked the Minister of the Environment if he  will take action to expedite the adoption of the Belfast metropolitan area plan.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 678/10<a name="AQO678/10" id="AQO678/10"></a>)</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment (Mr Poots)</strong>: The public inquiry into the Belfast metropolitan area plan (BMAP)  concluded in May 2008, and prior to completing its report and making  recommendations to the Department, the Planning Appeals Commission (PAC) is  considering all the information arising from the inquiry. PAC has indicated  that there is a preliminary timescale for delivering the report to the Planning  Service as early as summer 2010. Upon receipt of the report, the Planning  Service will consider PAC&rsquo;s recommendations and a plan will be prepared for  adoption. The adoption date will depend on when the PAC report is received, but  it is unlikely to be adopted before 2011. However, upon receipt of the PAC  report, I will consider any available options to expedite the adoption of BMAP.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B Wilson</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his answer, although it was rather disappointing. The  North Down and Ards area plan was completed in 1995, and consultation on BMAP  started in 2001. The draft BMAP was supposed to protect villages such as  Crawfordsburn and Helen&rsquo;s Bay, which were designated as areas of village  character. However, the draft plan is not in operation, and as a result, many  architecturally important houses have been demolished and replaced by apartment  blocks. Every year, we lose more and more houses. If BMAP is not adopted soon,  there will be nothing left to protect. Therefore, before it is adopted, would  it not be possible for the Minister to introduce some measures to protect our  built heritage? In another two years, there will be nothing left.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Members should not walk or stand in front of Members who are  speaking. A number of Members have already done so, so I ask others to be  careful.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: I share Mr Wilson&rsquo;s concerns. In fact, I shared those  concerns back in 2000, when the area plan in question was first mooted by  Minister Foster, the then Minister of the Environment. In case there is any  confusion, I am referring to Minister Sam Foster. I was opposed to developing  the plan in the way in which it has been developed because I thought that there  was too much to take on in one go. Some 10 years later, here we are without an  adopted plan. I share Mr Wilson&rsquo;s concerns about the process. Unfortunately,  the matter is now with the Planning Appeals Commission, and as the Member well  knows, that is an independent quasi-judicial body.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member also wanted an independent environmental  commission to be set up. I do not want to interfere with the independence of  the Planning Appeals Commission. It has a particular role to play, and it must  do its work in the way that it has set out for itself. I cannot expedite  matters until the PAC has completed its work.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  I heard what the Minister said, and I am not blaming him for the delay in the  process. However, given that that process started in 2000, not only is it  exhaustive, but it is exhausting every stakeholder. Surely a mechanism should  exist whereby the Minister or the Department can intervene and guillotine the  process so that BMAP can be officially adopted. My understanding is that BMAP  will operate until 2015. To date, the process has taken longer than the  resulting product will be in force.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: The Member is right. Not only is the process exhaustive,  but it is detrimental to good planning. On the one hand, people who wish to  carry out developments do not have much guidance, and on the other hand, areas  that require protection are not being adequately protected. I did not design  the process; in fact, I opposed it in the House. However, I have inherited it.  I cannot move it forward any faster until it comes back to the Department.  While it rests in the PAC, I cannot move it forward any faster.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I have a word of caution: Alban Maginness comes from a  legal background, and he knows that other area plans have been judicially  challenged, so I am very cautious about using guillotines and leaving ourselves  open to judicial challenge and making lawyers rich.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  As I understand it, Knock golf course is included in the Belfast metropolitan area plan. Will the  Minister explain how its destruction can be allowed in his remit as Minister of  the Environment?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: The Member&rsquo;s question does not relate to the original question,  but since he has raised it, I will deal with it. More than 500 letters of  support were received for that planning application; there was only one letter  of objection. The Ulster   Hospital will benefit  significantly and will be able to expand, and Knock Golf Club will be able to  develop a state-of-the-art facility, which will be widely used by the public.  The planning application has been widely supported in the community, and I  would rather be in the position of Peter Robinson and others &mdash; on the side of  the 540 people who submitted letters of support for the planning application &mdash;  than in the position of the Alliance Party, which opposes it and is standing on  the side of one resident.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  No one has asked yet about the cost to the public purse. How much has BMAP cost  so far?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: From its development until March 2010, the plan will have  cost &pound;7&#903;971 million. A huge amount of money has been spent on the process so  far. Without doubt, more than &pound;8 million has now been spent on BMAP. A flawed  decision has left us without up-to-date area plans. We have spent huge amounts  of money on it, to the detriment of the public purse.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Question 2 has been withdrawn.</p>
      <p class="H5StageHeading">Rose Energy</p>
      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">3. <strong>Mr  Paisley Jnr </strong>asked the Minister of the Environment when a decision will be  made on the Rose Energy application.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO  680/10<a name="AQO680/10" id="AQO680/10"></a>)</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: The Rose Energy planning application for a biomass fuel  power plant was submitted in June 2008 and was accompanied by an environmental  statement. The application was designated article 31 in September 2008, and on  11 February 2009, Rose Energy was requested to provide an addendum to the  environmental statement. That addendum was submitted to the Planning Service on  12 June 2009. At the same time, Rose Energy submitted a new separate planning  application for the abstraction of water directly from Lough Neagh. The new  application for water abstraction was accompanied by an environmental  statement. The water abstraction application was declared article 31 on 11  August 2009 and is being processed in tandem with the power plant application.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The requirement for water to cool the incineration process  is an important element of the power plant proposal. Rose Energy initially  intended to abstract water from an aquifer below the site. However, recent survey  work revealed that it cannot provide the required volume of water. The result  of the survey was a need to find an alternative water source.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">On 28 August 2009, Rose Energy voluntarily submitted a  further addendum to the environmental statement accompanying the power plant  application. Consultations on the addendum were issued to the relevant  consultees on 1 September 2009. Neighbourhood renotification in respect of the  addendum was issued on 7 September 2009, and advertisements were placed in the  Lisburn newspapers on 9, 10 and 11 September 2009. Advertise&shy;ment of the  addendum was placed in the Antrim newspapers and in the three daily newspapers  on 7, 8 and 9 October 2009.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In accordance with environmental impact assessment regulations,  the public had four weeks from the date of the advertisement to submit  representations regarding the environmental effects of the proposals. The  four-week period ended on 6 November 2009. Planning officials are finalising  their consideration of the Rose Energy case and hope to make a recommendation  to me on the way forward shortly.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Paisley Jnr</strong>:  I thank the Minister for that detailed answer. The Minister must be aware that  more than 8,000 jobs in the poultry sector rely on an affirmative decision on  this case. In order for Northern    Ireland to comply with EU regulations, the  Minister will also be aware that we need a resolution on how to deal with  poultry waste pollution. Will the Minister assure the House that he will not  put a decision on the issue on the long finger; that he, and he alone, will  make a decision on the matter; that we will not see further delays and public  inquiries; and that we will see a ministerial decision to allow the Northern  Ireland poultry industry to get out of the problems that it faces, as soon as  is legally possible? With that in mind, will he inform the House what he is  doing, and what he has done, to ensure that he is fully au fait with all the  facts and not only with the emotions, of which we have read in the press?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: To date, I have received more than 6,500 letters of  objection and just under 6,500 letters of support. I will be pretty unpopular regardless  of what decision I make. However, that comes with the territory. A decision  will be made, and it will be based on the best knowledge and information that  is available. To help to ascertain that information, I visited the site with  senior planners and viewed it from all the critical points, including Lough  Neagh. I met those who object to the project, those who applied for it, as well  as senior advisers from my Department&rsquo;s water quality unit and the chief  scientific officer from the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development. At  each of those meetings, I sought to gain all the requisite information so that  I will be best placed to give my considered opinion to the report when it comes  to me. I will give the report a fair hearing and reading and make a decision  thereupon.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Burns</strong>:  Will the Minister explain why the Department of the Environment is entering  into the planning application when the proposed site is in a protected area of  high scenic value? Local residents would not be given permission to build a  garage, but Rose Energy seems hopeful that it will be allowed to build a giant  incinerator. Does the Minister agree that the best way forward would be  achieved through a public inquiry in which all views could be aired?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: The applicants have gone through a site-selection process.  I will not give my views on that process until I have seen the report and read  it in full. In fact, I will probably read it in full several times before I  arrive at a decision. The Member asked whether it should go to a public  inquiry, but that depends on whether all the information that is required to  make such a decision is available. The indications that I have received from  the Planning Service are that it has gone through an exhaustive process to  garner that information. I have sought to get as much information as possible  directly from those who support the application and those who oppose it, and as  much independent advice as possible as well as requisite information from  planning and science professionals to enable me to make a decision.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Armstrong</strong>:  Is the Minister aware of whether the Planning Service is considering any other  planning applications for facilities capable of processing poultry waste that  would meet the nitrates directive time frame? When will he make his decision?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: This application will not meet the nitrates directive time  frame; that is why I have had to extend it. That is an indication of the time  pressures that are applied. If there are other means of dealing with this  difficulty, they need to be brought forward, and applications will be made on  how to deal with them. The nitrates directive time frame has had to be  extended, but we will get away with that only for so long before the EU clamps  down on us. Therefore, it is important that a decision be made on the way  forward on the issue, one way or another.</p>
      <p class="H5StageHeading">High Hedges</p>
      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">4. <strong>Mrs M  Bradley </strong>asked the Minister of the Environment the cost of the previous  public consultation on high hedges legislation and the predicted cost of the  current consultation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO  681/10<a name="AQO681/10" id="AQO681/10"></a>)</p>
      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">7. <strong>Mr  Easton </strong>asked the Minister of the Environment to outline the timetable for  the introduction of the high hedges legislation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 684/10<a name="AQO684/10" id="AQO684/10"></a>)</p>
      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">14. <strong>Mr P J  Bradley </strong>asked the Minister of the Environment what action he will take to  ensure that councils with discretionary powers to levy fees in relation to the  high hedges Bill will adopt a uniform approach.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO  691/10<a name="AQO691/10" id="AQO691/10"></a>)</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: With your permission, Mr Deputy Speaker, I will answer  questions 4, 7 and 14 together.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The consultation carried out in 2005 to gauge the extent  and scope of the high hedges problem cost approximately &pound;11,000. The predicted  cost of the current consultation is likely to be in the region of &pound;2,000. As I  said in my statement to the House on 9 January 2010, public consultation on the  draft Bill closes on 1 March 2010. My aim is to introduce a Bill to the  Assembly by June 2010, with a view to having legislation in place during the  lifetime of the Assembly.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">2.45 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">With regard to a uniform approach to the levying of fees, I  have no desire to dictate to councils as to how much the fees should be, as  there may be a variance in costs from council to council depending on overheads  and operational procedures. However, I do not expect any difference in fees to be  considerable.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>:  Will the Minister assure the people who may need to use the legislation that no  costs will be applied to them?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: I cannot give Mrs Bradley that assurance. We need to  identify the costs that will be charged to local councils, and if we are saying  that local government should bear all the costs, the House must make that  decision. However, local government may not think that that is a particularly  good idea, as it may cause people to engage in vexatious complaints, as opposed  to real complaints coming forward when people have to make a contribution to  deal with the problem.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Easton</strong>:  Will the Minister assure me that hedges surrounding farmland that backs on to  private properties will be included in the Bill?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: The Bill deals with the issue of light. Therefore, the  legislation will deal with hedges that cause a problem with the light that  enters people&rsquo;s homes and property.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P J Bradley</strong>:  Does the Minister have any plans to make the public aware of their rights  following the introduction of the legislation?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: We are going through the consultation process, and the  public will respond to that consultation. When the legislation goes through the  House &mdash; as I assume it will as it has widespread support &mdash; I have no doubt that  it will receive significant public coverage. Local councils will have the task  of administering the legislation, and I have no doubt that they will make  information available on their websites, explaining how the legislation will  work and the processes to be followed when someone has an issue with a  neighbour&rsquo;s high or nuisance hedges.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brady</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Obviously, there are problems with evergreen  trees, but will the Minister be including rows of beech and ash trees in the  legislation?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: The legislation will apply to trees that are planted as  hedges as opposed to single trees. Action can be taken when people have planted  trees that have become hedges and have been allowed to become overgrown. The  legislation will not apply to single trees. It will apply to rows of trees or  high hedges.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>:  High hedges legislation has been operating successfully in England and Wales for several years. The  Minister&rsquo;s predecessor declined to introduce such legislation during his period  of office. Why does the Minister disagree with his predecessor, and why has he  decided to introduce the legislation, although I welcome the fact that he has  done so?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: Previous Ministers had other priorities. As a public  representative, I had a considerable number of complaints and dealt with a  considerable number of people who had an issue with high hedges, and I wanted  to deal with the matter. It caused the Department some difficulties as we had  to get extra resources because our legislative team was very busy. I decided to  push ahead with the legislation in spite of the fact that it would cause  additional work and be an extra burden on the Department.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Question 5 has been withdrawn, the Member is not in his place to ask  question 6, and question 7 has been answered already.</p>
      <p class="H5StageHeading">Mourne Heritage Trust</p>
      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">8. <strong>Mr W  Clarke </strong>asked the Minister of the Environment what the reduction has been in  the grant aid to the Mourne Heritage Trust from the Northern Ireland  Environment Agency.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 685/10<a name="AQO685/10" id="AQO685/10"></a>)</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: I recognise the importance of NGOs, such as the Mourne  Heritage Trust, and engagement with local communities to manage our  environment. I have sought assurances from officials in the Northern Ireland  Environment Agency (NIEA) that cuts to the natural heritage grants programme  will be minimised this year, despite the overall reduced level of funding  available to NIEA in 2010-11. That will lessen the impact on those bodies and  projects seeking the renewal of grant aid.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Mourne Heritage Trust has been offered a total of  &pound;220,000 over three years as a contribution towards its co-ordination of areas  of outstanding natural beauty (AONB) management, which represents a reduction  of 15% in the coming year as compared to the level of support offered by NIEA  this year. The trust will also receive over &pound;96,000 for visitor and  environmental management in the coming year, which is a slight increase on the  current year. However, funding for an additional ranger, which was provided for  the first time this year, will not be available. Taking into account existing  offers, the trust will receive almost &pound;230,000 in the coming year, which is 10%  of the total budget of NIEA&rsquo;s natural heritage grant programme.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr W Clarke</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his answer. Does he agree with me that the Mourne  Heritage Trust is vital in managing the area of outstanding natural beauty that  includes the Mournes and Slieve Croob? Does he also recognise that areas of a  similar size across the water receive millions of pounds?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: Areas across the water that receive millions of pounds are  very often national parks, and the Mournes area has not yet received that  status. However, the fact that 10% of the budget for NIEA&rsquo;s natural heritage  grant programme is being dedicated to one area is an indication that the  Department cherishes the Mournes and believes that it is a vital area.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">People may believe that the Health Minister is the only  Minister with financial difficulties, but his Department&rsquo;s budget was cut by a  lower percentage than mine, and everything is relative to percentages. My  Department, with a budget of little over &pound;100 million, had to find &pound;15 million  in efficiency savings, lost over &pound;7 million as a result of a reduction in  planning receipts, and had to spend over &pound;2 million as a result of the equal  pay settlement. Therefore, the Department is under severe financial pressure,  and some difficult decisions have had to be made.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Department is seeking to spread the pain and to keep  everything going. Once it gets over its current difficulties, and when more  planning receipts are received, it will hopefully be in a better position to  fully support vital resources such as the Mourne Heritage Trust.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>:  I listened very carefully to the Minister&rsquo;s reply to the Member opposite. Will  he tell the House what the current situation is regarding the Mournes area  becoming a national park? The Minister rightly pointed to the successful  attraction of moneys across the water. If that process was to be moved forward,  what level of moneys could be attracted to a national park in the Mournes?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: The Mourne Heritage Trust has already been successful in  bringing in other streams of income. Indeed, the &pound;230,000 it received from the  Department this year is not the only money that will be made available to it,  because it is very good at drawing down grant aid from other sources.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Department is looking at introducing legislation to  enable national parks to be developed in Northern Ireland, and where a  national park or parks are developed will be a matter to be dealt with after  the legislation has been approved. It could be the Mournes, the Fermanagh  lakelands, the Sperrins, the glens of Antrim or Strangford. There are so many  beautiful places in Northern    Ireland that could be eligible for that  status, but the first step is to ensure that the legislation is introduced to  allow for their creation.</p>
      <p class="H5StageHeading">Planning: Blaris</p>
      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">9. <strong>Mr  Donaldson </strong>asked the Minister of the Environment when the article 31  planning application will be processed for the proposed development at Blaris,  which includes the new Knockmore link road.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO  686/10<a name="AQO686/10" id="AQO686/10"></a>)</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: That question is well timed. There is no current planning  application in relation to the Blaris lands. A previous article 31 planning  application for a major mixed-use development, including the new Knockmore link  road, was withdrawn in June 2008, and a subsequent application has not yet been  submitted.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Snoddons Construction Ltd and Killultagh Properties Ltd,  the two companies behind the previous application, are preparing a development  framework for the site, which is a key site requirement for Blaris under the  draft Belfast  metropolitan area plan (BMAP). I am pleased to report that good progress has  been made on that and we are close to reaching an agreement. It is anticipated  that applications for the development of the site will follow after agreement  has been reached on the framework.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Donaldson</strong>:  Timing is everything in politics. I thank the Minister for his response. He  will know all too well, as a representative of the area, that one of the  problems inhibiting the further expansion of Lisburn, particularly the  industrial expansion to the west of the city, is the lack of adequate roads  infrastructure. The new Knockmore link road is essential in providing a  connection between the existing roads network and the M1/A1 at Sprucefield. Can  the Minister give us an assurance that, when considering the framework that  will be developed, the link road is given priority in the phasing of any  development at Blaris?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: In relation to the master plan, there is considerable  agreement between the Department and the developers on the nature of the  development and how it should be divided among industrial use, leisure use,  residential use, and other aspects. It is important that BMAP, when it is  produced, gives us an indication of the number of housing units that might be  allowed at the site, which will then enable the full development to roll out.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">At the moment, there are issues in respect of roads that  need to be addressed. Given the benefits that that road will bring to the city  of Lisburn, it may be worthwhile for the Member to pursue the issue with Roads  Service in order to ensure that roads do not cause a delay in a project that  will be hugely beneficial for transport linkages in that city.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Question 10 has been withdrawn.</p>
      <p class="H5StageHeading">Road Safety Council</p>
      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">11. <strong>Mr P  Ramsey </strong>asked the Minister of the Environment for an update on the review of  funding to the Road Safety Council of Northern Ireland.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 688/10<a name="AQO688/10" id="AQO688/10"></a>)</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: Members will be aware that, following a third, highly  critical independent review of the Roads Safety Council (RSC), my predecessor,  Sammy Wilson, wrote to the council on 9 December 2008 to confirm that funding  would be directed away from central administration and into the front line road  safety activities of local committees from 1 April 2009. The Department has  been funding local road safety committees from that date.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I met RSC representatives on 16 July 2009 and allowed them  to present their case for the reinstatement of core funding to the  organisation. Following that meeting, RSC wrote to me with its proposals and  asked me to reconsider the matter. Unfortunately, the RSC commission failed to  provide any evidence of new or innovative programmes of activity that would  provide added value to the delivery of the road safety strategy. However, I wrote  to RSC on 22 September 2009, informing it that I was prepared to allow the  organisation a further opportunity to make a proper business case for funding,  and asked officials to engage with them.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Officials met representatives of RSC on 13 October 2009 and  provided detailed advice and guidance on how to complete a formal business  case. Professional advice was provided by a departmental economist. To date, no  such business case has been provided by RSC and, given the fact that the  financial year is almost over, it is a reasonable assumption that even if an  appropriate business case were received, funding could not be processed during  what remains of the current financial year.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Some 16 of the existing 18 local committees applied to the  Department for funding for the current financial year. The Department approved  approximately &pound;33,000 of funding as a result of their bids. To date, eight  local committees have drawn down financial assistance to promote local  activities or events.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">A new funding model will operate for the financial year  2010-11, enabling the Department to engage more fully with the voluntary and  community sector and ensuring that it engages more effectively with local  communities in the promotion of road safety. That will replace the previous  system of funding solely to the Road Safety Council and the road safety  committees.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Ramsey</strong>:  I thank the Minister for such a detailed response to the question. I ask the  question as chair of the all-party group on road safety. There is a clear  strategic role for the Road Safety Council in Northern Ireland, and I appeal to  the Minister to meet a delegation from the all-party group to reconsider the  Road Safety Council&rsquo;s plans, and, perhaps, to try to re-energise the business  case in some way. Will the Minister agree to that?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: The Member will realise from my answer that I have  provided quite a number of opportunities to try to move the matter forward. One  of the issues is that of the budget of &pound;160,000, only 12% was used by local road  safety committees to deliver front line activities in 2008-09.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">When resources are tight, it is critical that any available  money be used well and wisely. The Member knows that I will always be available  to try to facilitate and to help where I can and that I will seek to be  constructive in all such matters. However, unless it can be demonstrated that  the money will hit the front line and be used in a way that can deliver on the  ground, I will be hamstrung.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: That concludes Question Time.</p>

      <p class="H4StageHeading">HSSPS: Potential Savings</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Debate resumed on motion:</p>
      <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly calls on the Minister of Finance and  Personnel to instruct the performance and efficiency delivery unit to assist  the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety by investigating  potential non-frontline savings within the DHSSPS remit and producing initial  recommendations within three months. &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Mr Hamilton.]</span></p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. The Alliance Party has sympathy  with the motion. Surely there can be nothing wrong with one Minister&rsquo;s helping  another Minister. We are concerned that the Minister of Health, Social Services  and Public Safety is struggling to come to terms with the efficiency savings  that are asked of him and agreed by the Executive. However, we must bear in  mind the fact that the Executive include members of the Ulster Unionist and  Tory party. We recognise the underlying weakness of the budget for health and  social services in Northern    Ireland, but it is another thing to say that  it should be insulated from any changes to the public expenditure environment.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I am glad to see that the Minister of Finance and Personnel  has arrived in the Chamber. I hope that his presence here does not have any  buckling effect on the negotiations and deliberations that are going on  elsewhere.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The health allocation for the 2008-2011 Budget cycle was  simply and clearly inadequate. In the past decade, a significant uplift in  health spending has taken place across the UK. That has reflected increasing  demographic demands, such as a growing senior citizen population, and there is  nothing wrong with that. Other demands include the need for more expensive drugs  and treatments and the need to continue to invest in modern technology. Areas  such as mental health and learning disability have rightly claimed an increased  proportion of health funding.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The fact that per capita spending on health was and  continues to be well ahead of the UK average reflects the wider  problems of Northern Irish society. Investment in healthcare has flatlined  against that in the rest of the UK.  Bodies such as the Economic Research Institute have estimated that our health  budget will be around &pound;300 million short of what is required to keep pace.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is disappointing that the Minister of Health, Social  Services and Public Safety accepted and, indeed, celebrated his budget in 2008  as being a good deal. It was clear to the Alliance Party then that it was far  from being a good deal. Our preference was for more money to be allocated to  health and social services in the first place. We would have sought to address  the costs of a divided society to release more money for health and social  services.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">People must be realistic about the need to raise money if  we are to have a quality Health Service. It is difficult to have it both ways.  It is one thing to acknowledge the underlying flaws in an overall Budget, but  it is another thing to say that no efficiency savings should be sought. Although  we are sympathetic to the notion of ring-fencing the health and social services  budget from further efficiency savings or cuts, that is not realistic.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The health budget accounts for more than half of the  Northern Ireland Budget, so any ring-fencing of the health budget would mean  that cuts in other Departments would be doubled. If health were exempt from the  3% efficiency savings, other Departments would have greater cuts to make, which  would be unfair. That could entail swingeing cuts in education, enterprise and  employment funding at a time when we are trying to regenerate the economy, make  society more sustainable and create more much-needed jobs.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>:  The Member said that a greater amount of money should have been given to health  in the original Budget. By necessity, that would mean that money would have to  come from other budget areas. Is the Member also saying that more money should  not come from other budget headings? If that is the case, what is he actually  saying?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member has an extra minute in which to speak.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  If the Member had been listening, he would have heard what I said. There should  have been and there could be more funding. In fact, the Alliance Party will  campaign for more funding to be created from what is being wasted on double  this and double that throughout our society. Funding could quite easily come  from that area. Hopefully, it will be forthcoming in due course.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Even at this stage, it is open to the Executive to suggest  that health takes a lower share of the burden of cuts than other Departments.  It is important that efficiency savings in the Health Service do not become  cuts in public services. Administration costs, such as needless paperwork, need  to be looked at. It is not a panacea or cure, as some people suggest, but there  are undoubtedly real savings to be made in that area.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, shifting resources towards public health and  prevention needs to be looked at. Prevention is the main route that we should  follow, and I know that a lot of work is going on in that area. If the main  reason for higher health spending here is the nature of our health problems,  then public health and prevention need to be prioritised. That requires  co-operation from other Departments and agencies.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The community and voluntary sector, which includes healthy  living centres and areas such as investment in speech therapy, must not be seen  as an optional extra but as a core function.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member should bring his remarks to a close.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  It can often deliver services more efficiently and may have a greater impact on  addressing health pressures early.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I want to make my comments on how savings can be made in a constructive  fashion, because I believe that that is what we are all about.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Members are aware of the economic downturn and the fact  that some things that are non-essential need to be cut back. We know that  Departments are saving money by using water coolers instead of bottled water,  printing only essential e-mails and introducing car sharing. Many people have  taken such issues on board. However, there are certain essentials that it is  important to retain: we cannot, at any stage, hit the front-line services by  cost cutting.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Members all know and are well aware that our Health Service  is among the best in the world, and we must ensure that it remains so. The fact  is that, in the Province, 50p in the pound goes towards health services, unlike  the Republic, where it is 35p in the pound. That is not a criticism, but it  puts things into perspective. It seems to me that there must be something that  can be done to reduce that amount without impacting on the service that is  offered to the people of the Province.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I want to focus on the Pharmaceutical Society of Northern  Ireland. In the &lsquo;Response of the Pharmaceutical Society of Northern Ireland to  the Northern Ireland Executive&rsquo;s Programme for Government, Investment Strategy  and Budget&rsquo;, the society claims that:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Pharmacists have an important role in: relieving the  workload of other health professionals, such as GPs and nurses; delivering cost  efficiencies to the NHS; and, improving convenient access to health services  for the public. Pharmacy should be a central consideration within any  discussions around health service reform in Northern Ireland.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The Pharmaceutical Society of Northern Ireland  recognises the pressures faced by all Departments to make efficiency savings  and states that:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;by working closely with the pharmacy profession the  DHSSPS can achieve a number of cost efficiencies.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">We ask the Minister to take that opinion on board.  The response continues that:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Examples include: taking workload pressures off other  healthcare professionals such as GPs; helping Incapacity Benefit claimants to  manage long term illness and potentially enable a return to work; improving  public health behaviours; and, ensuring best use of prescribed drug  treatments.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">I am anxious to know whether the Minister has  investigated a more complex use of pharmacies as a way of offering front line  quality services at a lower cost.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Everything that I speak about in the Chamber comes from  people from my constituency. A constituent of mine who works in a pharmacy  informs me that a substantial saving could be made by prescribing non-brand  medication that has the same active ingredients but not the same cost. That  would lessen costs for prescriptions and offer instant savings. I have also  spoken to a pharmacist who is concerned about the money that is wasted with the  dispense weekly and Medisure packages that offer prescription aid. Those  services were introduced for people who were unable to get out to collect their  prescriptions, but it is alleged that the service has been grossly abused by  some of the larger pharmaceutical businesses and is offered to anyone on repeat  prescription. That was not why the service was offered. The Minister should be  aware that the service quadruples the cost of dispensing a prescription. It is,  therefore, another example of a service that has cost more than it should have.  I stress that, in some cases, the service provides vital assistance to people  who are unwell. In other cases, however, the service is a way in which chemists  can make money. Surely that should be examined as a potential means of  delivering efficiency savings.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Those are issues that the Pharmaceutical Society of Northern  Ireland has brought to the attention of Members. They are only a couple of the  many examples that have been brought to my attention by those involved in front  line services.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I am sure that, were the performance and efficiency  delivery unit to be consulted, it would be able to offer a much wider range of  ideas. It is time to use that unit&rsquo;s services and to save money for the benefit  of all.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Recently, I asked the Minister some questions on heart  surgery and operations. It concerns me that some people, due to staff  shortages, go across the water for operations. Those operations cost more, and  we should look into whether the same service could be offered here at a much  better price. I think that it could. A significant number of rapid response  units have lain unused in a trust car park for well over a year. I wonder whether  such oversights and overspends could be avoided to deliver the required  savings.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister should get outside help. A fresh pair of eyes  should determine what savings can be made. The motion is before us today so  that all those issues can be addressed. Some underlying administrative costs  must be removed, front line services must be retained and enhanced, and  expenditure must be cut. I have made some proposals to the Assembly today, and  many other Members have done likewise.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Mr Michael McGimpsey has asked to be called as a private Member. I  remind him that he speaks in that capacity.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>:  I have no doubt, Mr Deputy Speaker, that, if I stray, you will be quick to  remind me of my status.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I am happy to take part in the debate. A number of points  have been made, some of which were constructive. I thank Mr Shannon for his  attempt to be constructive. However, I have to say, having listened to the  remarks of Simon Hamilton, that he made no effort to present anything other  than a cynical, political argument, partisan in the extreme, on the Health  Service. I have no doubt that that will also apply to remarks that are yet to  come. It is interesting that, in Simon Hamilton&rsquo;s speech, not once did I hear  the words &ldquo;patient&rdquo;, &ldquo;doctor&rdquo;, &ldquo;nurse&rdquo;, &ldquo;cleaner&rdquo; or &ldquo;porter&rdquo;. The whole thrust  of his argument is that there are too many doctors, nurses, cleaners and  porters who do not work hard enough. That argument does not go far in places  such as the Ulster   Hospital.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is important to stress that a report by the Nuffield  Trust formed the crux of Simon Hamilton&rsquo;s argument. The consensus in the Health  Service is that, as far as Northern    Ireland is concerned, that report is not fit  for purpose. The data is some four years old, and the report does not even  notice that the Department in Northern Ireland also provides social services,  on which some &pound;1&middot;2 billion of the health budget is spent. It ignores the fact  that, in England,  there was a major drive to create efficiencies through the wholesale transfer  of staff to private enterprises. Thousands of nurses were moved into private  businesses. That was based on the idea that the efficiency ratio can be eased  through maintaining the level of activity and reducing the number of nurses in  the workforce by thousands. I am not sure that that is the way forward for Northern Ireland.  I heard some DUP Members argue for some level of privatisation in the Health  Service, but that is no way to proceed.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Over the past few years, two major exercises on creating  efficiencies have taken place. One of those was the Wanless review, a key  element of which was to reduce demand by placing a greater emphasis on public  health. The Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety&rsquo;s response  was to create the Public Health Agency, a move that was accepted universally by  the House, with the exception of the DUP, which voted against it. That was an  example of the DUP voting against efficiency.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Appleby report has, as Members will recall, been  discussed on many occasions. Appleby made 26 recommendations, all but one of  which have been implemented by the Department of Health, Social Services and  Public Safety and the Health Service. The one Appleby recommendation that is  still to be implemented is the requirement for the Department of Finance to  increase the health budget by 4&middot;3% in real terms every year. That has not been  achieved. This year, the Health Service budget has been increased by 0&middot;5% in  real terms. Even when we adjust that to account for changes in the inflation  rate, it is still only an increase of just over 1% in real terms. Yet, as we  explained in the House on a number of occasions, demand on the Health Service  increased by 12% last year, and it is up by 9% this year. Therefore, Tommy  Gallagher and Kieran McCarthy were right to say that health and social services  are seriously underfunded in Northern    Ireland.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">3.15 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There is always room for efficiency; any sensible  organisation looks for efficiencies at every opportunity. I have been in  business all my life, and I understand how important it is to find  efficiencies. However, the funding gap with England has been estimated as being  somewhere close to &pound;600 million, and it does not matter how efficient you are  if you have that sort of shortfall.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Mitchel McLaughlin made a point about equality. Healthcare  is provided in the first 10 years and the last 10 years of someone&rsquo;s life. The  most vulnerable members of society rely on the Health Service. Hammering the  Health Service with a cut of over &pound;100 million at this moment is not something that  I can see as having been equality impact proofed. The reality is that that  requirement was made because DFP got the cash flows wrong, and we suddenly find  ourselves in the House requiring a fast &pound;400 million.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Will the Member draw his remarks to a close?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>:  I will draw my remarks to a close by asking that the House reject these  proposals because they come from a Department that is among the most  inefficient in Northern    Ireland.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  As my colleague Tommy Gallagher stated at the outset, we oppose the motion. We  see it as the smokescreen that it really is, intended to cover up the DUP&rsquo;s  abysmal record on and failure in the management of the finances of Northern  Ireland plc. Its lack of confidence in bringing forward a Budget or in allowing  us to revise the Programme for Government speaks volumes: it is afraid to open  the books and let the other parties and the public look at what is there.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I will also refer to Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s hypocrisy in talking about  equality on the day that is in it, when it is about to hand over a seat at the  Executive table to the Alliance Party, thereby failing to recognise the SDLP&rsquo;s  electoral mandate. Equality? Sinn F&eacute;in could not even spell it.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We all know that health inequalities are, by and large, a  result of poverty. Report after report tells us that poverty is one of the root  causes of health inequalities. Which Department is responsible for tackling  poverty and drawing up the action plans? OFMDFM. That is another failure of  Sinn F&eacute;in and the DUP. Mr McCarthy talked about the cost of the division and  sectarianism that remain in our midst. Those put a strain on all our budgets  because they are not being tackled. Which Department has responsibility for  cohesion, sharing and integration? OFMDFM. That is another failure of Sinn F&eacute;in  and the DUP to deliver for all the people of Northern Ireland. Same old, same  old.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Health Minister, speaking as a private Member, was  right to point out that none of the contributors from the opposite Benches  mentioned the hard work of nurses, social workers and all the ancillary staff  right across the North who worked so hard to deliver for our people during some  of the worst years of conflict. We saw in other reports how our staff are  working under enormous strain, not only where budget constraints are concerned.  Those reports have shown that their productivity has gone up by some 7%. At a  time of some of the most challenging financial and economic constraints, they  are working harder and for longer.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">My own trust &mdash; the Southern Health and Social Care Trust &mdash;  recently won a UK award for driving forward efficiency savings. As a  constituent of an area covered by that trust, you may have been aware of that,  Mr Deputy Speaker. Those efficiency savings did not impact adversely on front  line services. Time and time again, the SDLP has made the point that front line  services must be protected.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In bringing the motion to the Floor, Mr Hamilton and the  DUP have displayed cynicism, because only the SDLP voted against the Budget in  the Chamber. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span> For Members who do not  seem to be able to listen to what I have to say, I repeat: only the SDLP voted  against the Budget.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The loudest squeals and shouts now are from the Sinn F&eacute;in  Members, because they know that they voted in favour of the cuts, and now they  are trying to dress them up as efficiency savings. With their partners in  government in the DUP, Sinn F&eacute;in Members are trying to go after the Health  Minister, because, over the next few weeks, they do not want to be knocking doors  and having to admit that their Budget and Programme for Government are  decimating our healthcare. Services in the community &mdash; particularly those for  our older people, who are among the most vulnerable in our society &mdash; are being  reduced and cut because of Sinn F&eacute;in and the DUP.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  I want to try to get to the bottom of what Dolores is saying. She talked about  cuts and efficiencies, but does she not recognise that her own Minister removed  the strategic guidelines on the allocation of social housing, which were an  equality mechanism for people in Belfast?  That happened on her Minister&rsquo;s watch. Therefore, the party that calls itself  the champion of civil rights has a Minister who removed equality for people.  That is the legacy of Dolores&rsquo;s party, and it has nothing to do with efficiency.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I remind all Members that the motion is about government  efficiency.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  We have heard absolute nonsense from Sinn F&eacute;in Members, who now claim to be the  leaders of the civil rights movement. That is a load of nonsense; all  historians know that the facts speak for themselves.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We reject the motion and see it for what it is. Money could  be saved, and efficiency savings could be made. For example, what has been the  cost to the public purse of the recent events at Hillsborough Castle?  Those talks were held because Sinn F&eacute;in and the DUP could not get enough  clarity on the provisions in the St Andrews Agreement. We now have St Andrews mark II. What has been the cost of that? We  also have Sinn F&eacute;in bowing to the DUP on the allocation of the justice  ministry, abandoning the principles of equality and power sharing and assisting  the Alliance Party in its power grab for that ministry.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. I remind Members of a ruling made by the Speaker on 24  November 2009 in which he said that he would judge Members&rsquo; remarks against  standards of &ldquo;courtesy, good temper and moderation.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel (Mr S Wilson)</strong>: I am glad that I have been called at  this point in the debate, because it was going rapidly downhill. The rant by  the previous Member who spoke included references to power grabs by the  Alliance Party, a betrayal of equality by Sinn F&eacute;in, inefficiency by the DUP in  the running of the Budget, and the Health Minister not addressing the issues  that he should &mdash; everything except the subject of the motion.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I do not want to spend too much time discussing the matter,  but I will say one thing: the Budget is the responsibility of every party. The  Budget that we are going to live with next year, despite the rant by Mrs Kelly,  was endorsed by every party in the Assembly and in the Executive, including the  SDLP, the Ulster Unionists and Sinn F&eacute;in &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  That is not true.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: From a sedentary position, the Member is saying that  my comments are not true. All she needs to do is get a copy of the minutes from  the relevant Executive meeting. I do not think that even her own Minister would  have the barefaced cheek to deny that she had an input into the Budget and that  she accepted it. I do not want to get into that issue, because I want to move  on to the issues that we are meant to be talking about.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">All the parties in the Assembly have recognised the  importance of adequately funding the Health Service. The Minister of Health,  Social Services and Public Safety is a very busy man. Even though he took part  in the debate, he had to leave before the end of it, although he did not listen  to the first or last part of it. I am sure that Members are pleased that he  graced us with his presence today. In his ministerial role, he often could not  find the time to be accountable to the Assembly because he was fighting swine  flu and Lord knows what other diseases.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I remind the Minister that he is responding to the debate on  efficiency.<span class="Italic"> </span></p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I was about to respond to the comments of a Member  who had taken part; I wanted to provide a bit of context.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In 2007, the Minister said &mdash; do not forget that this was  the baseline for health &mdash; that he had got a good deal for health. Indeed, the  spending increase over the three years amounted to 3&middot;8% for the Department of  Health, as opposed to 3&middot;3% on average for other Departments. That was  recognition of its importance. I remind the House that the latest budget  reductions did not come about because DFP took its eye off the cash-flow ball &mdash;  whatever that may mean; I do not have a clue what he was talking about &mdash; the  reductions came about because the Executive and the Assembly decided  collectively to defer water charges, to implement equal pay and to help small  businesses and householders to pay their rates. There were costs attached to  those measures, and, therefore, the budget had to be redistributed.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  Rubbish.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: The Member may say &ldquo;rubbish&rdquo;, but it is a fact. The  cost of those measures was laid down, the gap in the Budget was identified, and  money had to be redistributed.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  Who brought the ideas to waive water charges and so on to the Assembly and the  Executive? Did you not bring those ideas to the House after calculating the  cost?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: Perhaps the Member forgets his party&rsquo;s manifesto,  which committed him to that. He voted for it.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: All remarks must be made through the Chair.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: Even with that, the reduction in the health budget  was the lowest of all reductions. Other Members said that various reports,  including the Appleby report, said that the Health Service in Northern Ireland  was not severely under-resourced. We should not run away with the idea that the  Health Department has not been given priority in the Programme for Government  and in the Budget; it has.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I will consider some of the arguments that were made. Why  was DHSSPS singled out in the motion? The proposer of the motion can explain  that later. PEDU has been with the Department of the Environment; I invited it  in when I was Minister of the Environment. As a result of its constructive work  and the follow-up work, which was a combination of PEDU working with  departmental officials, the processing time for planning applications was  significantly reduced. The targets, which had not been met in three years, were  achieved and there were significant improvements.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  Will the Minister give way?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: No; you had a rant during your chance to speak. Had  your contribution been constructive, I would have been happy to take questions  from you. If you did not have the time then, you do not have it now.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I remind all Members to address all questions through the Chair  and not to engage in toing and froing.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: Secondly, PEDU considered Land and Property  Services, which is part of a Department that is run by a DUP Minister. It  produced a useful report, which is now being implemented. Mr McNarry asked  about LPS. It was recognised that LPS had problems. However, the difference is  that DUP Ministers welcome the fact that a resource is available to deal with  problems when they arise in their Department.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I suppose that the motion would never have been tabled had  the Health Minister accepted the offer that I made to him on 10 November 2009.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">3.30 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I do not wish to impose PEDU on anyone. It is much better  if PEDU can collaborate and co-operate with Departments. On two occasions, I  have seen how PEDU&rsquo;s work can assist a Minister when there are problems in his  or her Department.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I do not think that the Department of Health, Social  Services and Public Safety has been unnecessarily targeted. A number of Members  have asked why I wrote to the Minister on 10 November 2009 to outline why his  Department might benefit from PEDU. Mr McLaughlin tried to puncture the balloon  of unionist unity by saying that there was a motive behind the letter that was  more about sniping and partisanship than about being helpful. I wrote to the  Health Minister because every Department is expected to find 3% efficiency  savings. By and large, all Ministers have got on with that job, and, as I have  reported here on a number of occasions at Question Time, those efficiency  targets are being met.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Time and time again, however, in the Assembly and in public,  the Health Minister has been the only one to say that he is finding it  difficult to meet the efficiency targets. The others said that they were  finding it difficult, yet they got on with it. They did not complain, nor did  they make a public issue out of the situation. The Health Minister did, and for  that reason I invited him, in a spirit of helpfulness, to use the available  resource that is the performance and efficiency delivery unit. I recognised its  value, and other Ministers, had they looked at PEDU, would have recognised its  value as well.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I like Mr McNarry&rsquo;s debating style. It is a kind of  skinhead bootboy debating style, which I always enjoy. It is my style, too. In  order to deflect criticism from the real core issue, Mr McNarry really got down  to it. He said that the letter was a calculated insult, and that it amounted to  carping about the Health Service. Let us look at the evidence. I do not want to  get into detail about reports, but three &mdash; the Appleby report, the report of  the departmental productivity working group and the Nuffield Trust report &mdash;  have already indicated that there are problems in the Health Service in  Northern Ireland. Members have quoted from those reports, and I will not repeat  them. However, the reports highlighted issues such as staffing, administration,  the amount of money that is spent per head, and dissatisfaction with service.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister said that the figures relating to those issues  were out of date. Had he read the Nuffield Trust report, he would know that it  is not four years out of date. Its figures are for 2008 to 2010, so if there is  a four-year gap, my maths must be wrong. The Nuffield Trust report quoted the  2008 figures for waiting times, so it is not four years out of date but fairly  up to date. All those reports highlighted issues that cannot be ignored.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Let us consider what the Minister has said about his  Department and how his Department makes decisions. When speaking in Committee  on 15 October 2009 on the investment in 200 new respite care places, he said:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;I am reviewing the situation with respite care&rdquo;.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText" style="text-indent:0cm;">Listen to this and tell me whether  this is not a Department that needs some extra focus. The Minister continued:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;no one is clear about what exactly we are doing or  where the need lies.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText" style="text-indent:0cm;">That hardly strikes me as a comment  that a Minister would make about a Department that is totally on top of what it  needs to do and how it needs to use resources. I could give Members other  quotations.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">All that I am saying is that there are independent reports.  Are they all levelling calculated insults at nursing staff, hard-working  auxiliary staff, or the staff in the Health Service? Is the Minister doing  that? I do not think so. Those reports simply accept that there is always room  for improvement in any large organisation that employs more than 100,000  people, spends &pound;4&middot;3 billion, and has a lot of competing needs and layers of  management. The whole point of bringing in PEDU is to help to zone in on some  of those areas, and to give direction to what the Minister wants to do. I want  to see, as I am sure does the Minister, the money that he has available spent  as efficiently as possible.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The argument was made that the Department of Finance and  Personnel should not impose PEDU on the Department of Health. The Minister said  that that demand came from the most inefficient of all Departments. He produced  no evidence for such alleged inefficiency. Unlike Mr McGimpsey, however, if he  has evidence of inefficiency in my Department, I would be the first to address  it, to find an answer and to remedy it.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I have said time and again, and this is where I differ from  part of the emphasis of the motion, that the best way forward is for Ministers  to invite PEDU to do its work, and to co-operate with it. There is no point in  PEDU going in and having to dig for information because a Minister and  Department do not want to provide it. That work can be done effectively only if  there is a willingness to surrender the information that is required so that an  assessment can be made of what can be done. I would prefer that we address the  issue in that way.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The debate has, at times, been contentious and not very  helpful. Sometimes, the attitude in the Assembly, and of the Minister, has not  helped. I want to make sure that health is adequately provided for and that,  when money goes to health, it is properly spent. That is why I am not imposing  PEDU on the Minister, but inviting him to bring it in. PEDU did a good job in  the Department of Finance and Personnel and in the Department of the Environment,  and can do the same job to help the Department of Health, Social Services and  Public Safety.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>:  Although the argument has been won on this side of the House, it is, sadly,  clear that the vote has not been won. I suspect that there may be limited  purpose in efforts to persuade recalcitrant Members to undergo a last-minute  Damascene conversion and see the merits of the motion.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Hamilton said at the outset of the debate that there was  a danger of health debates being marked by a puerile or childish attitude. The  debate was a mixed bag. There were sensible contributions and good points well  made. At other times, it went, as the Minister of Finance and Personnel put it,  rapidly downhill. I have in mind the image of the same sort of speed as a downhill  skier.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Hamilton, in proposing the motion, said that we should  all share the aims of the motion. There are a number of reasons for the motion.  Why should PEDU look at the Department of Health, Social Services and Public  Safety in particular, and why is the motion phrased as it is? As the Minister  pointed out, there are issues about a number of other important spending areas,  and other Ministers have shown willingness to invite PEDU in. However, for some  reason, the Department of Health has shown resistance. It would be valuable for  PEDU to have input on issues that are dealt with by the Department of Health,  because, as has been highlighted, that Department spends roughly 50% of the  Budget. If there is merit in examining only one area to get efficiencies and  value for money, the area to be examined should be the Department of Health.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We want to see PEDU involved because we are all acutely  aware of the importance of health. We realise the need to protect the weak and  the vulnerable and to try to protect front line services, as all parties said.  Why is there a resistance to the involvement of PEDU and attempts to see how  systems can be changed beyond just the general administrative efficiencies?  PEDU should take a radical look at the Health Service and suggest what changes  can be made so that we can have the best possible protection for our front line  services. That is an issue that we should all unite on.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>:  Will the Member acknowledge that the establishment of PEDU was based on the  principle that governs the Number 10 policy unit, which operates in Departments  at the invitation of those Departments? Will he accept that motions that are  aimed at bashing the Department of Health, which are tabled almost weekly by  the DUP, are not conducive to enabling such work? Will he reflect upon the  attitudes of his party, and will he agree that it is important to reflect the  significant increases in health demands?</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Last week, I visited a health trust that has experienced 7%  and 9% increases in accident and emergency visits and outpatients&rsquo; attendance  respectively. There has been no reflection of that additional workload in any  of his comments.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: I  am sure that the Member always gives the House much to reflect on.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">A number of areas are causing pressure on the Budget. I  wish for the Department of Health to engage with PEDU and to invite it in. If  that were to happen, there would be no need for a motion of this nature. The  pressures that are faced by the Department of Health are all the more reason  for PEDU&rsquo;s involvement. A finite amount of money is available in the Budget,  although undoubtedly, even if we spent every penny that we had on health,  pressures would still emerge. In dealing with the pressures, it is important  that we get the best possible service, value for money and maximum health spend  directed towards front line services. That is why PEDU should be involved. I am  concerned, because it is a no-brainer.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Hamilton stated that there is an inevitably emotional  response when dealing with health issues. That is only natural. However, when  we consider statistics that compare here with England, we see that we do not get  the same quality of delivery in the outcomes from our Health Service. However,  I do appreciate some of the caveats.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In days of financial constraint and in circumstances in  which the Budget is under pressure because of the avoidance of water charges,  which all parties supported in their manifestos, there will be increasing  pressures. Consequently, we need to have a clear-cut and radical look at better  performance management. Mr Hamilton stated that the Health Department is too  close to the issues to be able to consider what major changes should take  place, although that would be true of any Department. He also said that  management costs rose by 13% in the first year of the trusts. That is  fundamentally worrying. We should be looking at a driver for efficiencies.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Although he did not support the motion, Mitchel McLaughlin  indicated the need to respond to the economic circumstances, and he described  the need to try to ensure that front line services are protected as much as  possible as the defining issue. At least he acknowledged that there is some  opportunity to find additional efficiencies. Consequently, I agree that PEDU  has implications for the whole Executive. Unfortunately, some in the Department  seem to regard PEDU as a threat. PEDU should be regarded as a resource rather  than a threat.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">3.45 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">David McNarry, indulging in a bit of paranoia, regards the  motion as some sort of calculated insult. However, we tried to focus the debate  on practical measures rather than insults. I appreciate that a lot of the  debates in the Chamber can turn into knockabout, and both Mr McNarry and I are  guilty of that sometimes.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  Never.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>:  There is some revisionist history coming from those Benches.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Opposing the motion, Mr Gallagher outlined his worry about  cuts being imposed on front line services because it would be the weak and the  vulnerable who would suffer. However, that is the very reason why the motion  was put forward. Comparisons with social services are made with the exclusion  of some figures, so there is not that sort of problem. The line that the SDLP  voted against the Budget was trotted out again. However, the SDLP Minister  supported both the main Budget and the revised Budget. Therefore, the SDLP&rsquo;s almost  Pontius Pilate-like washing of hands is somewhat regrettable.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Kieran McCarthy indicated sympathy for the motion and the  strains on the Budget. However, I will be keen to read the Hansard report of  the debate, because his contribution left me with a slightly confused picture.  On the one hand, he said that more money should go in but, on the other, he  realistically accepted that money cannot be ring-fenced. Although it is  worthwhile to look at the costs of division again, it seems to be regarded as  the golden penny to fund just about everything at all times. Jim Shannon  contrasted our position with that of the Republic of Ireland  and highlighted the vital role that the pharmaceutical industry can play. He  also made some practical suggestions.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Although not speaking in his role as Health Minister,  Michael McGimpsey, whose contribution to the debate was welcome, launched an  attack on Simon Hamilton. That surprised me &mdash; well, perhaps I was not that surprised  &mdash; because I am not clear that Mr McGimpsey was in the Chamber for much of Mr  Hamilton&rsquo;s contribution; perhaps he watched it from another vantage point. I  ask the Minister what he has to fear from PEDU and urge him to take a better  look at the situation.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Dolores Kelly made a wide-ranging speech, which, at times,  concentrated principally on the evils of the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in and on a Sinn  F&eacute;in/SDLP battle. She touched on the subject of health occasionally, but there  is not a great deal that I can say in relation to that. The Minister  highlighted the fact that the Budget had been endorsed by all parties. I  appreciate that the Minister did not endorse it, but it has been endorsed by  all parties. Therefore, no one can pretend that it is the child of one party or  another. Furthermore, the Health Department received the lowest budget cut in  percentage terms.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">PEDU has been helpful in other areas, and I believe that it  can contribute to driving greater efficiencies in the health system by taking a  much more radical look at it. It will hopefully ensure that there is room for improvement.  The focus should be on front line services; all of the House should unite  around that. More in hope than expectation, I commend the motion to the House.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and negatived.</p>
