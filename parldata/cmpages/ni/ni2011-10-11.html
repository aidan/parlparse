        <p class="H4StageHeading">North/South Ministerial Council: Institutional Format</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Acting deputy First Minister, Mr John O&rsquo;Dowd, wishes to make a statement to  the Assembly this morning.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd (The  Acting deputy First Minister)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. In  compliance with section 52C(2) of the NI Act 1998, we wish to make a statement  on the sixth North/South Ministerial Council (NSMC) institutional meeting,  which was held in Stormont Castle on Monday 3 October 2011. Minister Kennedy,  who also attended the meeting, has approved the report, and we make it on his  behalf as well. The First Minister Peter Robinson MLA, Minister Kennedy MLA and  I represented the Executive. The First Minister and I chaired the meeting. The  T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Eamon Gilmore, represented  the Irish Government.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Ministers had a broad discussion on practical mutually  beneficial co-operation in the context of the current economic and budgetary  challenges that face each jurisdiction. Among the areas discussed were shared  economic challenges, the context of North/South co-operation and co-operation  to save money in service delivery. The Council discussed matters relating to  the North/South bodies and noted progress on their corporate and business plans  and the implementation of cumulative efficiency savings. It noted that a review  of the financial memoranda of the North/South bodies is under way, and a report  on progress will be provided to the next NSMC institutional meeting.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Council also noted that the boards of the North/South  bodies are due for renewal in December 2011 and that nominations will be  brought forward for approval at the NSMC plenary meeting in November 2011.  Revised reduced remuneration rates for board members that will take effect from  December 2011 were also agreed.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Council discussed progress on EU-related matters that  were raised at NSMC meetings. That included discussions on collaboration to  maximise drawdown of EU funds from the FP7 research and development programme.  Ministers also discussed progress on current EU programmes and the potential  for co-operation on future EU programmes.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">With regard to cross-border mobility issues, Ministers were  informed that systems have been put in place to resolve delays in the  processing of certain Department of Social Protection welfare benefit claims  with a cross-border element. The Council noted the continuing popularity of the  Border People website &mdash; <a href="http://www.borderpeople.info/"><span style="text-underline:none; color:black; text-decoration:none; ">www.borderpeople.info</span></a> &mdash; and that the Centre for Cross Border Studies, in partnership with other  organisations, will apply for EU funding for the website, which will  incorporate specialist training for the provision of advice on cross-border  matters.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Work taken forward to facilitate the comparison of  vocational qualifications obtained in other jurisdictions was discussed. That  included the publication of a leaflet &lsquo;Qualifications can cross boundaries: a  rough guide to comparing qualifications in the UK  and Ireland&rsquo;.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Ministers noted the progress made with regard to the  north-west gateway initiative.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Council agreed that the next institutional meeting will  be held in spring 2012.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Humphrey</strong>:  I thank the Acting deputy First Minister for his statement to the House. What  progress has been made as regards saving money in delivery service to  North/South bodies?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  There has been a constant review of the financing of the North/South  ministerial bodies. The Member is aware of the ongoing review under the St  Andrews Agreement, which is looking at the number of bodies and the  implementation costs. Both jurisdictions are conscious of the need for savings  to be delivered in those matters. We are conscious of the economic pressures  bearing down on both jurisdictions, and we want to ensure that whatever work we  carry out is effective and efficient in delivering services for people on the  ground.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms J McCann</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Given that the Minister referred to  the shared economic challenges, will he give us an update on the National Asset  Management Agency (NAMA)?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  NAMA was raised at the meeting, and we sought assurances from the T&aacute;naiste with  regard to its forward work programme. We also sought assurances that there  would be no fire sale of properties in this jurisdiction currently under the  control of NAMA and received those assurances. We raised concerns that,  although we have a representative on the NAMA northern board, often that  representative is given information after decisions have been taken. We sought  to ensure that, in future, such matters are fully discussed with our representatives  and that they are included in the decision-making process, so that we are kept  up to date with all those matters. The T&aacute;naiste noted that NAMA is an  arm&rsquo;s-length body of the Irish Government. However, he will do all in his power  to ensure that our interests and voice are heard around the NAMA table and that  we are kept briefed and up to date on all its workings.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Nesbitt</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his report. With regard to the renewal of the boards  of the North/South bodies, what steps are being taken to ensure that the  highest quality of applicant comes forward next time, particularly given the  view of DUP Executive Ministers, including the First Minister, who, speaking in  the House yesterday, offered the opinion that often more can be done by a phone  call to our opposite number than by working those formal North/South bodies?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  It is recognised and the report shows that the North/South bodies have carried  out a significant amount of work. Obviously, we want the highest calibre of individuals  to apply and be appointed to those bodies, and that is something that the  Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister (OFMDFM) and, no doubt,  the Irish Government will continue to apply when selecting and appointing  candidates to those bodies. As with all circumstances, there are instances when  a phone call will do and business can be conducted in that way. It is good that  Ministers feel comfortable enough to phone each other regularly and to conduct  business over the phone. However, longer-term programmes of work need to be  carried out, and detailed work has to be carried out to complete those tasks.  In those circumstances, you need well-equipped boards with the right calibre of  individual to carry out that work. It is not one or the other; we require both  to continue that programme of work.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Byrne</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his statement. Will he update the House on what was  discussed with regard to the north-west gateway initiative, given that the  people of Donegal and Derry want to see  co-operation on health, education and other matters?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  The north-west gateway initiative was discussed. Although we are conscious of  the economic pressures bearing down on both jurisdictions, it is proposed that  programmes of work for the initiative will continue. Alas, as I said, we are  conscious of the pressures bearing down on both Administrations. Some of the  work conducted around the north-west gateway, whether interjurisdictional or in  each jurisdiction, will depend on the finances available to the Executive or to  the Dublin Government.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lunn</strong>: I  thank the Acting deputy First Minister for his statement, in which he mentioned  vocational qualifications and how they can cross boundaries. Will the Acting  deputy First Minister encourage the Minister for Employment and Learning to  engage with his Southern counterpart to improve the transferability of  vocational and educational qualifications between the jurisdictions? Will he do  likewise with his other hat on as Minister of Education?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>: Although  the Minister for Employment and Learning does not have a formal North/South  relationship, I understand that he has been discussing those matters with  Minister Ruair&iacute; Quinn, whose brief covers further and higher education.  Progress has been made on the mutual recognition of qualifications. In my  capacity as Minister of Education and as I reported to the House recently, I am  aware that the General Teaching Council on this side of the border and the  appropriate body on the other side of the border are working more closely  together on teacher qualifications. That work is ongoing. Work is also being  carried out by the Council for the Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment and  the National Qualifications Authority on cross-border recognition of qualifications.  That work, too, is ongoing. I also reported in my statement that an information  leaflet has been published that allows for greater transparency for employing  bodies in recognising work qualifications that are mutually recognised on  either side of the border.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Spratt</strong>: I  refer the Acting deputy First Minister to his comments on EU funds from the FP7  research and development programme. Will he elaborate on what discussions took  place on collaboration to maximise Northern Ireland&rsquo;s position in  drawing down funds for research and development, which seems to be one of the  main areas for which EU money is available at present?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  How we benefit mutually from European funding and how each jurisdiction  benefits from European funding were raised as issues. The Member will be aware  that, even in our Budget discussions, we placed a focus on drawing down  European funding to assist our programmes of work, whether they be directly  government-led, community and voluntary sector-led or, within that, business-led.  It remains a focus of the North/South Ministerial Council and the Executive to  draw down European funding for research and development.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Flanagan</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Leas-Ch&eacute;ad  Aire ghn&iacute;omhach as a r&aacute;iteas. I thank the Acting deputy First Minister for his  statement, and I welcome the progress that has been made on dealing with delays  in processing certain welfare benefits that have a cross-border basis. I also  welcome the fact that a system for that has been put in place. Many of us have  called for such a system for years. Will the Minister provide an update and  further details on the system and tell us how it will benefit people?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>: I  have not got the complete details of the programme in front of me, but the  T&aacute;naiste assured the First Minister and me that the problems with social  welfare payments, particularly to those based in the Southern jurisdiction,  have been resolved and that he has been assured by his Department and his  Administration that problems that arose in the past have been resolved.  However, I will ascertain whether any further information is available and, if  so, forward it to the Member.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Boyle</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. How many North/South Ministerial Council  meetings have been held since 2007?</p>
        <p class="TimePeriod">10.45 am</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  Since 2007, approximately 92 North/South Ministerial Council meetings have been  held. The majority of the meetings are now held in our newly equipped  headquarters in Armagh, where staff are  located and the functions of the North/South Ministerial Council are, by and  large, operated.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  I thank the Acting deputy First Minister for his comprehensive report on the  meeting. I am interested in paragraph 8 of the statement. There is huge  potential for collaboration between North and South and other EU member states  in relation to the European Union innovation fund. Do the two Governments have  any specific plans to intensify the combined efforts of universities, North and  South, to work together with business to really impact big time on the  innovation fund? That fund is enormous. Somewhere in the region of &euro;50 billion  is available, and access to it could transform the economy in Northern Ireland.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  The Member will be aware that we identified European funding as potential  investment in our Budget to ensure that programmes that are operated by  government, business and the community and voluntary sector are driven forward.  Research and development and investment are part of that programme of work.  Those issues were raised during the meeting between the First Minister and me  and the T&aacute;naiste, and both jurisdictions are acutely aware of their potential.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">As we move towards the Irish presidency of the Council of  the European Union in 2013, it is worth noting that the T&aacute;naiste has offered  our jurisdiction, our Civil Service and our senior officials a place at the  table in preparation for that presidency. He has also offered the Civil Service  membership of a working party that will discuss the terms of that presidency.  Therefore, we will have a direct input at that stage. That shows that there is  a good working relationship on EU matters: the T&aacute;naiste is kindly allowing our  civil servants and senior officials access to the highest echelons of  decision-making in Europe.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I cannot speak on behalf of the Minister for Employment and  Learning about the universities. However, through my contact with Minister  Quinn as part of my brief as Minister of Education, I am aware that he and the  Minister for Employment and Learning are discussing potential work programmes  for the benefit of both jurisdictions.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McMullan</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for his  statement. Will he give the House an update on the A5 and A8 projects?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  As I said in my opening comments, Minister Kennedy joined the First Minister  and me at the meeting. He raised the A5 project with the T&aacute;naiste, and he  outlined the progress that has been made on that project and the time frame in  which the work will take place. I understand that Minister Kennedy made a  statement to the House yesterday on a number of spends and programmes of work  that he is carrying out, and those will have an effect on the A5 project.  However, that will be a delaying effect rather than a stalling effect. The  T&aacute;naiste offered his reassurance that the Dublin  Government are committed to the A5 and the A8 projects.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Allister</strong>:  The statement refers to efficiency savings without quantifying what savings  have been made in the &pound;100 million per annum cost. Yesterday, the First  Minister told us that a reduction in the number of bodies is on the agenda in  the efficiency review. Can the Acting deputy First Minister confirm that?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  The review of the workings of the North/South Ministerial Council is open to  public scrutiny. I believe that the First Minister informed the Member  yesterday that he may have been involved in the negotiations that led to that.  I cannot verify that; I am only relaying information that I picked up yesterday  in the House &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Spratt</strong>:  He approved it.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. Allow the Acting deputy First Minister to continue.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  Sorry. I understand that the Member actually approved the negotiations on the  North/South Ministerial Council.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Allister</strong>:  I resigned over them.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. Allow the Minister to answer.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>: I  suspect that the Member knows right well the answer to his question. The review  of the North/South Ministerial Council is open to public scrutiny, and its work  continues. Both jurisdictions want to ensure that we have effective, efficient  services on the island   of Ireland for the people  whom we serve, regardless which side of the border they reside on.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: That  ends questions on the statement of the Acting deputy First Minister.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Spratt</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Speaker. Is it proper for a Member, from a sedentary  position, to accuse the First Minister of lying to the House yesterday? That is  the word that he used: &ldquo;lied&rdquo;. I understand that such language cannot be used  in the House.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Allow me once again to check Hansard. I probably spend my whole life reading  through Hansard for points of order. However, I am happy to allow Mr Allister  to clarify the position if he wants.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Allister</strong>:  I never used the word &ldquo;lied&rdquo; whatsoever. I said that I resigned over the St Andrews matter. I never made any allegation about  lying.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I am happy to check Hansard and come back to the House. Let us move on.</p>
        <p class="H3SubHeading"><a name="2"></a>Private Members&rsquo; Business</p>
        <p class="H4StageHeading">Home-to-school Transport</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Business Committee has agreed to allow up to one hour and 30 minutes for  this debate. The proposer will have 10 minutes to propose the motion and 10  minutes to make a winding-up speech. One amendment has been selected and  published on the Marshalled List. The proposer of the amendment will have 10  minutes to propose and five minutes to make a winding-up speech. All other  Members who wish to speak will have five minutes.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  I beg to move</p>
        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">That this Assembly notes the importance of an  effective home-to-school transport policy; believes that the current policy is  outdated; and calls on the Minister of Education to initiate an overarching  review of the policy to ensure that home-to-school transport is provided in the  most cost-effective, efficient and safe manner.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I see that the proposer of the amendment is not in the  House. Perhaps, during the debate, you might give a judgement on what that  implies.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The current arrangements for the provision of  home-to-school transport came into operation in 1996. It is clearly time for a  review. Home-to-school transport is a major operation, involving some 110,000  children, with an annual cost of &pound;74 million. About 30% of those children  receive free home-to-school transport, and, of those using public transport,  65% are carried by Translink, 27% by the education boards and 8% by private  sector operators. In that last category, some &pound;8 million is spent each year  transporting pupils by taxi. I emphasise that I do not suggest that taxis for  children with special requirements should in any way be disposed of. However,  an analysis of costs indicates that Translink and Metro&rsquo;s costs are  significantly lower. That suggests to us all that major savings can be made and  that we need to look for greater efficiencies, which, I might add, do not mean  job losses solely to reduce costs.</p>
        <p class="B3SpeakerinChair">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr Dallat] in the Chair)</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">If all pupils transported by education board buses were  transported instead by Translink, it is estimated that annual savings of &pound;6&middot;8  million could be achieved, which is enough, I suggest, to ease significantly  pressure on a Department that has lost its fiscal direction. We simply cannot  afford to ignore such potential savings. However, the least we can look for is  a far better working relationship between the education boards and Translink,  for the benefit of the public purse, and look further to see what reductions  can be negotiated with commercial private companies, using the negotiating tool  of bulk purchase. The Department pays way too much for school transport.  Indeed, if we consider Translink to be a private company &mdash; it is &mdash; why should  we not widen the scope of private enterprise to compete for contracts or  bundles of contracts, to see what enhancement of community bus services can  also be realised on the back of that?</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">There is another aspect of home-to-school transport that  needs to be considered. Clearly, if there is to be a major rationalisation of  the schools estate, existing rules will become obsolete. School closures are on  the predetermined hit list of recommendations of at least one board. Even in  advance of general discussions about that following the audit planned by the  Minister, some boards are jumping the gun and are trying to force school  closures. Look no further than the South Eastern Education and Library Board,  which is taking unilateral threats to parents way beyond the limit in Ballykeigle Primary School in my constituency. Every  day we hear of such threats being transmitted in other areas under that board&rsquo;s  control.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd (The  Minister of Education)</strong>: On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. I am sorry  for interrupting the Member, but is it appropriate for a Member of the House to  refer to a public body issuing threats to anyone? I do not think that that is  appropriate language for the House.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I remind Members to be moderate and to avoid any kind of  controversy, which we do not want.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  Mr Deputy Speaker, after yesterday, I will be the last person to get involved  in controversy with the Chair. I respect your decision. The only thing that I  will say is that I have been sent here by my constituents, and they have told  me that they see those as threats, and it is my duty to report that to the  House. That is what I have done, and I hope that the House will accept it in  that manner.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I remind the Member that while he is in the House he should  respect the rules of the House, whatever his constituents might think.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  Indeed, Mr Deputy Speaker. I shall take it no further.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The point that I was going to make was that, if rural  schools are closed by the actions of the Executive and the Minister, he must  take responsibility and be held accountable for the financial consequences of  his actions. That includes the cost of forcing many more children into a  position in which they need home-to-school transport. I contend that that will  be more than was hitherto the case. That having been said, in a climate of cost  cutting and savings, it is incumbent on all of us to look at the most  cost-effective way to provide such transport, which may well involve  outsourcing those services to the private sector. There is a good example of  such a private service being operated in the County Down area by Down Town  Transport Ltd.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Deputy Speaker, as you will know, if rural life is to  continue and all-age communities are to be preserved in the countryside, good  home-to-school transport is essential, not optional. I say that as an MLA who  represents the Strangford constituency, where there are many small rural  communities, villages, towns and schools. Indeed, that is precisely why I am  proposing the motion today: to bring to the attention of the Minister and the  public the absolute need to sustain rural and semi-rural life, which is the  norm for more than one third of our citizens.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">An intrinsic part of sustaining rural life is having good  home-to-school transport. It is part of ensuring the viability of the  communities that I have talked about. Therefore, we cannot allow that important  consideration to fall through the grating in our scramble for savings. The  balance between service and costs is crucial, but lowering standards cannot and  should not be acceptable.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">We know that the Minister has embarked on an audit, which  will bring out many stark facts. I hope that the motion, which I trust the  House will support, will add weight to the proposition that, in the audit or as  an important attachment to it, the Minister will factor in the delivery of  school transport. He should do that not just as a cost but as a service and an  intrinsic part of a level of servicing necessary for a shrinking schools  estate, bringing in its wake, I hope, a great deal more home-to-school travel  than was needed before.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I look forward to the debate. I commend the motion to the  House and ask Members for their support.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Agnew</strong>: I  beg to move the following amendment: Leave out all after &ldquo;Education&rdquo; and  insert:</p>
        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;to work with the Minister for Regional Development to  create an holistic and sustainable school transport policy which will ensure  that school transport is provided in the most cost-effective, efficient and  safe manner.&rdquo;</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I must apologise to the Member and his party for my  lateness and for missing the start of his introduction, but I was caught up in  school traffic.</p>
        <p class="TimePeriod">11.00 am</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I tabled the amendment because I am concerned that the  motion focuses too narrowly on a cost-benefit analysis and does not look at the  huge array of benefits that investing in sustainable home-to-school transport  can bring. The Member mentioned the costs that are involved, and it is right  that we look at them, given the financial constraints. However, as I said, we  must equally look at the benefits and, perhaps, at how we can spend money more  wisely without reducing sustainable transport options for pupils.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">It is estimated that congestion costs the economy &pound;250  million a year. As anyone who drives will know, a large part of that congestion  is caused by the school run, that is, children travelling to school. Many  drivers dread the end of the summer when the schools come back and traffic  congestion increases. Therefore, it makes sense that we look at the benefits  that investing in sustainable transport would bring to the wider economy and  that we look at the wider benefits of that, as opposed to the same indirect  benefits.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Other benefits include safety, which is mentioned in the  motion. Buses are the safest form of transport that pupils can use to get to  school. The pack that the Research and Information Service provided to Members  shows that there were no deaths on school buses between 1996 and 2005, while,  during the same period, 17 deaths were attributable to other modes of  home-to-school transport. Good work is already being done to improve bus  safety, but we must now look at improving the safety of other forms of  home-to-school transport. If the motion is passed and the Minister accepts the  recommendation to initiate a review of the policy, it must not only focus on  safety and cost-efficiency, which, of course, are important, but have  sustainability at its core. Part of the reason for my tabling the amendment was  that I felt that that was an important omission from the motion.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">A policy is needed that focuses on active school transport.  Too many of our children get to school by private car. In some cases, that may  be necessary. However, I argue that, in many cases, it is not. A policy is  needed that has targets to reduce the number of children who get to school by  private car. Such a policy should seek to increase the number who cycle and  walk to school, because those methods have many benefits.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Campbell</strong>:  I thank the Member for giving way. Most people would appreciate the tenor of  his comment that the policy should aim to increase the number of children who  walk or cycle to school. However, does he appreciate and understand that many  parents are concerned that, if they try to ensure that their children cycle or  walk in, for example, extremely rural areas with small, narrow roads, particularly  in wintertime, which has been mentioned, then, rather than assisting  environmentally, they might actually be putting them in danger?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Agnew</strong>: I  absolutely accept the Member&rsquo;s point. At the start of my comments, I said that  we need to move from making buses safer towards making walking and cycling  safer. I said that there are circumstances where it may be necessary to use a  car &mdash; perhaps for safety reasons because there are no alternative forms of safe  transport. I will mention the Sustrans scheme to provide sustainable transport  to rural schools.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">As I said, there are many benefits of active school travel.  It will help to tackle obesity, which, as we know, is a growing problem in  society.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">If children are healthier, their educational attainment  will improve. In my short tenure as an MLA, the Assembly has debated reducing  fuel poverty a number of times. We must help families to reduce their reliance  on the car and, therefore, help them to tackle fuel poverty. As I mentioned,  reducing traffic congestion will have wider benefits for our economy. Given the  targets to reduce CO2 emissions, we must be aware that transport accounts for  21% of all greenhouse gas emissions. As has been stated, the school run is a  significant part of our transport.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Given the impact on a number of policy objectives, as I  read up on the subject I started to think that my amendment, which calls on the  Minister of Education to work with the Minister for Regional Development, does  not go far enough. As has been pointed out, an active school transport policy  will bring benefits to health and to the Minister for Social Development&rsquo;s  attempts to tackle fuel poverty.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I mentioned the Sustrans rural safe routes to schools  pilot, and that shows what can be achieved. The number of people using cars was  cut by 22% in the pilot project; the number of children cycling increased by  100%, and the number walking increased by 40%. That happened in rural areas,  which the Member mentioned and where, arguably, there are fewer sustainable  transport options. Therefore, we could achieve even greater success in our  towns and cities.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">It is important that the Executive work together and that  we do not have one party represented in the Executive calling on a Minister  from another party to do something. We need co-operation at Executive level on  policies such as this to ensure that costs and benefits are spread across  Departments.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Sustrans estimates that it would cost around &pound;2 million a  year to provide the necessary funding to produce measures to run a successful  scheme that targets primary schools. By my own crude calculations, &pound;1&middot;3 million  or &pound;1&middot;4 million of that would be given to the Minister for Regional Development  to improve safety for cyclists and walkers on our roads, and &pound;600,000 or  &pound;700,000 would be given to the Education Minister. Given the benefits that I  have outlined, those are reasonable costs. Indeed, such investment might  increase savings in areas such as health and reduce fuel poverty. It would be a  sensible investment at a time when money is scarce.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">An active school transport policy would be good for our  economy in reducing congestion; good for people in improving health and  education outcomes; and good for our environment in reducing emissions and  further improving air quality. I hope that the House will support the  amendment. It is not intended to take away from the motion in any way but  simply to add to it the importance of sustainability in school transport  policies and of Ministers working together.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey (The  Chairperson of the Committee for Education)</strong>: I thank the Member who tabled  the motion for the opportunity to engage in the debate. I speak as Chair of the  Education Committee, but I trust that, if time permits, I will be able to make  a few comments as a Member.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">It is right and proper that I inform the House that the  Committee has considered the issue of transport from home to school on a number  of occasions since the beginning of this mandate. The thrust of the Committee&rsquo;s  work focused on three areas: health and safety issues in such transport; the  Department of Education and Department of Finance and Personnel (DFP) joint  efficiency review; and the need to review the policy on transport from home to  school. I will touch on each of those briefly.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">At Committee meetings on 22 June and 7 September, members  discussed the provision of school transport and the mechanisms through which  compliance, enforcement and monitoring of health and safety issues took place,  particularly the procurement process.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Some concerns were raised about contractual provisions  vis-&agrave;-vis health and safety compliance; the frequency of health and safety  inspections of transport; and the resources available to the boards and the  Department of the Environment to monitor and enforce health and safety  standards in home-to-school transport. Those are vital areas, because, although  it is right for us to call for a review of the policy, we need to remember that  thousands of children across Northern    Ireland were transported today. Although it  may take the House some considerable time to deal with the policy, the practice  needs to be right today to ensure that our children are being transported in a  safe manner.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee, in furtherance of its scrutiny of this  important issue, is pursuing information from the Federation of Passenger  Transport, the Committee for Regional Development and the Committee for the  Environment. It is only right and proper that we wait until such time as the  Committee has formed a collective view.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">In June, the Committee considered the ongoing work by the  Department of Education and DFP on a joint efficiency review. The performance  and efficiency delivery unit (PEDU) review has two stages. The stage 1 report,  which was published in March 2011, included school transport as one of its key  themes. In short, the report found that, against a background of all boards  facing increasing transport costs and falling pupil numbers, there were sharp  increases of between 3% and 9% in unit costs across the education and library  boards.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">PEDU also found that the main sources of increased costs in  home-to-school transport between 2004-05 and 2009-2010 were Ulsterbus, or  Translink, and the board-owned vehicles. However, the increase in cost of the  board-owned vehicles was more pronounced because that mode of transport carried  just over half the number of pupils that Translink carried.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">If we leave aside the three-for-two funding, the escalation  in unit costs of board-owned vehicles was just under 40%, which was nearly  twice the rate observed for Translink. If we take account of the three-for-two  funding and examine the variation in costs of transporting children with  special educational needs (SEN), the PEDU analysis still points to significant  variations or growth in unit costs, particularly when comparing the South  Eastern Board, the Western Board and the North Eastern Board. The stage 1  report found that, in the case of the Belfast Board, the overwhelming cost  factor for board-owned vehicles in SEN &mdash;</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr T Clarke</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  Yes.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr T Clarke</strong>:  The Member compared the board-owned transport with the transport provided by  Translink. Does the Member accept that those statistics are an unfair  reflection, because Translink merely sticks to bigger routes and the  board-owned buses tend to stay on smaller routes on which Translink does not  function anyway? The statistics are being used to suggest that Translink is  possibly cheaper, but the board-owned buses use routes that Translink cannot  use.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>: I  thank the Member for that valid point. That needs to be clarified further, and  I think that it will be addressed in the second stage of the PEDU report. His  point about Translink not having access to rural roads was well made.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">However, the point that must be made is that the unit cost  of transporting SEN pupils in the Belfast Education and Library Board area by  board-owned vehicles has gone up by a staggering 75%. In comparison, the South  Eastern Education and Library Board transported more than twice the number of  SEN pupils on board-owned vehicles for around the same overall cost. The stage  1 report highlighted what it characterised as some odd and unexplained  variations in comparative spending on the taxi and daily allowance.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">For example, in relation to the latter, PEDU was unclear  why, in some cases, presumably in peripheral locations &mdash;</p>
        <p class="TimePeriod">11.15 am</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Bring your remarks to a close, please.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>: &mdash;  the number of pupils should have increased to such an extent &mdash;</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Your time is up.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>: I  support the motion and the amendment.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Flanagan</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. &Eacute;ir&iacute;m chun taca&iacute;ocht a thabhairt  don r&uacute;n, agus gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis na Comhalta&iacute; a chuir &eacute; faoi bhr&aacute;id an  Tion&oacute;il. T&aacute; &aacute;thas orm go bhfuil an tAire Oideachais anseo chun &eacute;isteacht leis  an r&uacute;n agus leis an d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht agus go mbeidh s&eacute; in ann a chuid smaointe  f&eacute;in a chur chun tosaigh.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">There is no question that transport provision is a huge  expense to the Assembly, with &pound;75 million being spent on it each year. However,  there is also no doubt about the key role that transport providers play in  getting our children and young people to and from school and further education  colleges in a safe and timely manner. That is particularly the case in rural  constituencies such as my own. There is, however, significant wastage, and  there are potential savings to be made in the transport budget. I welcome the  fact that the Education Minister has made a commitment to ensure that &pound;5  million is removed from the budget each year within this four-year budgetary  period. He has also made commitments that that is to be done in a manner that  does not impact on front line service provision, particularly on the needs of  rural dwellers and children with special educational needs.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">We need to ensure that any review that is carried out is  done with rural proofing and equality measures at its core. I look forward to  seeing exactly how the challenging targets that the Minister has set out can be  achieved, and, later in my contribution, I will outline some proposals through  which both savings and service improvements can be made.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I remember travelling to school as a young child from  Garrison to Enniskillen, a journey of 25 miles, on a greatly overcrowded bus,  where the youngest children had to sit on school bags at the front, and there  were at least three people on each seat. That was a completely unsafe method of  transporting young children to and from school, but it was good craic.  Thankfully, there have been relatively few serious accidents on school  transport.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">In recent years, there has been a serious fall in the  number of pupils availing themselves of our transport provision, so the problem  of overcrowding is not so great any more. However, in the same time frame,  there has been a huge surge in the cost of providing that transport. Much of  those increased costs can be explained by rises in fuel prices, inflation, and  the increasing costs of purchasing vehicles and servicing them, but the fact of  the matter is that we need to look at how we provide and procure transport from  home to school. I, therefore, welcome the motion and the amendment and the  opportunity for the debate to take place.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Chairperson of the Committee referred to stage 2 of  PEDU. I look forward to seeing the proposals outlined in that report, and I  anticipate the Minister reacting positively to them, as he has done to date  throughout the process. I hope that one of the proposals to come out of that  review will be to encourage greater collaboration between all our Departments,  and particularly in regard to education and library boards, Translink,  community transport operators and the Health Department. At present, we have a  silo mentality in operation. Education and library board buses are often  sitting idle throughout the day, when they could be used to provide affordable  and reliable transport in neglected rural areas for the benefit of the entire  community. There is also a greater need for collaboration and sharing of  information among education and library boards and with transport providers in  the South. We should not be afraid to tackle those issues.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">We really need to take a serious look at the tender process  for transport for children with special educational needs, at whether private  taxi operators provide the best value for money for the Assembly and at whether  potential savings could be found if there was greater collaboration with other  public transport providers. Over the last six years alone, some &pound;45 million has  been spent on taxi hire for students.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Many Members who have spoken brought forward stories from  their own constituencies, and I will keep with that trend. I was contacted by a  lady just last week who had serious difficulties getting suitable transport for  her 17-year-old son, who suffers from autism. He has done very well in  remaining in full-time education, and he takes part in a course at the college  of further education in Enniskillen. The rigid nature of the current policy  means that he must get a taxi into Enniskillen for 9.00 am every morning and  get one home at 3.00 pm. That normally suits him OK, except on Thursdays, when  his class only runs from 11.00 am to 1.00 pm. That leaves a very vulnerable  person in Enniskillen on his own for four hours each week. That is an area in  which the policy has failed those it is designed to protect.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">There is also a whole host of questions regarding the  quality of some roads that young people are expected to walk on in dangerous  conditions. We all know of the devastating loss &mdash;</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr T Clarke</strong>:  I thank the Member for giving way. He raises a pertinent point about some of  the roads. I take it that he is referring to the fact that many of the roads  have no footpaths. Does he not think that there is something that the Minister  could do in relation to that? For some of the children who live fewer than two  miles from the primary school, or three miles from the post-primary school,  where there are spaces on the bus and buses are driving past the children  walking along those roads, there are concessions that could be made. Can the  Minister encourage the education and library boards to fill those places  through concessions? In some areas, that is not the case.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Flanagan</strong>:  I thank the Member for his intervention. The motion calls for a review of the  policy, so I hope that the Minister will take that issue on board.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">To return to the subject of bad roads, we all know of the  devastating loss to the local community of Debbie White and Nathan Gault, who  passed away after being knocked down getting off a bus near Florencecourt in  November 2008. Since that terrible accident, their school, Devenish College,  and other schools in Fermanagh have taken positive steps to attach reflective  material to school blazers, a move that was supported by former Minister of  Education Caitr&iacute;ona Ruane. I hope that that will be looked into as part of the  review.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Agnew correctly raised the issue of safety. In fact, a  number of pupils from my former school tragically lost their lives on the way  to and from school in private cars, when they could have been travelling on a  bus.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I ask the Member to bring his remarks to a close.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Flanagan</strong>:  Since those incidents, the school in question has banned pupils from taking  their own car to school. I look forward to hearing the rest of the debate and  hope that it will get support across the House.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  I support the motion and Mr Agnew&rsquo;s amendment. I apologise to Mr McNarry and Mr  Agnew for missing a good deal of their contributions; I was detained elsewhere  in the Building.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">It will not escape the attention of those who follow our  business carefully that this is yet another day on which we are debating the  need to do something at some point in the distant future. It is becoming a bit  difficult to justify the House&rsquo;s existence when that is all that we seem to do.  As meritorious as this and many other motions are, it would be much better for  us all if we were here debating the outcomes of reviews and the proposed  policies through legislation that Ministers may be able to bring to the House  than simply calling on them to do something at some point in the not too, or  perhaps too, distant future.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I am a bit surprised that anyone would come to the House  and welcome a &pound;5 million cut per annum in anyone&rsquo;s budget. I am surprised that  anyone would suggest that taking money out of a very important public service  is in the regional interest. I am particularly surprised that we would welcome  it, given that we have the worst uptake in these islands of pupils &mdash; children  and young people &mdash; using public transport to get to school. Fewer pupils in our  primary and secondary schools use public transport in Northern Ireland than  anywhere else in these islands. In fact, more than half of all our pupils  travel to school by car. I accept that we have a dispersed population, and I am  a huge supporter of the integrity of our countryside and the way in which we  have historically lived &mdash; a way in which we must be entitled to continue to  live. However, it is bizarre to say that it is a good thing to cut by &pound;5  million a budget that is already so abysmally failing.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the Chairperson of the Committee for Education&rsquo;s  comments about the need to eliminate the extreme inefficiencies in the school  transportation budget. However, if we are to eliminate inefficiencies, surely  it would be better to close the gap in uptake so that we do not stand out as  the worst-performing region in these islands when it comes to children&rsquo;s and  young people&rsquo;s ability to access school transport. Rather, we need to stand out  as a place in which there is a considerable increase in the uptake of school  transport.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Eighty-eight per cent of schools in England now have school  travel plans aimed at shifting kids and their parents away from using cars and  towards alternative, safer ways of getting to school. Six hundred and fifty  schools in the South use the Green-Schools programme, which, again, is about  trying to make sure that children can get to school on public transport or  through alternative modes other than their mum and dad&rsquo;s car, or, in some  cases, as Mr Flanagan pointed out, and increasingly in some of the schools  where the kids come from more affluent backgrounds, their own car.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Here, we have been cutting the budget to try to  encourage kids to shift mode from a car to public transport. I accept that the  Minister is responsible only for the education side, and I am not going to ask  him to do anything else. However, when we look at our regional transportation  strategy, which, of course, informs a lot of the debate, there is absolutely no  connection whatsoever among health boards, education boards, Translink and the  Post Office. Three or four vehicles travel the same country road and pick up  three or four different people at three or four different times of the day.  That is not duplicating; it is triplicating and quadrupling the amount of  public investment that goes into transporting people along that road.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Wouldn&rsquo;t it be great if, rather than celebrating cutting &pound;5  million a year out of the budget, which is no celebration at all, we were  genuinely talking about being able to continue to invest that money and getting  so much more bang for our buck; and that, in fact, in the years ahead, it was  not a majority &mdash;</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Bring your remarks to a close.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  &mdash; that use their cars to go to school, but a tiny minority?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lunn</strong>: I  support the motion and Mr Agnew&rsquo;s amendment, which is slightly more specific  but has the same aim of tidying up and renewing an outdated policy. I am sure  that substituting &ldquo;holistic and sustainable&rdquo; for &ldquo;overarching&rdquo; does not change  the substance of the motion. From contributions previous, it sounds as if  everybody will support it, which is good.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">There are many points to be considered in this argument.  Other Members referred to constituency problems. The most irritating one for  me, which seems to recur every year, is the vexed question of the exact  distance from home to school and the two-mile and three-mile rule. It worries  me that the Department, in the case of which I am thinking, can commission an  exact measurement over a three-mile route and then argue about 100 yards,  particularly when the suggested route involves crossing a busy road at the  nearest point without the benefit of a crossing patrol or traffic lights. The  parents, in that case, did their own measurement using proper safety  considerations and traffic lights. Their measurement was different to the  Department&rsquo;s, but the Department won. It also worries me that, when two  children live on the same street and attend the same school, one could be  regarded as qualifying for free transport and the other not on the basis of the  same rule.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Having got that out of my system, it is also a fact that,  across all boards, transport costs have been rising while pupil numbers have  steadily fallen over a number of years. That has produced the unit cost  increase, to which the Chairman referred, of up to 9%. We are all familiar with  the rapidly increasing figure of 85,000 empty desks, which only a couple of  years ago was being quoted at 50,000.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McNarry talked about greater efficiencies. He made some  very good suggestions, mostly around privatisation and outsourcing. Mr Agnew  went a different route and talked about sustainability and environmental and  health considerations. That is all very worthy. Mr McDevitt and others  mentioned the &pound;20 million that will be taken out of the budget over the four  years. I wonder whether the real problem is the same one that affects every  aspect of education at the moment: the fact that we have too many schools and  sectors. Many schools operate well below what is regarded as a sustainable  pupil number but still have a requirement for transport. Furthermore, there is  the need for the controlled and maintained sectors to largely employ different  school buses even though, as a result, they pass each other, sometimes half  empty. That applies to the schools as well as the buses.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I do not, for one minute, advocate the closure of small  schools. The Minister&rsquo;s viability review will take everything into  consideration, not just pupil numbers. However, we need a root-and-branch  review of our school estate and a meaningful post-primary review, not just the  maintained sector review, which will be announced shortly. It needs to be  across all sectors, and it will lead to a serious attempt to rationalise our  system. That is now advocated by so many interested parties, which range from  the One School of Thought campaign right through to the First Minister. There  is certainly a wide range of interested parties that seem to think that the  Alliance Party view has been right all along.</p>
        <p class="TimePeriod">11.30 am</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">In recent days, the Minister has made statements that may  lead to serious decisions being made. If the House were to allow the Minister  to get on with that in the short, medium and longer term, perhaps problems such  as the cost of school transport would resolve themselves to some extent. If the  schools estate were put into the right framework and pupils were being sent to  school in the most efficient way possible, obviously it would mean that there  would be fewer schools and more co-operation across the sectors. That would  mean that the requirement for transport would diminish, so the problem that we  are looking at today would sort itself out to some extent. I look forward to  what the Minister has to say. We support the motion and the amendment.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Craig</strong>: I  support the motion and the amendment. I refuse to take the pessimistic view  that all of this should have been done a long time ago and that we are  discussing something that should have been sorted out. There are a wide range  of reasons why it has not been sorted out, and there are a large number of  reasons why it will not be sorted out in the short term. We inherited the  policy from a direct rule Minister, and there is a whole raft of reasons why it  is now completely out of date. One of the main reasons is the rising cost of  transport, and there are rising costs of between 3% and 9% in the education and  library boards (ELBs). In addition to that, the spending review that was  announced by the coalition Government has led to the cut in the transport budget.  All of us seem to forget that we do not have a magic hat from which we can  summon up money from nowhere. Money has been taken away from us, and,  unfortunately, school transport is one of the areas being cut.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The current arrangements for the provision of  home-to-school transport came into operation in September 1997, and the  transport costs for each pupil vary significantly between cases and between  boards. Across the five boards, there are examples of it costing &pound;513 a pupil,  and there is an example of it costing &pound;1,741 a pupil. Another reason for  transport costs having risen is that the three-for-two policy was, quite  rightly, abolished. In a lot of the vehicles, children now have to wear  seatbelts, and that is a good safety measure. That has played a part in  changing the landscape in the area of transport.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The statement that the Minister made in the House on the  review of schools will also change the landscape. He talked about the  sustainable schools policy, and that will have a major impact on the transport  system. I can speak only from experience about the impact that that policy is  having in my constituency. When we are looking at the rationalisation of  schools, the impact on the transport system needs to be taken into account.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">In my constituency, I have watched with interest the impact  that the announcement of a consultation on the closure of Dunmurry High School  has had. Quite frankly, there is no way to describe it other than that pupils  are now going to the four winds. A lot of them are going to schools in east  Belfast. Some of them are going to the next nearest school, which is now at  complete capacity. They are being handed on to yet another school, which is  further away. Even today, I have heard that a number of pupils have been toured  around a third school that is even further away, because there is no spare  capacity in the other schools. That is, in miniature, what I see happening as a  result of the rationalisation of schools. That will have a major impact on the  whole infrastructure of home-to-school transport for our children.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I am an optimist, not a pessimist, and I think that now is  the time to review the whole strategy for how we transport children to school  and the way in which we do so. Whether the Minister likes it or not, the  rationalisation of schools will have a major impact on the provision of  transport right across the board. I appeal to the Minister &mdash; as has been said  in the House before &mdash; to rationalise the whole school transport system.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I can give the Minister a prime example of where it is all  going wrong and where the Member for the Green Party has got it right. A board  bus with three pupils on board passes the end of my street every morning and  afternoon.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Bring your remarks to a close.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Craig</strong>: A  concessionary place was taken off my child and others because of a policy made  by the board in my area, the impact of which is that another 15 cars have to  travel less than a mile and a half to the local primary school.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Sorry; your time is up.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Craig</strong>:  That is an absurd policy, and it needs to be reviewed.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Boyle</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I welcome the opportunity to speak to  the House in support of the motion and the amendment. The current arrangements  for home-to-school transport have been in operation since 1997. Pupils eligible  for transport assistance must be enrolled at their nearest suitable school and  live beyond the qualifying distance to that school, which, at present, is two  miles for primary and three miles for post-primary. In Britain, the authorities  operate lower walking standards than those used here to determine free  transport eligibility.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">School transport in Strabane, in my constituency, is a  contentious issue at present because a service was withdrawn days before the  start of the new school term. The parents of up to 133 young people from one  school received letters just before the new school term informing them that  their children were no longer entitled to concessionary places. As a result,  families were displaced. Some parents in rural areas received the letter only  the day before the child was due to start back at school. Parents were forced  to act immediately, almost overnight, to ensure that their child got to school  safely the next day. For most of the parents, that was a domestic nightmare,  and, more important, a health and safety one. Those who were unable to avail  themselves of a car or other transport methods at that time had no alternative  but to walk their children along one of the busiest roads in Strabane: the A5  Strabane to Derry road.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Children attending primary schools in my district were also  displaced. I have been told by one parent that she had to walk her three small  children &mdash; one was in a pram and the other two were on either side of her &mdash;  along an unsafe country road for a mile and three quarters, taking her 70  minutes. There have been similar issues in the Douglas Bridge area, with  parents having to make decisions that impacted greatly on their arrangements.  For example, one parent had to give up her part-time employment as a result of  concessionary entitlement being withdrawn.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The current system of home-to-school transport provision  fails those who need it most. There is no doubt that the cost of providing  home-to-school transport is rising, and I am sure that other Members also  acknowledge that. That has been attributed to a number of factors: the rising  number of children with special needs; the increased use of taxis by ELBs for  school journeys; the rising cost of public transport due to operating costs;  and the scheduling of different services due to schools&rsquo; starting and finishing  times.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Western Board officials in my area informed me as recently  as last week that pupils who were entitled to concessionary travel to get a bus  from their village in order to then get a connecting bus to their school are no  longer entitled to that. They said that that practice has now ceased because  they had to downsize. Yet parents from the same village told me only yesterday  that the same bus passes by their children with empty seats.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Research tells us that there is significant growth in car  ownership, which has resulted in increased traffic and busier roads, adding to  congestion close to schools. I acknowledge the concerns that Mr Agnew has  outlined. The current policy on walking distances in home-to-school transport  should be reviewed to identify the impact that changes could have on transport  provision here and to ensure that all our children and young people can travel  to school in a safe and effective manner. There is a need for a comprehensive  review of the policy on home-to-school transport, and I believe that now is the  time to have that review. It is also important that any review incorporates all  existing transport resources to help to address capacity issues on buses and  that steps are taken to improve safety arrangements for children and young  people &mdash;</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Draw your remarks to a close, please.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Boyle</strong>: &mdash;  travelling to and from school. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Hale</strong>: As  a member of the Education Committee, I support the motion and the amendment. I,  like many in the House I am sure, have been inundated with calls and letters  from concerned parents in my constituency whose children are attending the  nearest suitable school and who have seen their transport being withdrawn or cut  by the education and library board. That presents major difficulties for  parents and children, many of whom live in constituencies such as mine, where  they rely on public transport to get children to school on time.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">An example that I would like to highlight is Banbridge  Academy, which is close to my constituency office in Dromore. It provides an  excellent local educational facility for local children. A significant number  of its pupils rely on a bus to get them to and from school each day. However,  children who are keen to take part in extra-curricular activities outside  normal school hours have been left at a severe disadvantage. The bus can take  the children to school on time and bring them home, but only if they go home  with the rest of the children at the end of the official day. For many children  in Dromore who choose to take up extra-curricular activities, the day does not  end with formal lessons. That leaves them stranded as there is no bus that will  take them from Banbridge Academy to Dromore.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I feel that the approach is inflexible and maybe even  discriminatory, as children who wish to stay after school to take part in  sports, a homework club or drama, etc, are being discouraged from doing so for  fear of not getting home. That is not acceptable. Future employers and  universities look for pupils who have access to the full curriculum as an  indicator that they are team players, work well with others and can meet extra  work commitments. Are we really going to actively discourage our future  workforce from accessing the best jobs and universities because of an outdated  policy that is not fit to meet its purpose? As we know, and as the Minister has  said, 80% of learning happens outside the classroom, yet here we are in 2011,  seemingly preventing a large percentage of that learning from happening. It  should also be pointed out that many of those children&rsquo;s parents work, leaving  them unable to pick them up from school.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Two weeks ago, the Minister announced a review of schools &ndash;  one that will ultimately decide which schools stay open and which will close.  If we are to go down that route, will we see more children having to travel a  considerable distance to get an education that is suitable for their needs? The  review could impact on rural areas more than urban areas. There is a greater  likelihood that rural children will have to travel further than their urban  counterparts. That is the case, as I have outlined already, but I fear that  things could get worse. It is for that reason and others that we must see the policy  renewed and updated. The current policy is 14 years old and out of date, and it  should be reviewed and revised, but not at the child&rsquo;s expense. The child must  be at the centre of any new policy, and the policy must fit in with children  and their parents. Of course, I understand that costs must be looked at and  that they are not an insignificant part of the policy, but the policy must be  child-led. Education is vital to any child&rsquo;s life, and we, as legislators, must  place children at the centre of any such policy. It therefore gives me great  pleasure to support the motion and the amendment.</p>
        <p class="TimePeriod">11.45 am</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hussey</strong>: I  welcome those from the Strabane area who are here to observe the debate. I  support my colleague Mr McNarry, and the other Members who have spoken, on the  need to review the home-to-school transport policy.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I have been corresponding for a while with the Education  Minister on this issue, and he educated me by advising me that the present  policy dates from 1996 and is contained in circular 1996/411, with minor  updating in September 2009. He also advised that to alter the eligibility  criteria to include pupils who live within the existing two- or three-mile  qualifying distance would significantly increase the cost of home-to-school  transport at a time when the education budget is under severe pressure. My  response was: what value would be put on a child&rsquo;s life?</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">You may not believe it, but many years ago I walked to  primary school from home through Omagh, across the main road with the  assistance of a patrol man or traffic lights; I could quite easily walk the two  miles there and back. I could not do that now, but that is a different story.  In Omagh we have footpaths, street lighting and traffic lights; we had them  even that long ago when I was a child &mdash; before anyone interrupts to say that.<span class="Italic"> [Laughter.]</span></p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I now ask you to picture the scene between Magheramason and  Bready, Donemana and Strabane, Artigarvan and Strabane, Ballymagorry and  Strabane, the Glebe and Strabane, and Killen and Castlederg. Those names may  mean very little to Members, but they mean an awful lot to the parents of  children who have suddenly found bus services removed. In the case of  Magheramason to Bready or from Ballymagorry, we are just short of two miles for  primary-school children and just short of three miles for secondary-school  children.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Once you leave Magheramason the footpath disappears in a  very short time and you are left with a grassy area. The grassed area runs  alongside the main A5, and to comply with pedestrian safety guidelines or the  &lsquo;Highway Code&rsquo;, you walk towards oncoming traffic, which can legitimately  travel at up to 60mph. If it is raining, you are walking on slippery grass,  keeping your head down to try to avoid the rain and being buffeted by the  pressure created by an articulated lorry thundering past. The case is similar  when you leave Ballymagorry and attempt to walk towards Strabane.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">In Londonderry, it has been decided that the bus service  can be withdrawn because the Peace Bridge is now open and children can walk to  Foyle and Londonderry College even though in inclement weather the bridge may  become a nightmare for pedestrians and at times may be closed.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Buchanan</strong>:  Does the Member agree that it is totally irrational that at the beginning of  this school term 130 children in the Strabane area and those areas that he  mentioned were told that they were no longer entitled to school transport  simply because of a merger between Strabane Grammar and Strabane High School?  Remember, that is an area with no footpaths or street lighting, and children  were being asked to walk to school on the busy A5 arterial route where, just a  few years ago, a local GP was killed as he cycled along.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hussey</strong>: I  thank the Member for his intervention. He makes the point clearly that the A5  is not a road for pedestrians or cyclists; it is an arterial route where  traffic will travel at up to 60mph. Picture the scene with a child attempting  to carry his schoolbag, head down, heading towards that road. A child could be  drawn under an articulated lorry, and I would not wish to see that at any time.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Glenmornan is a small rural school with windy roads that  make it a nightmare for children to attempt to walk to school, with two-way  traffic battling for control of the limited space available on a rural road.  With the withdrawal of certain services to the newly amalgamated Strabane  Academy, parents were left with a decision: pay approximately &pound;8 to send a  child to school by bus or walk them to school. The police at one stage  suggested that they would be prosecuted because by walking as a group they were  taking part in an illegal parade. Two to three miles may not seem a big deal  when walking up the leafy lanes around Parliament Buildings, but when you are  living in a rural area such as west Tyrone it can be quite a battle.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I mention the Children&rsquo;s Commissioner&rsquo;s report &lsquo;Safer  Journeys to School&rsquo;, which was produced in June 2006 in collaboration with the  Consumer Council and the Department for Regional Development. One of the  recommendations in that report was a review of the current statutory walking  distance for home-to-school transport to identify the impact that changes could  have on school transport provision. It also stated that, in order to help  achieve a modal shift, the current walking distances might need to be reduced  to make bus services attractive and viable for those who need them. On the  other hand, it stated that current walking distances might need to be increased  or removed and that provision could be based on household car ownership and/or  low household income in order to target need.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Michaela already made reference to the case of a parent of  three children: a baby, a toddler and a primary-school child. Her words to me  were, &ldquo;She has three weans, and she has to get them out to school in the  morning.&rdquo;</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Bring your remarks to a close, please.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hussey</strong>:  How does she do that? Would you like to see a five-year-old child walking to  primary school? I certainly would not.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  Thank you, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I welcome the opportunity to speak to the  motion and the amendment. Both should be supported. I assure you that I fully  agree that there is a need for an effective home-to-school transport policy. It  is on record that I have indicated to the Education Committee, in my  deliberations with it, that we need to examine every aspect of the arrangements  for home-to-school transport.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">It is worth noting that approximately 90,000 pupils were  transported to school this morning by some form of public transport. That is a  mammoth task undertaken every morning by the transport services of the boards.  However, we have to examine whether we are transporting the right children to  school and whether we are using our finances and resources efficiently. I make  that remark in the context of trying to identify savings that can be released  to support teaching and learning in classrooms.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McDevitt asked whether we should be celebrating the fact  that we have taken &pound;5 million out of the transport policy budget. It was the  right decision, because even a preliminary examination of transport costs shows  us that the &pound;75 million was not being used effectively or efficiently. We have  taken &pound;5 million off that, and I support that decision. That &pound;5 million was not  returned to the centre or the Finance Minister; it was reinvested in education  services in a more effective and efficient way.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Byrne</strong>:  How can the Minister definitively say that the education and library boards&rsquo;  transport departments are inefficient? What statistical analysis has been done?  I assure him that in the Western Education and Library Board area, the  transport service managed by the board is very efficient and its garages are  extremely efficient.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  This debate will be in Hansard. I suggest that, in several months&rsquo; time, when  the PEDU stage 2 reports are published, he returns to his comments. I assure  you that all the examinations of school transport have shown that it is not  being effectively or efficiently run. I also assure you that PEDU stage 2  reports will also show, when they are finally published, that our education  transport system is not being effectively or efficiently run. I am not prepared  to waste any money on this matter. My comments are evidence-based. The  examinations are not being carried out by my Department; they are being carried  out by officials from the Department of Finance and Personnel. The work of the  Education Committee and the knowledge in the Department of Education and among  Members here show that transport services are not being effectively or  efficiently run. So the Member&rsquo;s statement cannot be stood over in any way.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">It would be remiss of me not to say that Mr McNarry&rsquo;s  comments about boards and board members are completely unacceptable. No public  servant working for the Education Department or the Assembly has threatened  anyone. No board has threatened anyone, and the use of that language is not  helpful and does not assist any public servant in carrying out their work. What  is going on at the moment, as has been referred to by Mr Craig, which will have  an effect on school transport policy, is &mdash;</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  Will the Minister give way?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>: I  will give way briefly.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  You know that you are being given every assistance to deliver education in your  capacity as Minister. I will tread very warily, because the Speaker already  mentioned this in response to your previous objection. When I mentioned the  word &ldquo;threat&rdquo;, it was specific to one board. It was also specific to the fact that  your Department denied any knowledge of what I called a hit list. There is  something wrong, Minister, when your Department does not know what a board is  doing, and that is from where the word &ldquo;threat&rdquo; emanates.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  The Member has &mdash;</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  You are either in or out.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  The Member has refused to take the opportunity to withdraw his comments. I  think that that is a mistake and unfair on staff, who are public servants and  have to carry out a very difficult task. All Members, whether they accept it or  not, are aware of the practice that I have put in place to deal with our  unsustainable schools estate, and every Member agrees that we have an  unsustainable schools estate. To deal with that, action is required. Difficult  decisions will have to be taken, but no Member, including me as a  representative of Upper Bann, can seriously expect that all other  constituencies except their own will see school closures. That is neither a  sustainable nor a practical way forward. I appeal to Members to show leadership  on the matter and not to offer false hope where there is no hope. There are  instances in which Members are rallying to the flag &mdash;</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>: <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order, please. The Minister should resume his seat. I pointed out  yesterday and today that no Member should make any comments from a sedentary  position. If Members insist on doing so, they will not make a comment from any  position.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  Thank you, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Members are rallying to the flag of  convenience, seeking 15 minutes of fame, and their main focus is not where it  should be. It should be on the educational well-being of the young people whom  we are here to serve.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I will return to the motion. The viability audit that is  ongoing and the area planning review that will take place will have an effect  on our school transport policy, and rightly so. I think that both will have to  heed the other.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I have no intention of rushing into a short-term fix. A  full review of our transport services and policies across the areas is  required. We currently have five boards that, by and large, run similar  programmes. However, as Members also said, only three of the boards offer  concessionary seats. It is worthwhile putting on record exactly what a  concessionary seat is. It is a seat on a bus that is provided to transport  eligible children that may be made available to a child who is not eligible at  that time. The concessionary seat can be removed by the board at any time. That  causes difficulties when an eligible child needs that seat. It is worth noting  that only three of our boards carry out such a practice, while two do not.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I intend to look at our transport services and the planning  of education provision in every area. Both should support access to  high-quality education and the appropriate educational pathway that all  children and young people need. Transport needs to be kept in focus as part of  the need to identify savings. Any savings identified will be driven back into  the education service to ensure that the educational requirements of all our  young people are met in the schools that they attend.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">As I said to Mr Byrne, some work is already under way as a  result of the Executive agreement in July 2010 to exempt the education and  health sectors from the in-year Budget adjustments. It was agreed that DFP  would commission PEDU to undertake work on the scope for and delivery of  significant cost reductions across the two sectors. Stage 1 involved the  identification of broad areas in the education sector in which there appeared  to be scope to make savings, and transport was one of those areas. The evidence  was primarily in the form of unexplained variations in the cost of provision  from one board to another or unexplained changes in the cost of provision over  time.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The previous Minister requested that home-to-school  transport be examined further in stage 2 of the review. Work on that stage is  nearing completion, and the draft reports will be published by me and the  Minister of Finance and Personnel. Although the report will focus primarily on  the scope for improving efficiency and reducing costs in the existing policy  framework, I expect that it will also signal areas in which policy change could  yield further savings and produce a more rational system to complement a  strategically planned school system. I will want to consider those and other  areas carefully, and in the context of the wider financial climate, before  producing any proposals for change.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">As I have said, in the interim, a savings requirement of &pound;5  million was set for the ELBs for 2011-12, and those savings are to be achieved  through greater efficiency in operating home-to-school transport within  existing policy parameters. The scope for further work lies in the nature of  the existing policy and how services are delivered. Members will, I hope, bear  with me while I briefly account for those.</p>
        <p class="TimePeriod">12.00 noon</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Legislation obliges education and library boards to make  arrangements for the provision of transport and other provisions, subject to  the approval of those arrangements by the Department. The Department and the  boards must then have regard to the general principle that pupils shall be  educated in accordance with the wishes of their parents in so far as is  compatible with the avoidance of unrealistic public expenditure. The combined  effect of those obligations, which is outlined in the Department&rsquo;s circular on  home-to-school transport, is the provision of transport assistance for pupils  who qualify for it according to two criteria: distance and suitable school.  Pupils are essentially eligible for transport assistance if, within the  specified distance &mdash; two miles for a primary school child and three miles for a  post-primary school child &mdash; they may not attend a school of a suitable type and  so must travel further to attend one.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Department of Education recognises six types of  schools: controlled, integrated, Irish-medium, maintained, grammar and  non-denominational grammar. As I have said, 90,000 children are eligible for  that assistance. The form of assistance they receive &mdash; and this is key &mdash; is  determined by the five education and library boards, having regard to the need  to avoid unreasonable public expenditure. So, if Mr Clarke, who I understand  sits on an education and library board, believes that a change in services is required  in his area, the first port of call is the education and library board, and  that request for change of service should then be sent to the Department of  Education.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Boards must consider providing transport assistance through  one of the available forms of mass transport: Translink, board services or  private bus operators. Translink, comprising Ulsterbus, Metro and NI Railways,  has the widest network for providing transport assistance. Accordingly, 50,000  eligible pupils travel on Translink buses using a sessional ticket or bus pass.  Board services have the next widest network, primarily in rural areas and carry  27,000 pupils, and private bus operators carry approximately 7,500 pupils.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Translink provides two different forms of service. First,  it provides the stage carriage service, which is a public service that carries  adults and pupils. Secondly, it provides designated services or school buses.  Designated school buses are provided by Translink where there are a large  number of eligible and non-eligible pupils in one location, such as a town. A  significant proportion of the boards&rsquo; fleet of nearly 900 vehicles and most  private operated taxis are used to transport pupils with special educational  needs.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">When we look at the review, all those elements will have to  be examined. I await the vote of the Assembly on the motion and the amendment.  However, if they are passed by the Assembly, that would be welcome. If we are  to carry out a review of transport services, we have to look at them in their  entirety. The outcome of that review will have to ensure that we live within  the current budget of around &pound;70 million. So, the services proposed at the end  of the review will have to operate within that budget, and we will have to look  at the categories of school that we transport children to. Are Members prepared  for that challenge? Are they prepared to look at the challenge of  cross-departmental uses of transport services? Mr McDevitt suggested that we  have three different forms of public transport in some areas. That, in itself,  presents challenges, because if we adopt one of those transport services, two  will lose out. Therefore, at least two transport drivers will lose their post  as a result.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">So, whatever recommendations the review comes forward with,  they will present a challenge to us all to provide a transport service for  90,000 people. There is no quick fix or easy solution through the review of  transport services to our education system. We have to ensure that the outcome  of the review looks after those who are most needy in our society and young  people with special educational needs, and embraces the rights of rural  dwellers. We must provide a service that is cost-effective and delivers an  efficient service for our pupils, our schools and the public purse.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs McKevitt</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>: I  have nearly finished, and I want to finish with a number of points.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">We await the outcome of the vote and the recommendation of  the Assembly today. I will embrace a review of the transport service. I am more  than happy to report back to the Assembly on those recommendations and how we  carry them forward. I suspect that several will require legislative change,  which, in itself, will take time. However, difficult decisions will have to be  made by individual Members. Not all of it will be up to the Minister to carry  forward, although I have no difficulty in doing so. Individual Members will  have to decide where the priority for school transport rests and where they  want the limited budget available to the Department of Education and the  Executive to be spent. I am happy to carry out my role, but I suggest that  Members will be required to make decisions around the matter, too.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Agnew</strong>: I  thank the Minister and Members for supporting the amendment. A revised policy  that reduces bus services without providing safe alternatives has the potential  to be detrimental. An option that increases the cost to families and increases  the risk of death on our roads is not an acceptable alternative or an  acceptable way of saving money. In seeking to make savings, we cannot simply  pass the cost on to families. We would be doing with one hand what we are  trying to prevent with the other by tackling fuel poverty. The cost of the average  school run is about &pound;340 a year for a family using a private car as transport,  and that is predicted to go up to &pound;400 a year with rising fuel costs. I do not  think that that is an acceptable alternative.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Any new policy must have active travel at its core and  include targets to reduce the number of pupils travelling in cars and increase  the number of those cycling and walking. The statistics are pretty damming: 52%  of pupils travel to school by car. As Mr McDevitt pointed out, that is the  highest percentage of any region on these islands. Only 2% cycle to school,  compared with 50% in Denmark. I am not sure that we or our children are so  different, but the facilities and incentives that we apply to active travel are  different. We need school travel plans: 88% of schools in England have travel  plans, and 650 schools in the Republic of Ireland have green school travel  plans. Only nine schools in Northern Ireland have travel plans. Although it is  important for the Minister to conduct a review, we need to ensure that policies  get down to school and board level and that those travel plans are drawn up.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">There will be health benefits. As I said earlier, obesity  is a major problem. Significant numbers of our children are considered obese:  some 33% of two- to 10-year-olds are considered obese, with only one out of  seven children getting the required 60 minutes of exercise a day. There will  also be educational benefits: a 3&middot;4% improvement in test scores can be gained  by exercising for 15 minutes earlier in the day.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I call on the Education Minister to work with his colleague  the Minister for Regional Development to ensure the safe provision of  pedestrian and cycle routes to schools. He can ensure that our pupils are  trained in cycle safety skills and pedestrian safety; that school travel plans  are based on active school travel; and that the provision of cycle sheds is  compulsory, particularly in new capital builds. If he works with the Minister  for Regional Development, we can ensure that those pedestrian and cycle routes  are safe. Modest investment now can and will lead to long-term savings across  Departments.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Dobson</strong>:  I thank Members for their contributions and the Minister for his response.  Having called on the Department in June this year to review the guidelines on home-to-school  transport, I am pleased that we are having the opportunity to debate the issue  in the House today.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The provision of home-to-school transport is a vital  lifeline to the thousands of students who use the service daily. It is  especially important to those students with special educational needs who  benefit so much from attending their schools. The Department of Education,  quite rightly, has a duty to provide transportation for students to and from  their schools, and there are many examples of good practice from Translink  drivers and, indeed, private bus and taxi companies. However, the needs of our  children have outgrown the 15-year-old legislation. Although the overall number  of pupils being transported has decreased on average by 8% since the 2004-05  academic year, the average cost for the transport has increased by some 17&middot;6%  in the same timescale. Therefore, the legislation needs to be reviewed.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">In my constituency of Upper Bann, I have been contacted by  a number of concerned parents about SEN students travelling to and from schools  in taxis that are overcrowded. That is an issue that may very well affect all  our constituencies and raise serious health and safety concerns. The  consequences of an accident occurring when children do not have access to a  seatbelt are too horrific to contemplate. We have all seen the television  adverts that graphically highlight the issue in adults, but it would be  abhorrent to think that in being transported to and from their schools, our  young children were being put in danger.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">People who live and work in rural communities know how  dangerous country roads can be. It only takes someone to be travelling too fast  on a twisty road to cause an accident, and I fear for children who may not be  properly protected if such an accident were to occur.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome that random inspections are carried out by the  boards and the Department of the Environment for Translink and private bus and  taxi companies. However, I know that parents and teaching and non-teaching  staff employed at schools would welcome more information as to how they can  report health and safety concerns directly to the boards via school principals.  That would aid the targeting of inspections, which would result in a greater  degree of public accountability for the home-to-school service and, ultimately,  the safer transport of our children.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">As part of my winding-up speech, Mr Speaker, I will draw  attention to Members&rsquo; valuable contributions. In particular, Mr Hussey made a  good point about the importance of home-to-school transport in rural areas. He  highlighted dangers such as the lack of proper footpaths or street lighting  and, of course, the fact that the distances to and from schools in rural areas  are obviously longer and more dangerous than they are in our towns. I can  certainly imagine the Member crossing the main road in Omagh with a schoolbag  over his shoulder. That is quite a vivid image from today. Mr Hussey also asked  what price we placed on the life of a child, which is a very serious point.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Members also raised the following important points. Steven  Agnew urged that money be spent wisely, and he spoke about the benefits of  sustainable transport. He also urged that any review focus on cost and safety,  and he urged co-operation on the issue at Executive level to improve health and  the environment.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Mervyn Storey reminded the House that the Committee has  discussed the issue, and, quite rightly, he described it as vital. He also  highlighted the 75% increase in the cost of transporting SEN students in the  Belfast Board.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">My colleague David McNarry reminded us of the importance of  the issue and highlighted that 110,000 students are transported via the scheme.  He also said that if rural schools are closed, the Minister must be responsible  for the financial consequences of his actions. Such closures may result in an  increased demand for home-to-school transport.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Phil Flanagan highlighted the &pound;75 million that the Assembly  spends annually on home-to-school transport, and he pointed towards potential  savings.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Conall McDevitt supported the motion. He said that half our  pupils travel to school by car and that few use public transport. He welcomed  the call from the Chairman of the Committee for Education to limit  inefficiencies. He also said that the lack of a connection between the  different transport agencies heightens public expenditure.</p>
        <p class="TimePeriod">12.15 pm</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Trevor Lunn described how, because of the two-mile and  three-mile rules, some children who live on the same street qualify for the  scheme while others do not. He also said that safety should form a greater part  of the consideration of that issue.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Jonathan Craig welcomed the opportunity to sort out the  issue and gave many valid reasons why the issue has remained unresolved to  date. He also outlined the practicalities of the rationalisation of schools. He  talked about students having difficulty finding suitable places and highlighted  how that will impact on the home-to-school transport scheme.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Michaela Boyle referred to school transport in Strabane,  which is a contentious issue because of the withdrawal of the service. She  detailed the concerns of many about the rise in the cost of home-to-school  transport.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Other Members also made valuable contributions. They  highlighted the issues of safety and cost and suggested that the needs of  children be placed at the heart of any review.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the Minister for his response and for echoing many  of the views raised in the House. I welcome his assurances that he will conduct  a review of home-to-school transport. I trust that, in that review, he will address  the issue of half-empty buses, which came up time and again during the debate.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">If one thing is to come out of the debate today, let a  review of the policy identify that parents, teaching and non-teaching staff  should be made more aware that a mechanism for the reporting of health and  safety concerns exists. They should be made aware that they can easily use that  mechanism to report clear breaches that put our children&rsquo;s lives in danger. If  more people are aware that such a mechanism exists, those who place children in  danger may alter their practice, and the fear of losing a contract may be  enough to ensure that all of our young children travel safely. To that end, I  wrote to the Minister this morning to ask him to detail the number of private  companies that have been reported, and, as a result of random and targeted  inspections, were no longer being used by his Department.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Once again, I thank all Members who contributed to the  debate. I commend the motion and the amendment to the House.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question, That the amendment be made, put and agreed  to.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Main Question, as amended, put and agreed to.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
        <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly notes the importance of an effective  home-to-school transport policy; believes that the current policy is outdated;  and calls on the Minister of Education to work with the Minister for Regional  Development to create an holistic and sustainable school transport policy which  will ensure that school transport is provided in the most cost-effective,  efficient and safe manner.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Business Committee has arranged to meet immediately upon the  lunchtime suspension. I propose, therefore, by leave of the Assembly, to  suspend the sitting until 2.00 pm, when the next item of business will be  Question Time.</p>

        <p class="OralAnswers-H1Heading"><a name="3"></a>Oral Answers to Questions</p>
        <p class="OralAnswers-H2DepartmentHeading">Health, Social Services and Public  Safety</p>
        <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">NHS: Plastic Surgery</p>
        <p class="OralAnswers-Question">1. <strong>Mr  Kinahan </strong>asked the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety  what proportion of plastic surgery carried out in the health service is done  for cosmetic reasons. (AQO 516/11-15<a name="AQO516/11-15" id="AQO516/11-15"></a>)</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots (The  Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety)</strong>: I can advise that  no plastic surgery is carried out by the health service in Northern Ireland for  purely cosmetic reasons. Current policy on plastic surgery is contained in the  document &lsquo;A Policy to Make Best Use of Resources in Plastic Surgery and Related  Specialities&rsquo;, which was developed in 2006 by the four legacy health boards.  That document sets clear clinical criteria for a range of routine, non-urgent  procedures. Patients who do not meet the criteria are not referred for surgery.  The Department has asked the Health and Social Care Board to review that  guidance in 2011-12. That will promote discussion on both the physical and  psychological criteria to be used in decision-making. Clearly, hard choices  will have to be made and interventions of low clinical value may not routinely  be available on the health service.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kinahan</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his answer. He has already touched on my supplementary  question in his reference to the review of the guidelines. Will the review look  at whether more plastic surgery procedures that involve a hospital stay can be  carried out by consultant dermatologists in day surgery?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  Clearly, we want to see as many procedures as possible carried out in day  surgery. Day surgery potentially has fewer problems for the patient, a lesser  potential for cross-contamination or infection and is also much more cost  effective. For all those reasons, it is our desire to reduce the number of  overnight stays and have a greater number of day surgery procedures take place.  Any efforts made on that front will help.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Boyle</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for his  responses. How many of those procedures involve gastric band surgery?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  Not many of those procedures involve gastric band surgery. The present Health  and Social Care (HSC) Board does not routinely commission bariatric surgery,  and we are looking at that. Bariatric surgery has huge potential and is  extensively used in some other areas, although it is not without problems. We  have been carrying out a pilot and reviewing its results. There is evidence  that, even after bariatric surgery, some people return to eating habits that  lead to them becoming morbidly obese. However, other evidence indicates that it  reverses diabetes, and that it is the only type of intervention that does. It  certainly has pluses, but also some minuses.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms P Bradley</strong>:  What actions have been taken to identify treatments that are or have become  inappropriate for provision by the National Health Service?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  Plastic surgery is very important. It is of huge benefit particularly to people  who have had serious burns or suffered trauma incidents. We must use our  resources wisely, and we have to give fairly broad consideration to a number of  areas. For example, breast augmentation may have to be carried out to correct  congenital conditions such as amastia or endocrine abnormalities, etc. However,  they should not always be carried out on the National Health Service.  Similarly, eyelid surgery may be performed to remove excess skin on the upper  eyelids that results from the ageing process if it starts to interfere with  vision or the function of the eyelids, but it should not necessarily be  provided on the National Health Service if it is only to enhance appearance.  Therefore there are areas where judgement calls have to be made. The report  will help surgeons to ascertain what should and should not be done.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr McDonnell</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his answers. We could spend all day debating the merits  or otherwise of plastic surgery. You recently mentioned restricting caesarean  section procedures. How do you compare the two procedures? Is plastic surgery  an option for cutting? Could optional plastic surgery procedures be reduced  instead of caesarean sections?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  There is certainly plenty of cutting in plastic surgery, but, as for cutting  plastic surgery, 85% of procedures are done purely on a clinical basis, and  there is a question mark over whether the remaining 15% are done purely for  clinical or cosmetic purposes. Surgeons could do with some clarification in  those areas. Therefore, it is down to the personal choice of individuals. If  they wish to pay for a cosmetic service, it is open for them to do so  privately; however, it is not necessarily something that we should do on the  National Health Service.</p>
        <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Pharmacy</p>
        <p class="OralAnswers-Question">2. <strong>Mr  Dallat </strong>asked the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety how  his Department intends to deal with the pressure put on service delivery  resulting from the cuts to the pharmacy budget. (AQO 517/11-15<a name="AQO517/11-15" id="AQO517/11-15"></a>)</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: As  I advised the House on 19 September, the Department recognises that it has an  obligation to provide fair and reasonable remuneration for community pharmacy.  In January 2010, the High Court found that the arrangements in place at that  time did not meet that obligation. Thereafter, the Department and the HSC Board  engaged in extensive negotiations with Community Pharmacy Northern Ireland  (CPNI) in an attempt to reach agreement on community pharmacy arrangements in  2011-12. However, agreement could not be reached.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">New arrangements were introduced with effect from 1 April  2011 to meet my Department&rsquo;s statutory obligation to provide fair and  reasonable remuneration. CPNI has brought forward a judicial review challenge  to renew remuneration and reimbursement arrangements. Against that background,  it would be inappropriate for me to comment further on community pharmacy  remuneration until the outcome of the hearing is known. However, I do not  accept the assertions that are being made by CPNI, and I assure Members that I  am committed, as required by law, to provide a fair and reasonable system of  remuneration to community pharmacists in Northern Ireland.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dallat</strong>:  No doubt, the Minister will be aware that up to 80% of small towns and villages  in England no longer have pharmacies. If the cuts continue and rural pharmacies  close, what plans does he have to protect the most vulnerable people living in  rural areas?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  Pharmacists have a key role in delivering healthcare, particularly in our rural  towns and villages. Unfortunately, however, I inherited a legacy arrangement  that was subsequently challenged through judicial review. Therefore, I have not  been able to involve myself in arriving at an arrangement that will help us to  ensure that we have pharmacies in rural areas and in many deprived areas in our  cities. We have a pharmacy system that does not lead to the extensive costs  that we currently have, because costs have been going up year on year and have  got to the point where they are unsustainable. Therefore we need to challenge  the cost structure in our pharmacies.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Gildernew</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Is the Minister aware that at  least one pharmacy in Rasharkin has closed and that another in Dunloy is on the  verge of closure? Pharmacies from Belcoo right across the North are ready to  close their doors thereby doing away with a valuable community service, not  only in rural areas &mdash; although I take the point that the questioner raised &mdash;  but in areas of social deprivation as well. Does the Minister accept that you  cannot impose an English model on the Six Counties because it will not work? It  will be a disaster not only for our communities but for businesses that are  struggling to keep their doors open in a very harsh funding environment?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: I  recognise that Northern Ireland is not London. In the English model, the  prescribing cost is &pound;169&middot;13 per head of population. In Northern Ireland, it is  &pound;244&middot;67. Wales and Scotland, which are not dissimilar to Northern Ireland in  that they have some large urban areas as well as being strongly rural, have costs  of &pound;192 and &pound;195 respectively. Therefore, as far as pharmacy is concerned, one  can see that we are not getting good value for money in Northern Ireland as  things stand. We need to do better. Whether the current arrangements are the  correct ones is being tested in court. Therefore, I cannot comment on them.  However, I can say, clearly and unequivocally, that, irrespective of the  court&rsquo;s findings, I am happy to engage with pharmacists as soon as the court  case is over to arrive at a position that delivers a good quality service for  the people of Northern Ireland and provides sustainable pharmacies for the  future.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Campbell</strong>:  My question is further to that precise point. People understand the legal  situation and the position in which it puts the Minister until it is resolved.  Will he give an undertaking that as soon as the situation is resolved, there  will be intensive discussions in order to try to take matters forward so that  community pharmacies and the people whom they serve will best benefit from the outcome?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: I  give that undertaking, and would have done so prior to the court case had  Community Pharmacy NI been prepared to drop the judicial review and allow  negotiations to take place in good faith. I do not think that pharmacists are  being well represented by going through with that particular court case. There  was preparedness on my part and on that of the Department to engage in  reasonable negotiations to arrive at a reasonable outcome. It has been  particularly punitive on smaller pharmacists and those that operate in more  rural areas and are almost wholly dependent on prescription fees.  Unfortunately, I believe that some of the larger pharmacies have driven that  particular court case. It is not to the good of the population of Northern Ireland  nor, indeed, to small pharmacies.</p>
        <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Economy: Health Sector</p>
        <p class="OralAnswers-Question">3. <strong>Mr  Newton </strong>asked the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety what  action is being taken to harness the potential of the health sector to  contribute to growing the economy. (AQO 518/11-15<a name="AQO518/11-15" id="AQO518/11-15"></a>)</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: I  believe that there is considerable potential for the health sector to  contribute to economic growth. I have given priority to disease prevention and  having a strong public health agenda, which should lead to a healthier and more  productive workforce. There is scope for research and development in the health  and life sciences sectors to have benefits both for patient outcomes and  attracting inward investment and assisting development of local business. My  Department is working with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment  (DETI) on the application of e-health technologies here, including using  technology to provide healthcare remotely.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The health and social care sector is also involved, along  with the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, in the RAFAEL  project, centred in the north-west, to encourage and support local food  producers and processors to compete for business in the public sector,  specifically in hospitals and schools. As an employer, both directly and through  significant capital investment, the health service is a major contributor to  the local economy.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Newton</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his question. It is good to know that the health service  is moving in a direction in which it can make a contribution to the economy.  Does the Minister believe that there is further potential to expand the type of  relationship that he has described both with DETI and Invest Northern Ireland?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: I  have been working closely with Minister Foster on a range of those issues. It  is our intention to develop a memorandum of understanding between my Department  and DETI&rsquo;s Invest NI to take forward a health-and-wealth agenda. It is my  intention to move things forward considerably next week, as we visit Boston,  and we are working closely with Invest NI to develop that particular agenda.  Northern Ireland is very well placed to bring jobs to the area through the life  sciences sector. The greater the degree of co-operation that takes place  between the two Departments and Invest Northern Ireland, the greater the  potential to bring significant job benefits to Northern Ireland as a result.</p>
        <p class="TimePeriod">2.15 pm</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Copeland</strong>:  Will the Minister detail the amount of money received from the Government of  the Irish Republic last year in return for our National Health Service&rsquo;s  treating its citizens?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: It  is very simple, even though the question is slightly off the subject: we get  full reimbursement for whatever treatments are carried out. I see the new  hospital in Fermanagh and indeed the facilities at Altnagelvin and Daisy Hill  as creating opportunities to provide healthcare to people from the Republic of  Ireland, to be paid for by the Republic of Ireland, and to assist us in  sustaining and enhancing services in Northern Ireland.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I regard that as a win-win situation. I do not see any  underlying political connotations that are bad for the people of Northern  Ireland. I see significant benefits of the new facilities, such as the hospital  being erected in the south-west of the Province, as they will provide a greater  level of service for all the people in the area.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Flanagan</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I would like to tease out further  information on the RAFAEL project. Given that a number of reports indicate that  older people who go into hospital are more likely to be malnourished than other  patients, and that the RAFAEL project has assisted greatly in that regard, does  the Minister have any plans to expand the project from the north-west to right  across the Six Counties?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: We  must have a starting point. At the outset, we look at the success of what has  happened, and we then make judgements on how to expand. We will deal with that  in due course, once we have a better understanding of the project&rsquo;s success or  otherwise.</p>
        <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Mental Health</p>
        <p class="OralAnswers-Question">4. <strong>Mr  McCarthy </strong>asked the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety  what measures his Department will be taking forward to reduce the stigma  associated with mental health issues. (AQO 519/11-15<a name="AQO519/11-15" id="AQO519/11-15"></a>)</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: A  new public information campaign Under the Surface was launched on 6 October.  That campaign aims to de-stigmatise mental illness and raise awareness of the  early warning signs and symptoms. In addition, the Public Health Agency will  continue to deliver training programmes and community-focused mental health  awareness programmes that aim to increase the understanding of mental illness.  The reduction of the stigma associated with mental illness will be a priority  in the new mental health and well-being promotion strategy being developed. An  improved understanding of mental health issues will encourage people to seek  help before problems escalate.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his response. Does he agree that, unless the  Department and wider society address the stigma fully, people with mental  health conditions cannot have proper equality of access to the full range of  services and opportunities in line with the Bamford review and, moreover, that,  as a consequence, our economy will suffer through absences from work and the  loss of productivity?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: At  any one time, one in six adults in the UK has a mental health condition.  Therefore, if stigmatisation is happening, we are stigmatising an awful lot of  the population. The Department wishes to challenge the stigmatisation of mental  health. We wish to give the lead on that issue, and that is what we are doing.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Evidence suggests that Northern Ireland&rsquo;s levels of  psychiatric morbidity are up to 25% higher than those in the rest of the UK and  that poor mental health affects almost 300,000 people in Northern Ireland. We  cannot ignore poor mental health. We cannot write people off as a consequence  of mental health issues. Early intervention and prevention can bring major  benefits to the individuals concerned and to Northern Ireland and its economy.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dunne</strong>:  What does the Minister hope will be the impact of the mental health services  framework?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  The mental health services framework, which we launched on Monday, can have significant  benefits. It can identify treatment paths and assist us in engaging in early  interventions. It also gives strong guidance to people who provide mental  health services on how they should respond.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">At that event, I listened to a carer and to someone who had  been in the mental health system, and I found their views on how mental health  problems have been treated in the past very challenging and certainly not  satisfactory.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brady</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Does the Minister recognise the  excellent work carried out by Home-Start in supporting families and children,  thus helping to prevent mental illness?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  Yes, I do. I believe that Home-Start has a very useful purpose and I would like  it to be able to continue to provide that service. I think that the next  question is about funding. That money was dealt with specifically under the  children&rsquo;s fund, and my Department did not have that money to continue with. It  is somewhat unfortunate that, last year, the funding was discontinued for that  project. I was not in a position this year to reinstate that, given the  financial circumstances we are in.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  The Minister will probably be aware that yesterday was world mental health day.  My colleague Mr McCrea and his colleague junior Minister Bell marked that event  by riding bicycles around Belfast in the soaking rain. Does the Minister agree  that such events play an important role in reducing stigma and raising the  profile of this important issue?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  Yes; I think events such as Mr McCrea and Mr Bell riding bicycles in the rain  are of significant benefit to the rest of us.<span class="Italic"> [Laughter.]</span></p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Nonetheless, I will not treat this issue glibly. It is  important to highlight concerns about the stigmatisation of mental health. It  is important for others to step up to the mark and say that it is wrong to  stigmatise it, that there is help out there and that we all have some role. It  will affect virtually everyone&rsquo;s families at one stage or another. Many young  women have postnatal depression and so forth. One in four of our over-65s has  depression. There are so many cases that will affect nearly every family in  Northern Ireland. It is important that we all assist in de-stigmatising mental  health issues and depression, and that we work with the authorities and trusts  to ensure that the right service provision is there to provide the right  quality of care for those individuals.</p>
        <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Cancer Drugs</p>
        <p class="OralAnswers-Question">5. <strong>Mr T  Clarke </strong>asked the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety what  plans he has to improve access to newly developed cancer drugs. (AQO 520/11-15<a name="AQO520/11-15" id="AQO520/11-15"></a>)</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  The development of new technologies in medicines is continually advancing and  bringing new ways of treating cancer. I want to improve access to such  interventions when there is robust evidence to support their introduction here.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I recently approved a new process that will reduce the time  it takes to endorse National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence  (NICE) guidance for use in Northern Ireland. Although approximately &pound;22 million  is recurrently spent on cancer medicines here, there are, nonetheless,  significant costs associated with the introduction of new medicines and  treatments. Clearly, some hard choices will have to be made as we cannot fund  all new interventions, but I am currently exploring options to increase the  resources available to fund access to specialist medicines and interventions,  including those for cancer.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr T Clarke</strong>:  I thank the Minister for that answer. Will he give the House an assurance that,  where possible, the money will be found so that those drugs can be made  available to those who are suffering from cancer? That may be the only hope  they have. Will he update the House on progress on the cancer services  framework?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  NICE has approved a range of drugs to treat cancer that are currently not  available in Northern Ireland. Particularly when we are talking about people  who have cancer, which is an illness that can lead to their early death, and  when we are talking about other drugs that can help people to absolutely  transform their lives, we have a responsibility. We have a mechanism that tests  those costs against the outcomes. When that has been tested, as it has by NICE,  we have a responsibility to respond.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Unfortunately, that is not currently the case in Northern  Ireland. It is an issue that I wish to address positively. I want to deliver on  that and ensure that people in Northern Ireland who have cancer are not left in  a worse situation than those in other parts of the United Kingdom. Those with  cancer in Northern Ireland must not be second-class citizens.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Overend</strong>:  Will the Minister consider the creation of a special cancer drugs fund in his  budget to fast-track treatments outside the normal NICE regulatory process?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  There is such a fund in England. However, I think that we need to play catch-up  in the first instance and deliver on the NICE drugs. It will get to the point  where we will have some challenging decisions to make. There are big questions  for the House: do we not fund those drugs because of the current financial  restraints, or do we find a way of funding them? Do we introduce fresh income  into the Department, or do we strip income from something else? Those are the  testing questions in front of me. I feel morally obliged to provide those  drugs, and I want to resolve that issue.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  I acknowledge the Minister&rsquo;s very sympathetic and thoughtful approach to this  matter. Bone marrow donations relate to the treatment of cancer. Has the  Minister any measures or support mechanisms in place to increase such  donations?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  Bone marrow donations can certainly be of significant benefit and are carried  out regularly to assist people who have cancer. We are constantly trying to  raise the general public&rsquo;s awareness of how they can become involved and  seeking to get more people to donate bone marrow. It has been demonstrated in  quite a number of, though not all, cases that donated bone marrow can be of  considerable benefit to people suffering from cancer. It can help in the  recovery process and in beating cancer, and I want to use every element of the  armoury that exists to that end.</p>
        <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Suicide</p>
        <p class="OralAnswers-Question">6. <strong>Mr Weir </strong>asked the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety what action  he has taken to address the issue of suicide. &nbsp;(AQO 521/11-15<a name="AQO521/11-15" id="AQO521/11-15"></a>)</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: I  am very concerned that the local suicide rate continues to rise despite the  strenuous suicide prevention efforts made over the past five years. Actions  that I have taken include the ring-fencing of &pound;6&middot;7 million of funding for  2011-12; consultation with community and voluntary support groups; the launch  of a new public information campaign on mental health and suicide prevention,  Under the Surface; meeting other Ministers and suicide prevention experts from  the USA to consider new and innovative ideas; and ongoing discussions with the  health and social care sector to progress actions such as places of safety. The  learning from those actions will be reflected in the forthcoming updated  Protect Life strategy.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his response. Will he indicate how the community and  voluntary sector can help to stem the tide of suicide in Northern Ireland?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  The community and voluntary sector plays a key role. It has a tremendous amount  of goodwill. Indeed, in the Colin area, the community and voluntary sector was  instrumental in positively challenging the number of deaths from suicide. I  would like to look at how we can extend similar activities to other areas and  provide more training for people in the voluntary sector so that they can  assist us in providing counselling services for those with suicidal tendencies.  I would like to do that in conjunction with developing safe places in  hospitals, close to hospitals or in facilities that people with suicidal  tendencies can easily access.</p>

        <p class="OralAnswers-H2DepartmentHeading"><a name="4"></a>Justice</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I advise Members that question 1 has been withdrawn.</p>
        <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Antisocial Behaviour</p>
        <p class="OralAnswers-Question">2. <strong>Mr Weir </strong>asked the Minister of Justice what new initiatives his Department intends  to introduce to combat antisocial behaviour. &nbsp;(AQO 532/11-15<a name="AQO532/11-15" id="AQO532/11-15"></a>)</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford (The  Minister of Justice)</strong>: Tackling antisocial behaviour is a key priority for  my Department. A graduated response of prevention, intervention and enforcement  has contributed to a 20% reduction in antisocial behaviour since 2008. I am  determined to build on that success and support communities to address the  issues that matter locally. At a regional level, the response has included  initiatives such as CCTV, community safety wardens, neighbourhood watch  schemes, inter-generational projects and youth diversion programmes. Community  safety partnerships across Northern Ireland have, in consultation with local  communities, identified specific types of antisocial behaviour that are of  concern to their local areas, and they have delivered initiatives to help  address those concerns.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Members will know that earlier this year I consulted on a  new community safety strategy and met groups across Northern Ireland to listen to  views on our approach to addressing antisocial behaviour and on how we can best  support local communities. The responses to the consultation broadly supported  that graduated approach, focusing on early intervention and prevention,  recognising the need for effective enforcement where required. The consultation  also highlighted the role of the voluntary and community sectors, in  partnership with statutory agencies, in addressing antisocial behaviour. My  officials are in discussions with key stakeholders to develop the final  community safety strategy, taking account of the views raised during the  consultation process. I aim to publish a new community safety strategy by the  end of this year.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his response. Given the widespread public concern about  antisocial behaviour, will he give an assurance that, when he implements any  youth justice strategy, combating antisocial behaviour will be the cornerstone  of any actions that are taken in that field?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  can assure the Member that the issue is being taken seriously. The youth  justice strategy is not particularly concentrating on antisocial behaviour,  because that is covered predominantly by the community safety strategy.  However, we should also recognise the successes that have been achieved against  the target of a 15% reduction over three years. We have actually seen a 20%  reduction, which is clearly a sign that the different agencies and the  non-governmental organisations concerned are working together well.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms J McCann</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for his  answer. In considering any future community safety strategy, will he recognise,  first, the importance of people who are directly affected by antisocial  activity and are victims of it, and, secondly, the input that the wider  community can have in formulating any such strategy? How does his Department  see that process happening?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  agree with Ms McCann about the vital necessity &mdash; not just the importance &mdash; of  ensuring the widest possible involvement in developing the strategy. That is  why the Department arranged a significant number of public events across  Northern Ireland, several of which I attended. There were many meetings with  specific groups representing particular interests, and that is why we have had  a detailed and full response to the consultation exercise in general, which, I  believe, will mean that the views of every part of the community are fully  taken on board.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Overend</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his answers. Will he explain what he proposes to do,  or is doing, to encourage people in the community to come forward with  information to the PSNI that would help build a case against those who carry  out antisocial behaviour?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: It  is incumbent not just on me but on every Member of the Assembly, and anyone  else with influence, to ensure that we encourage people with any information  about crimes or antisocial behaviour to come forward to assist the police and  to ensure that the perpetrators are dealt with appropriately.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr McDonnell</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his answers. He has touched on the consultation with  local communities, but will any new initiatives to curb antisocial behaviour be  presented to the local police, district policing partnerships or community  safety partnerships (CSPs) before they are introduced in local areas?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>:  That is part of the key direction of the Department. The issue, frankly, is  that the Department is open to assisting, whether through CSPs or the new  partnerships, in whatever can be done that is seen potentially to deliver  locally. It is also open to assisting in good practice being taken from one  district to another. However, it is not about the Department directing things  from the top down but about encouraging local people to find local solutions  and assisting them in doing so.</p>
        <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Parades</p>
        <p class="OralAnswers-Question">3. <strong>Mr  Humphrey </strong>asked the Minister of Justice how many illegal republican parades  have been held over the past three years and how many people have been  convicted as a result. &nbsp;(AQO 533/11-15<a name="AQO533/11-15" id="AQO533/11-15"></a>)</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: The  Police Service has advised that figures on illegal parades are available only  from July 2009. Records show that, since then, there have been nine illegal  republican parades. The Public Prosecution Service has advised that 25  individuals have been charged. No one has yet been convicted in relation to  those parades, as the cases have yet to come to court. Decisions on prosecutions  are pending in a further 23 cases.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Humphrey</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his reply. Does he agree with me that the Parades Commission  in Northern Ireland is now discredited and that it is part of the problem, not  the solution, and, quite frankly, should be abolished?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: No,  I do not agree with the Member. The management of the Parades Commission is a  matter for the Northern Ireland Office, or indeed, the Office of the First  Minister and deputy First Minister, of course, if it were to come forward with  agreed alternative proposals.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCartney</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Gabham bu&iacute;ochas leis an Aire as a  fhreagra. I thank the Minister for his answer. Will he give us the statistics  on the number of people who have been arrested and charged for recent rioting  in north Antrim, east Belfast and north Belfast?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: The  answer at this stage is that I do not have the figures available. However, I  will write to the Member about them.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs McKevitt</strong>:  Does the Minister agree that the Parades Commission offers the most effective and  fair way of dealing with contentious parades?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  think, Mr Deputy Speaker, that I will duck the opportunity to repeat what I  just said to Mr Humphrey. The issue of parading is clearly one of significant  contention. The responsibility at the moment for the Parades Commission lies  with the Northern Ireland Office. That is the only arrangement that is  currently in place. Whether it is the best or the only method is not the issue;  the issue is the institution that is currently in operation. Certainly, the  institutions of the Department of Justice are committed to working with the  Parades Commission to ensure that parading proceeds as well as can be arranged.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Cree</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his answer. Will he explain whether there is a  repetitive pattern in the parades in question? Is he satisfied that the  penalties are adequate to deal with the problem?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: It  is a little bit difficult to say whether the penalties are adequate, given  that, although 25 people have been charged, which I just said, none of those  cases has come to court. However, the issue of penalties is one that has to be  carried through by the courts. It will be for the Assembly to decide whether it  wishes to increase penalties on the basis of experience.</p>
        <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Human Trafficking</p>
        <p class="OralAnswers-Question">4. <strong>Mr  Hussey </strong>asked the Minister of Justice what action he is taking to deal with  the growing prevalence of human trafficking. &nbsp;(AQO 534/11-15<a name="AQO534/11-15" id="AQO534/11-15"></a>)</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: As  Minister of Justice and chair of the Organised Crime Task Force (OCTF)  stakeholder group, I am committed to seeing that all reasonable measures are  taken to tackle that appalling crime and ensure that the victims have the  support that they need. The PSNI and other partners in OCTF have undertaken a  number of co-ordinated intelligence-led operations. Those will continue, as  will the ongoing cross-border co-operation between the PSNI and an Garda  S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Our approach is twofold: first, to rescue the victims of human  trafficking and support them in a safe environment; and secondly, to put the traffickers  before the courts.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hussey</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his response. I presume that you are referring to the  police Operation Pentameter 1 and Operation Pentameter 2. Will the Minister  outline what steps he is taking to ensure that the scale of the problem of  human trafficking is properly investigated and known?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  am not sure that I can do much other than take the statistics as they emerge  from the police and the other agencies that are concerned with dealing with  that dreadful crime. It is certainly an issue for the Department that we are  seeking to reduce rather than merely assess. We have run the Blue Blindfold  campaign twice, for example, to emphasise the significance of human  exploitation, and we are doing all that we can to remind people that those who  are currently making use of prostitution are, in many cases, supporting the  exploitation of people who have been trafficked. That is why we are encouraging  and assisting the relevant agencies in all the work that they do. We have seen  significant successes in the past couple of years, but there is clearly still  an ongoing problem both within Northern Ireland and to or from other regions of  these islands.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Agnew</strong>: I  thank the Minister for permitting two of his officials to attend the meeting of  the all-party group on ethnic minority communities today. That meeting  addressed the issue of human trafficking.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Given that sex workers are often the victims of human  trafficking, what work is he doing to ensure that the policy focus is on enforcement  towards those who avail themselves of the services and create the demand for  sex workers, rather than the sex workers themselves?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: Mr  Agnew raises an extremely serious position. Like so much else in organised  crime, trafficking and exploitation of individuals would not happen if there  were not a demand created for them. The Department is working on a policy on  prostitution and, this week, hosted a seminar on the issue. I hope that, later  this year, we will publish specific conclusions and proposals on addressing the  range of issues. Mr Agnew&rsquo;s point on the victimisation of those who work in  prostitution will be taken on board.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr I McCrea</strong>:  Given the international dimension to human trafficking, have international  links with other police forces been established? Will the Minister again  confirm that his Department is addressing the issue with the priority that it  deserves?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: As  for prioritisation, I can confirm only that, when I chair the regular meetings  of the OCTF stakeholder group, the issue of human exploitation features at  every meeting. The OCTF brings together a range of organisations, including the  Serious Organised Crime Agency, the UK Border Agency and the Police Service,  and subgroups work on a cross-border basis. From recent court cases, there is  clear evidence of co-operation between the PSNI and police forces across the UK  and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. I am not sure whether Mr McCrea was asking specifically  about structures. The practical working relationships are at an extremely high  level.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lo</strong>: I was  in the same meeting as Steven, who mentioned the presentation from a number of  Department of Justice officials and the police, who told us about the many  initiatives.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: May we have a question, please?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lo</strong>: Yes,  I am coming to that. I understand from the presentation that the British  Government are in the process of ratifying the EU directive on human  trafficking.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Will the Member ask the question, please?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lo</strong>: Does  the Minister anticipate that any legislation or policies will come out of  Northern Ireland to comply with the new directive?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: As  I understand it, the initial position of the UK Government was that they would  not ratify the EU directive. That position has now been reversed by the Home  Office. My officials have been in discussion with the Home Office, and,  undoubtedly, we will implement whatever is required. At this stage, I am not  sure whether that will involve legislative change or merely administrative  change, but I make a commitment that the Department of Justice will do all that  is needed to ensure that we remain at the top of the European league in dealing  with this dreadful problem.</p>
        <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Police Ombudsman: Payments</p>
        <p class="OralAnswers-Question">5. <strong>Mr  McMullan </strong>asked the Minister of Justice to detail the overall amount in  salary, expenses, and other financial contributions that his Department expects  to pay to the Police Ombudsman between 1 September 2011 and 1 June 2012,  including the amount for any special severance arrangement. &nbsp;(AQO 535/11-15<a name="AQO535/11-15" id="AQO535/11-15"></a>)</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: The  overall amount in salary, expenses and other financial contributions that my  Department expects to pay to the Police Ombudsman between 1 September 2011 and  1 June 2012 is &pound;133,000. That is made up as follows: gross pay of &pound;96,000;  pension of &pound;24,000; housing allowance of &pound;9,000; and &pound;4,000 in flights. There  has been no discussion of any severance arrangements following Al Hutchinson&rsquo;s  decision to leave office on 1 June 2012.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McMullan</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for his  answer. When he met the Police Ombudsman to discuss his departure from office,  did the Minister question whether it was in the interests of the public purse  to pay a single penny more to Mr Hutchinson for the sensational failure that  defined his time in office?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: Mr  Hutchinson has given a date on which he proposes to leave. He has indicated his  willingness to leave early if arrangements are made to put in place a  replacement, and he will carry out the duties of ombudsman until that time.  Therefore, he is entitled to the salary and expenses until that date, but no  question has arisen of any specific severance payments beyond that.</p>
        <p class="TimePeriod">2.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Spratt</strong>:  Can the Minister confirm that Mr Hutchinson will be treated in an equitable way  and in the manner that any other public servant would expect to be treated,  that the Police Ombudsman has served the Province well up to this point and  that we therefore wish him well for the future?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  can confirm that Mr Hutchinson will continue to receive his salary and  expenses, which were agreed on his appointment, before I came to office. That  will apply until the date on which he ceases his duties, which, at this stage,  is projected to be 1 June 2012. I believe that the Department of Justice&rsquo;s obligation  is to ensure that Mr Hutchinson is appropriately remunerated, in accordance  with that previous agreement, for as long as he continues to exercise the  functions of ombudsman.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Byrne</strong>:  Does the Minister accept that the Police Ombudsman&rsquo;s office is a very important  public office and must enjoy widespread public support? Given the uncertainty  over Mr Hutchinson&rsquo;s recent statements and inquiries, would it be sensible to  encourage him to move a bit earlier in order to restore morale and confidence  in the office?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  must say that it seems that we are stretching the question a little bit beyond  its initial point. The simple reality is that there is no alternative in Northern Ireland  to the ombudsman functioning under the corporation sole model, so Al Hutchinson  must remain in office, continuing to do the job for which he was appointed,  while arrangements are made to appoint a replacement ombudsman. That  responsibility lies with the Office of the First Minister and deputy First  Minister (OFMDFM). The Department of Justice has offered any assistance that  might be requested by OFMDFM to carry out those duties, and we will do what we  can to assist.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In the meantime, there is ongoing work in the office. The  ombudsman is committed to carrying out the day-to-day work as well as working  on the necessary reforms for his successor. On that basis, he will continue in  office until a replacement is appointed, which might be before 1 June, subject  to OFMDFM.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  Given that the Criminal Justice Inspection report recommended that the Police  Ombudsman&rsquo;s office should not carry out investigations into historical cases,  will the Minister indicate what he has done so for to advance the process of  looking into historical investigations?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  appreciate the question. However, I need to be very careful, because we are  coming perilously close to the point where I am being asked to intervene in the  operational responsibilities of the office. The Department can, however, quite  legitimately give support on governance issues.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I met the ombudsman and his two senior staff members this  morning. We discussed some of the arrangements that are being put in place for  the reform and restructuring of the office as well as the governance issues in  which the Department has a role. However, it would have been completely  improper for me to go into the detail of how the operational work of the office  is being carried through.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Office of the Police Ombudsman: Serious  Organised Crime Agency</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">6. <strong>Mr  Murphy </strong>asked the Minister of Justice when the Office of the Police  Ombudsman agreed, and began to implement, a memorandum of understanding with  the Serious Organised Crime Agency. (AQO 536/11-15<a name="AQO536/11-15" id="AQO536/11-15"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: On  3 March 2010, the Police Ombudsman signed an agreement between his office and  the Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA) for the investigation of complaints  against SOCA staff operating in Northern    Ireland. The Office of the Police Ombudsman  has advised that the agreement was implemented from the date of signing and  that the ombudsman has not received any complaints for investigation under that  agreement.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Murphy</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his answer. The Minister will be aware that the Serious  Organised Crime Agency has been engaged in very public and publicity-orientated  action since its inception in April 2008. Does he, therefore, feel that coming  to some arrangement with it almost two years later &mdash; just one month short, in  fact &mdash; is a further serious indictment of the Police Ombudsman&rsquo;s office under  the directorship of Al Hutchinson?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>:  Given the fact that I became Minister in April 2010, I am not sure that I am in  a position to give any interpretation of what happened and of what role the  Northern Ireland Office, the ombudsman or SOCA had in reaching that concordat  prior to my appointment.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>:  Can the Minister please outline in detail the terms of the memorandum of  understanding?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: No,  I cannot outline that at this stage, but I will certainly write to the Member  with what detail we have.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kinahan</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his answers. Will he give his assessment of the  success of criminal assets recovery, especially considering its immediacy in Northern Ireland  following the merger of the Assets Recovery Agency and the Serious Organised  Crime Agency?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: We  really seem to be getting to the point where we are stretching supplementary  questions beyond any bounds of connection to the original question. I can give  an assessment only of what I have seen in my connections with SOCA and its role  in the Organised Crime Task Force stakeholder group since I became Minister  almost 18 months ago. It seems to me that we have an effectively functioning  organisation, working in partnership with the other agencies, including on a  cross-border basis. As for the comparison with its predecessor agency, I am not  in a position to make any statement.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Criminal Responsibility</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">7. <strong>Mr B  McCrea </strong>asked the Minister of Justice for his assessment of the call to  raise the age of criminal responsibility to 12 years old. &nbsp;(AQO 537/11-15<a name="AQO537/11-15" id="AQO537/11-15"></a>)</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">14. <strong>Mr  McGlone </strong>asked the Minister of Justice if he will act immediately on  recommendation 29 of the criminal justice review of the youth justice system  and raise the age of criminal responsibility from 10 to 12.

    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>:  With permission, Mr Deputy Speaker, I will answer questions 7 and 14 together.  I spent some time covering proposals on the age of criminal responsibility  during the questions that followed my statement on the youth justice review  report. I appreciate that it is a subject on which people have strongly held  and often opposing views. However, the review team was required to consider the  subject, given the inclusion of the requirement in the Hillsborough Castle  Agreement&rsquo;s reference to a youth justice review:</p>

    <p class="B3BodyText">The review team sought to take a careful and balanced  approach to reflect the views it received and how Northern Ireland sits in relation  to international norms and standards. I am not proposing at this stage to make  an assessment of the merits of the review team&rsquo;s recommendations. With the  report now out for consultation, I welcome the opportunity that it provides to  promote an informed public debate on this important matter.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Rather than acting immediately, the proper process is to  put the issues out for public consultation and to make decisions once the  results of the formal consultation exercise have been fully analysed. I also  remind the House that it is only one of 31 recommendations in that important report  and I invite Members to afford equal consideration to the other recommendations  and to play a full part in the consultation process.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am committed to listening carefully to the debate  generated by the report and to draw on its conclusions in shaping decisions on  the direction of youth justice to provide a modern, effective youth justice  system that meets the needs of our children and young people and of the wider  community.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Minister, I wonder whether you might do more than just listen. There is a  requirement for you to explain why the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child  is legally binding, but it is not proposed &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Can we have a question, please?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  It is not proposed that there will be no criminal responsibility, but some  other form of looking after those young people.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: Mr  McCrea makes the point that I made when I answered questions on the review  report. If we are talking about a tiny number of young people aged 10 or 11, or  even 12 or 13, we are talking about those who, if they come to the notice of  the criminal justice system, will almost certainly be dealt with by care  methods rather than criminal sanction, recognising their age and vulnerability,  even as offenders. Therefore, the significance of the age of criminal  responsibility is perhaps sometimes overrated by some, including some in this  House. We need to take account of international norms and best practice,  recognise that Northern Ireland  has among the lowest ages of criminal responsibility in Europe,  and ensure that we see what is best for our children and young people and for  the community.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Patsy McGlone appears to have left the Chamber, so I call Mr  Stewart Dickson.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dickson</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his answers. Minister, you said, and I welcome it,  that there should be an informed debate about the criminal age of  responsibility. It should not just be a single recommendation, but should be  linked to the enhancement of parental responsibility, prevention and early intervention.  Those methodologies need to be deployed.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  agree. It may be that the Member has read some of the other 30 recommendations,  which refer in significant detail to issues such as early intervention and  recognise that youth justice is not something to be dealt with at the sharp end  when problems arise. We need a joined-up approach across Departments, and I  welcome the constructive engagement that my officials have already had with  those in other Departments on the matter.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Peace Walls: Belfast</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">8. <strong>Mr A  Maginness </strong>asked the Minister of Justice if he has any plans to continue to  work, on a systematic basis, to remove the peace walls in Belfast. (AQO 538/11-15<a name="AQO538/11-15" id="AQO538/11-15"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: The  process of dealing with interface structures will be a major pillar of the community  safety strategy. I want to ensure that we continue to work on a systematic  basis with communities and statutory agencies to make communities safer for  all. That will create the circumstances in which barriers can be reduced and  removed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is important that we build on recent successes. Mr  Maginness was with me at Alexandra Park to celebrate the opening of the gate  there. That was a significant day, and I share the Member&rsquo;s underlying  sentiment that we need to keep the momentum going at a strategic level.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A collaborative approach has helped to bring about progress  at Alexandra Park and Newington    Street. A key aspect of the community safety  strategy will be the creation of an inter-agency group to build on the good  work that has already been carried out. The group will address safety and  security concerns at interfaces and seek to maximise the impact of limited  resources with more targeted interventions.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Community engagement and agreement for change at interface  barriers is vital to progress. My Department, in conjunction with community  representatives and other agencies, is looking at other areas where positive  change is possible. I am on the record as saying that I do not wish to see any  more security structures being built. Priority must be given to forms of  investment in people and places that will provide appropriate levels of safety  and security and enable us to create the environment in which structures can be  dismantled.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s answer and agree that the Alexandra Park initiative  was very significant. Will the Minister undertake to meet Belfast City Council  and work out a systematic programme to address the whole issue of peace walls  throughout Belfast?  The council has committed itself to that, and I hope that a genuine  relationship can be built between the Minister and the council to address the  issue.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  agree entirely with those sentiments. I think there was a question buried in  there somewhere; if it was about my willingness and that of the Department of Justice  to engage with the city council, then I give an absolute assurance that the  work that is under way between my officials and the city council will continue.  I have met the chief executive of the city council on a number of occasions,  when we have been looking at the north Belfast  subgroup of the Executive.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is clear that there are significant issues to address  around interfaces, promoting the general issue of good relations and working to  make the community safety safer by building bridges instead of walls. It is too  easy to build walls; after 30 or 40 years of building them, we have to face up  to how we can remove them, how we build relationships and how we ensure that  the community gains the confidence that has been demonstrated in Alexandra Park  and Newington Street.  I hope that we will see progress in some other areas in the near future.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Whatever is required to build that partnership, the  Department of Justice will be taking part, and I welcome Mr Maginness&rsquo;s  support.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Alternative Dispute Resolution</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">9. <strong>Mr  Copeland </strong>asked the Minister of Justice what action he plans to take to  increase the use of alternative dispute resolution. &nbsp;(AQO 539/11-15<a name="AQO539/11-15" id="AQO539/11-15"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: On  13 September, I published the final report of the access to justice review. The  report is a comprehensive analysis containing 159 conclusions and  recommendations. The review supported the promotion of alternative dispute  resolutions. Many disputes do not necessarily need to be resolved in a court  hearing, and the review recommends the promotion of mediation, conciliation,  collaborative law and other alternatives to court proceedings in the right  cases.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As Members may know, I believe that greater use of  mediation and other alternatives in suitable cases can avoid cases&rsquo; having to  be heard in court, which brings benefits to all concerned by providing a less  stressful environment for the resolution of disputes and reducing costs. In  some cases, changing our approach could also help prevent abuse of the system.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have published the final report of the review for public  consultation, which will last for three months. Once I have received and  considered those comments, I will publish a formal response to the review in  the new year, including any proposals for the development of alternative  dispute resolutions.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: That ends Question Time. Members may take their ease for a few  moments while we make changes at the top Table.<span class="SectionMarker"><span style="font-size:14.0pt; "> </span></span></p>
    <p class="H3SubHeading"><a name="5"></a>Private Members&rsquo; Business</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">United Assembly Against Terrorism</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">3.00 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>:  The Business Committee has agreed to allow up to one hour and 30 minutes for  the debate. The proposer of the motion will have 10 minutes in which to propose  and 10 minutes in which to make a winding-up speech. One amendment has been  selected and published on the Marshalled List. The proposer of the amendment  will have 10 minutes in which to propose and five minutes in which to make a  winding-up speech. All other Members who are called to speak will have five  minutes.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr I McCrea</strong>:  I beg to move</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">That this Assembly stands united against continued  dissident republican attacks on the PSNI; condemns any attempts on the lives of  officers; and fully supports the Chief Constable and the PSNI officers in  dealing with this growing threat.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It gives me no great pleasure to bring before the House a  motion on continued attacks by dissident republicans on the lives of our police  officers and, indeed, society at large. However, it is a topic of major  importance and concern, given the significant number of attacks on the police  and our wider community in recent years.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I pay tribute to all members of the Royal Ulster  Constabulary, the full-time and part-time Reserve, and any other members of the  Crown services who paid the supreme sacrifice. I also pay tribute to those who  bear the mental and physical scars suffered as a result of defending against  terrorists the rights of the people of Northern Ireland and democracy.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am pleased that we find ourselves in a new era in which  democracy rules supreme over the unlawful and criminal actions of terrorists. I  am, however, concerned about the ever-growing threat to our officers and the  wider community. In April, we witnessed a gruesome attack on the PSNI when a  young constable, Ronan Kerr, was brutally murdered by dissident republicans.  Prior to the murder of Constable Kerr, we witnessed the murder of Constable  Stephen Carroll in Lurgan, which followed the unlawful killings of Sappers  Quinsey and Azimkar at Massereene Barracks in Antrim in 2009. Both sappers were  to have been deployed to Afghanistan  the next day. Those gruesome acts of murder remind us of the threat that our  police officers remain under, despite the fact that the majority of the people  of Northern Ireland  wish to move forward.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is also worth mentioning the attacks on police officers  and those associated with the security forces in which, thankfully, the bombs  and devices did not explode. Nonetheless, such attacks cause people to suffer  hurt and to have lifelong memories of them.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although the number of deaths is at its lowest when  compared with 15, 20 or even 30 years ago, murder continues to present a major,  unwelcome theme in our society. Sadly, terrorism continues to rock Northern Ireland.  It is, therefore, important that we as an Assembly support the police during  this immensely difficult time and unite in sending a message to the police and  the Chief Constable that we fully support them in their fight against those who  intend to destroy our society.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Of the 72 shooting incidents recorded in 2010-11, 61 were  attributed to republicans, three were attributed to loyalists, and,  unfortunately, the remaining eight attributions could not be determined. There  were seven shooting incidents involving shots fired at police, five of which  occurred during July 2010 when shots were fired at Crossmaglen and Lurgan  police stations, and there were three serious public disorder incidents between  12 and 13 July. Shots were also fired at police during public disorder in  Lurgan in August 2010 and in Londonderry in  March 2011. All those incidents were attributed to dissident republicans.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Statistics show that bombing incidents have doubled over  the past two years, with 50 recorded incidents in 2009-2010 and 99 in 2010-11.  As the statistics show, that is the highest number recorded in eight years,  although it is significantly lower than the 2001-02 figure of 318 bombing  incidents. The 99 bombing incidents recorded in 2010-11 involved 101 devices,  of which 52 exploded and 49 were defused by the army. Injuries were reported on  six occasions when a device exploded.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We must not forget that many of the incidents  inconvenienced hundreds and thousands of people who were refused access to  their houses or businesses for their own safety. Pipe bombs were the most frequently  used device and were involved in 64 bombing incidents, and there were also four  incidents when a viable device was located under a vehicle. Of the 99 bombing  incidents, 59 were attributed to republicans, 28 were attributed to loyalists,  and 12 were undetermined. There were 26 bombing incidents involving attacks on  the security forces, including 11 attacks on police officers and 12 attacks on  police stations. The other three incidents were attacks on army premises and  personnel.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although it does not strictly tie in with the motion, I  feel that it is important to mention paramilitary-style attacks, which, in many  ways, relate to the strength and threat of dissident republicans who threaten  peace. During 2010-11, there were 83 casualties as a result of  paramilitary-style attacks, compared with 127 casualties in the previous year.  Paramilitary-style shootings accounted for 33 casualties, all of which were  attributed to republicans. In comparison with the previous year, the number of  casualties from paramilitary-style shootings decreased by 13, while the number  of casualties of paramilitary-style assaults decreased by 31. Furthermore, 86  firearms and 2,574 rounds of ammunition were found during 2010. In addition,  2&middot;9 kg of explosives were recovered during that year. I welcome those finds and  commend our police force and the security services for their sterling work in  removing those weapons from the hands of those who desire to kill and injure  our people. Although the figures are not necessarily right up to date, there is  no doubt that the perception today is that we will see yet another increase in  attacks when the next round of figures is available.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Most of the incidents are attributed to rural areas,  although there have been a significant number of security alerts, in addition  to attacks on serving personnel, in Belfast and Londonderry. It is only right  for any decent and law-abiding person to condemn such acts. I stand before the  House today to condemn all such acts of violence, whether in the past or the  present. I have repeatedly condemned such incidents in public and privately in  the past, and I have done so again recently. I hope that every Member of the  House joins with me in the condemnation of any attack.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Allister</strong>:  I endorse and note the Member&rsquo;s condemnation of all these heinous attacks. How  far does the Member think that the rewarding of terrorism in the past by  delivering a system of terrorists in government in response to those who  murdered is, in fact, an encouragement to present-day terrorists? Is it not one  of the lessons of the past that, by virtue of what has been done as that  legacy, we encourage new terrorists to think that they too, using Provo-owned  Semtex and weapons, will attain the same end?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr I McCrea</strong>:  Obviously, the Member has an axe to grind. Although I agree with some of his  sentiments, he attended and was part of the St Andrews Agreement talks that set  down the basis on which any government that included Sinn F&eacute;in could be set up.  He is more than aware of the issues. He sits at the back and snipes and has  very little that is constructive to bring forward. People know exactly where he  stands on that issue, and he is not the saint that he makes himself out to be.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is no justification for the sort of behaviour and  illegal activity in question, especially when it involves the murder of  security personnel. However, I make no apology for saying that, I do not care:  the people of Northern    Ireland come into that as equally as  security personnel.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I turn to the amendment tabled by Sinn F&eacute;in. Initially I  was not willing to accept the amendment, specifically for the reason that it  removes the term &ldquo;dissident republican&rdquo;. However, I am willing to consider Sinn  F&eacute;in&rsquo;s comments on and reasoning for the amendment. If I truly feel that members  of Sinn F&eacute;in have the desire to include dissident republicans &mdash; although I do  not see why they had the need to take it out &mdash; I am willing to consider what  they have to say before we make up our minds.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Will the Member draw his remarks to a close?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr I McCrea</strong>:  Mr Deputy Speaker, I thank you for the opportunity to bring the motion before  the House. I commend the motion to the House and ask the House to support it.  We will consider the amendment during the speeches that Members from the opposite  Benches make.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr G Kelly</strong>:  I beg to move the following amendment: Leave out all after &ldquo;continued&rdquo; and  insert</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;attacks on the PSNI and the wider community; condemns  any attempts on the lives of officers; and fully supports the Chief Constable  and the PSNI officers in dealing with this threat in a way that gives primacy  to community policing, is human rights compliant and engenders greater  confidence throughout the whole community.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank the  Member across the Chamber for tabling the motion. I do not think that anyone in  the Assembly can disagree with the intent of the motion. I will explain a  little about the amendment in a moment. However, the amendment and the motion  start by stating:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;that this Assembly stands united against  continued...attacks&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That is the important message to be sent out from  here today. We do not want to be dragged back into the past. We want to work  for and support all those who have been under attack. I add my condemnation of  all those who were involved in such attacks, and I know that Ian McCrea went  through quite a substantial list of attacks that have happened over the past  year or so.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The question is: why the amendment? Some amendments are  tabled to change the essence of a motion, and they are opposed. However, I  believe that this amendment does not change the essence of the motion. Some  amendments are tabled to strengthen and expand the message, and that is our  intention in tabling this amendment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Over the past couple of years, death threats have been made  against police officers and there have been threats against political  representatives, some of whom are sitting all round the Chamber. There have  also been threats against community workers. In fact, there was a blanket  threat against all community workers in Ligoniel in my constituency because of  their actions. There were threats against people in the voluntary sector and  trade unionists, and shop owners and businesspeople were also threatened. Bombs  were placed under cars in republican areas as well as in unionist areas, and  headlines highlighted a number of bombs placed at businesses where people could  have been killed. My constituency office and other Sinn F&eacute;in offices have been  targeted with pipe bombs. There have also been shootings of young people,  kneecappings, and people have been sent into exile.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">3.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The essence of the amendment is that this concerns more  people than the PSNI, but that is not to exclude officers in the PSNI. The  essence is to make sure that everyone hears from the Assembly the message that  all such attacks are being condemned and that we stand united.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Allister</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr G Kelly</strong>:  Not a chance.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">People need to hear support from the Assembly and across  the Chamber, but I also want to be sure that the response builds on the confidence  in policing, because at the core of this is an attempt to undermine the new  beginnings of policing. There is an attempt to drag us back into situations we  were in previously. I want to make sure that policing does not get undermined,  even in the motion and in the actions. The whole community is rejecting the  actions of the people who are carrying out all of the attacks, irrespective of  whom they are on or whether they are on police officers. We need to show that  we reject those attacks on the community and show support for all of those  involved in the attacks. When those attacks come to members of the community,  they are, clearly, an attack on the whole community. That message also needs to  go out from the Chamber today.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr I McCrea</strong>:  In my initial comments about Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s amendment, my main concern was the  effect of the removal of the words &ldquo;dissident republican&rdquo;. I accept that there  are people on the loyalist side who are involved in some of these activities,  but although the Member has mentioned in his comments that everyone is  involved, I have yet to hear him refer to dissident republicans. It would be  useful if he was willing to at least refer to the fact that they are there and  give us a reason to at least consider supporting the amendment.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr G Kelly</strong>:  I thank the Member for his intervention. I have no hesitation whatsoever in  mentioning dissident republicans. As he pointed out, the bulk of the attacks  are coming from that area, but I thought that it was important to table the  amendment, because there are people out there who want to know that they are  not being left out of the list of people who are being attacked. If you have an  attack on a community service, that clearly is an attack on the community as  well. I have no hesitation in saying that; we simply wanted to expand the  amendment to cover that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is important to point out the primacy of community  policing, as is done in the amendment. Without that combination and that  relationship between the Police Service and the community, the Police Service  can be set apart from the community it serves. It is important that we make  sure that that does not happen; it is what those opposed to policing are trying  to do. They are trying to drive a wedge between them.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Assembly wants to send out a united message. For that  reason, I ask the proposers of the motion to accept the amendment and the  intent in which it was put forward.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  The motion before us might be considered predictable, given its source, but no  less worthy for being predictable. It is not unusual for the DUP or any  unionist party to be concerned about attacks on the PSNI and to look to see  what it can do about them. What is of real interest is the amendment put  forward by Sinn F&eacute;in. I realise that some people may be concerned that that is  a cynical ploy. However, when you read the amendment, its content is quite  astonishing. I mean no offence by that. The amendment states that the Assembly:  &ldquo;condemns any attempts on the lives of officers; and fully supports the Chief  Constable and the PSNI officers in dealing with this threat&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I regard that as an entirely positive statement and one  that should not be missed. There is a danger that we look for problems, and I  understand the point that Mr McCrea made. Nevertheless, the amendment contains  a significant statement, and I want to acknowledge that I see it as such.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Allister</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  If you just let me develop my point first, I will give way in a moment. One of  the other elements of the amendment is the idea of putting community policing  at the centre of policing, and I agree with that, too. I am convinced that you  cannot impose policing on people and that policing should be done with  communities, for communities and, frankly, by communities. However, there are  some issues with how you deal with that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to deal with another issue, but I will take the  intervention first.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Allister</strong>:  Before the Member gets too effusive about the content of the Sinn F&eacute;in  amendment, will he reflect on the fact that what it really points to is the  total divergence and hypocrisy of that party in being willing to say that  attacks on police officers today are wrong, yet attacks on the RUC and anything  else up to 1998 were justified and continue to be so? So long as that is the position,  does the Member agree that very little credence can be put on the self-serving  stance of the moment?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  There is much that I admire when the honourable Member speaks, but sometimes I  need to challenge what he says. On the basis of the motion in front of me, and  given the time and place, I cannot demur from what is being said. I could point  out certain inconsistencies, but there are lots of inconsistencies with this  issue. For example, I would like people to examine certain issues when talking  about community policing. Alex Maskey has spoken to WIMPS.tv. He needs to make  it clear that the only form of policing in the community is through law and  order and the PSNI. Although Mr Maskey might have supported other methods in  the past, that is not where we are now.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I also understand the issue raised about dissident  republicans, and I am not one of those who would have forced that particular  phraseology out of Sinn F&eacute;in. I understand what the amendment was designed to  do and why Sinn F&eacute;in might want to make that change. I accept that and move on.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to deal with the point about human rights. I dealt  with that matter when I chaired the human rights and professional standards  committee of the Northern Ireland Policing Board. That committee had many  interesting debates on stop-and-search powers and how they should be used  properly. What was significant about those meetings was that Sinn F&eacute;in members  of the committee accepted the right of police officers to stop and search  individuals, yet they were never given the credit for that. Their  counterargument was that using stop-and-search powers in the wrong way or  inappropriately can be counterproductive. I accept that argument, and, to my  mind, that is realistic and reasonable dialogue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The problem in this place when we talk about human rights  is that people forget about what human rights mean, and the term becomes a  stick to beat people with. Everyone, including police officers, has human  rights, and they exist because we all agree that they are the basic standards  of a civilised country. The most fundamental of all human rights is the right  to life &mdash; article 2.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We have all been trying to deal with the past for some  time, but I do not think that we have dealt with it properly. The past must be  examined in such a way that we address what was wrong and make sure that it  does not happen again.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I agree with Mr McCrea that we should listen carefully to  how the debate develops. However, on the basis of the motion and the current  debate, it seems that the House has accepted a counter-terrorism message. That  is excellent. I urge people to support the motion, and I am sympathetic to the  amendment.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  The SDLP also supports the motion, and I add my voice to those of colleagues  from across the House who appear to be uniting against the threat posed by  those on our island who still believe that physical force is a means to a  political end. Let me say at the outset that I will happily give way to anyone  who wishes to join me and the rest of us in uniting around that simple message.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The pressure under which young police officers live today  is entirely at odds with the expressed will of the people of Ireland. It  flies absolutely in the face of the more than 90% of people across this island  who have endorsed every step of our peace process. It is not an act of  patriotism to attack someone who seeks to serve their community. It is not an  act of British or Irish patriotism to do that. It is not legitimate to profess  a violent mechanism and expect a political outcome. The futility of violence is  evident to us all, and the fact that we are able to unite around that now is a  great testament to the very many people who made this Chamber possible.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I know that, when he speaks in a few minutes, Joe Byrne  will refer to a young man from his home town who joined the PSNI to serve us  all, and who was killed for no other reason than because he made that decision.  If Dolores Kelly were here today, she would speak similarly of Constable  Stephen Carroll, and so on and so forth. That we are able to unite as a Chamber  and a political body is a very special thing. Like Mr McCrea before me, as  current chairperson of the human rights and professional standards committee of  the Policing Board, I know how much it will mean to police officers.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, uniting around the need to respond to this crisis  from a security standpoint is only half of what we really need to do, if we are  honest, because the history books tell us that, ultimately, eventually someone  will have to sit down and work through the thwarted logic of whoever it is who  thinks that violence is still a legitimate basis for pursuing a political  objective. Someone, somewhere, is going to have to show the courage to sit down  and start talking. I just hope that, in the years ahead, as we settle down in  this Assembly and go from simply debating a peace process and start debating  the transformation of our region and of this island, we are able to honestly  assert that. I do not expect us to do it today; I can understand why we would  not feel able to. However, we must surely accept that, for all of us, it is  legitimate to dissent. It is fair enough to disagree &mdash; in fact, it is necessary  and healthy that we do so &mdash; but it is not legitimate, fair or in any way  potentially justifiable to do so in any other manner than democratically and  through force of argument.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Allister</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  I will not, and I will tell you why. I suspect that the Member wants to agree  about the determination to dissent, but what we are about here today is uniting  against those who refuse to dissent &mdash; to be fair to the Member and to his full  credit &mdash; in the way he is able to in this Chamber. I want to use my five  minutes, if that is OK, to assert the primacy of politics and to celebrate the  fact that, with all our imperfections, and we have many &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Will the Member draw his remarks to a close, please?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  This House will silence every gun, if we remain united.<span class="SectionMarker"><span style="font-size:14.0pt; "> </span></span></p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">3.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lunn</strong>: I  support the motion and the amendment, but, before I continue, I wish to  associate myself with Ian McCrea&rsquo;s acknowledgement of the sacrifice of those  who have gone before in the PSNI, the RUC and other organisations. It is  entirely appropriate that that sacrifice always be mentioned.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The DUP motion is clear and unambiguous. It seeks Assembly  unanimity in sending a message to dissident republicans that we stand with the  PSNI and the Chief Constable in dealing with the threat against them.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Sinn F&eacute;in amendment predictably removes the specific  reference to dissident republicans, but Mr Kelly has unequivocally stated in  response to a prompt from Mr Ian McCrea that he is not seeking to avoid that  question and that he includes dissident republicans in the overall thrust of  his party&rsquo;s amendment. He includes all attacks on the PSNI and the wider  community, so, presumably, that includes attacks by dissidents,  UVF-orchestrated riots, attacks and killings in paramilitary groups and all  other attacks, from whatever source they come. The amendment also offers full  support for the Chief Constable and the PSNI as they deal with the threat in a  way that gives primacy to community policing, observes human rights and builds  community confidence. I join Mr Basil McCrea in saying that I cannot find any  fault with that. If that wording had come from the DUP, it would not have  surprised me.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am a member of the Policing Board, and I think that every  political member of the Policing Board is here today, as well as some former  members. I have listened to the views of the Chief Constable and his senior  officers and think they will be very encouraged and would certainly support the  wording of the amendment. Community policing and human rights observance are  absolutely front and centre in their thinking. The drive to increase community  confidence, particularly in disadvantaged areas, also has the highest priority.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Over the past few years, we have heard so many  condemnations of terrorist and paramilitary atrocities in this House and  beyond. The voices of those who still advocate violence for political or any  other ends have been drowned out by the united voices of condemnation from all  sides. The motion and the amendment are further evidence of the desire across  the community to live in a normalised society.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We want no more Stephen Carrolls, no more Ronan Kerrs and  no more Peadar Heffrons. We do not want any more Bobby Moffats, or any other  punishment shootings or summary justice from any part of the community. The  motion will send a message to the dissidents and to others that they have no  support. It is equally important that a very strong message of support will be  sent to the PSNI if the House unites today, preferably around the Sinn F&eacute;in  amendment.</p>
    <p class="B3SpeakerinChair">(Mr Speaker in the Chair)</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have been very encouraged, because, up until some time  ago, I heard that there would be some resistance from the unionist side, but  Ian McCrea said at the start of his contribution that he wanted to hear what  Sinn F&eacute;in would say on the subject. I think that he and the Ulster Unionists  have heard the right message from Sinn F&eacute;in. I see absolutely no reason why the  motion should not be supported on the basis that, to all intents and purposes,  the Sinn F&eacute;in amendment encompasses the DUP motion.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will leave it at that, Mr Speaker. It will be a good day  for the Assembly if we can pass a motion jointly without a Division on a  subject such as this. Tomorrow morning, we might even hear something  constructive from Stephen Nolan about the activities in this House. He may give  us some credit instead of picking out particular minor incidents, as he did  this morning.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Newton</strong>: I  also wish to be associated with the tributes that have been paid to all the  members of the security forces &mdash; many of whom gave their lives in the duty of  service &mdash; who stood between us and the objectives of the terrorists. It is  absolutely necessary that the Assembly know exactly what we are up against from  dissident terrorists. I will refer to some remarks that were made by a  dissident, who, following an interview with &lsquo;The Guardian&rsquo; on 15 July 2011,  indicated:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;mainstream republicans were coming over to  organisation&rsquo;s way of thinking.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">He also claimed that members of the group that placed the  bomb underneath the car of Catholic policeman Constable Ronan Kerr in Omagh  were relatively recent defectors from the Provisional IRA.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">He also said that Constable Ronan Kerr and Constable  Stephen Carroll, who was murdered in Lurgan, were murdered by dissident terror  groups because they were legitimate targets. Indeed, although he left it out, I  dare say that he would apply the same words to the two members of the army who  were murdered in Antrim. That is what we are up against.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to pay tribute not only to the security forces &mdash; the  PSNI, the RUC and the army &mdash; but to the people of Northern Ireland. They have stood  against terrorism not only in recent years, but for generations. They have  stood against those who wanted to remove their birthright by extreme violence  and attack the very things that are dear to them. Throughout the generations, during  the dark days of terrorism, the law-abiding people of Northern Ireland  did not bend. Terrorists could not break their will. When murder and mayhem by  the Provisional IRA was at its peak, they stood firm against Provo terrorism.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We must pay particular tribute to the business community,  which was often terrorism&rsquo;s target. In the clear-up after every bomb that was  placed in their premises, a sign went up saying, &ldquo;Business as usual&rdquo;. It did  not really matter whether the business belonged to someone from the Protestant,  unionist, nationalist or Catholic community; the owners continued on and stood  firm against terrorism. In all the difficulties of life that we witnessed  during the most recent terrorist campaign, when there was a ring of steel  around Belfast, when every village and town in Northern Ireland  had its own security arrangements, and when practically every retail shop had  to implement security arrangements, the business community stood firm against  terrorists.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the stand that the Assembly has taken. All  indications are that the motion will pass. Over recent years and following  attacks on the PSNI and the army, the House has stood united to condemn those  attacks in the strongest possible terms. Those cowardly attacks on police  officers have been condemned by the First Minister and the deputy First  Minister. I have to say that many of us were surprised when the deputy First  Minister stood side by side with the Chief Constable and the First Minister on  the steps of Stormont   Castle and condemned the  dissidents as traitors. I welcomed his words. Many of us were surprised when he  used those words.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">An attack on any member of the security forces is not just  an attack on him and his family; it is an attack on the entire community and  the aspects of life that we all hold dear, such as the democratic process. Of  course, we face an increased threat from dissident terrorists. The  implementation of the Patten report saw many very experienced officers lose  their jobs and move on to other employment. Is it not interesting that they  have been headhunted by Governments around the world because of their  experience of the infrastructure to combat terrorism?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member must bring his remarks to a close.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Newton</strong>: I  support the motion.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ruane</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Like many in the House, I support the  motion as, I hope, amended. I hope that Members accept the amendment in the  spirit in which it was tabled.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is a peace process here. There are new institutions  that are the envy of many countries and societies throughout the world. That is  not to say it is perfect; it is not. At times, many of us would say that it is  very imperfect. However, the fact is that many countries look to these new  institutions. They look to see what checks and balances and new institutions  are being established. They want to learn how the Assembly is doing it. Recently,  as part of the Committee for the Office of the First Minister and deputy First  Minister, I joined Tom Elliott and other members in discussions with a  delegation from Cyprus.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Like many Members, I lived through the difficult times. I  also worked in other parts of the world and saw different war-torn places. They  look at what we are doing here and want to move on in the way in which we are  moving on. Like many Members, I attended Ronan Kerr&rsquo;s funeral and saw poor Mrs  Kerr, who was absolutely distraught. She was heartened by the support of people  from across the political spectrum.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The amendment is important because, as Gerry Kelly and  others said, we need to build safer communities. We need to build new policing structures  that are accountable, representative &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Humphrey</strong>:  I am grateful to the Member for giving way. Does she agree with me and my  colleagues that, in building policing structures, there can only ever be one  police force in Northern Ireland and that community policing on a two-tier  level is not acceptable?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ruane</strong>: I  thank the Member for his intervention. I was going to go on to say that the  more we ensure that policing structures are supported by the communities that  they represent and serve &mdash; serve is the key word &mdash; and adhere to international  standards and human rights, the more we have a solid foundation on which to  continue with our peace process and the new institutions and the bigger the  message we send to people who are opposed to change and the agreements that we  have reached.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Many sections of our society have suffered attacks. My  office, like Gerry&rsquo;s, has suffered an attack. I have been attacked by people  who should know better. There have been racist attacks in our society. We awoke  this morning to hear that a child had been wounded by glass after an attack on  her house. It is not good enough for that to happen in our communities.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Many of us in the House are on the Policing Board. We spend  days and nights trying to build the new structures. I welcome the engagement  that I have &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ruane</strong>: &mdash;  on that board with members of all the different political parties. We have many  different viewpoints, but it is good to hear people such as Basil, Trevor and  members of the DUP speaking in this important debate. We will have many more  debates. I do not agree with everything that everyone says, and people do not  agree with me. However, the point is that we are having those debates. That is  what makes today&rsquo;s debate so important.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The best way for us to ensure the continuation of our  process and arrangements, and our new justice and policing structures, is to  engage on every single issue. We must build the new structures and ensure that  no one in our society is attacked.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D McIlveen</strong>:  I also commend the Members who tabled the motion. We have to acknowledge that Northern Ireland  has come a long way in recent years. We should all be very proud of the  progress that has been made to date. I also take this opportunity to pay  tribute to members of the security forces who paid the ultimate sacrifice at  the hands of terrorism. We must keep them at the front of our minds in this  debate.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will pick up on one point. A view has been expressed that  the existence of the Assembly somehow incentivises terrorism; that is  ultimately what was said. When such a view is pontificated from the Benches, I  have to say, &ldquo;Look around.&rdquo; We are in a devolved United Kingdom Assembly.  Surely the very fact that people on the Benches opposite are sitting in such an  Assembly is proof that terrorism does not work rather than proof that terrorism  does work. I struggle to get my head around that argument.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Allister</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D McIlveen</strong>:  Unfortunately, however, there are still issues to be resolved. Continued  attacks on the PSNI constitute a fundamental issue.<span class="Italic"> [Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D McIlveen</strong>:  Sorry, I will give way.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">3.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Allister</strong>:  I am much obliged because &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Allister</strong>:  &mdash; I think that the Member might just have been referring to me.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The point, which I would like Members to seriously  consider, was that we are in the scenario where we are all condemning the  murder of PSNI officers. I was making the point that some of those who are  today condemning the murder of PSNI officers are those who have justified, and  continue to justify, the murder of RUC officers. Yet, it was in order to  accommodate those very people that these artificial political structures were  created. Something &mdash; before this nonsense is repeated &mdash; which I never endorsed  and for which I resigned from the DUP. The point &mdash;<span class="Italic"> [Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. The Member has the Floor.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Allister</strong>:  The point is this: one of the products of the Belfast Agreement, which Members  on those Benches used to oppose, was the rewarding of terrorism and special  accommodation for terrorism. My point is that &mdash;<span class="Italic"> [Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Allister</strong>:  &mdash; having set that template, are we not inviting the new generation of  terrorists to reap the same reward?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. Can I just say this to the House: let us calm down. Let us be reminded  of the language that we use in the House. I also say this to all sides of the  House: I would like to think that when a Member takes an intervention &mdash; the  Member quite rightly had the Floor and gave way &mdash; out of courtesy, the Member  who intervenes will make the intervention short and sharp. I say that to the  whole House.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D McIlveen</strong>:  I thank the Member for his intervention. There is one very simple answer to his  question: no, I do not agree with him. I think that the vast majority of people  do not agree with him. The reality is that &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member will have an extra minute added to his time.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D McIlveen</strong>:  Thank you very much, Mr Speaker.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I think that, if people did agree with the Member, he would  not have to contribute to the debate through interventions as he would have the  allocated speaking positions and the mandate to put his view across.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  Does the Member agree that, if the Member were being consistent with his  claimed policies, he would not even be in this House? <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span> Of course, the very fact that he is now here is evidence that he has not even  got the support in the country. Of course, sitting there as a lone jack in the  corner is evidence &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Speaker</strong>:  Order. Could we please get back to the motion?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D McIlveen</strong>:  I thank the Member for his intervention. I could not agree more.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I feel that issues still have to be resolved. The  continuing attacks on the PSNI are an absolutely fundamental issue, and we have  to address them today. The reforms of the PSNI over the years and the equality  work that has been done by the organisation should be very much commended.  Tribute has to be paid in that regard. Public confidence is increasing, with  94% of people saying in 2008 that they felt safe in their communities. However,  it is unlikely that a similar poll of police officers and their families would  yield the same results.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The threat from dissident republicans made it into a July  2011 Home Office report outlining a UK counterterrorism strategy.  Attacks on police officers are becoming far too regular an occurrence. Those  people keep our communities safe. It is thanks in no small part to their  tireless work that we are now enjoying relative peace and stability in the  Province; therefore any attempts on the lives of officers must be  wholeheartedly and unreservedly condemned.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Today&rsquo;s motion is vital. What a day it would be if we could  unite as one Assembly to condemn the brutal attacks on our police officers by  those wishing to derail the peace process. I believe in this passionately,  which is why I find it rather unusual that the other side of the House cannot  accept the motion as written. For the whole Assembly to unite entirely against  terrorism would be a huge step. In fact, it would be a seismic step, and I  believe that we are either moving forward or we are not.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I find the amendment all the more difficult to comprehend  given that the deputy First Minister has called those responsible for the  murder of Ronan Kerr the enemies of the peace and the enemies of the island of  Ireland. Indeed, my colleague Mr Newton mentioned the comments made after the  murders at Massereene Barracks. Why, then, will the other side of the House not  just accept the motion as tabled so that together we can present a united front  against terrorism?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The threat against PSNI officers is almost exclusively from  dissident republicans. We have heard facts, figures and statistics proving that  that threat is incontestable.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member should bring his remarks to a close.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D McIlveen</strong>:  We should send out a message today condemning the acts of dissident republicans.  I commend the motion to the House.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hussey</strong>:  When I read the proposed amendment to the motion, one of the first things that  hit me between the eyes was the phrase &ldquo;human rights compliant&rdquo;. That means  something to an awful lot of people, but it seems to mean different things to  different people. We all know &mdash; my colleague Basil McCrea referred to it &mdash; that  the basic human right is the right to life. Constable Kerr gave his life in the  service of the Police Service of Northern Ireland, which incorporates the Royal  Ulster Constabulary GC. Similarly, Constable Michael Ferguson of the RUC gave  his life in Londonderry when he was shot dead  in the street. Both were Roman Catholic officers, and both paid the supreme  sacrifice for being police officers. So, where are we today? Have things  changed much?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Police officers carry a heavy burden. In Northern Ireland,  they carry an exceptionally heavy burden. In fact, throughout Irish history,  police officers have carried a heavy burden. They have always been targeted by  terrorists. They were targeted in the 20s, 30s, 40s, 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s,  2000s and beyond. I find it strange that we cannot use the term &ldquo;dissident  republican&rdquo;. I find it strange that some people find the word &ldquo;terrorist&rdquo; to be  one that they cannot use. At a recent meeting of the Policing Board, we  considered the Winsor review, and one of the paragraphs that was to go back to  the review referred to the specific targeting by terrorists of members of the  Police Service of Northern Ireland. Who in this House would deny that police  officers are being targeted by terrorists? A Member who spoke previously  objected to that word. They objected to the words &ldquo;targeting&rdquo; and &ldquo;terrorist&rdquo;.  I find that difficult to swallow.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I fully support the Police Service of Northern Ireland  without question, and I fully support the Chief Constable without question. He  has a role to undertake, and he undertakes it exceptionally well. If mistakes  are made by any police officer in this country, various organisations can  investigate those complaints. I do not and cannot accept attacks on any members  of this community. I cannot accept attacks on people who have their windows put  in. I condemn those who attacked the offices of the Members opposite, because  that is wrong. That does not happen in a democracy. In a democracy, a police  officer does not have a bomb placed under his car. In a democracy, a police  officer is not shot at, and his home is not targeted because he is a police  officer. I condemn all attacks, and I condemn the attacks on police officers,  but we can and must call a spade a spade.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Dissident republicans are clearly there, and they will not  go away. We cannot make them go away by covering our eyes and pretending they  are not there. I am sorry, but, until people accept that dissident republicans  are here and that they are here to cause havoc and to murder police officers  and those who support this state, I have no truck with them. If the words  &ldquo;dissident republicans&rdquo; cause so much offence to those opposite, I cannot  support the amendment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We have a completely new Police Service. Those new police  officers are being specifically targeted because Catholic officers were  prepared to join the Police Service of Northern Ireland. Catholic officers were  prepared to join the Royal Ulster Constabulary, and many of them paid the  supreme sacrifice. The words &ldquo;dissident republican&rdquo; will not go away. Like  another organisation that once said that it had not gone away, they have not  gone away. Until those words are included, I am afraid that I cannot accept the  amendment.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  This has been a very good debate, and there has been considerable agreement  right across the Chamber. That is encouraging, not just for political reasons  but, in particular, for the PSNI, which has a very difficult job to do in  safeguarding our community, and I mean the whole community. Dissident  republicans are out to destroy policing and the PSNI if they can; they are out  to destroy the political progress that we have made in recent years.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Of course, the answer to their campaign of destruction and  their campaign against the PSNI is not just to condemn their actions but to  support and deepen the political progress that we have made, because it is  through partnership and working together in the Chamber, in the Executive and  in the other architecture of this institution that we will continue to make  political progress. By making political progress, we undermine the very point  that dissident republicans are trying to make, which is that this cannot work.  However, this can and is working, but it can work much better; therefore we  should deepen our resolve to create an even better partnership right across the  community. In supporting the PSNI and encouraging young people in particular  from every part of the community to join it, we are strengthening the police  service.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">What the PSNI has, which its predecessor did not have, is  the fact that it is a representative police service; it has a critical mass in  its cross-community make-up. It is a legitimate police service. Right across the  community, people respect and support the PSNI, and it is therefore very  important &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Humphrey</strong>:  I am sure that the Member will appreciate that that is very difficult for some  of us on this side of the House. He seems to imply that the Royal Ulster Constabulary  was not legitimate. The Royal Ulster Constabulary was not as representative as  he and his community would have wanted it to be because people who sought to  join it were targeted &mdash; as were their families &mdash; and prevented from doing so.  That has to be remembered.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  Of course I accept that the RUC sustained savage attacks, and many members lost  their lives in the service of the community. However, it has to be said that  the RUC did not command universal political or community support; that was one  of its fundamental weaknesses. I believe that, as a result of the reforms in  policing, we have built a police service that commands almost universal support  across the community. That is a very powerful weapon, more powerful than any  physical weapon that any police service has. Having popular support is so  important. Thus the murder of Ronan Kerr shocked the whole community and  brought an outpouring of sympathy right across the community. That is a  testament to the political progress that we have made and the achievements of  the PSNI in a very short period. That is something of great value.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In the final half minute that I have, I appeal to those who  are involved in dissident republican activity to desist and to reflect on what  they are doing, because they are simply repeating the mistakes of the past.<span class="SectionMarker"><span style="font-size:14.0pt; "> </span></span></p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Physical force will not work to achieve what they are  setting out to achieve, which, I believe, is a united Ireland. You  cannot unite Ireland  by murdering your fellow citizens. You cannot unite Ireland by murdering policemen and  policewomen who serve the community.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">4.00 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, I appeal to them to desist from violence and to  work politically to achieve what they want to achieve, which is the unity of  the Irish people. They will not succeed with violence, of that I have no doubt.  I believe that the very powerful support in the Chamber today for the PSNI  underlines the fact that those people cannot achieve, through violent means,  their ultimate political ends. I hope that the House, by uniting today, will  demonstrate that to them.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford (The  Minister of Justice)</strong>: I am responding to the debate on behalf of the  Executive as the result of a specific decision at last week&rsquo;s Executive meeting  that I should be here to give a response, even though the motion and the  amendment do not formally call for action by my Department. I want to make it  clear at the outset that I support the motion and the amendment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome what we have heard today, which is a unified  voice in the Assembly. It is absolutely important that the Assembly send out a  clear and united message to the community and to the police on this hugely  important topic. Of course, the views around the Chamber have not exactly been  unanimous. They were never going to be unanimous when dealing with an issue  such as this, given the differing backgrounds that are represented here. In  fact, it shows something of the strength of unity that it is not unanimity.  People have come from different backgrounds, we have all kinds of different  perceptions and we all bring different baggage, yet, around the simple motion  and amendment, it seems to me that we are close to achieving the unity that, I  believe, our community deserves.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The debate is a valuable opportunity for us all to  recognise, as we so rarely do, the service and commitment of those who work on  behalf of the Assembly and the entire community to tackle criminality and  terrorism in all its forms: the officers and other staff of the Police Service  and, of course, their colleagues in a number of other agencies. It is clear  that the principal target of the terrorists is police officers, yet, at the  same time, the amendment in particular recognises that those who resort to  violence are unconcerned about the lives of other civilians. They are  unconcerned about civilian injuries and the loss of business, jobs, tourism  opportunities, and so on &mdash; the losses that are inflicted on us all.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I commend the PSNI and its colleagues in an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na  for their continued determination, despite the threats that they face, to  prevent terrorist attacks and to bring to justice those responsible for them. I  welcome the significant successes that there have been in recent weeks and  months on both sides of the border in dealing with those who resort to  violence.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Nevertheless, there are other important points that need to  be made in the debate. The first, which has been highlighted by a number of  Members, perhaps more on one side of the House than on the other, is about the  police&rsquo;s commitment, supported by the Department of Justice, the Policing Board  and many others, to neighbourhood policing, community safety and key priorities  to ensure a service that meets the needs of the community as a whole. Those  will not be sacrificed. Let us remember the words of the Chief Constable, Matt  Baggott, who said:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;It is the ambition of the Police Service of Northern Ireland  to be the finest personal, professional and protective police service in the  World&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">and</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;community policing is the means to achieve this.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In the face of the threats that police officers are under,  the determination to continue with that policing for the entire community must  be respected by us all. In the aftermath of Constable Ronan Kerr&rsquo;s murder, the  chairman of the Police Federation said that the police:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;will never be deterred by terrorism from doing our  duty and serving the whole community.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Perhaps even more poignantly, a young Catholic  officer interviewed by the BBC in the summer said:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;every person that needs us, needs our help or advice,  that&rsquo;s who I work for&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">If that is not a clear statement of what policing  in the community means from the perception of a new, young constable, one that  is would differ very little.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Let us also remember the public statements that were made  by political leaders, Church leaders and leaders in every section of this  community in the face of the murder of Ronan Kerr earlier this year. Let us  remember the determination that was expressed in particular by the First  Minister and deputy First Minister to continue to make the necessary progress  for this society. I stood with them and the Chief Constable that day. The  symbolism of the Chief Constable, accompanied by three political  representatives from very different backgrounds but who were united, in the  context of the devolution of justice, to show that the Executive and Assembly  could work together, cannot be overstated.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Let us remember the words of Nuala Kerr, who said:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;We were so proud of Ronan and all that he stood for.  Don&rsquo;t let his death be in vain.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">I think that the response that we have seen in the  Chamber shows that his death was not in vain. Sometimes, we have produced that  unity in the short term in the face of a particular act of violence. The fact  that the Assembly is having a measured and sensible debate about the response  to violence and, looking at the wider circumstances, the recognition from both  sides of the House of something of the perception of the others in the House,  has been a very positive statement.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Let us look at something of what normal policing means.  Earlier this year, we had the publication by the police of their principles of  policing. They stated that the police will put communities and victims first.  The policing plan, which was prepared by the Department and the Policing Board  in conjunction with the views of district policing partnerships, refers to a  clear focus on policing with the community and a focus on delivering an  excellent service. Community policing is and must be the bedrock of policing  here. That is why confidence in the Police Service is at such a high level.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Policing is far from the only response to the threat that  we face from terrorists. We all need to play our part in the Chamber and the  community to assist the police by uniting to demonstrate to terrorists from whatever  quarter, and whatever cause they claim, that their actions are out of step with  the vast majority of the people of this island, who have rejected violence and  wish to see a peaceful solution to our issues.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As Minister, I commit myself to supporting work that will  remove the causes of conflict in our community so that we can develop a safer  and shared community. I will continue to work on the relevant issues such as  the community safety strategy, the reducing offending strategy, the work that  we talked about during Question Time on removing or remodelling interfaces in  line with community aspirations, and assisting in reducing tension around  parades and public order generally. Those are ways in which the Department of  Justice and every Member can help to build a positive future in which  communities can see the positive impact that the devolution of justice can make  and has started to make over the past 18 months.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Of course, it is not enough that justice has been devolved.  This is a matter for partnership around the Executive table, in the House, on  the Policing Board and in the Assembly Committees, especially the Committee for  Justice. I stress that ongoing community support for the Police Service is  vital in the work that it does to keep us all safe. I am glad of this  opportunity to remind the public of the importance of that support and to  encourage them to assist the police in any way they can. In return, we expect  the police to serve the community. We expect them to operate professionally and  in a manner that is compliant with human rights. That means protecting the  public and officers, and pursuing terrorists, within the law. The service is  naturally and rightly accountable in a variety of ways for its role and  operation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I assure Members that, as Justice Minister, I will continue  to work with all Members, especially Executive colleagues, to help to build a  positive future in which all of us, including police officers, members of the  wider community and ordinary citizens, can be free from the fear of terrorist  attack.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As I said earlier, too often in the past, we have seen  Members united in the short term in the face of specific terrorist acts. I  welcome the way in which the debate has been conducted. I welcome the united  views that have been expressed. That is unity in an extremely positive sense  because it is support for the Police Service, the Chief Constable and all of  his officers, and the work that they do in policing with the community.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I trust that all Members will feel able to join together in  supporting the motion and the amendment to show such unity in the face of  terrorism and in support of the Police Service.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCartney</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Beidh m&eacute; ag labhairt ar son an  leasaithe. Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I will speak in favour of the  amendment. I hope that Members have seen the amendment as strengthening the  motion. In particular, I hope that, when Gerry Kelly took an intervention from  the mover of the motion, Ian McCrea, he went some way to allaying the fears  about labels or designation. The same applies to Ross Hussey&rsquo;s comments. Gerry  Kelly said that this is not about labels but about ensuring that we have a  united voice against all attacks that are made on our community. I hope that,  when Members come to vote, they will see the spirit and intention of the  amendment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Sinn F&eacute;in is totally and absolutely opposed to all attacks,  be they on persons or on property. Gerry Kelly said that, when you say that you  are opposed to all attacks on all persons, including PSNI officers, people  sometimes think that you see them as a category that is separate from the rest  of the community. I hope that Gerry Kelly addressed that. They are part of the  community and do not stand apart from it. In that sense, therefore, we want that  point to be realised.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We also stand opposed to all those who attack persons and  property, and we do so without reservation or designation. As we go forward,  that is important. We hope that our amendment, if accepted, will send a very  clear message to the community that the Assembly stands opposed to all attacks  on all persons and all property. It is very important that we send that  message.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That message cannot stand in isolation, because we have to  show political leadership. The message will be stronger if such leadership runs  alongside it. In my opinion, key to that leadership is the creation of a  society that is based on mutual co-operation, respect and equality.  Underpinning that must be an attempt by all of us to ensure that prosperity is  brought to the lives of the people whom we represent. Therefore, these attacks  can be seen in that context.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will dwell on one particular initiative that took place  in Derry in my constituency of Foyle, and I  know that the Ceann Comhairle &mdash; the Speaker &mdash; was also involved in it. That  initiative is a good example of co-operation, and, in the main, it was a  response to the two car bomb attacks in the city. At the end of last year and  coming into the new year, political representatives and people from across the  city came together and tried to come up with an agreed position on how we would  move forward. People came from all shades, and we accepted that there were  political differences and different political perspectives. We were able to  agree a statement, part of which read:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Any attack against any part of the city and region or  against any person or people in or of the area is an attack against the  interests of everyone and against the future wellbeing of this City and its  people.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That message can be stretched right across the North and  across the island   of Ireland. It is  important that we do that, because people appreciate the strength of the  message. There was no need for labels or for designation. When people in our  city read the message and saw the work that had gone into the statement, they  did not ask whether it referred to attacks by dissident republicans on the PSNI  or those by vigilante groups on individuals in our community. They got a very  clear message that the city and its political representatives were totally and  absolutely opposed to any attack on any person or property in our city.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That is the message that we must send today, and, as I say,  it can extend right across the North and across the island. That is the tone of  and the sentiment behind our amendment, and that is why we ask that the House  not divide on it. I acknowledge that the Minister is here. As he outlined, he  did not have to respond on behalf of the Department, but we all welcome his  positive tone and his lead in calling for support for the motion.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">4.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Craig</strong>: I  want to take this opportunity to thank all who participated in the debate. I  believe that the debate is significant, and the reason is quite simple. Given  that we have come out of 30 years of violence, during which the Royal Ulster  Constabulary successfully defended and protected the rights of our citizens  against terrorist attacks, and have moved into a new era of peace, which has  been marked by the Assembly, there is an onus on all of us here today to give  leadership and to stand up to those who continue to commit acts of terrorism  and refuse to accept the will of the people of Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">After the indefensible and sickening murders of Sappers  Azimkar and Quinsey, outside Massereene Barracks in Antrim, and the murder of  Constable Stephen Carroll, who was responding to a call involving a community  policing matter, the deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland, Martin  McGuinness, called those involved in the incidents &ldquo;traitors&rdquo; &mdash; a very strong  word indeed. It came from someone who, at the end of the day, confessed to his  membership of the IRA. There are Members in the House who refuse to recognise  that step forward, but I am not one of them. That was a statement of how far  forward we have moved and why we stand here today. We must give our full,  wholehearted support to the Chief Constable and the PSNI. There must be no ifs,  buts or maybes about whichever group decides to take up arms against the will  of the people of Northern    Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I, for one, want to thank the PSNI for all that it has done  to cope with the situation in which it finds itself. Many serving officers have  been left with physical and mental scars. I speak with some experience because  some of those officers are my friends and colleagues, and I know what they have  been through. I also want to pay a huge tribute to the 300 members of the RUC  who made the supreme sacrifice, and to their families. We are always reminded  of them &mdash; some of us have very personal reminders &mdash; and we will always remember  them.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I do not want to single out any one victim or victims, but  given the inquiry south of the border into the IRA murders of RUC officers  Harry Breen and Bob Buchanan outside Newry in 1989, I want to point out that  those murders are, quite frankly, no different from the murders of PSNI  officers in recent times. We all hope and pray that no one else is killed at  the hands of terrorism. However, given the significant increase in violence  that we have seen, as my colleague pointed out at the start of the debate, we  cannot rule that out. Nevertheless, what we can do today is to send out a clear  message to the terrorists about what the House believes: democracy is the only  way forward.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Like many in the House, I knew nothing but the way of  violence in my youth. That was the way that was imposed on me; I did not have  an option. We lived through 30 years of waking up every day to hear a list  being read out on the morning news of the people who had been murdered.  Ironically, the programme is now called &lsquo;Good Morning Ulster&rsquo;, but back then  there was never a &ldquo;good morning&rdquo;. I will not go into the rights and wrongs of  who murdered whom. However, that was my youth, and that is what I lived with.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Some of it is quite comical; to this day I have not got  used to the fact that when you walk into a shop you do not get searched. I also  always found it strange when you went to another country and were not searched.  That is the progress that this House and this process have brought. However,  there are those who refuse to recognise that process and progress. I just wish  that they would open their eyes and, more important, their ears and listen to  what was said here today.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The fact that Gerry Kelly mentioned dissidents is a  significant point in the history of this House. There is recognition by all  Members and parties that the only way forward is through dialogue and  democracy. We need to send out a clear message to those who think that they can  get their way through violence, whether they label themselves loyalists or  dissidents, that that is not the way forward. That way failed my generation for  30 years. We are not going back there; we are not having it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I could go through the long list of what Members said,  because I listed their main points in bullet form. What shines out is quite  simple: every one of them paid tribute to serving officers and the stress and  pressure that they are under; everyone supported the police and security forces  in their efforts; everyone paid tribute to those who made the ultimate  sacrifice in securing our safety in this community; and everyone pointed out  that the only way forward is for the police to have the full support of all  communities in Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have little more to say about that. However, I appeal to  the House to send out a clear message to the people of Northern Ireland and to  those who still think that there is a way forward through violence: there is no  room for violence in Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland, the United  Kingdom or anywhere else. The way forward is through democracy, which is being  exercised in this House tonight.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I support the motion and the amendment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question, That the amendment be made, put and agreed  to.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Main Question, as amended, put and agreed to.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">That this Assembly stands united against continued  attacks on the PSNI and the wider community; condemns any attempts on the lives  of officers; and fully supports the Chief Constable and the PSNI officers in  dealing with this threat in a way that gives primacy to community policing, is  human rights compliant and engenders greater confidence throughout the whole  community.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Motion made:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">That the Assembly do now adjourn. &mdash; [Mr Speaker.]</p>
    <p class="H3SubHeading"><a name="6"></a>Adjournment</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">Flags and Emblems: East Belfast</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The proposer of the Adjournment topic will have 15 minutes in which to speak.  All other Members who are called to speak will have approximately seven  minutes.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lyttle</strong>: I  thank you for the opportunity to discuss the display of flags and emblems in  east Belfast, which is not only a local issue but one of regional significance.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to make myself clear today, because, unfortunately,  some Members in the House have proactively misrepresented the Alliance Party&rsquo;s  position on this emotive issue for their own political gain. Alliance upholds  the right to freedom of expression that does not infringe on other people&rsquo;s  rights or breach the hard-earned peace in this community. We actively encourage  positive celebration of culture and identity and recognise the right of an  individual to display non-proscribed flags on their own private property on any  day of the year.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, I hope that all Members agree that the display of  flags in order to demarcate territory or to intimidate, including flags  depicting the names of proscribed organisations, is negative for east Belfast  and undermines peace and progress in Northern Ireland. As I stand here, in the  middle of October, there are flags of different nationalities displayed on  public street furniture across east Belfast in a tattered state. Some of them  are even upside down. Is that really the way we want to express our culture and  identity?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We have had a difficult summer in east Belfast with an  increase in the display of flags, some of which display the names of proscribed  organisations, and new wall murals that are alleged to be in contravention of  the Public Order (Northern Ireland) Order 1987 and the Terrorism Act 2006.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister  funded Queen&rsquo;s University research which established that the display of flags  on public street furniture, flags depicting the names of proscribed  organisations and flags that are left to tatter for months after commemorative dates  impacts negatively on areas. I am not sure whether we needed Queen&rsquo;s research  to tell us that. Those types of displays are considered intimidatory, bad for  good relations and bad for development in areas that need it the most.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In the 2008 Northern Ireland life and times survey, 84% of  respondents objected to the display of flags on lamp posts. I have received  anonymous correspondence from many constituents, including those from expressed  Protestant backgrounds and inner-city areas who were too afraid to give their  details, expressing concern about the impact that such displays have on our  community. I have heard from businesses in inner-city areas of east Belfast  that have experienced losses, have laid off staff and are considering  relocating as a direct result of the display of illegal flags and emblems in  their area.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Perhaps most importantly for the Assembly, those residents  and businesspeople are asking why elected representatives and the PSNI have so  far been unable to do anything about the issue. Members of this House,  particularly those from East Belfast, including the First Minister of Northern  Ireland, need to listen to those anonymous residents who are too afraid to give  their details. We need to listen to businesspeople living in our constituency  who are too afraid to give their details.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">This is not about limiting the expression of identity,  unionist or nationalist. It is about saying clearly that the consequences of  the problem are serious. I recognise that this is not just an issue for east  Belfast, and that if I am to call for change in east Belfast I must also call  for change across Northern Ireland. I also have to express serious concern that  a mural depicting masked men was unveiled this summer in west Belfast by  Members of the House.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I must reference the positive work that also goes on in our  communities, particularly in east Belfast, which has led the way on this issue  in many respects. Many people in east Belfast, including those with an  expressed loyalist background, have worked courageously on Re-imaging Communities  projects, supported by the Arts Council of Northern Ireland and Belfast City  Council. Those projects have shown how works depicting the Titanic, CS Lewis  and shared future murals can display and record the culture and identity of  east Belfast in a way that promotes community spirit, development and good  relations in the area.<span class="SectionMarker"><span style="font-size:14.0pt; "> </span></span></p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">However, if we are to avoid that work being lost,  we need to take further action.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">4.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister  has policy responsibility for good relations and for the public display of  flags and emblems. If the First Minister and deputy First Minister&rsquo;s commitment  to a shared east Belfast and a shared Northern Ireland is to be taken  seriously, it is time for them to deliver a long overdue and inclusive review  of the flags protocol and to give their full support to a policy framework that  encourages the respectful display of flags and emblems that is consistent with  a shared future. That policy must also set out clear responsibilities for the  PSNI and other statutory bodies to prevent illegal displays and enforce the  legitimate rights of law abiding citizens and communities to live free from  fear or intimidation. That policy should, at the very least, deliver a more  respectful and time-bound public display of flags and the removal of tattered  and paramilitary flags to help us build a shared and better future in east  Belfast and Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Douglas</strong>:  I welcome the chance to contribute to what I believe is a timely debate. On  average, over 4,000 flags are put up on lamp posts and houses in town centres  and on arterial routes throughout Northern Ireland every July. I read somewhere  that the average number of unionist flags erected was approximately 3,500 to  250 nationalist flags.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As the Member who spoke previously said, the Office of the  First Minister and deputy First Minister commissioned the report, &lsquo;Public  Displays of Flags and Emblems in Northern Ireland&rsquo;, which was published in 2010  by the Institute of Irish Studies at Queen&rsquo;s. That report highlighted the fact  that the number of paramilitary flags being flown on main roads in Northern  Ireland during July had more than halved. Members should take note of that. I  remember speaking to Dominic Bryan from Queen&rsquo;s about how he calculated the  number of flags that were flying. He told me that he walked the streets and  arterial routes and literally counted the flags.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The protocol around flying flags, interestingly enough,  dates back to direct rule, and it was published by the then Labour Secretary of  State Paul Murphy in 2005, which was when the Assembly was in suspension.  Therefore, the time is right for us to take a fresh look at the protocol as  long as we ensure that all stakeholders have input.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The 2005 protocol aimed to work towards the removal of  flags from arterial routes and to limit the flying of flags to particular  periods. It stated:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;where flags are displayed for a festive or other  occasion, that the display is reasonably time-bounded&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">I think that we can all sign up to that. It also  stated:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;flags, including plastic ties, tape and poles, should  be removed by the community after the agreed period&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That has certainly taken place in some areas, and  it should be encouraged. Another aim was to:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;encourage communities to accept that flags displayed  which are tattered and torn or discoloured do not enhance the environment and  should be removed.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">We have all seen flags that leave us unable to  identify what or whom they belong to, and we cannot even make out the colours.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In response to the report, Duncan Morrow from the Community  Relations Council said:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;It is very disappointing to learn that six years  after the introduction of a Protocol on the public display of flags and emblems  along arterial routes that there has been little change&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I think that the Member who spoke previously mentioned the  Terrorism Act 2000. One of the clauses makes it an offence for someone to  invite support for a proscribed organisation, and that should or could cover  paramilitary flags.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I also looked up the flags protocol for the Republic of  Ireland. Again, it is interesting to note that the national flag, or the  tricolour:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;should never be defaced by placing slogans, logos,  lettering or pictures of any kind on it, for example at sporting events.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">I have been at a few sporting events at which that  flag was defaced.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In east Belfast, there has been a long history and  tradition of flying flags, especially since the outbreak of the Troubles more  than 40 years ago. A number of years ago, a protocol was established by a  loyalist commission that all flags should usually be removed by Ulster day in  September. Generally speaking, that was adhered to for a number of years.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Last weekend, I spoke to some loyalist leaders who were in  the process of removing the last flags in east Belfast. Most of those flags  have been removed. It should be noted that, very often, flags are put up by  people who are not associated with any loyalist groups, and they end up  tattered and torn. For instance, young people might put flags up, and some  people in the street might be afraid to remove them because they think that the  flags might be related to a loyalist organisation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will move on to murals and symbols. In 2003, after months  of vicious rioting at the Cluan Place/Clandeboye Gardens interface, sectarian  graffiti appeared across east Belfast. After months of discussion between  community leaders and paramilitary groups, every piece of graffiti was removed,  and, importantly, senior loyalists in the area offered to remove images of  hooded gunmen from along the main arterial routes. They did so mainly as a  gesture of goodwill but also to encourage businesses to stay and bring jobs to  the area. As the Member said, people have made very positive contributions.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A community project called The Writing is not on the Wall  was set up. It was a local project that entailed removing dozens of  paramilitary murals and replacing them with new community-friendly images  celebrating local culture and human achievement. Those murals included C.S.  Lewis, The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, George Best and the Titanic. In  the Tullycarnet estate, the grisly UFF grim reaper mural was replaced by an  image of a Catholic World War II hero. James Magennis, from the nationalist  Falls Road in west Belfast, is the only Northern Ireland man awarded the  Victoria Cross for bravery during World War II.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Fast forward to this summer, when two freshly painted  loyalist murals depicting balaclava-clad UVF men clutching machine guns and  poised for action appeared in east Belfast. The media reported at the time that  the murals were understood to have been erected in frustration over a new  republican mural in west Belfast that commemorates the 30th anniversary of Bobby  Sands&rsquo;s death and depicts shots being fired over the coffin. I decided to speak  to loyalists in east Belfast about the murals, and they conveyed to me their  frustration at alleged double standards on the issue of paramilitary murals.  They referred to the Whiterock republican mural that was erected earlier this  year and shows an IRA firing party at the 1981 funeral of hunger striker Bobby  Sands. I also spoke to Jim &ldquo;Bimbo&rdquo; Wilson, a local community worker and former  internee who has worked tirelessly to reduce tensions at the interface. He told  me that there was no difference between the east Belfast murals and the west  Belfast mural of IRA men standing in combat uniforms, firing guns and wearing  berets. Certainly, there is a window of opportunity to remove the recent east  Belfast murals if there is a positive reciprocal response from republicans in  west Belfast.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Over the years, a huge amount of positive work has been  done in east Belfast, so let us not focus too much on some of the recent  developments, albeit that some were steps backwards. There is now an  opportunity, at a devolved Administration level, to shape a new flags and  emblems protocol. However, if we are to have a Northern Ireland in which we are  at peace with ourselves, we need to engage with all stakeholders on all those  contentious issues.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maskey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I thank the Member for securing the  debate and allowing us to address the issue to some extent. However, I am not  entirely confident as to what the most positive outcome can be. Although we  probably need protocols and legislation to tackle those issues, I still firmly  believe in the need to ensure that we do so in a way that engages with  communities. We must assure people that it is not about removing their version  of history, their culture or their heritage. Rather, it is about trying to make  sure that we have a society here in which people respect one another, whether  through equality legislation at all levels of our lives or in the display of  flags and emblems.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Any future protocol has to deal with the fundamental  inequality between the British Union flag and the Irish national flag, to which  all nationalists give their political allegiance. We need to address that  elephant in the room. It is unfortunate that people driving up and down pass  what are supposed to be illegal flags, as do we on coming to the Building every  day. However, not one single person is addressing the fact that those illegal  flags are still on display.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, I suggest that if someone were to replace one of  those flags with an Irish tricolour, you can be sure that it would be removed  immediately and described as an illegal flag. It is a difficult issue that has  to be addressed if we are to treat with respect people in the community as a  whole when it comes to how they view their inheritance, their allegiance and  their cultural heritage.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The debate deals specifically with east Belfast, and,  following on from Sammy Douglas, the Member who spoke previously, I want to put  it on record that there are a number of people from what would be called the  loyalist community in east Belfast who have worked very hard over many years.  Their work is not always very popular. The great and the good do not often give  credit to some of those individuals, and quite a lot of the great and the good  would look down their nose at some of those individuals, and have done so  publicly. Sammy referred to a gentleman who has been involved in tackling  problems at interface areas, who has been involved in cultural and political  exchanges and who attended and organised many debates on a very open-ended and  inclusive agenda, and I commend that work.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Unfortunately, this year, we had an outbreak of flag mania.  We all know that there was a shift in power, or whatever it may have been, and  it is not up to me to give an analysis of that. However, everybody knows that  there was a specific problem in east Belfast earlier this year that manifested  itself in a number of ways, one of which was a massive increase in the number  of flags on public display. Unfortunately, most of them would be described as  illegal paramilitary flags. That caused tremendous annoyance and upset this  past year in particular because, as I said, it was a complete departure from  what clearly had been an ongoing reduction in the number of flags on public  display. Members have already said that we have a mixed community, and that  should be welcomed. More and more people are trying to share on an equal basis  in this community, but it is difficult if you have to move in and out of an  area that is completely and utterly emblazoned with flags, particularly if they  represent paramilitary organisations.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I do not want to second-guess people in those communities  who have allegiances, sympathy or empathy with any of those organisations or  that part of our history. This is not about an attack on that. Surely at this  time in our lives and our history it is important that we can agree some type  of protocol that would allow flags from a particular tradition or heritage to  be flown respectfully but that would also respect others who may not come from  that particular tradition. A call has to go out for clear political and civic  leadership. It is not just down to politicians or to the First and deputy First  Ministers, because whatever they agree may not be deliverable as a result of  others not putting their shoulder to the wheel. The issue goes much deeper than  party politics. If people think that it is down to the First Minister and the  deputy First Minister, they are being very foolish. It is matter of political  and civic responsibility, and it requires leadership. It also requires  discussion and debate with those who are involved in those activities.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I support the idea that we renew our flags protocol.  However, that will not be delivered unless it is backed up with legislation,  and it will certainly not be delivered if it is not backed up with civic and  political leadership at local level in those communities, with people being  prepared to discuss how best we reflect our own particular heritage, culture  and history.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I call Mr Michael Copeland.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Copeland</strong>:  Thank you very much, Mr Deputy Speaker: I thank the Member for bringing this  debate &mdash; unfurling it to a degree.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr McDonnell</strong>:  It is Mr Speaker.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Copeland</strong>:  Mr Speaker. Did I not say that, sir? That is Mr Speaker.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I was not listening to the Member.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Copeland</strong>:  Sorry, did I refer to the Speaker as Deputy Speaker? Sir, you have my most  profound apologies. The hour is late, but the mistake is unforgivable. Perhaps  I should have kept my glasses on. I do apologise.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I thank Member for unfurling &mdash; if that is the right word &mdash;  the debate and giving it an airing in the Chamber. It is important to establish  and differentiate immediately what we are talking about. In some circumstances,  a flag is just a piece of cloth, printed or woven. However, in some  circumstances, it can take on an almost mythical meaning: regimental colours;  Old Glory; the flag that flew at the Alamo; the flag that flew over the General  Post Office in Dublin in 1916; and perhaps even the standard, allegedly, of the  14th Battalion, Royal Irish Rifles (Young Citizens Volunteer Corps) that  fluttered momentarily in the third German line on 1 July 1916.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">4.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, that is not what we are talking about here. We are  talking about flags that hang, in some circumstances, until they decay, rip or  tear. They do not look loved, and they do not look respected. However, they  cause difficulties, which I fully understand, for people who do not subscribe  to what those flags represent. We are in danger of viewing flags as the problem,  when the truth may be that they are a symptom of a much deeper problem, and  treating the symptom will not always cure the underlying difficulty. Indeed,  interfering with the symptom, if it is a rash or a lesion, can lead to  infection, which can create greater difficulties.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am very proud of the district of the city of Belfast from  which I come; I always have been. I am not always proud of everything that it  does; no one could be. A number of years ago, a group of individuals decided to  launch the Dressing the City initiative, which Mr Lyttle may be aware of. They  decided to do so for no particular reason other than they felt that, in some  cases, Union flags and the device of the Government of Northern Ireland, which  is often erroneously called the Ulster flag, were flying year in, year out and  deteriorating into rags. Under that initiative, banners were sponsored and  erected on lamp posts on Templemore Avenue, a section of the Albertbridge Road,  a section of My Ladys Road and a section of the Ravenhill Road. Made from PVC,  they were put up on a specific date, taken down on a specific date and designed  to commemorate particular events appropriately, without seeking to give offence  to anyone.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will support and listen to any notion that makes east  Belfast in particular and the city of Belfast or the Province in general a more  acceptable place for us all to live. However, as was said by Mr Maskey and  echoed by Mr Douglas, what is not arrived at with the agreement, acquiescence  and understanding of the communities affected will not work; it is simply words  aimed at an audience. The same applies to walls. I know as well as anyone else  in the Chamber what those walls are, and I know that, in many cases, the people  who live on either side of them suffer in equal measure. They suffer economic  exclusion, educational under&shy;achievement and the ravages of recession and depression.  In many ways, they are identical, yet, for some ancient reason, an animosity  exists almost as an act of nature. Talk of bringing walls down without seeking  the acquiescence of those who live in their shadow and who look to them for  protection does not help. However, I noted the remarks that were made earlier  about Newington and the fence in the park.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">These issues are terribly complex, and one solution does  not fit all. We should not blunder in; we should go quietly and diligently,  like the communities who live in the vicinity of flags. Hopefully, by  agreement, the passage of time and the forgetting of ancient enmities, the  celebration of one section of our community will no longer come at the expense  of another.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr McDonnell</strong>:  I welcome the opportunity to take part in this debate, because I have long felt  that illegal flags and insensitive flag-waving and flag-flying can poison  community relations and undermine trust. Flags flown to be provocative usually  serve their purpose. They are perceived to be aggressive and threatening to  many people to whom they are directed and, indeed, many to whom they are not  supposed to be directed. Ultimately, people are intimidated to a greater or  lesser degree.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Inappropriate displays of flags and emblems can lead to  economic damage. Although we are looking at east Belfast specifically, there is  a town centre aspect to much of the Newtownards Road and the Holywood Road.  Those areas need to be safe and welcoming spaces for everyone. Beyond that,  improved relationships around interfaces will, I hope, reduce the number of  flags that are flown and murals and all the rest.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, all those things are hopes. I go back to this: the  fact is that flags poison community relations and undermine the trust that  people need to have in each other. Flags are perceived as aggressive and  threatening. They are not seen as positive statements of identity, nor do they  reflect the new disposition that we have managed to achieve here in the past 10  or 12 years. I believe that that is a disposition that the vast majority of  people want to sustain.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We in the SDLP accept that everyone has the right to  celebrate their culture and heritage, but we do not agree that flags always  make a positive contribution to community relations or to the regeneration of  our neighbourhoods. There is a degree of regret that the Executive have failed  to progress the establishment of a meaningful flags protocol that would control  the flying of flags, particularly in contentious situations. We urgently need a  protocol that deals with how DRD, the PSNI or both will remove illegally hung  flags or, frankly and from my perspective, any Union flag, tricolour or paramilitary  flag that is flown in a manner that is designed to intimidate and annoy. Such a  protocol would also deal with the prosecution of anyone who tries to replace  those flags. Quite frankly, any Union flag or tricolour that is hung out to  cause annoyance or provocation does no favours and pays no compliment to the  flag or to what it represents.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have had serious trouble with flags for years in parts of  neighbouring south Belfast. The issue is not confined to east Belfast or to the  wider Belfast area; it is an issue right across Northern Ireland. In parts of  south Belfast, we have been tortured with illegal loyalist flags that are  systemically used to intimidate Catholics and moderate unionists who do not  want their neighbourhoods turned into ghettos. Time and time again, I have seen  elderly and frail people threatened, bullied and intimidated if they object to  loyalist flags being flown &mdash; from their property, in some cases, or from lamp  posts at their gates.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">This is a divisive issue which we, as an Assembly and an  Executive, have totally failed to address. A shared future policy was created  some time ago, and a joint protocol on the flying of flags in public areas was  developed and published as long ago as 2005. That was six long years ago, and  little has happened since then. That protocol was not followed up, pursued or  implemented.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Northern Ireland life and times survey of 2008 showed  that 84% of people did not support the flying of flags from lamp posts in their  neighbourhoods. Additionally, 38% were unwilling to shop in neighbourhoods  where there were displays of loyalist flags, and that figure rose to 46% for  displays in what were perceived to be republican areas.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Queen&rsquo;s survey, which my colleague from East Belfast  referred to, was conducted between 2006 and 2009 and was published last year.  As my colleague from East Belfast said, its findings show that there has to  some extent been a reduction in the number of paramilitary flags displayed,  with their numbers dropping from 161 to 73, which is a more than 50% reduction.  However, although paramilitary flags are the most offensive, they are less  likely to be removed than other flags because of the threat that is contained  therein and the threat to anybody who tries to remove them. I have had lengthy  negotiations with the police and DRD officials, who pass the parcel to each  other because nobody quite accepts responsibility. They both feel threatened  and believe that to tackle the problem would sometimes cause more disruption  than it is worth. That is not much consolation to the people who feel  threatened and who have to sell their homes and move out of areas.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Queen&rsquo;s University survey concluded that, although the  flags protocol, which was established some time ago, worked well in some areas:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;evidence suggests that, in overall terms, it has been  largely ineffective ... there remains a lack of &lsquo;joined-up&rsquo; working by agencies  in many places.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That independent report recommended:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;that the Flags Protocol be restructured to include  District Councils&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">It also stated that displays of flags should be  time-bound to no more than two weeks. The emphasis was placed on reducing the  numbers of paramilitary flags, and it was suggested that a voluntary code of  conduct be developed for local groups.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Many other issues are involved: road safety, tourism,  intimidation and the need for a revised protocol that statutory agencies and  local groups could sign up to. I could go into a lot of those, but the bottom  line is that the flying of illegal flags is damaging to the economy, tourism  and community well-being. We must do all that we can to tackle this issue, not  just in east Belfast but right across Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Newton</strong>: I  welcome the opportunity to speak in the debate. I also welcome the  acknowledgement by the Member who secured the debate that this is not  exclusively an east Belfast issue but a feature of life in Northern Ireland,  and that it is not exclusively a unionist issue but has connections with the  nationalist community, predominantly the flying of the flag of the Republic of  Ireland in parts of Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I, like Dr McDonnell and my colleague Sammy Douglas, want  to pay tribute to the work done by Queen&rsquo;s University in its report on the  display of flags and emblems in Northern Ireland. Without that piece of work,  we would have been unable to quantify the situation or determine what progress  has been made. I believe that we have made progress.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We can make all sorts of broad assumptions or conclusions  about the display and regulation of flags as political symbols. In east  Belfast, the vast bulk of the political symbols displayed are on arterial  routes, and they are flags, although mention has been made of murals. I am not  sure whether the debate is about the flying of illegal flags or the flying of  flags illegally, but the issue needs to be addressed. The total number of flags  that are on display peaks during the marching season; we all know that. In many  cases, flags are put up, certainly in the east of the city, to mark out  marching routes. That is a fact, and it has been going on for generations. The  flags predominantly stay up throughout the summer months. The vast majority of  them are the national flag, or the Ulster flag, also referred to as the flag of  the Government of Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As I said earlier, progress has been made. Dr McDonnell  referred to the figures on the reduction in the numbers of paramilitary flags.  The decisions to reduce the numbers of flags have been made by those who have  an affiliation to one paramilitary group or another. That is to be welcomed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Michael Copeland referred to other initiatives taken by  locally based community groups to try to remove what was a controversial issue.  For example, bannerettes were erected in a non-offensive way along marching  routes as a symbol of the cultural and historical aspects of life in Northern  Ireland from the unionist perspective. I happen to be quite proud that I  sponsored one of those bannerettes, which has a photograph of Her Majesty the  Queen on it. Two local groups embarked on that welcome initiative. They did so  for their own reasons, which were very positive.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">5.00 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Dr McDonnell referred to the life and times survey and  indicated that although a joint protocol in relation to flags in public areas  has been utilised well in some areas, evidence suggests that, in overall terms,  it has been largely ineffective. I have indicated that I believe that progress  has been made, and the figures sustain that. Police officers, and workers from  many key agencies such as the Roads Service, the Housing Executive, and so on,  have been involved in local issues, and they have been effective. Surely, the  situation, at least in part, is that we need to encourage more of that PSNI  statutory involvement from the Housing Executive, Roads Service and so on, to  see if further progress can be made.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will finish by saying that we need to acknowledge that  progress has been made. It is not all negative. I understand where Members are  coming from, be it at a local level by those statutory agencies, and encourage  more of that. However, I agree with my colleague Sammy Douglas that we need to  look again at the protocol for the flying of flags. Hopefully, we can arrive at  a much more positive situation than many people see at this moment in time.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Cochrane</strong>:  As others have already said, the issue of flags and emblems not only affects  our constituents in East Belfast but has a much wider grip right across the  region. Flags and emblems have a long history of commemorating and celebrating  a variety of occasions and are seemingly part of the fabric of the streetscape  in east Belfast and beyond. Indeed, the joint protocol in relation to flags  flown in public areas asserts that the use of flags in instances such as  celebration or festivity is not normally an issue. However, we cannot overlook  the growing problem of flags flying from lamp posts for indeterminate periods  and the demarcation of public space that that inevitably creates. That is not  constructive to social understanding or to economic development, at a time when  it is most needed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although we appreciate that some people consider that those  symbols represent their traditional and cultural values, we must not ignore the  feelings of the silent majority who fail to share the same sentiments.  Distinctions must be made on flags, in particular, and reticent inaction must  be substituted with greater regulation and enhanced enforcement.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Members will be aware of the strict time constraints that  exist for election posters throughout the election period. However, the flags protocol  is seemingly disregarded when it comes to flags attached to lamp posts.  Furthermore, any display of paramilitary emblems is illegal on a number of  grounds, primarily in accordance with article 19 of the Public Order (NI) Order  1987, and, additionally, under the Terrorism Act 2000, which prohibits the  display of articles that may arouse suspicion of membership of or support for a  proscribed organisation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The launch of two corresponding reports in 2005 &mdash; &lsquo;A Shared  Future&rsquo; and the &lsquo;Joint Protocol in Relation to the Display of Flags in Public  Areas&rsquo; &mdash; identified main roads and town centres as significant front lines in  the symbolic demarcation of public spaces here in Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Others have already referred to the OFMDFM-commissioned  report back in 2006. That research has been undertaken annually in subsequent  years and has examined the number of displays in key areas, the nature of the  displayed emblems, and, ultimately, the removal rates following key cultural  events around Easter and July. The findings from the 2010 report tell us that,  over the five years, flags have accounted for the overwhelming majority of  emblems displayed, with around three quarters of those displayed in July 2010  being attached to lamp posts. Furthermore, the removal rate after the summer of  2010 was only 67%. In other words, of the 3,239 flags that were flying from  lamp posts in July 2010, more than 1,000 were still there in September.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Not only does that indeterminate time for the display of  flags impose an unseasonable clannish camouflage on our constituency, but the  elements of our infamous weather also take their toll on those flags and, as  time progresses, leave them in a state that would instil pride in few people.  Members need only take a short drive through east Belfast to see for themselves  the torn and discoloured flags that still hang from countless lamp posts. Those  flags are an ongoing source of contention for many of my constituents in East  Belfast. I firmly believe that a new flags protocol with sufficient enforcement  procedures would go a long way to addressing the failings in existing  provision. As it stands, the current protocol sets out a framework for the  regulation of flags and priorities for action. However, it is unclear as to how  those can best be taken forward.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is a fearful reluctance on the part of Roads Service  and the Housing Executive to remove flags from their properties without consent  from local community representatives. Although the PSNI has previously removed  flags in some areas without first seeking local permission, that willingness  has not yet been evidenced across the board.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The reports that were brought forward by Queen&rsquo;s University  raised other interesting points for consideration, specifically the suggestion  of district councils&rsquo; involvement in co-ordinating a response; the need to  focus on a reduction of the timescale of flags as opposed to outright removal;  and a call for enhanced public access to information and consultation on the  part of OFMDFM. The Alliance Party believes that the onus is on this  Administration to build on the work that has been done previously on the issue  and to use to their advantage the wealth of gainful information that has  already been gathered. In the light of all that we have touched on, we must  take those factors into consideration going forward and work together to  establish and enforce an expressive and suitable new flags protocol.</p>
