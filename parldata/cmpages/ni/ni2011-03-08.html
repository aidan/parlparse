    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P J Bradley</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Speaker. On Monday 14 February 2011, a Member made and  repeated a falsehood about my declarations of interest at Committee meetings  during evidence sessions on the Welfare of Animals Bill. My accuser stated that  at no time did I declare my honorary membership of the Northern Ireland  veterinary association during meetings of the Committee. You will recall, Mr  Speaker, that, at the end of the debate on 14 February, I brought the wrongful  allegations to your attention.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Will you confirm to the House that you have received a copy  of correspondence from the Agriculture and Rural Development Committee office  that states categorically that I declared my interests at the appropriate times  during the taking of evidence on the Welfare of Animals Bill?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I thank the Member for his point of order. As the House knows, I do not  normally get involved in Committee business. However, the Member has spoken to  me about the issue outside the House, and, as he said, he raised it previously  in a point of order. I know that the Member feels very strongly about the  matter, and he has shown me correspondence to confirm what he said in the House  about properly declaring his interests at meetings of that Committee. I am  content with that evidence. The Member clearly has that on the record, and I  now consider the matter to be closed. Once again, I thank the Member for his  point of order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Campbell</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Speaker. On 1 February, I raised a very important issue  with the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety through an  urgent question for written answer. My understanding is that such questions  should be responded to within two working days. My question, without  elaborating on it, was about an inactivity and lack of response from the Minister.  That was the issue that I raised, and 25 working days later I have still not  had a response. I seek your guidance about what Members should do if they raise  the issue of inactivity from Ministers and get inactivity by way of response.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I thank the Member for his point of order. If Members have exhausted all other  channels and find that they still cannot get an answer from a Minister to a  particular question, I am happy for them to raise that as a point of order in  the House and get it on the record. After that, I will write to the Minister to  see how we can get an answer to the particular question. I will do that on this  occasion.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Order. Before we begin, I wish to advise the House that a  valid petition of concern was presented on Monday 7 March 2011 in relation to  two amendments published for today&rsquo;s Consideration Stage of the Planning Bill.  Amendment Nos 20 and 102, which are in group 3, deal with planning control. The  votes on those matters will be on a cross-community basis and may take place  today.</p>
    <p class="H3SubHeading"><a name="a2"></a>Ministerial Statement</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">Water Services: Freeze-Thaw December 2010</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development (Mr Murphy)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle.  I welcome this opportunity to update the Assembly on the conclusions of the  review into the major interruption to water supplies over Christmas and the new  year.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The composite report, which was published last week, gives  us a comprehensive account of the events during the emergency. I thank the  Utility Regulator and the two reviewers appointed by the Office of the First  Minister and deputy First Minister (OFMDFM) &mdash; Heather Moorhead and Phil Holder  &mdash; for their hard work. Both strands of the review were completed within a very  challenging timescale. The report contains a number of detailed conclusions.  NIW (Northern Ireland Water) and stakeholders will need to absorb those and  respond to them in a vigorous and positive way. The interim chief executive of  NIW has already accepted the report&rsquo;s findings. A great deal of work will be  involved in taking the necessary actions forward, and it would not be sensible  for me to try to deal in detail with the 60-odd recommendations today. However,  the publication of the report gives us an opportunity to reflect on, and  acknowledge, some realities.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Turning to the emergency itself, the regulator said that  the winter weather was an exceptional once-in-a-100-year event. The  record-breaking period of sub-zero temperatures over two weeks was followed by  an equally dramatic thaw on Sunday 26 December. The report states that:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;temperatures jumped up by 20&deg;C in a few hours right  across Northern Ireland.  As a result, up to 40,000 bursts on customers&rsquo; pipes which had occurred during  the cold weather all started to leak, more or less at the same time.  Consequently on Monday 27 leakage was at a level not previously experienced and  over the following days parts of NIW&rsquo;s water network drained down and thousands  of customers lost their water supplies. As reservoir capacity dwindled, some  areas went without any supply and in other areas, NIW instituted rota cuts to  maintain supplies to hospitals and other essential facilities; a situation  unknown in Northern Ireland in a decade. It took NIW just over a week to refill  its system and restore water supplies to all its customers.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The regulator  recognises that NIW&rsquo;s:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Front line operational teams worked effectively in  very challenging weather conditions.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I reiterate my thanks to all those in NIW, and in many  other organisations, who helped to deal with the emergency. I am grateful for the  co-operation that was so willingly offered and given.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Nonetheless, despite the efforts of NIW staff and  contractors, the overall response fell far short of customer expectations. As  the report says:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The consequences of the incident were exacerbated by  the fact that the emergency response led by NIW was wholly inadequate. There  was ineffective communication with customers and no comprehensive arrangements  for alternative supplies of water. The communications failure meant that in the  days immediately following the thaw, many customers were losing their water  without any warning or explanation.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As was said at the time, exceptional conditions require an  exceptional response. The emergency resulted in a significant failure to  deliver the most basic services to people, and NIW has to learn lessons from  that, especially about communication with customers during such incidents.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The regulator warns that such extreme conditions:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;with a changing climate could recur in the near  future.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">NIW needs to meet the challenge of dealing with similar  weather conditions in the future. Ensuring the continuance of supplies and  services for customers is the priority. As I said, the regulator has completed  a thorough investigation and produced conclusions that are detailed in the  report and which give a clear way forward on how NIW can improve its emergency  response. I will work with NIW and stakeholders to ensure that the appropriate  actions are taken. As the report says,  to mitigate future emergencies, we need to acknowledge that:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;This would require community wide action.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The regulator&rsquo;s analysis indicates that:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;at least 80 of the increased demand resulted from  usage or bursts on consumers&rsquo; properties. Commercial properties were closed  during the holiday period and bursts went unnoticed and ran for longer. Survey  evidence estimates that there were bursts on more than 40,000 customers&rsquo;  properties (domestic and non-domestic).&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Action to inform people how they can support the public  supply is needed, and the review includes recommendations in that area.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Turning to the infrastructure, the regulator concludes that  NI Water&rsquo;s mains performed as well as could be expected under the harsh  conditions in comparison with other water mains in the UK. That  confirms that the investment we have made, nearly &pound;1 billion over the last four  years, is helping to improve the service and reverse the lack of investment in  earlier decades. Obviously, we still have some way to go. Leakage is not yet at  economic, let alone sustainable, levels and there are many areas where  infrastructure needs to be renewed. Despite the reduction in funding available  to the Executive, I have managed to increase investment in water significantly  from within my Department&rsquo;s budget to partly meet any shortfalls. At over &pound;660  million, I have delivered funding for a substantial programme, and it will  allow me to provide NIW with the water mains investment levels recommended by  the regulator in its final determination.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In relation to my  role and that of my Department, the report concluded that I:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;acted in a manner consistent with the governance  requirements&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">It says that I was fully engaged for the entire  period in seeking to deal with the situation and performed all of my roles and  responsibilities effectively. It adds that:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Departmental officials also provided timely support  and assistance in the crisis.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">I am content that the report recognises what I said  at the time, that this was an operational matter and that responsibility lay  with NIW. That may not suit some commentators, but it is the reality. I accept  that calls for me to be held personally responsible are part and parcel of  politics, but it is time to move on from the deliberate misunderstanding and  convenient ignorance to deal with the reality of the relationship we have with  NIW.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The external reviewers identified the unique hybrid  governance arrangements which currently exist. We need to face up to the fact  that these arrangements, which I inherited from direct rule Ministers, are at  odds with what the Executive have chosen to do. I have said that we need to  examine the relationship and clarify the situation as we do so. Others have  opposed this, unfortunately including the majority on the Committee for  Regional Development, but we will need to do deal with this in the future.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Those who do not want to accept these conclusions will  attack the process. They will say that the report was biased or a whitewash. We  have already seen this line, and we saw it pedalled by some almost before the  review began and during the review. Stories about Facebook friends and  candidate lists were exaggerated to suggest potential conflicts of interest,  even when those involved were not aware of the links. Allegations of conflict  over potential NIW board appointments and the regulator&rsquo;s existing role in  NIW&rsquo;s governance were raised by others, when, logically, I should have been the  one concerned about them. I was prepared to set aside any reservations and support  the review. It is time for others to accept that this review was properly and  professionally conducted.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There are huge challenges ahead for our water and sewerage  services, and everyone needs to support NIW in meeting them.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Regional Development (Mr Cobain)</strong>: The Regional  Development Committee did not oppose the:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;need to examine the relationship and clarify the  situation&rdquo;,</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">to quote the Minister. It made no comment on the  policy merits of the proposed water and sewerage Bill. The Committee, by  majority vote, was not happy to rush through, without Committee Stage, a Bill  on the governance of Northern Ireland Water. It is not clear to me how it is  possible to:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;examine the relationship and clarify the situation&rdquo;,</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">if there is no time to do any examination or to  seek any clarification.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, does the Minister accept the report&rsquo;s finding that  the external reviewers have included that, while the governance arrangements  are complex, they were clear to the stakeholders and they, therefore, had no  material impact on the crisis?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: I accept what the Chairperson has said. I went before  the Committee and argued that there was an opportunity in the remainder of this  mandate to address some of the governance arrangements, which have left the  organisation NIW operating, on the one hand, as a company under company law  but, on the other hand, answerable to the public purse under the accountancy  arrangements that we have. We had an opportunity to deal with that and a number  of other issues.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There was time in this mandate to do that. The Committee is  entitled to its own view on the issue of accelerated passage for the Bill.  Nonetheless, at every opportunity, where people have been critical of NIW and  said that it needs to change, a lot of parties here have talked the talk; very  few of them have walked the walk.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Miss McIlveen</strong>:  I concur with the comments made by the Chairperson in relation to the request  for accelerated passage. Will the Minister tell the House whether the large  scale failure of supply in Northern Ireland Water features as a risk on the  Department&rsquo;s risk register? If it does, who has responsibility for it? How is  it tested, and how frequently?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: The Department&rsquo;s risk register looks at the areas  over which the Department exercises control. The Department does not exercise  control over the risk management of NIW. It has its own risk register. The  regulator looked at that issue, as did the NIW report. At every meeting that is  held, the Department is represented. Obviously, those people make a  professional assessment of the areas of risk in their own area of operation.  Immediately after the crisis, we tried to restore some degree of public  confidence by asking for that to be externally validated by a professional from  outside NIW. The report that came back to the Department said that they were  satisfied that NIW was managing those risks. However, they recognised the need  for improvements in response to the emergency and for a longer-term resilience  plan to be worked through. That concurs with some of the findings of this  review.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Boylan</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh r&aacute;iteas an Aire. I  welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement. The party to our left, the SDLP, says that  the report is a whitewash and that those appointed to look at the leadership,  management and governance aspects of the Minister&rsquo;s Department and role were  conflicted. What his view of that allegation?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: Can I say that &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. Allow the Minister to continue.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: Questions were raised around that. Ironically, if  those people were conflicted, I should have been the person most concerned  about that, because that would have gone against rather than for me. The  appointments for the independent part of the review were made by OFMDFM. It was  satisfied that the people whom it had appointed were not conflicted in any way,  and I was happy to accept that assurance. Indeed, questions were also raised  around the regulator. However, I think that it is quite clear from his report  that the issue was approached in a very thorough and professional way, because  it does not pull any punches about where improvements are needed. I think that  that is a very useful service for this Assembly, in terms of the immediate  response of NIW to any further emergency weather situation, and for the  incoming Assembly and Executive in the new mandate, in terms of the future of  NIW as an organisation.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  Mr Speaker, had I been allowed the opportunity to make a point of order, I  would have made it clear that knowingly misleading the House is not a good  reflection on any of us, and the previous comment did just that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Many consumers will be shocked to read this report and to  see that it spends a lot of time justifying the actions of a few and says very  little about where the hundreds of thousands of people affected by the  freeze-thaw incident will see some improvement to their service in the years  ahead. The Minister suggested that we should talk the talk and walk the walk,  so why did he write to me 10 days ago refusing an offer to sit down around the  table with colleagues from the other parties to discuss the long-term future of  Northern Ireland Water? Why is the Minister uninterested in having a debate on  a cross-party basis about the future of Northern Ireland Water?</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">10.45 am</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: I am not sure what exact terminology the Member used  about the report. However, when the report was published, he said that it was  discredited. I do not know whether or not he used the term &ldquo;whitewash&rdquo;, but it  was reported in the media that he did. I think that that moved, in a very  serious way, from suggesting that the people responsible for conducting the  report were perceived to be in some way conflicted to actually alleging that  they conspired in some way to cover up what he believes to be the truth of the  situation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As regards measures for consumers, the report makes a very  significant number of recommendations for improvement. That was the focus of  this report and of the Executive&rsquo;s action from the moment that the crisis  happened. Very quickly after that, we held meetings with NIW about short-term  resilience, improvement and lessons learnt. All of that was focused on  consumers and on ensuring that we did not have a repeat of the lack of service  that was provided to consumers over the Christmas period. That was the  Executive&rsquo;s entire focus. Therefore, to say that consumers were somehow ignored  in all of this is a very loose interpretation, if not a misrepresentation, of  the report altogether.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">His suggestion is almost like the &lsquo;Belfast  Telegraph&rsquo;-inspired suggestion for academic selection: let us create another  process for something to happen. There is already a Regional Development  Committee, which has responsibility for scrutinising all of the Department&rsquo;s  work, and I have engaged with it on issues around NIW for four years. I have  undertaken to take a paper on the future of NIW to the Executive.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am not sure whether Mr McDevitt thinks that the regional  development spokespersons in every party have more authority than his colleague  who sits on the Executive. However, the actual decisions on recommendations  that are to be brought to the Assembly will be made at the Executive table in  an open and transparent process, not in some committee meeting that is not  minuted, regulated or part of any function of the Executive. If the Member is  interested in openness and transparency, it is through the structures of the  Assembly, such as the Committee for Regional Development, which he sits on, the  Executive Committee or the Assembly itself, that discussions and debates can be  had in a very open and transparent way.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member needs to be consistent. I understand that he has  a difficulty with consistency, given that he opposed water charges but now  supports a mutualised company that would involve such charges. He wants the &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: Throughout the crisis, the SDLP mantra was that I  should take responsibility. It is now proposing a mutualised company that is  further removed from government. That would mean that government would have  less authority and control over the provision of water and sewerage services.  The only thing consistent about his &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: The only thing consistent about his propositions thus  far is their inconsistency.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lo</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his statement. It is very important that the report came  out so quickly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I understand that the report says that the front line  operational teams worked effectively in what were, no doubt, very challenging  weather conditions. However, I have talked to staff and union representatives  from Northern Ireland Water who are quite critical of the fact that many of the  staff who were on standby during the crisis were not called in. Have the  Minister and the regulator met the union to talk about its criticism of  staffing at that time?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: I spoke to the unions, and I encouraged them to make  representations to make their views known to the regulator, who conducted the  report. I believe that they did so. Unions continuously make representations on  working arrangements. They are quite entitled to do that, and they can have  valid points to make. It is my understanding that the regulator took evidence  from the unions, assessed that response and came to the conclusions that are in  his report.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr G Robinson</strong>:  Does the Minister feel that the recommendations will help to prevent a  reoccurrence of this winter&rsquo;s chaos? How does he define the term &ldquo;community  wide action&rdquo;? Further, does the Minister believe that he is the right person to  oversee the future of Northern Ireland Water?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: In answer to the last question, the electorate will  determine that in about eight or nine weeks. My party will then determine  whether I get back into a ministerial role. It will be the luck of the draw, or  non-luck of the draw, if that role is in the Department for Regional  Development (DRD), depending on how things play out. There are a lot of hurdles  to be jumped before that question is concluded.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There are recommendations in the report, and, I think that  the regulator&rsquo;s line on this is that NIW was prepared for the expected but  unprepared for the unexpected. Although NIW felt that it had an incident plan  in place that was able to cope, it certainly was not able to cope with the  weather situation that was thrown at us over the Christmas period. There are  very serious recommendations in the report, but not just for NIW. Some of those  issues stray into the civil contingencies group, which will have learned  lessons from the approach that was taken over the Christmas period.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">To be fair, during the freeze period, I heard staff from  NIW on the radio advising people that the thaw would cause pipes to burst and  that people, particularly those in outlying areas or farmers with outlying  farms or drinking troughs, should check and turn off their supply if possible  to ensure that we tried to maintain a water supply. I am not sure that the  community acted on that advice in the way that I think it should have, because  repeated requests were made. During the emergency, several large industrial  customers were found to have had leaking supplies for a number of days. The  volume of those leaks would have been equivalent to the supply of a small town.  Obviously, there are lessons to learn from the NIW response. Lessons have been  learnt already. The severe criticism of the response is valid.</p>
    <p class="B3SpeakerinChair">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr McClarty] in the Chair)</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, there is also a need to better inform the  community, on both the domestic and non-domestic sides, about their  responsibilities if a similar weather pattern were to occur again. People need  to be more informed about what they can do to contribute to a reduction in  water supply and how they can play their part in ensuring that we do not reach  crisis levels, as we did over the winter period. There are recommendations on  how to inform the community of its role, which are very useful. Some 80% of the  leakage was on the private side. Therefore, if even half the customers had  taken steps to try to reduce it themselves, there would have been a significant  improvement in the water supply to other areas, which had to be cut off  purposely through rotation to try to restore the levels in the reservoirs.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I, too, welcome the  Minister&rsquo;s statement. As a matter of interest, I note that Mr McDevitt did not  call on all the housing spokespeople to come together to talk about the crisis  that occurred in the Housing Executive and housing associations over Christmas.  As the Minister is aware, other parties, including the SDLP, have proposed that  NI Water become a mutualised company. What would be the implications of that  down the road?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: There would be a number of implications. People who  advocated a mutualised company pointed to the Welsh Water model. We have to  understand that Welsh Water is a self-financing company and charges households  an average of, I think, &pound;411 a year for water. It is further removed from  government and, therefore, further removed from the responsibility of the  Minister who is in charge of that area in Wales.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will want to put a paper to the Executive, and it will be  for an incoming Executive and mandate to decide what to do about NIW in the  longer term. I have brought the argument for the need for change to NIW to the  attention of the Executive many times over the past four years. I have met  resistance from other political parties around the Executive table every time  that I have brought propositions. Indeed, Mr McDevitt described my propositions  as unaffordable and unworkable. He then claimed that they did not exist, and  then he voted against the proposition for some short-term measures for change  that I brought to the Regional Development Committee.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Those who advocate the mutual model should be clear with  the public about what the full consequences of that would be, because I have  seen some &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. Please allow the Minister to answer the question.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: Some Members have a difficulty with manners as a  basic requirement in the House.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have heard some people say in the media that the  Executive cannot afford to continue to pay for NIW, that that would bankrupt  the public purse and that there is a better way of doing this, as if there is a  magical crock of gold at the end of a rainbow somewhere that will pay for it.  Those people advocate the mutualisation model. As I said, the mutualisation  model, as it works in Wales,  is further removed from government. It is a move towards privatisation and  charges domestic customers for their water supplies. Those who argue that point  of view are entitled to do so, even though it may conflict with their other  public position of being opposed to water charging. However, if they are going  to argue that position, they should argue the full position so that, in advance  of the election, the public can make their judgements about who they want to  support.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bresland</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his statement. As the Minister will know, I am very  concerned about the impact of a shortage of local plumbing inspectors who have  local knowledge of the system. Has that issue been dealt with?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: The regulator looked at that. As part of its crisis  response, NIW effectively moved back into the local area. I was on the ground  and met some of the local engineers who were dealing with the situation. The  Member is quite right that, at local level, there is very beneficial knowledge  of the historical water supply, of where people are located and even of details  of customers. That is important. There is certainly a lesson there for NIW. It  was incumbent on NIW to try to improve its management system and to go through  that kind of tough-book system of issuing instruction, and that has improved  the service overall.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Nonetheless, given the geography of the region that we live  in and the importance of local knowledge, it is vital to get that balance.  There was a reference to how, in an emergency situation, the company relied on  the local knowledge that was available. The need to retain local knowledge is  an important lesson for the company, as is the need to improve the efficiency  of the service.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">11.00 am</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Armstrong</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his statement. Does he acknowledge that, since the  moment it was revealed that those who were meant to lead the review were  previously considered for roles in Northern Ireland Water, the review has been  undermined? Will he give us his assessment of the comments of the Commissioner  for Public Appointments that were made public last week? Is he aware of her  concerns regarding the review?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: The Commissioner for Public Appointments is entitled  to make whatever comments she wishes. The question for the people who conducted  the review was for those who appointed them &mdash; the First Minister and the deputy  First Minister &mdash; to assess. The Member knows that this is a very small place  and there are few people who do not know other people. Tenuous links were being  made to suggest that people had a conflict of interest. Indeed, Heather  Moorhead was not even aware that she had been on a list for consideration. She  accepted the proposition that she be involved in the review in good faith,  until, halfway through, it was pointed out by someone who knew that she had  been on a list.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The question of being satisfied as to whether a person has  a conflict of interest is for those who appoint that person. They did that, and  I was prepared to accept those assurances from them. The outcome and the  product of the review show that it was clearly a professional piece of work  that did not pull any punches in its response. From my perspective, if I had  rejected the people involved, I would have had more to worry about in relation  to the conduct of the review than most.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>:  If the same kind of freeze incident happened again and the Minister were  looking ahead to the thaw and considering the great effects on consumers that  we saw in the latest instance, would he do anything different from what he did  on the previous occasion?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: The report is clear about my role and about the  governance issues for which I am responsible. It says that I acted effectively  in dealing with the matter. I am sure that everyone can improve on  &ldquo;effectively&rdquo;, and I would try to do that. The Member is a former teacher, so,  had he marked a person&rsquo;s work as &ldquo;effective&rdquo;, he would have thought that they  had done quite well.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Nonetheless, there are lessons to be learned. One of the  responses in the review to the sort of question that George Robinson asked was  that there was a need for greater community involvement in dealing with the  issues. As we can see in this instance, despite forewarnings to people that the  thaw would result in pipe bursts and they needed to take some responsibility  for checking their own arrangements, 80% of the water loss happened in private  properties. That can be improved through greater communication with the public  about their responsibilities in advance of an incident such as the recent one.  That could have saved a situation in which NIW was forced to rotate water  supplies.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The review amounts to a substantial volume of work,  containing 60 recommendations by the Utility Regulator for improvements. The  civil contingencies group will have looked at the incident and its response to  it and will have seen areas in which it feels it can improve. There are lessons  for us all from the incident, and people who think that they have nothing to  learn are in a dangerous place.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Maskey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. First, I welcome all the women who  are attending the Assembly and different events throughout the place to mark  the 100th anniversary of International Women&rsquo;s Day. Maith sibh.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">On 13 September 2010, the Minister stated that he would  bring forward short-term legislative proposals to improve the governance of  water services. Where does that sit at the moment?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: I described that in my exchange with the Chairperson  of the Committee for Regional Development. There is still an opportunity,  which, probably, runs out today, to bring forward those short-term measures. I  appreciate that Members are reluctant to use the accelerated passage procedure,  but, nonetheless, it has been used quite regularly in other instances. There is  a risk of NIW staying as it is, as a hybrid model. That is identified in the  overall report as part of the difficulties that NIW faces. There is still an  opportunity &mdash; a limited window &mdash; to do something about that, but, nonetheless,  I do not feel that there is sufficient support to bring that forward.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will bring longer-term proposals to the Executive before  the end of this mandate. The Assembly has been prompted and probed on this over  the past four years, and the suggestion is that the arrangements we have are  not fit for the purpose of devolved government. We really need to grasp this  nettle and make substantial changes in the new mandate.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr I McCrea</strong>:  The Minister will be more than aware of my criticism of how information was  passed out to the community, the failures of the website and, on some  occasions, the misinformation about whether water was being turned on. As part  of the recommendations from the regulator, will the Minister outline how  Northern Ireland Water has moved on the short-term measures that it can take to  ensure that nothing like what happened over this period happens again?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: Even before the review, I met NIW and, on behalf of  the Executive, pressed it to put in place short-term resilience measures  immediately. Thankfully, we now seem to be moving out of the cold weather and  into the spring, but, at that time, in January, there was an indication that we  faced further severe weather in February. That did not materialise, and I  suppose that that makes a point about weather predictions and how we manage  them.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The recognition across the board was that communication was  the key and central failure in the response, in both the call centre capacity  and the facility for dealing with incoming measures and answering queries and  in the website and other methods of communication with customers. In the  immediate aftermath, we were given assurances about a much enhanced and  technologically improved call centre facility so that people could get accurate  information. NI Direct stepped in to support that because NIW&rsquo;s website was  separate from that of NI Direct, which has much greater capacity.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The information that was put on the NIW website was such  that engineers could read and understand it but members of the public could  not. There was immediate recognition that that was not suitable. Immediate  steps were taken to improve the website&rsquo;s capacity and the information that was  on it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Other areas being explored and developed are issues such as  the use of other broadcasters to get regular messages out, an emergency  broadcast service, possibly through radio. That is being considered to such an  extent that NIW is examining putting up a radio itself for a limited period if  there was an emergency again or making better use of services such as the BBC  to get accurate information, warnings and advice out to people.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As I said, part of this is about forewarning people about  what to expect so that they can take their own measures. If such an incident  were to arise again &mdash; hopefully not of the same severity, although we cannot  predict what the weather will do &mdash; then people need to be much better informed  and able to communicate more directly with NIW as an organisation.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms J McCann</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I, too, thank the Minister for his  statement. Despite all the criticism of the Minister and the party politicking  around that, a lot of people appreciated the efforts that he made to get the  bottled water, particularly for elderly people, that community activists gave  out. Does he believe that the interim NIW board fulfilled its responsibilities  over Christmas and the new year?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: The Member is correct in that the board is an interim  one. A new chairperson will be appointed by the end of this month, and the  process of filling the vacancies for non-executive directors on a longer-term  basis has already begun. The report singled out the interim chairman and acknowledged  the leadership role that he played.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Performance was benchmarked against the boards of other  water companies, and it was acknowledged that the board had the requisite  skill, competence and ability across a wide range. The Member will know that,  on these boards, you do not simply appoint six, seven or eight people from a  water utilities background. A broad range of skills and experience is needed in  that board in order that they complement each other. The report found that the  board had a sufficiently broad range of skills, which was commensurate with  that of other water company boards.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Buchanan</strong>:  The Minister stated that leakage in the infrastructure is not yet at economic  levels let alone sustainable levels, and many areas of the infrastructure still  need to be renewed. I appreciate that the Department has invested money to meet  the shortfalls. However, will the Minister give the House an indication of the  percentage of the deficient network that that will replace? Does he have a time  frame for the completion of the work?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: As I said, the review found and accepts as a  historical legacy that the leakage figures are not at economic or sustainable  levels. Much more work needs to be done. The regulator&rsquo;s review found that much  work has been done. As the Member knows, the Executive have invested &pound;1 billion  of capital investment over the past four years. That is part of playing a very  substantial catch-up exercise due to lack of investment over previous decades.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Despite the reduction in the capital budget, which  particularly affects my Department, I have managed to identify funds in  addition to those initially allocated to me to bring it up to &pound;660 million  worth of investment over the next four years. That will meet what the regulator  recommends for mains rehabilitation. I do not have the percentage figures, but  I will supply them to the Member. What we have invested to date and what we  propose to invest over the next four years matches what the regulator  recommends for mains rehabilitation investment, but we still have the  outstanding legacy to deal with, and catch-up is required. It will bring us to  a stage at which leakage is sustainable and economic, but the question is how  far we go beyond that and whether it becomes uneconomic to continue to invest  after that. We are not at that point yet, but we have identified very  substantial investment that is in line with what the regulator recommends.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kinahan</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his statement. I congratulate the members of the  public who helped and worked together when the crisis happened. The Minister  said that the response was wholly inadequate. As we know, the public see the  Assembly, councils and all of us in government as being responsible. What has  been put in place, probably in discussions with other Ministers, to ensure that  we have a good 24-hour responsibility so that, whether it is Christmas or the  weekend, somebody can make decisions and get people in so that the public get  the response that they want immediately?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: There was a sense in the regulator&rsquo;s report and the  recommendations that the executive team in the NIW did not respond as a  corporate unit. There was no clear line of who was responsible for what area,  which is a lesson that the NIW is obliged to learn. The regulator&rsquo;s report has  60 recommendations, and the regulator will check to see how those are  implemented. Indeed, the Department will use its oversight mechanism to ensure  that those proposals are implemented. The corporate team response was  non-existent; people did not have specific roles. The emergency response of  most organisations is to pool their entire corporate team and make sure that  there is oversight in all areas of responsibility. That did not happen in the  NIW; it was not part of its emergency plan. In hindsight, it certainly was a  deficiency. The regulator has clearly identified that that needs to change in  any future response.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dallat</strong>:  The Minister told us that this was an operational matter and was the  responsibility of NIW. Given that there is just an interim chief executive at  the moment and a board that is top-heavy with people who have no experience in  the water industry, does the Minister accept that he has in the past stood  four-square behind the former chief executive, Laurence MacKenzie, and that the  image that the 40,000 people who were deprived of water have is of our Minister  standing with Mr MacKenzie, who has now gone? Does he accept that many people  will see this morning&rsquo;s statement as a Pontius Pilate exercise &mdash; a washing of  the hands, so to speak &mdash; with no responsibility for what might happen in the  future?</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">11.15 am</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: I am not sure how the Member can come to that view.  The report is very clear. I am not misrepresenting or misinterpreting it in any  way; it is very clear about where responsibility lay.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member remarked that the board is not top-heavy with  people experienced in the water industry. The only person with water utility  experience to leave the previous board was the chairman, Chris Mellor.  Therefore, there is little difference in capabilities. Incidentally, the Member  has never changed his position that that chairman needs to be reinstated, even  though Mr Mellor argued that tens of millions of pounds&rsquo; worth of contracts  being wrongly procured was simply a matter of getting the paperwork right. The  Member is still of the view that a person who holds that view of public  finances is fit to be the chairperson of a public organisation here. I have  never heard Mr Dallat change that view.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In respect of my responsibility, I was confident at the  time and remain confident &mdash; I think that the report reflects it &mdash; that I acted  on my responsibility for NIW. In its oversight role, the Department will  continue to ensure that NIW lives up to the report&rsquo;s clear, consistent and  evidence-based recommendations on where responsibility lay and where  improvements must be made. There is no hand-washing effort about that at all.  At my request, I came to the Assembly&rsquo;s first sitting after Christmas to make a  statement on the issue. Other Ministers had to be dragged to the Assembly to  make state&shy;ments related to their area of responsibility. I brought terms for  recommendations to the Executive. Although the Member shakes his head, I asked  my Executive colleagues for their support for the review and its terms of  reference, again unlike other Ministers.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Reviews are being conducted across a broad range of areas  of responsibility. As a Minister in the Executive, I do not know who set the  terms of reference for those reviews. I do not know who is conducting them. I  do not know when they will report. They have never been discussed around the  Executive table. I have never seen any of the other Ministers asked to come to  the Assembly to answer, as they should, questions about those reviews. That is  in stark contrast to my approach. I asked to come to the Assembly with the  first item of business after Christmas to answer questions from my Assembly  colleagues on this. I asked the Executive to conduct a review. I brought terms  of reference to the Executive for their approval, and the report went back to  the Executive. Mark that against reports on other areas of government here.  Scrutiny committees cannot get access to those reports. They do not know who is  conducting them or what the outcomes may be. Some SDLP Members may shake their  head, but that is the reality. This report was open and transparent. I have  been upfront, never washed my hands and never shirked responsibility in dealing  with the Assembly and making myself available to it and asking to come to  answer questions on these matters. That is in marked contrast to, perhaps, the  Member&rsquo;s colleague and some other Ministers.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  That is outrageous.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Sheehan</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. The Minister mentioned the former  chairperson of NIW, Mr Chris Mellor, who stated publicly, on television, that  he would have done a better job than the interim non-executive directors  appointed by the Minister. What is the Minister&rsquo;s view on that?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: I commented on his fitness for public office in terms  of his approach and commentary around the wrongful procurement of tens of  millions of pounds in contracts. He said that that was simply a matter of  getting the paperwork right. I do not think that that is the standard that the  Assembly should apply to meet its desire to have open, transparent, accountable  and properly scrutinised public spending. As for his doing any better, the plan  that the NIW board operated to was developed and devised under Chris Mellor&rsquo;s  leadership.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lyttle</strong>: I  join my colleagues in commending front line staff and all the community groups  on the ground who responded to the freeze-thaw over Christmas. I recognise that  exceptional weather was at play. I also share the report&rsquo;s concern about the &ldquo;failure&rdquo;  of Northern Ireland Water&rsquo;s executive leadership during the incident. Given  that the Public Accounts Committee report on procurement and governance in  Northern Ireland Water found departmental oversight of the company to be  &ldquo;clearly deficient&rdquo; and that the Utility Regulator&rsquo;s report finds that there  was a failure to address lessons identified from the 2009-2010 freeze-thaw  incident, why does the Minister feel that departmental governance is so fit for  purpose and dismiss mutualisation as an option to be considered to improve  governance of our water supply?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: The Member strayed into an area of the PAC report,  which is yet to be responded to by the Department. Although I am happy to get  into those issues, it is not normal protocol for me to answer questions on a  report that the Department has not responded to.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">On the arrangements for managing NIW&rsquo;s operational response  on the ground and its implementation plan for emergency responses, the  regulator and the review found that the governance arrangements were adequate.  The Department asked questions, it was given assurances, and the governance  arrangements were adequate.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As for mutualisation, at least the Member&rsquo;s party is  upfront in arguing that domestic customers should pay for water. Other parties  have argued that that should not be the case. People may feel that, in the  first instance, there should be a stronger connection and more responsibility  between the Department and whoever happens to be the Minister and NIW, which  provides our water and sewerage services. I am simply making the point that  mutualisation would loosen those arrangements, bringing the organisation  further from government. If Members feel that water and sewerage services, in  which the Executive and the public whom we represent have invested billions of  pounds, are vital, I am advising them that, under mutualisation, we would have  a looser and less authoritative arrangement.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In addition, mutualisation involves self-financing.  Therefore, people proposing that arrangement should explain it in its totality.  It would mean that domestic customers would pay, as is the case with Welsh  Water, an average of &pound;411 per household each year. If that is the proposition,  I am happy to debate it, but let us not try to offer a solution where we are  saying that the Executive cannot afford to pay for NIW and the people should  not pay for it, but, somewhere at the end of a rainbow, there is a crock of  gold that will sort it all out for us.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  First, I put on record my thanks and praise to all front line Northern Ireland  Water staff who were out during those difficult times. At that stage,  contractors were brought in as well. Is the Minister aware that some of those  contractors have yet to receive payment? I am not even sure whether their  payments have been processed, and that may have a significant effect on future  work that they might be required to do for Northern Ireland Water.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: I was not aware that that may be the case. None of  the contractors involved has brought the matter to my attention. I will  certainly take note of the Member&rsquo;s question and take the issue up with NIW to  ensure that the Executive&rsquo;s policy of prompt payment for services, which was  initiated through the Department of Finance and Personnel, is observed. The  Executive set a standard of prompt payment for people who do work for  government services. Particularly at this time, people are working with very  tight margins and are struggling to keep organisations open and companies  afloat, so I will raise the issue with NIW and ensure that people who did work  are properly paid in sufficient time.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Callaghan</strong>:  The report deals with events from and beyond 27 December. As we all know and as  Roy Keane has said on many occasions, &ldquo;Fail to prepare; prepare to fail&rdquo;. Does  the Minister accept that the report should have dealt with matters before 27  December, because, no matter what was done after the event, given the lack of  emergency planning by Northern Ireland Water before then, it was fairly obvious  that a disaster was going to happen? How can he argue credibly for more powers  over Northern Ireland Water now, when everything that he said today and over  the past number of weeks was about evading responsibility?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: Perhaps the Member has not read the report. It goes  into issues prior to 27 December. It makes an assessment of NIW&rsquo;s preparation,  saying clearly that NIW was prepared for the expected. You should have read it.  The report is a matter of record. Although the Member and the SDLP might  dispute that, it says clearly:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;NIW was &hellip; prepared for the expected &hellip; but &hellip;  unprepared for the unexpected.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Therefore, the report does assess NIW&rsquo;s state of  preparedness before Christmas; the fact that the company put the emergency  planning operation in place in early December and stood it down again; how  effective that plan was during the freeze in early December; and what lessons  were learnt following the regulator&rsquo;s view of the freeze incident in the  earlier part of last year. So, the Member clearly has not read &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Callaghan</strong>: <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: I am sorry; I cannot answer questions asked from a  sedentary position. If the Member has other questions to ask, perhaps he should  have asked them.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member clearly has not read the report. It assesses the  situation prior to December 2010 and NIW&rsquo;s state of preparedness, and it makes  criticisms of that. Where recommendations flow from those criticisms, NIW needs  to address them.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I listened intently to two or three days of Budget debate  in which, on the one hand, the SDLP made propositions and then, on the other,  made arguments that completely contradicted them. The Member is doing that  again. He argues that I am trying to avoid responsibility and that I should  take responsibility. That was the SDLP mantra throughout the whole freeze-thaw  incident. The party has come up with proposals that move NIW further from the  responsibility of government. So, as I said, the only thing consistent about  the SDLP over the past period has been its inconsistency. It may fool some of  the people some of the time, but SDLP Members cannot stand here and argue that  more authority is needed and that the Minister in charge of the DRD needs to be  more in control of NIW, while advancing propositions that will move the  organisations that deliver water and sewerage services further away from  government and further away from responsibility so that &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>: <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: I am sorry; I am getting hectored by the bad-mannered  Mr McDevitt. I have answered his question about discussion. He wants to set up  some sidetrack process that involves himself and I am not sure who else when we  already have open, transparent opportunities in these political arrangements  for discussion through the Committee of which he is a member. Why he wants to  sidestep the Chairperson, the Deputy Chairperson and the rest of his Committee  colleagues &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>: <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: I am sorry, Mr Deputy Speaker, it is difficult to  answer questions when I am being continuously interrupted. Manners are very  easily carried. My mother used to say, &ldquo;Manners maketh the man&rdquo;. Obviously,  they have not made much of a man over there.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Last September, I outlined to the Assembly that I would  bring proposals to the Executive for discussion and to inform an incoming  Executive. I am not sure what parallel process Mr McDevitt wants to become  involved in, but it does not involve transparency or openness.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>: <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: Such a process does not involve the established  institutions of the Assembly. Mr McDevitt appears to want to sidestep his own  Committee, his Committee colleagues, the Executive and his colleague on the  Executive, which is where those discussions and decisions rightly take place.  That is the forum for debate, and, ultimately, that debate comes back to the  Floor of the Assembly.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms M Anderson</strong>: Go raibh  m&iacute;le maith agat. The Minister will not have been surprised by the SDLP proposal  to mutualise the water service, which will, as he said &mdash; I agree with him &mdash;  lead inevitably to water taxes. It was first mooted by the previous leader of  the SDLP, Mark Durkan, and was called a Durkan tax.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will pick up on the question that Tom Buchanan asked.  Have the Executive allocated the required capital funding to the DRD over the  Budget period to allow the necessary investment to continue?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: There is no doubt that, as a consequence of the  reduction in our Budget delivered from Westminster, where the Tory cuts were  unsuccessfully challenged, if challenged at all, we have a substantial  reduction in the capital budget. The initial allocation that I received as part  of that capital budget would have left a substantial shortfall, particularly in  years 2 and 3, in the allocation for NIW. Through reallocating the Department&rsquo;s  resources and through further allocations that we received as a consequence of  the final Budget proposition, I have been able to bring that up to a  substantial level of &pound;660 million over the next four years, which meets the  regulator&rsquo;s recommendations for investment in NIW.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: That concludes questions to the Minister for Regional Development  on his statement. We now move to the next item of business, which is &mdash;</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">11.30 am</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Boylan</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. A Member indicated that I was  misleading the House in the question that I asked. Let me say that I was  referring to a statement that Mr McDevitt himself released.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  Further to that point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker, what was said earlier was  misleading. It is not the case that the SDLP ever suggested that any report was  a whitewash. I strongly counsel Members to pay due respect to what was and was  not said. I will ask you, Mr Deputy Speaker, whether it is in order to  knowingly misrepresent another party&rsquo;s position in the House.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Could I please respond to the two points of order? Both Members  made their points. They are now on record, so I wish to move on.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Boylan</strong>:  On a further point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. Can I hand the statement in to  the Speaker&rsquo;s Office? If you will indulge me, I will read out exactly what it  says.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. It is not in order to read out the statement. If the Member  wishes to hand it to the Speaker, he is quite at liberty to do so. I wish to  move on.</p>

    <p class="H4StageHeading">Health and Social Care Bill: Legislative Consent Motion</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety (Mr McGimpsey)</strong>: I beg to move</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">That this Assembly endorses the principle of the  extension to Northern Ireland of the provisions of the Health and Social Care  Bill dealing with the abolition of the Health Protection Agency; functions in  relation to biological substances; radiation protection functions; revocation  of the AIDS (Control) (Northern Ireland) Order 1987; co-operation with bodies  exercising functions in relation to public health; the regulation of health and  social care workers; arrangements between the National Health Service  Commissioning Board and Northern Ireland Ministers; and relationships between  the health services.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In July 2010, the UK Government announced their intentions  to carry out a radical reform of the NHS. One of the key elements of that  reform is streamlining the number of existing arm&rsquo;s-length bodies. Most of the  changes to those bodies will be given effect by the UK Health and Social Care  Bill, which was introduced at Westminster  on 19 January 2011.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At the outset, it is important to say that the vast  majority of the Bill&rsquo;s provisions apply to England only. Members will be aware  that any proposed changes to a Westminster Bill that relate to a devolved  matter or that require a specific amendment or reference to legislation that  applies in Northern Ireland  must be agreed by the Assembly by means of a legislative consent motion. It is  primarily those provisions to which I will now draw Members&rsquo; attention.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">All healthcare regulatory bodies, including the  Pharmaceutical Society of Northern Ireland, will be given new powers to  establish voluntary registers. That may affect the future delivery of  regulation for some healthcare professionals on a UK-wide basis. The Bill will  abolish the General Social Care Council and will transfer the role of regulating  social workers in England  to the Health Professional Council (HPC). Given the close working relationships  that have been established between social care regulators in each country of  the UK,  the Northern Ireland Social Care Council is taking steps to develop a working  relationship with the HPC. In future, the HPC will be known as the Health and  Care Professional Council, and it will utilise its expertise to provide  administrative, technical or advisory services to any body or individual that  is involved in maintaining registers of health or social work professionals and  social care workers.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Council for Healthcare Regulatory Excellence (CHRE),  which scrutinises and oversees the work of the nine healthcare regulatory  bodies, will become the Professional Standards Authority for Health and Social  Care, and it will be otherwise known as the authority. It will become  self-funding through a compulsory levy on the healthcare regulators, and  ministerial requests for advice from the authority will be subject to a fee.  The authority will be given the power to provide advice or auditing services to  the regulatory bodies and to charge for that advice. Accountability to the four  UK Parliaments and Assemblies will be achieved by placing a duty on the authority  to lay its strategic reports before those bodies.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My Department will continue to appoint one non-executive  member to the council of the authority. The authority will have responsibility  for accrediting the voluntary registers mentioned earlier. The Bill will  abolish the Office of the Health Professions Adjudicator (OHPA), which was  established under the Health and Social Care Act 2008 to undertake fully  independent adjudication of fitness-to-practise cases. The issue, as  highlighted in the Shipman inquiry, was to separate the functions of  investigation and adjudication in fitness-to-practise matters. The General  Medical Council (GMC) has enhanced the independence of adjudication and  modernised existing processes, so it is considered that similar benefits to the  setting-up of the OHPA can be achieved through reforms to the GMC&rsquo;s  legislation. The OHPA is still in shadow form and would not have been  operational until April 2011. Therefore, it has no impact on Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Secretary of State for Health wishes to take a more  direct role in health protection in England, with the result that the Health  Protection Agency (HPA) is to be abolished in its current form and will become  part of the new public health service (PHS) for England. The HPA was established  under the Health Protection Agency Act 2004. The Act gives a number of  functions to the HPA, including health and radiation protection functions. The  Health and Social Care Bill will abolish the HPA as a statutory organisation  and will repeal the 2004 Act. Health protection functions that are not devolved  to the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety will be  transferred to the Secretary of State for Health as part of the new public  health service.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Non-devolved functions that the HPA currently undertakes  for Northern Ireland, such  as aspects of radiation protection and other UK-wide functions will continue to  be provided for Northern    Ireland by the public health service. My  Department, along with the Public Health Agency and the health and social care  sector in Northern Ireland have sought assurances that we will continue to  receive the range of expert advice and support currently being provided and  will also be able to participate actively in health protection matters on a  UK-wide basis.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I also wish to assure Members that our own Public Health  Agency will remain as a freestanding body and will continue to carry out its  public health functions across Northern    Ireland. The Bill also seeks to make changes  to the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), which is  responsible for producing guidance on good clinical practice and the  cost-effectiveness of NHS resources in England. It also examines new  interventional procedures developed throughout the UK to check that they are safe and  effective.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety  (DHSSPS) has links with NICE, whereby all guidance published by the institute  is reviewed locally to test its applicability to Northern Ireland and, where  appropriate, endorsed for implementation here. Part of that endorsement process  is to provide information to allow the guidance to be interpreted in the Northern Ireland  context and to identify any important differences in service provision here.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My Department&rsquo;s arrangement with NICE ensures that Northern  Ireland can access the same safety checks as England and can get timely advice  from NICE staff on guidance issues. NICE will be re-established as a  non-departmental public body (NDPB) and will be known as the National Institute  for Health and Care Excellence to reflect its extended remit, which will  incorporate elements of social care. For example, it will assume responsibility  for producing quality standards for adult social care. For my Department to  continue its existing arrangements with the newly established National  Institute for Health and Care Excellence, it will be necessary to amend article  8 of the Health and Personal Social Services (Northern Ireland) Order 1991.  Article 8 enables the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety  to enter into arrangements with special health authorities. However, it does  not allow arrangements with non-departmental public bodies. For the Department  to continue arrangements with the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence,  which will become an NDPB, the 1991 Order needs to be amended. That amendment  will be effected through the Health and Social Care Bill. Therefore, it will  require the consent of the Northern Ireland Assembly. The legislative consent  motion seeks to put in place a mechanism that will allow us to continue our  current relationships with those organisations and to access the information  and expertise that we need. On that basis, I ask Members to support the motion.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy  Chairperson of the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety (Mrs  O&rsquo;Neill)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I speak on behalf of  the Committee. On 3 February 2011, the Committee took evidence from  departmental officials on the need for a legislative consent motion on the  Health and Social Care Bill. I want to say at the outset that, after hearing  evidence and exploring issues with officials, the Committee was content for the  legislative consent motion to proceed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As Members will know, the British coalition Government have  put in process various reforms of the NHS in England, which include streamlining  the number of arm&rsquo;s-length bodies or &ldquo;quangos&rdquo;, as they are often called. The  Bill is relevant to here because it will make changes to arm&rsquo;s-length bodies  that are already established or will be newly established by the Department of  Health in England.  As some of those bodies provide or will provide expertise and services, some  consequential amendments are required to our legislation. In a nutshell, that  is why legislative consent is required of the Assembly and why the Minister  tabled the motion that is before the House.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Many of the arm&rsquo;s-length bodies in question play a vital  role in legal, ethical, quality and safety issues associated with the service&rsquo;s  access and research. They also provide advice and guidance, regulation,  inspection and monitoring, and a measure of uniformity and public assurance  across a wide spectrum of services. One such body, to which the Minister  referred, is the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, which  produces best-practice guidance that is designed for the Health Service in England, but is  also appropriate for us in many instances. Indeed, many other countries, such  as New Zealand and Canada, use its  services.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The simple reason for that buy-in of NICE services is that  they cost &pound;90 million a year to run. As we all know, we do not have a spare &pound;90  million in the current Budget process with which to set up a similar service  for our own use. Therefore, it is important that we are able to tap into that  function and share that expertise. For that reason, legislation is needed to  create a mechanism by which to enter into a contractual relationship with NICE  and other bodies when their status changes as a result of the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In conclusion, I reiterate that the Committee is content  for the Department to proceed with the legislative consent motion. I commend  the motion to the House.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I agree with the Minister and the Deputy Chairperson of the Committee that it  is important that we build and work on our relationships with NICE and its  successor organisation. It is encouraging that the coalition Government are  moving to streamline the public Health Service. I wonder whether the Minister  will want to comment on where they might have got such an idea. It is important  that streamlining takes place, that relationships with groups such as NICE are  maintained and that we continue to buy into that expertise, because there are  issues of quality and safety. It is important that we have had the debate and  that the Committee took evidence to move that forward. I support the motion.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  The SDLP supports the legislative consent motion, which asks the Assembly to  consent to the provisions of the new Health and Social Care Bill at Westminster. We accept  the importance of the role of, for example, the National Institute for Health  and Clinical Excellence, which will, as the Minister said, be under a new name  and that we are able to avail ourselves of its services. The SDLP is, however,  of the view, as we stated previously here, that we will have a better Health  Service not only through working more closely with the rest of the UK, but by  taking the tremendous opportunities that exist to work with the Republic on an  all-Ireland context. It is important to understand that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The motion has been before the Executive and agreed by all  Ministers. Like I said, the SDLP has no difficulty with that.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">11.45 am</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Callaghan</strong>:  I concur with what the Member said about the potential for better outcomes and  better value for money in developing North/South joint procurement and joint  services, among other things. Does the Member share my sense of frustration,  and that of many families, about the fact that although on the one hand we are striving  to keep up to the standards or developments of the National Institute for  Clinical Excellence and its successor, the National Institute for Health and  Clinical Excellence in London, we are at the same time still in a position in  which many standards set by NICE, including the offer of fertility treatment,  are not being fulfilled here for various reasons? We should strive towards  that, and hopefully that will be reflected in the Budget settlement.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  The Member has made the point well. On that note, Mr Deputy Speaker, I  conclude.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  In recent times, much comment has been made about the funding of our National  Health Service. Any reasonable proposal to make efficiencies throughout the  Health Service, thus saving money, is welcome, and the money should be put back  into front line services. The Bill seeks to reduce bureaucracy by cutting down  the Department&rsquo;s NHS functions and abolishing quangos that do not need to exist  and streamlining the functions of those that do. The Health and Social Care  Bill will rationalise a number of public bodies. Let us hope that by so doing  our community will not be disadvantaged.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I pay tribute to the work of the Health Protection Agency.  Our constituents&rsquo; expectation is that the Northern Ireland Health Department  will continue to provide a first-class Health Service. Every man, woman and  child in Northern Ireland  expects to receive nothing but the best. It is our hope that the Health and  Social Care Bill will come up to expectations. The Alliance Party supports the  motion.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Callaghan</strong>:  I am happy to forgo this opportunity to speak, Mr Deputy Speaker.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I thank the Members who  contributed to the debate and the Health Committee. I already said that a  number of the bodies provide advice, guidance, regulation, inspection and  monitoring, as well as a measure of uniformity and public assurance across not  only a wide spectrum of services but the UK as a whole.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My officials liaised closely with Department of Health  colleagues to ensure that we maintain the expertise or service currently  provided by the bodies affected. The main focus of our engagement has been to  make sure that Northern    Ireland continues to receive services or  expertise under the new arrangements that will come about as a result of the  proposed changes to bodies.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Members will appreciate that an arrangement whereby a body  provides services and expertise on a UK-wide basis not only reduces unnecessary  duplication but makes good economic sense. It is also clear that Northern Ireland  could never hope to replicate the range of experience and expertise that a  UK-wide body can provide. It is important that Northern Ireland continues to have  access to that experience and expertise. I therefore commend the motion to the  House.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">That this Assembly endorses the principle of the  extension to Northern Ireland of the provisions of the Health and Social Care  Bill dealing with the abolition of the Health Protection Agency; functions in  relation to biological substances; radiation protection functions; revocation  of the AIDS (Control) (Northern Ireland) Order 1987; co-operation with bodies  exercising functions in relation to public health; the regulation of health and  social care workers; arrangements between the National Health Service  Commissioning Board and Northern Ireland Ministers; and relationships between  the health services.</p>

Ar son an Choiste Comhshaoil cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh Ch&eacute;im an  Bhreithnithe den Bhille Plean&aacute;la. On behalf of the Committee for the  Environment, I welcome the Consideration Stage of the Planning Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill was referred to the Committee on 14 December 2010.  Although it was the largest Bill ever to come before the Assembly, the Committee  was determined to conduct the best possible scrutiny in the short time  available. The Committee sought a brief two-week extension but managed to  produce its report a week in advance of that, thereby enabling the Department  to bring the Bill back for consideration today. That required the Committee to  meet all day twice a week throughout February, and I wish to put on record my  thanks to the members and staff for accommodating that heavy workload.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There were 61 written submissions to the Committee&rsquo;s call for  evidence, and the Committee took oral evidence from 11 organisations, including  NILGA, the NI Housing Executive and the Consumer Council. The Committee also  held a very well-attended stakeholder event, at which organisations and  individuals were encouraged to give their comments on four specific areas of  the Bill. Departmental officials were in attendance to respond to the issues  raised, and it proved to be a very useful way of gathering a lot of views in  the short space of time available to the Committee.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee&rsquo;s scrutiny of the Bill led to it making 25  recommendations. Most have been addressed by the Department tabling its own  amendments today, and some by commitments from the Department to future work or  legislation. I thank the Minister for that. However, a few outstanding  recommendations required the Committee to table its own amendments.  Disappointingly, there are a couple of recommendations that the Minister  originally indicated he would make amendments to address, going as far as to  provide draft amendments for the Committee to see. However, between then and  now, he declined to table them, without explanation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Where that has happened, the Committee has gone ahead with  its own amendments. However, I, and, I imagine, other members, find it very  unsatisfactory. Where amendments could not resolve members&rsquo; concerns, the  Committee sought commitments from the Minister to make sure that those concerns  would be addressed. To some, he responded in writing; to others, he or his  officials gave verbal commitments. I welcome confirmation of those commitments  again today.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Resources were a key concern. Councils are worried about  being handed responsibility for planning without sufficient resources to  deliver it effectively and efficiently. The Committee was adamant that it wants  to see full transfer of resources from Departments to councils for the planning  functions that they are taking on and that will not be covered by planning  fees.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee also recognised that the introduction of the  new planning system will result in a sea change of responsibility and behaviour  for councillors and council staff. The Committee welcomed the proposed pilot  projects that will help to inform the change process but also wants to see  comprehensive capacity building and training. Token gestures and lip service to  training will not suffice.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Another key Committee recommendation was for local  development plans to have a statutory link to community plans. The Department  told the Committee that community planning was being developed through local  government reform proposals and that legislation for that process had still to  be developed. The Committee therefore welcomed the Minister&rsquo;s written  commitment that a statutory link between community plans and local government  development plans will be provided in future local government legislation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">With regard to amendment Nos 1 and 2, most respondents to  the Committee&rsquo;s call for evidence felt that the function of the Department  under clause 1 should be expanded to reflect the desired outcome of the new  planning system. They felt that it was no longer satisfactory that the  Department&rsquo;s sole aim should be:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;the orderly and consistent development of land&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">They wanted to see a much greater aspiration, going beyond  governing the development of land to promoting sustainable development and  tackling disadvantage and poverty. Organisations also sought recognition of  environmental limits, well-being and other social factors such as disadvantage  and good relations.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Department insisted that duties to the environment were  covered by its obligations to local, national and European legislation and that  the social factors were already requirements for the public sector. It also  maintained that well-being as a concept was still being consulted on as part of  the local government reform consultation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Despite that response, the Committee agreed with the  concerns of stakeholders and sought amendments to improve the Department&rsquo;s commitment  to sustainable development and well-being as a way to recognise the full  aspiration of the new approach to planning in the North. As I alluded to  earlier, the Department initially agreed to an amendment in relation to  sustainable development but again I note my disappointment that the Minister  will not now bring that amendment forward. I hope that he will explain to the  House why he will not do so.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Regardless of the Minister&rsquo;s decision, the Committee was  clear and unanimous: sustainable development should be at the heart of  planning, underpinning decisions. Although members accepted that it was  unrealistic to expect the Department or councils to secure sustainable  development, it was perfectly reasonable and right to require them to further  sustainable development. There should be a clear direction to do so in clauses  1 and 5, and I support amendments Nos 1 and 7 on behalf of the Committee.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Department refused the Committee&rsquo;s request for an  amendment on well-being. Although it may be true that the concept is still  being consulted on as part of the local government reform consultation, that  should not rule out its inclusion in the Bill. We were assured that the local  government reform legislation will be implemented in tandem with the Bill. If  that is truly the case, there should be no nervousness about introducing a  concept now that will eventually fall into place, and I urge the House to  support amendment No 2.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">12.00 noon</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">On amendment Nos 3 and 8, the Committee recommended that  the Department remove any risk of misinterpretation regarding the obligations  of the Department and of councils to policies and guidance issued by the  Department for Regional Development. The wording of clauses 1 and 5 is  inconsistent with that of clause 8, and the Committee supports the Department&rsquo;s  amendments to address that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">On amendment Nos 4 and 5, the Committee was concerned that,  although there had been an obligation on the Department to produce a statement  of community involvement since the Planning Reform Order was published in 2006,  one had never been produced. To avoid repetition of that situation, the  Committee recommended that a time limit be placed on the production and  publication of the Department&rsquo;s statement of community involvement. The  Committee welcomed the Department&rsquo;s commitment to do that through amendment Nos  4 and 5.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">On amendment No 6, the Committee was keen to place a  requirement on local authorities to take the potential impact of climate change  into consideration when conducting surveys of districts, and the Committee  asked the Department to consider amending clause 3 accordingly. However, in its  response, the Department indicated that it did not believe that it would be  possible for councils to collate the necessary information from the sectors  that produced emissions in their region to enable them to meet such a  requirement. The Committee maintained that that was not its intention and that  it wanted councils to look at best practice and guidance on taking the  potential impact of climate change into consideration and to factor those into  their district surveys accordingly. In the absence of such an amendment from  the Department, the Committee agreed to table its own amendment at  Consideration Stage.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Having conducted an inquiry into climate change for the best  part of a year, Committee members are aware of its importance and of the impact  that planning has and could have on it in future. There is huge potential  through the Bill to tackle climate change at a local level and to ensure that  all councils are actively working to introduce climate change measures through  local plans.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee felt that councils should be required through  the legislation to take the implications of mitigating and adapting to climate  change into account in their surveys. That would not necessarily require  councils to collect and collate detailed local emission information, but it  should necessitate the consideration of long-term flooding predictions and an  observance of best practice in reducing carbon emissions etc. On behalf of the  Committee, I support amendment No 6, and I urge the House to recognise its  importance and to support it too.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I cannot comment on amendment Nos 9 to 14 on behalf of the  Committee, because, during Committee Stage, Committee members were content with  the relevant clauses. However, the amendments do not appear to alter the policy  principles established in the relevant clauses.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">On amendment No 15, there was considerable concern among  the stakeholders who responded to the Committee about the proposal in clause 10  to enable the Department to appoint an independent examiner. Some stakeholders  felt that it would give the Department inappropriate control. Others suggested  that, if the Planning Appeals Commission could not meet its requirements, it  should be tasked with appointing an independent examiner, thereby ensuring that  the independence of the PAC is extended to the independent examiner.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee was concerned about the allocation of costs  for the process. Members were concerned that, although the cost for the PAC to  carry out its duties is covered by OFMDFM, there is no indication of how an  independent examiner would be paid. The Department later confirmed that it  would pay for independent examinations conducted by an independent person that  it appointed. That clarity was welcomed, as was the fact that the costs would  fall to the Department rather than to individual councils.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">On the appointment of an independent examiner, the  Department stressed that the PAC would be the first choice to conduct independent  examinations. However, if it was unable to do so within the appropriate  timescale, clause 10 would give sufficient flexibility to appoint an  alternative examiner. The Department insisted that it was important to retain  the option, but it agreed, through amendment No 15, to strengthen its position  that the appointment of an independent examiner would be done only in  exceptional circumstances and only when necessary to meet a council&rsquo;s  timetable. On behalf of the Committee, I welcome amendment No 15 and encourage  support for it and for amendment No 16, which is consequential to it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I move to amendment Nos 78 to 80. A respondent to the  Committee&rsquo;s call for evidence suggested that clause 221 should be strengthened  by the inclusion of a requirement for bodies in receipt of planning grants to  further the understanding of planning policy proposals. The Committee asked the  Department to consider such an amendment and was content with amendment Nos 78  and 79 accordingly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 80 removes the requirement for the Department  of Finance and Personnel to be consulted before grants can be awarded. That was  another suggestion made by the Committee on the grounds that the requirement  was no longer necessary and was out of keeping with similar grant-awarding  processes. I support amendment No 80 accordingly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The final amendment in the group is amendment No 86. As a  result of its scrutiny, the Committee expressed concern about how the process  will roll out, and it asked the Department to consider the possibility of introducing  a review period following the implementation of the Act. The Department did not  agree to that on the grounds that reviews can be instigated at any stage, and  the Committee agreed not to pursue the matter.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Having spoken at length on behalf of the Environment  Committee, I will now say a few words on this amendment as a representative for  Newry and Armagh. I am disappointed that the  Minister has not taken on board the point about carrying out a review.  Yesterday in the House, we talked about maturity and common sense, and the  Minister was willing to take forward a review in respect of the matters debated  then. Yet, when we ask for a review in respect of planning policies being  transferred to local government, he has refused to take that request on board.  I want to make some points about a review.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At present, the e-PIC system has not reached its potential  but is vital to the future of the Planning Service and how it rolls out. There  are teething problems with the system. As the Minister is well aware, we asked  for a rural design guide, and there has been no sight of that. Also,  professional and technical members of staff from the Planning Service are being  redeployed. Although it is recognised that planning receipts are down and the  number of applications is not as high as in previous years, it is understood  that the workloads are being transferred to those in the Planning Service at  this time. It would not be appropriate, having not brought forward a workload  programme, to transfer this policy in its current state without a mechanism to  review how that planning process will operate and be implemented on the ground.  The Minister should take that on board seriously and look at exactly what we  are going to transfer to local government.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">If the Minister is minded to support a review, we could  look at the amendment&rsquo;s reference to five years and the requirement to publish  a report. If planning policy were to be split and if we could look at what will  be delivered through development planning and development management at local  level, we could get the Department to come back with a suggestion about exactly  what we would need to review. I do not think that it would be an overall  review. I think that there are ways of keeping an eye on it and checking it.  This issue could be considered at Further Consideration Stage, if the Minister  is willing to bring it forward and if the Members across the Floor are  concerned about the type of review we are suggesting.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We asked for a review of PPS 21, which the Minister agreed  to previously. If we properly define the type of review that we want to have,  it would not be difficult to ensure that proper planning policy is rolled out,  that proper resources have been given to local councils and that accountability  exists. Many Members still sit on councils and are well versed in the planning  process. If we are going to lift this policy from the Department and set it  down in local government, we need to have a review. This is also relevant to  other clauses. Also, as part of the review, maybe we could look at a  third-party appeal process, if the Minister was keen to bring that forward.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">With that in mind, I support a number of the amendments. My  party colleague Willie Clarke will give the Sinn F&eacute;in view on the amendments.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kinahan</strong>:  I very much welcome the chance to speak at Consideration Stage. Before I start,  I thank the staff from the Committee and the Department for the long hours that  they put into the Bill. Without all their hard work, we would not be able to  make any of the comments that we make today. I am sure that they worked long  hours and well past midnight many times. I thank them for all the hard work.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">When I first spoke about the Bill, I was concerned that we  were dealing with it too quickly. I shall be brief, before I get on to the  amendments, but I am still concerned that we are doing this too quickly. Only  time will tell. We know that there are 17 or more sets of guidance to come  through and that this is really an enabling Bill. I want to ensure, both today  and at Further Consideration Stage, that we get the right checks and balances  into the Bill to make sure that the next Assembly has some control but, at the  same time, is able to hurry it all through. We do not want the Bill to be  sitting for ages without being implemented. We know that there are regulations  to follow, we know that we have to get RPA in, and we know that RPA failed to  get there the last time. There is a great deal that we need to get in place.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am also concerned that, with such a large Bill with so  many clauses, however human any of us are, we can start off for the first 25 or  50 clauses with full concentration, but, after two or three hours,  concentration has lapsed and things are getting more complicated. Without the  help of the Department and Committee staff, we would never have got through it,  and I congratulate everyone on all of their hard work.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We need to change our planning system, and the Bill is  absolutely vital to that. Therefore, the Ulster Unionist Party will support  most of the amendments. The group 1 amendments deal with the functions of the  Department and local development plans. I hope that Members do not go through each  amendment one by one. I will go through, as quickly as I can, the few that I  think are necessary.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We very much welcome amendment No 1, which replaces  &ldquo;contributing to the achievement of&rdquo; with &ldquo;furthering&rdquo; in relation to  sustainable development. I hope that the legal side that is advising us and  will be advising councils makes sure that we find a nice, comfortable way  through that that councils can afford.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We welcome amendment No 2. It means that we are taking  well-being into account, and I welcome the fact that it will allow us to plan  our walkways and our use of parks, forests, rivers and all sorts of things. It  will be a challenge for councils to find a way of interpreting it, and we will  need good guidance from the Department on that.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: I  appreciate the sentiments behind amendment No 2. However, does the Member not  envisage a bit of a problem? Well-being is not defined in legislation, so there  is a danger that, if it is contained in this legislation, we will be affording  a duty but people will not know what they are supposed to be doing. Is there  not a technical problem with that?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kinahan</strong>:  I thank the Member for that comment. I agree that there is a problem with  defining well-being, but given that the legislation is going to be there &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  On that very point, surely, if the sequence of events is that we have reform of  local government first and the legislation to enable that is first, those  powers of well-being and the definition of well-being should be included? The  Planning Bill and the transition of those powers should follow that reform of  local government. Therefore, a definition should be in there by the time any  transition of powers for planning takes place.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kinahan</strong>:  Again, I see the Member&rsquo;s point. We need good guidance on the definition of  well-being. However, the review system proposed in the last amendment in this  group is one way of looking at how we define well-being and take it forward.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is absolutely right that we put the onus on councils and  the Department so that well-being is part of the future. We have to find a way  of defining well-being. We want walking routes and pavements in the local  development plan in order to encourage people to walk, enjoy the countryside  and get fresh air. There is a whole lot more to it, and it is, therefore, right  that well-being is put in the Bill. However, we must find a way of defining it  in the future, and we all need to work on that.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">12.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 3 proposes that the Department &ldquo;take account  of&rdquo; policies and guidance. Amendment Nos 3, 4 and 5 are technical and ensure  that the Bill is tidied up, so I will not to go into them in great detail.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 6 proposes that councils take account of the  &ldquo;potential impact of climate change&rdquo;. It is rather like the amendment that  deals with well-being. It is absolutely meet and right that that is in the  Bill. We know that climate change is happening, whether we believe that we are  responsible for some of it or that it is natural. I am very concerned about the  possible massive costs to councils. We will need good guidance from the  Department and good discussions &mdash; particularly in the review, if we have it &mdash;  of what we mean by climate change.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We can pinpoint the easy issues, such as flooding and not  building on flood plains, but there are the other impacts, such as the grit  from road gritting going into gullies and poisoning the ditches or sheughs and  the impact of snow, if we continue to have longer cold spells. Another easy  point is transport and trying to get people out of their cars and lorries. Northern Ireland  relies very much on its transport system, and that puts an onus on the  Department and councils to keep an eye on climate change.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment Nos 9 to 14 are technical. I agree with them, so  I will move on.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">With regard to amendment Nos 15 and 16, I welcome the  ability to bring in an independent examiner. I particularly welcome it as it  will help councils to timetable. I see this as a learning process. As councils  produce their surveys and pull their local plans together, they will need as  much help as possible. It is absolutely right to have an independent examiner  to help things to move quickly, as long as the Department is not too  heavy-handed, and I have faith that it will not be. There will be backlogs, and  we must find our way through. The more people we have helping councils, the  better.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment Nos 78 and 79 will allow the Department to give  grants, and that is another good idea. However, I am slightly concerned about  giving grants to bodies that are not-for-profit, as most bodies are there for  profit in some way. I am not sure how that can be defined, and maybe the  Minister will clarify that. I also welcome amendment No 80, as it removes the  oversight role of DFP.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 86 is extremely important. As Members heard,  we had much discussion about that in Committee. We need a review mechanism in  place, and we have heard all along that a lot of the legislation is based on  legislation in England and Wales and that  they, too, are constantly learning. It is absolutely right that we have  something in place so that we can constantly look and see how well we are  doing. If there is to be a review once in the first three years, will that be  done with a body that is there all the time collecting information and advising  us how to do better, or will a new body be brought in in the third year? My  feeling is that it should be the first option, because it is probably more  cost-effective. I like the amendment because it forces us to have a review, no  matter who is Minister and no matter what Assembly we have. It is absolutely  right to do that. I hope that the Minister will look at the amendment and that,  if he does not support it, he will find a way of putting something in to act as  a check and balance in the future. The Ulster Unionist Party supports all the  amendments in group 1.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Today, I am reminded of why we are  discussing the transition of powers to local authorities. After the Macrory  report and the 1973 reform of local government, those powers were taken away  from local authorities because they had been abused. In any normal society, it  is accepted as the norm that local councils &mdash; parish councils, district  councils or whatever they are in other western democracies &mdash; deal with planning  and have various other powers. As we well know, however, the North is not the  norm.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The challenge for us as politicians is to move to a society  in which local politicians reflect the community and perform their duties and  functions in a role of absolute commitment to equality, transparency and to the  removal of the barriers to exclusion. As the Committee scrutinised the Bill,  usually in the Senate Chamber, it became increasingly apparent that the Bill  had been rushed through and was out of sequence. The document on the reform of  local government is merely out for consultation at the moment. That reform must  be in place before the Bill in order that &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. I thank the Member for setting the context for the debate.  I would like you now to address the amendments in this group, please.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy  Chairperson of the Committee for the Environment</strong>: I appreciate your  guidance, Mr Deputy Speaker and, indeed, your forbearance. However, without one  reform setting the context, we will get the other reform absolutely wrong. If  the Planning Bill is dealt with outside the context of the reform of local  government, the issues to which I referred &mdash; the lack of transparency, openness  and equality and the failure to protect against discrimination &mdash; will be  repeated. Those were pivotal to the errors of the past, and that is why I set  the context.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP broadly supports the first group of amendments. I  have no intention of going through each amendment individually. Mr Kinahan  highlighted the issue of well-being in amendment No 2. It is important for that  term to be defined. I hope that, as part of local government reform, it will be  defined.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I, like the Chairperson of the Environment Committee, sat  through an important inquiry by that Committee into climate change. Therefore,  I welcome amendment No 6, which requires councils to take into account the  &ldquo;potential impact of climate change&rdquo; when conducting surveys of their district.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 15 provides for the independent examiner to be  appointed by the Department. I welcome the recognition by the Department that  the independence of that examiner is pivotal and must be beyond reproach.  Therefore, the Department was asked by the Committee to tighten up the  conditions under which that independent examiner might be appointed, and the  amendment is welcomed accordingly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Moving quickly though the amendments, I welcome amendment  No 86 and thank Committee Members for tabling it. It is important because, as I  outlined earlier, the progress of the Bill, local government and reform should  be monitored. It is an important amendment that allows us to keep a close watch  on whether progress is made.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It would be wrong and remiss of me not to reflect the fact  that local government welcomes progress. It also welcomes the powers and the  oversight role that it is so necessary to deliver equality. Likewise, it wants  to make sure that it is not sold a pup by having to bear the costs of the  transition and the handover of those powers and that the process will, in  effect, be cost-neutral, not because the Department bumps up prices but because  a smooth transition is made. The Department must ensure that there is  compatibility when planning powers move from central government to local  government and that ratepayers are not lumbered with excessive rates bills as a  consequence. I know that the Minister has spoken about that issue before, but  the Environment Committee got mixed messages about it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Deputy Speaker, I thank you for your forbearance.  However, before I forget, I would like to pay tribute to the Committee staff  who punched in very long hours and to the departmental staff who put pedal to  the metal virtually every day to make sure that all of the information was  brought before us as efficiently as possible. I would like to pay tribute to  and thank them because, quite often, that goes unrecognised.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lo</strong>: I  welcome the Bill&rsquo;s Consideration Stage. We support the first group of  amendments except for amendment Nos 1 and 7. Clause 5 says that the Department  must carry out its functions with the objective of contributing to the  achievement of sustainable development. However, those two amendments would  change the wording to say that the Department must carry out its functions with  the objective of &ldquo;furthering&rdquo; sustainable development. We believe that the  amendments dilute the Department&rsquo;s commitment to sustainable development and  water down the legislation to achieve that. We, therefore, oppose amendment Nos  1 and 7.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr W Clarke</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Amendment Nos 1, 2 and 7 put  sustainable development at the heart of the planning system and link that to  the well-being of people in the North of Ireland. At Committee Stage, I felt  that the Planning Bill needed to be more robust in promoting sustainable  development and well-being. Sinn F&eacute;in believes that there is a huge opportunity  to move away from a land-based planning system to one based on spatial  planning, with people and communities at its core.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member who spoke previously said that the amendments on  furthering sustainable development will dilute the Department&rsquo;s responsibility.  However, Sinn Fein&rsquo;s opinion is that the amendments will actually strengthen  that responsibility, because they ask local authorities to go further than they  normally do. That is what we are trying to get at with &ldquo;furthering&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Other Members touched on the definition of well-being. I  think that it is widely know what is meant by &ldquo;well-being&rdquo;. It has already been  pointed out that that is out for consultation as part of the local government  reform process, of which well-being is a major plank. The Planning Bill, which  deals with well-being and sustainable development, is a driver for real change  by lifting people out of poverty, affording them better mental health and  ensuring that they have a better quality of life, all of which will have great  significance for Departments&rsquo; budgets. By putting planning at the heart of  people&rsquo;s lives, we will make greater savings in the long run. We have heard the  debates about the health budget not having enough resources. If Members think  about this strategically, they will realise that we are looking to front-load  the system in order to make savings in the long run. As I said, by giving  communities a greater sense of well-being, people will have better mental  health and self-esteem and will make a contribution through their taxes to this  establishment.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">12.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Department rejected the inclusion in the Bill of the  concept of well-being, because it said that there was no precedent for it. I  reject that. If there is a will, there is a way. The Department is being very  dogmatic about the issue. As I said, the local government consultation refers  to well-being, and it should be in the Bill. The majority of responses to the  Committee supported having sustainable development and well-being in the Bill.  We have a duty to ensure that, when the people speak, we listen. There is no  point in putting things out to consultation and people asking for major change  if we then decide not to implement those changes.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Sinn F&eacute;in supports amendment Nos 4 and 5, which strengthen  the requirement for statements of community involvement. We also support  amendment No 3.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 6, which Sinn F&eacute;in also supports, makes the  link between the planning system and the need to tackle and respond to the  impact of climate change. The amendment would make it a requirement for  councils to consider the impact of climate change when carrying out surveys of  their district. There is a need for local authorities to factor in best  practice. That is what we are talking about. We are talking about using the  best practice from around the world that helps to mitigate the impact of  climate change. We are not asking local authorities to carry out emission  surveys on a global level. We are asking that they gather the evidence and let  that formulate their views on implementing or designing local plans. We are  talking about using best practice to reduce our carbon footprint and emissions and  to combat flooding, which has a major impact on the island of Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Sinn F&eacute;in supports amendment No 15. The Department gave  clarification on the appointment of an independent examiner, saying that he or  she would be appointed only in exceptional circumstances and that the PAC would  always be the first choice in an examination. I welcome the clarification that  OFMDFM would cover the cost of the independent examiner.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 86, proposed by my colleague and me, calls for  the Department to carry out a review within three years of the implementation  of the Bill. It is Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s opinion that that is a sensible thing to do, so  that any problems that may arise can be addressed and greater comfort can be  given to local authorities.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At this point, I declare an interest as a councillor on  Down District Council. Local authorities are nervous about the number of powers  that are coming down from the Assembly, and they feel that resources will be a  problem, no matter what the legislation is, be it the High Hedges Bill, the  Welfare of Animals Bill or the Planning Bill. We need to give comfort to local  authorities and their umbrella support groups, such as NILGA, which were very  supportive of a review. As the Chairperson outlined, we are willing for the  review to be flexible, if there is a willingness in the Department for that.  That would be sensible, as it would help the Department, communities and local  authorities. If things are not working or need to be tweaked, there would be an  opportunity to do that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Also outlined was the opportunity to look at third-party  rights of appeal. That is the subject of an amendment that does not have a  snowball&rsquo;s chance in hell of going through because of the petition of concern.  Tabling a petition of concern is an abuse of power, because it was not designed  for this type of legislation. Planning impacts on everybody, not just people on  one side of the community or the other. This petition of concern is a total  abuse of power. We should be mature enough to debate what we want in a Planning  Bill. I hope that we get that maturity, and I hope that, if and when there is a  review, we can look at that again.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Obviously, there are problems. There is front-loading of  the system, a lot of community involvement and a lot of community planning. I  accept that. However, if there are still problems with ordinary citizens having  their rights heard, there is an onus on us to ensure that their voice is heard.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will finish by speaking about sustainable development,  the key deliverer in this Bill. It will add to a low-carbon economy in the  North and provide good job opportunities. Companies throughout the world that  are seeking to relocate are aware of their carbon emissions and carbon  footprint. If we are ahead of the game and leading the way, those companies are  more likely to set up their businesses in our part of the island of Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We need to look seriously at the renewables industry. I  know that I am going off slightly, but we need to ensure that everything that  we do is sustainable in the best possible manner. By putting that in the Bill,  we are saying that that will be the framework that the public sector and the  private sector work off. That will be the skeleton, and it will be up to the  rest of the sectors to put flesh on the skeleton.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Every Department says that it makes a contribution to  sustainable development, but no one ever leads that work. Through the Planning  Bill, there is now an opportunity for the planning sector to lead the rest of  the sectors in that regard. It will help to improve community life and  well-being. It will cut down on emissions and on people travelling in vehicles.  Instead, jobs, schools and opportunities will be relocated in neighbourhoods.  For too long, housing developments have been pushed out of the way to the outskirts  of towns &mdash; the problem is out of the way. Then you see major difficulties, with  people underachieving and having major health problems such as obesity and  mental illness. This is an opportunity to address that. I will leave it at  that.</p>

    <p class="OralAnswers-H2DepartmentHeading">Health, Social Services and Public  Safety</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Lagan Valley   Hospital</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">1. <strong>Mr  Givan </strong>asked the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety if,  and when, his Department will commission the South Eastern Health and Social  Care Trust to progress the development plans for the Lagan Valley   Hospital site. (AQO  1223/11<a name="AQO1223/11" id="AQO1223/11"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety (Mr McGimpsey)</strong>: The South Eastern  Health and Social Care Trust has already been asked to develop its outline  proposals for the future redevelopment of the Lagan Valley   Hospital site. I will  need capital to progress that work. However, I submitted bids of &pound;1&middot;8 billion  of capital to address the legacy of underinvestment under ISNI II. I had been  expecting &pound;1&middot;3 billion. In the run-up to the draft Budget, there were  suggestions of &pound;1&middot;1 billion, falling to &pound;0&middot;9 billion.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I eventually received &pound;851 million over four years, which  was less than half my bid. With contractual commitments of &pound;250 million and  annual fixed costs of &pound;100 million for the maintenance of an ageing health and  social care estate, that leaves less than &pound;200 million for new investment. That  level of funding is insufficient to meet the demands that are being placed on  the Health Service. The impact on the health capital programme will be  disastrous, and some very difficult decisions will have to be made.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Givan</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his response. I am sure that he would like to apologise  to the people of Lagan   Valley for his party  urging them to support the Tories, who reduced our capital allocations. Perhaps  he can explain why, given that the strategic outline business case for the &pound;50  million-plus development of Lagan   Valley Hospital  was submitted over a year ago, his Department has not asked the South Eastern  Health and Social Care Trust to commission the development of a full business  case.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I will begin by referring to the  Member&rsquo;s opening comment. Of course, a block grant came across to us of around  &pound;10 billion, and it is up to the Executive to decide. I am looking at DUP/ Sinn  F&eacute;in cuts. If Mr Frew is serious about the hospital in Lisburn, he would &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: Mr Givan. It is very hard to  remember the names of these unelected Members.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  Eighty million pounds has been set aside in the Budget for the social  investment fund. Has the Minister had any discussions with other Ministers  about how that fund may be disbursed, or, indeed, would it be available to him  for capital for projects such as the Lagan   Valley Hospital?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I am not aware of any such  moneys being available. I have a fund of &pound;851 million over four years, but when  &pound;250 million of current contractual commitments are taken out of that, along  with &pound;100 million a year for maintenance, it leaves very little money to do  anything. That is why I protest so strongly. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: The reality is that there is enough  money in the Budget. The fact is that the Department for Regional Development  (DRD) was getting &pound;2 billion under ISNI II. Under the new block, with all the  cuts in it, DRD still gets &pound;2 billion. The question is whether we want to spend  our money on hospitals or road bypasses. That is a very pertinent question. I  repeat: that is a matter for the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in, who came together to devise  the Budget and vote it through, in opposition to Ulster Unionist Party and SDLP  Ministers. We are where we are, but I assure Members that there is not enough  money in the Budget to begin to do what has to be done, never mind work our way  through the comprehensive list that I have.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member is not in his place for question 2. Question 3 has been withdrawn  because it requires a written answer. I call Ms Sue Ramsey.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Suicide Prevention</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">4. <strong>Ms S  Ramsey </strong>asked the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety for  an update on suicide prevention following the recent ministerial and Executive  meetings. (AQO 1226/11<a name="AQO1226/11" id="AQO1226/11"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: The ministerial co-ordination  group on suicide prevention supported the development of guidance on building  emotional resilience in schoolchildren and managing critical incidents in schools,  the development of community crisis response plans and further consideration of  preventative measures on the Foyle   Bridge. The response to  deaths in the Colin area and the operation of the &ldquo;card before you leave&rdquo;  protocol were also discussed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have provided an updated paper on suicide prevention for  discussion at the next Executive meeting.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms S Ramsey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I genuinely thank the Minister for  meeting my colleague Jennifer McCann and me yesterday. We had an in-depth  discussion. It just so happens because of the way the questions fell that the  subject has come up again today.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I would appreciate it if the Minister could provide as much  information as possible on the work that is going on in the Executive, because  I have concerns about other Ministers playing their roles. Media guidelines  also need to be looked at. I know that the Minister has given a commitment, but  if he could provide perhaps a written report, without going into too much  detail, on the incident in Lagan   Valley psychiatric unit a  number of weeks ago around the issue of suicide and self-harm, I would  appreciate it.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: On the latter issue, I said at  our meeting yesterday that I would write to the Member, and I will do that when  I have full details on the issue around the patient at Lagan Valley.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As the Member and the House are aware, we have set  guidelines for the media on the reporting of suicide, because improper  reporting of it has an effect on those individuals who are liable to self-harm.  That is why it is so important that those guidelines are in place and are  observed. Most of the media and press outlets observe them, although I regret  that there have recently been lapses. We will look to ensure that such lapses  do not happen again, because when they do, harm occurs.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">This is not a health issue alone. I think we are agreed on  that. This is a matter for the Department of Education, the Department for  Education and Learning (DEL) and the Department for Regional Development; it is  a matter for all Departments working together. We are looking at certain  responses; for example, I mentioned work being done on Foyle Bridge,  which is a suicide point in the north-west. We are also looking at pupils&rsquo;  emotional health and well-being. It is about building resilience. DEL wants to reduce the  number of young people who are not in education, employment or training, and we  are looking at other areas where the Departments of Health and Education can  co-operate, such as the Roots of Empathy programme in schools.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A lot of work is being done as well as what is being done  through the anti-suicide strategy. However, this is a matter of stamina; we  must keep with it and keep the pressure on. It will take a number of years to  fully address the issue, but we must never lose heart, because so many of the  victims of suicide are youngsters, and that is a double tragedy.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>:  Are the trends any different to what they were? What age group is most at risk?  Do we know the stats for the past couple of years, so that we can compare them  to now?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: The trend is up and down. In one  year, the number will be down and we get a wee bit of comfort, but the next  year it will jump up and then go down again, so we are getting spikes in the  numbers, which can be very discouraging. However, I am told that that is to be  expected. We have a number of actions in place through our Protect Life  strategy.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As far as the statistics are concerned, I understand that  people in the 25-44 age group are most likely to successfully commit suicide.  However, to an extent, and rightly so, we concentrate on the very young people  because some very young people are being affected. In the Colin and Lagan Valley  areas recently, there were a number of very young people in a cluster. We now  have strategies in each trust for cluster responses, because that is one of the  very terrifying aspects of this.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I join others in commending the Minister for the work and effort that he and  colleagues have put into suicide prevention. Will he elaborate on the divide  between urban and rural areas? Is the Department of Agriculture and Rural  Development engaged in the strategy to tackle suicide on a rural basis? When  the Health Committee visited Lifeline, mention was made of mobile phone roaming  charges.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: As far as mobile phone roaming  charges are concerned, we have agreements with some providers, although some  are now charging; it could be Orange  or O2, I am not sure which. However, we will follow that up because it is  important that they give us that contribution.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Suicide affects all strata in society and all ages, but it  is concentrated in the young. There is a clear correlation between suicide and  economic deprivation and educational disadvantage. That is unquestionable. The  main concentrations of suicide are in north and west Belfast, which are the areas that are the  most economically deprived. As well as a general response, we have a policy in  which money follows priority. That works in rural areas too, because they are  by no means immune, which is a point that the Minister of Agriculture and Rural  Development makes routinely with me. We do not ignore that, and we are not  complacent about it.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">DHSSPS: Capital Projects</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">5. <strong>Mr Cree </strong>asked the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety for his  assessment of his Department&rsquo;s capital projects in light of the draft Budget  2011-15. (AQO 1227/11<a name="AQO1227/11" id="AQO1227/11"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I submitted capital bids of &pound;1&middot;8  billion to address the legacy of underinvestment and I received less than half  of that &mdash; &pound;851 million &mdash; for the next four years. With contractual commitments  of &pound;250 million and annual fixed costs of &pound;100 million for the maintenance of  an ageing health and social care estate, less than &pound;20 million is left for new  investment. That level of funding is insufficient to meet the demands being  placed on the Health Service. The impact on the health capital programme will  be disastrous, and there will be serious implications for our ability to  deliver a modern Health Service. Some very difficult decisions will have to be  made.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Cree</strong>:  Will the Minister tell us when the planned improvements to Dundonald hospital are  likely to commence as a result of the budget?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: We need &pound;1&middot;8 billion, but we  planned to spend &pound;1&middot;3 billion at one stage and then it was &pound;1&middot;1 billion &mdash; the  number is all over the show. When one gets less than half of what is needed,  there is a critical mass of money that has to be spent before one even starts,  including &pound;100 million on the routine maintenance of old buildings.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have four major capital priorities: the Dundonald ward  block, the Altnagelvin radiotherapy unit, the maternity hospital in the Royal  and the local hospital in Omagh. All of those need the funding to go with them,  which means that although I may be able to get them started, the completion  times will be over years. That is the problem and the worry. The ward block  that the Member referred to in the Ulster hospital is failing. It has  concrete cancer and health and safety problems. It has a wiring system that is  more than 50 years old, and the heating system is in a similar condition. That  building will not last the time that it will take to get the money, which is  why the capital funding for the Health Service is so bad. It is disastrous. To  paraphrase somebody else, it is, frankly, obscene that we are being placed in  this situation bearing in mind that the Health Service has been starved of  funds for generations &mdash; over 40 years. The Health Service is again the main  bearer of the burden and pain as far as capital is concerned.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Buchanan</strong>:  Will the Minister inform the House where the proposals for the new local  enhanced hospital in Omagh now sit in his priority capital works? He will be  aware that the project was in the 2007-2011 comprehensive spending review (CSR)  period. We in Omagh were told by the Minister that the money was in the bag.  The project seems to have slipped off the radar. When will that new hospital be  built for the people in Omagh?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I remind Mr Buchanan that our bid  was for &pound;1&middot;8 billion, and then it was cut again and again. Even Mr Buchanan  will realise that those sort of cuts to a budget, which leave less than half of  what you were getting, will have an effect on how we deliver. As I explained to  him, the Omagh local hospital is one of my top four capital priorities. There  are others, but let me remind him that the Budget to come forward tomorrow  provides amounts of money that will not allow me to go forward on a number of  major projects. Mr Buchanan will have his opportunity tomorrow to vote for the  Omagh local hospital by rejecting the Budget that the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in have  concocted.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">2.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  The Assembly is aware that money is already in place for the new hospital at  Enniskillen to be completed and opened next year. In light of the permanent  secretary&rsquo;s statement, made following the cuts agreed by the DUP, Sinn F&eacute;in and  the Alliance Party, that the Health Service will be broke next year, will the  full range of services at Enniskillen that were identified in &lsquo;Developing  Better Services&rsquo; be delivered and fully funded by his Department? Will he give  us such an assurance?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: The Enniskillen hospital  contract is one that is let and to which we are legally bound. That is one  example of our contractual commitments that amount to &pound;250 million annually. As  far as services are concerned overall, in real terms, the health budget goes  down by 2&middot;4% over the next four years, and that is indisputable. It is a 2&middot;4%  reduction in real terms. That means that whatever activity is going on at the  minute will fall by 2&middot;4% over the next four years, and that is before we take  into account increases in demand and elderly population growth.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Health Service is needed most by younger and older age  groups, both of which are growing. We have the fastest growing population in  the UK  &mdash; the highest birth rate. At the same time, our elderly population cohort is  growing faster than in anywhere else in the UK. All those demands are coming  forward; never mind new drugs, therapies and treatments that we can see coming  down the line. Therefore, it is a mathematical fact that activity will fall. It  cannot do anything else. If we do not have the resource to drive the activity,  that activity will fall, and this Budget proposes a 2&middot;4% cut in Health Service  activity right across the board.</p>

    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  Question No 5 for the Minister. I beg your pardon, Mr Speaker, Question No 6</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">6. <strong>Mr  McCarthy </strong>asked the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety  what steps he has taken to encourage the sharing of health services with the Republic of Ireland. (AQO 1228/11<a name="AQO1228/11" id="AQO1228/11"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I am always glad to hear from  Kieran McCarthy.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My duty as Minister of Health, Social Services and Public  Safety is to secure the best possible services for the people. Where tangible  benefits are to be achieved, such as economies of scale, enhanced viability of  projects and concrete improvements for patients, I am ready to work with the Republic of Ireland for our mutual benefit. The  existing range of co-operation is extensive and goes beyond the original five  areas of co-operation in the Belfast Agreement, which, for example, did not  refer to child protection or suicide prevention.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his response. What dialogue did he have with the  previous Health Minister in the Republic? A new one will be appointed shortly.  Will the Minister get involved in further talks, so that the duplication of  services is avoided and the people in that part of the world will receive  nothing but the best from health services North and South?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I have routinely reported in  ministerial statements to the House the dialogue that I have had. Mr McCarthy  has had occasion to routinely ask me questions on that issue. As far as the  principle is concerned, it is where we gain mutual benefit. We go forward in  areas where I see mutual benefit for the Northern   Ireland population and the Minister down South sees  mutual benefit for citizens of the Irish   Republic.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Beyond the original five areas of co-operation, such as  accident and emergency and co-operation in high-technology equipment, we have  moved forward in areas including suicide prevention, child protection,  paediatric congenital cardiac services, the satellite radiotherapy unit at  Altnagelvin, GP out-of-hours, and so on.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There are a number of areas on which we have moved forward,  including cancer research and, indeed, the Ambulance Service memorandum. I have  always looked at such matters on the basis of where we will gain benefit, and,  yes, we gain benefit on both sides of the border. I will be active wherever I  see benefits.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs O&rsquo;Neill</strong>:  I welcome the areas of co-operation that the Minister outlined. However, since  the Minister frequently commissions reports but does not publish them, when can  we expect to see the publication of the North/South feasibility study, which  explores areas of efficiency in health and social services throughout the whole  island?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I do not commission reports and  not publish them. The Member was referring to a feasibility study that was  commissioned by Paul Goggins, who, as she will probably be aware, was a direct  rule Minister. I have no ownership of that report. Besides, I have, by and  large, taken forward the issues in it. As I said, I am not into spending money  on bureaucracy, which is what that report was about.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Not all cross-border co-operations are as fruitful as  anticipated. For example, two cross-border GP out-of-hours schemes are running  at the moment: one in the south Armagh/Castleblaney area, which is averaging  only 34 patients a month; and one in Donegal/Londonderry, which is averaging  only 10 patients a month. Those are examples of where we have tried  cross-border co-operation that does not work. However, there are successful  areas, such as the satellite radiotherapy unit. If only I could persuade the  DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in to come up with a proper capital budget, we could secure  cross-border co-operation that would serve as an example. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>

    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  Has the Minister read the programme for government that was agreed recently  between the Labour Party and Fine Gael in the South?

    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I have not had a chance to read  it. I have been engaged in battling those self-same DUP/Sinn F&eacute;in cuts, which  were voted through the Executive only last week. Of course, I am in a position  to speak about that. None of the Back-Benchers to my left was at that meeting,  so they are relying on reports; whereas I can report personally on what  actually happened.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We look forward to seeing how we can best deliver the  budget. Of course, the key relation&shy;ships are within the kingdom: England, Scotland  and Wales  working together in a joint Health Service. Of course, I have no compunction  whatsoever about co-operating with the Irish  Republic where it benefits Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Altnagelvin Area   Hospital: Neurology</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">7. <strong>Mr  Callaghan </strong>asked the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety  to outline the reasons for the additional waiting times for a neurology  appointment at Altnagelvin   Hospital. (AQO 1229/11<a name="AQO1229/11" id="AQO1229/11"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I understand that, as a result  of staff absences, there are specific challenges in the Western Health and  Social Care Trust. I have been assured that the trust is actively engaged with  the board in addressing pressures. However, it has proved very difficult for  the trust successfully to recruit a locum consultant to sustain services in the  short term. I fully acknowledge that people are waiting much too long for a  neurology appointment at Altnagelvin. That is totally unacceptable. This year,  I have invested &pound;6&middot;3 million to improve access to outpatient appointments.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Callaghan</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his answer.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Does he acknowledge, as I do, that the increasing delays of  up to 50 weeks have caused huge distress not only for patients with neurological  conditions but their families? Does he also agree that it makes no sense from a  health-outcomes point of view and from an economic point of view to allow what  are often degenerative conditions to worsen and that we need to take specific  measures in the west to address some of those recruitment and retention issues?  In particular, does he see scope for further North/South co-operation in the  north-west of the island to ensure that we build capacity there?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: Current capacity for neurology  services in the Western Trust does not meet demand. That is a fact. Efforts to  recruit have proved unsuccessful, and, in fact, consultants from the Belfast  Trust are attending to support the services in the west and in Altnagelvin. It  is very difficult to recruit a locum neurologist. That skill is very scarce. We  need to build capacity, and the best way to do that is through training and  support for our own staff. That, of course, needs a resource and investment  that we currently do not have. However, I have put in some &pound;6&middot;3 million this  year to do that. That is the best win and is the same approach that I have  taken to cardiac surgery, where capacity is short and where we need to build  it. However, I accept that patients in the Western Trust area are having to  wait too long.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bell</strong>: Is  it not the case that the cuts in neurology came as a result of the Cameron cuts  that the Health Minister acted as a cheerleader for? When will the Health  Minister be honest and tell the House when he will move from Cameron&rsquo;s cutter  to Cameron&rsquo;s quitter?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. Let us be careful. That is not a supplementary question to the original  question. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span> Order. It is not. Let us  move on.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms S Ramsey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Is the Minister aware that, to date,  in some trusts, private clinics are still being used to deal with NHS patients?  The reality is that we are still being charged extortionate prices. Will the  Minister agree to review some of those issues? When we talk about the  efficiencies in the Health Service, it seems to me that private medical  services are creaming off public patients.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I would love to know where that  is happening. Consultants have a contract and are contracted to work so many  hours a week. What they do out of hours is, frankly, their business. Whether  they do a bit more consultancy or paint their bedroom ceiling is a matter for  them. We have 11 consultants in Northern    Ireland. That is not enough, and we require  more. Talking about &ldquo;extortionate this&rdquo; and &ldquo;extortionate that&rdquo; is running away  from the issue and the problem. What is extortionate is the way that the Health  Service is being run down here. We currently have the worst-funded Health  Service in the UK  pro rata. We are worse than England,  Scotland and Wales, and I  have the figures to demonstrate it. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.] </span>Here  we go.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. Allow the Minister to continue.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: Shouting will not change the  facts. We were not in that situation four years ago. It is the situation now,  and that is why we have such waiting times for neurology services in the  Western Trust and all over. For anyone who has a capacity to listen, I will say  that that is getting worse. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: It is getting worse, and these  are &ldquo;made in Northern    Ireland&rdquo; cuts that have been voted through  by the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in at the Executive.</p>

    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Parades: Lurgan</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">1. <strong>Mr  Moutray </strong>asked the Minister of Justice what discussions he has with the  PSNI, the Public Prosecution Service and the Parades Commission following the  arrests of people involved in an illegal dissident republican parade in Lurgan.  (AQO 1238/11<a name="AQO1238/11" id="AQO1238/11"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice (Mr Ford)</strong>: I have regular discussions with the Chief Constable on a  range of issues and have discussed the topic of illegal parades. I have also  discussed the matter with the chairman of the Parades Commission. Decisions on  investigations in individual cases, however, are a matter for the Chief  Constable and his officers.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am advised that, to date, four people have been arrested  in relation to the parade in Lurgan on 23 January. All four have been released  pending a report to the Public Prosecution Service. Therefore, it would not be  appropriate for me to comment further on the matter.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">2.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Moutray</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his response. Many people across society in Lurgan  have done tremendous to create a situation that is now much improved. Given  that, will the Minister commit to pressing for speedy prosecutions and for the  maximum tariff allowable to be imposed on anyone who is convicted in relation  to events of this nature?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: I fear that Mr Moutray misunderstands my position. My  responsibility is to ensure that the Police Service has adequate resources to  protect the community, but issues of prosecution and pressing for maximum  sentences are entirely outwith the responsibility of the Department of Justice.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  Will the Minister join me in urging all political representatives to support  the Parades Commission in its decision-making role?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: Clearly, an election is coming up. I have no difficulty in doing  that. I highlighted the fact that I met the new chairman of the Parades  Commission. In the absence of agreement in the House on any other arrangements,  the Parades Commission has an important role to perform this coming summer and,  perhaps, for some years ahead. I hope that all public representatives, all  agencies related to the issue, those who parade and those who wish to protest  about parades will recognise that the Parades Commission has a job to do and  will engage constructively with it.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gardiner</strong>:  Last year, dissident activities in Lurgan cost &pound;220,000 to the rail network  alone. Can the Minister give an overall estimate of the policing and other  costs associated with managing the dissident threats?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: I cannot give an accurate estimate of the costs, because the  overall policing budget covers a number of areas between which there is  significant interplay. However, I can agree with what I suspect is Mr  Gardiner&rsquo;s point. The costs of providing for the security needs of this region  are excessive, and it is incumbent on all politicians and everyone in public  life to do all that they can to dissuade others from getting involved in such  activities.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">McGurk&rsquo;s Bar: Police Ombudsman&rsquo;s Report</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">2. <strong>Ms S  Ramsey </strong>asked the Minister of Justice to outline any discussions he has had  with the Chief Constable in relation to the Police Ombudsman&rsquo;s report on the  McGurk&rsquo;s Bar bombing. (AQO 1239/11<a name="AQO1239/11" id="AQO1239/11"></a>)</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">6. <strong>Mr D  Bradley </strong>asked the Minister of Justice to outline any discussions he has had  with the Chief Constable in relation to the findings of the Police Ombudsman&rsquo;s  report on the bombing of McGurk&rsquo;s Bar. (AQO 1243/11<a name="AQO1243/11" id="AQO1243/11"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: With your permission, Mr Speaker, I will answers questions 2 and 6  together.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I met the Chief Constable on Monday 28 February, and the  bombing of McGurk&rsquo;s Bar was among the items that we discussed. I was also  briefed by the Police Ombudsman on his findings. Having had those discussions,  I place on the record of the Assembly, as its Justice Minister, that it is  clear that those killed were in no way responsible for the bombing and were  innocent victims. I am deeply conscious of the pain that suggestions to the  contrary have caused to the relatives of those killed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">How we deal with the legacy of our past is a challenge to  the Assembly and the Executive. The Department of Justice and the organisations  that it funds will continue to play their part, but the issue is far wider than  one simply for my Department. The development of a coherent and effective  approach is, as I said, a challenge for all of us in the House.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms S Ramsey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for his response.  It is important that he has put on record that it is clear that the people  killed were not responsible and, indeed, were innocent. Does the Minister agree  that the interests of justice were not served by the inadequate investigation  by the RUC into the McGurk&rsquo;s Bar bombing?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: We need to be careful not to stray excessively far into the past  in the assumptions that we seek to make. It is clear that the Police Service of  Northern Ireland, as it exists today, has a significant and serious role to  perform in providing the policing needs for the people of Northern Ireland  and deserves the full support of everyone in the House in doing so. As I said  in my first response, it is also clear that there are other aspects relating to  the past for which agencies of the Department of Justice, specifically the  Historical Enquiries Team and the Police Ombudsman, have a remit.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, there are serious difficulties in seeking to  address all the concerns of the past if we simply use that as an opportunity to  drag up individual issues and seek to make major cases. There are matters of concern,  but the key issue must be to ensure that we provide for the needs of the  present day.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat. The central finding of the Police Ombudsman&rsquo;s report  on the McGurk&rsquo;s Bar bombing was that there was an investigative bias on behalf  of the RUC. Does the Minister regret the effective rejection of that finding by  the Chief Constable?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: I thank Mr Bradley for that question, but I am not sure that there  is much to be gained by my seeking to engage with matters that are for the  ombudsman or the Chief Constable about how the report was written and the  response to it. I am aware that the Chief Constable met representatives of the  families a few days after the report was published, and, on the basis of that discussion,  I understand that he agreed to make no further comment on the arrangements, in  accordance with the wishes of the family. In that respect, it is probably best  that I do the same.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Spratt</strong>:  The Police Ombudsman&rsquo;s initial report was published, and, seven months later, a  completely rewritten report was published. Will the Minister examine the  botched work of the Police Ombudsman? Also, has the Chief Constable indicated  whether any new evidence has been presented? The ombudsman indicated that there  was new evidence, but the Chief Constable has denied that. Has the Chief  Constable indicated to the Minister that new evidence has been provided in the  second report?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: It would be a very dangerous prospect for any Minister to start to  criticise the work of a body such as the Police Ombudsman&rsquo;s office. That would  lead us into significant difficulties. The Chief Constable has not told me of  any new evidence being provided. It is quite proper that he did not tell me  because it is an issue for the Chief Constable.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Community Safety Partnerships</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">3. <strong>Ms M Anderson </strong>asked the  Minister of Justice what steps he intends to take to ensure that the objectives  of community safety partnerships will be taken into consideration if the  amalgamation of district policing partnerships and community safety  partnerships become the new policing and community safety partnerships. (AQO  1240/11<a name="AQO1240/11" id="AQO1240/11"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: At the outset, I stress that I see community safety as being of  equal importance to policing in the concept of each new policing and community  safety partnership. From their inception, those partnerships will establish  their own plans, taking into account community safety and policing issues in  meeting the needs of their local area. They are new partnerships, but they may  choose to build on the objectives of existing CSPs and DPPs while working  within the remit set out by the Justice Bill, in which the functions inherited  from CSPs and DPPs are of equal importance. The PCSPs&rsquo; plans will also have to  sit with the strategic objectives of the joint committee, which will be my  Department and the Policing Board working together as equal partners. Those  strategic objectives will encompass the objectives of the Department of Justice  and the Policing Board in respect of policing and community safety and will  ensure a coherent approach across the 26 council areas.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms M Anderson</strong>: Go raibh  m&iacute;le maith agat. Does the Minister agree that the valuable work carried out by  community safety forums and partnerships should continue and not be replaced by  PCSPs and that they should work alongside them in some way to try to promote  better community safety?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: I thank Ms Anderson for that question. It is clear that we are  seeking to enhance the good work done on community safety in the new  partnerships. A number of groups will be related to the work of community  safety in different areas. The provisions are there for an open arrangement for  membership of the various partnerships to suit the needs of the local  community. However, it is vital that we build on the good work done by existing  partnerships if we are to seek maximum benefit from the new partnerships.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Empey</strong>:  I raised this issue with the Minister during discussions on the Justice Bill,  but with CPLCs, PACTs and the DPCSPs, it would be possible to deliver an essay  without saying a word.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Does the Minister agree that, although we encourage  engagement between the police and the community, having to attend so many  different meetings puts a huge burden on the Police Service of Northern  Ireland? If police attend and service those meetings, obviously, they cannot be  out fighting crime. Is the balance right or are there too many bodies for  police to attend?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: I was wondering whether we would get a kind of alphabet soup out  of Lord Empey&rsquo;s acronyms. He raises an entirely reasonable point. However, the  key issue is that in bringing DPPs and CSPs together into PCSPs &mdash; if we are  going to talk acronyms, let us really talk acronyms &mdash; the number of bodies will  be reduced. Those are the key bodies. There will be a single partnership for  each of 25 districts. In Belfast,  there will be a single partnership citywide and four DPCSPs, which represent  the city&rsquo;s four area-command sectors as they are currently composed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Lord Empey, rightly, draws attention to a number of other  bodies. Those bodies do not have the same status as proposed new partnerships,  nor are they touched by operation of the Bill. They remain in existence in so  far as, frankly, sector inspectors in the Police Service see them as serving a  valuable purpose in meeting the needs of their relationship with people in a  particular local neighbourhood. As Minister, I am not going to be prescriptive  and say that they should not exist. The issue is to ensure that there is an  overall structure that meets the needs of each district. Then, we allow local  liaison to proceed in a way that best suits the needs of local policing. That  is the appropriate way forward, regardless of whether there is an alphabet  soup.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr I McCrea</strong>:  The Minister will be more than aware of my views on DPPs and whether there is  any need for them. I suggest that there is not. Nonetheless, through the Bill,  the Minister has decided to bring DPPs and CSPs together. Will he ensure that  when the two bodies are amal&shy;gamated, the new body will provide value for money  and, indeed, the service that is required to show that community safety is at  its heart?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: Indeed, as he said, Mr Ian McCrea has made his views well known on  a number of occasions in the past. After detailed discussion at Consideration  Stage and Further Consideration Stage, the House has accepted that we will go  down the route of seeking to rationalise partnership by having a single  partnership in each district. One key issue is that it produces value for money  in that less money will be directed to administration of the two partnerships  and more money from available funding can, therefore, be devoted to appropriate  projects to promote community safety on the basis of whatever each local  partnership decides for its area.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  Will the Minister reassure the House that, despite Mr Ian McCrea&rsquo;s bizarre and  strange view on DPPs, the original idea behind them, which was to bring  accountability for policing to local areas, will be preserved with the new  arrangements along with the enhancement of community safety, and that it is in  everybody&rsquo;s interests that that takes place?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: I am sure that Mr Maginness would not necessarily expect me to  agree with his description of Mr Ian McCrea&rsquo;s views. However, he is correct; we  have sought to maintain one of Patten&rsquo;s key reforms, the creation of DPPs, in  the policing committees of new partnerships. I am committed to ensure that that  continues, alongside the work of the wider partnership as it seeks to promote  wider notions of community safety. At some point in the future, there may be  further rationalisation of the operation of those partnerships. However, I  doubt very much that I will be Minister when that happens.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Maghaberry Prison: Drugs</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">4. <strong>Mr P J  Bradley </strong>asked the Minister of Justice if he can confirm that prison  authorities recently introduced a drugs amnesty in Maghaberry prison. (AQO  1241/11<a name="AQO1241/11" id="AQO1241/11"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: Recently, the Northern Ireland Prison Service (NIPS) was made  aware that a quantity of illegal drugs had been smuggled into Maghaberry  prison. As a result of using those drugs, one person collapsed and had to be  taken to Lagan Valley Hospital  to receive medical treatment. It is clear that that bad batch of drugs posed  serious risks to prisoners. In such cases, the overriding concern must be for  the health and welfare of prisoners. That is why, in order to minimise risk and  proactively encourage prisoners to hand over their drugs, the governor of  Maghaberry prison alerted prisoners to concerns about the potential harm that  those drugs could cause and took the decision to not impose any sanction on any  prisoner who handed in illegal drugs within a 48-hour period.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Prison Service has a duty of care to prisoners, and  that action is in line with its policies on safer custody and on reducing the  harm of illegal drugs in prisons. Such amnesties are taken in only very  exceptional circumstances in which the risk posed is considered very high.  However, they are not unique to NIPS and are used from time to time by police  and prison services in other jurisdictions. On this occasion, no drugs were  handed in to the authorities, although it is possible that they may have been  disposed of in other ways.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">2.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Prison Service maintains a tough stance on drugs and  will continue to take every measure necessary to reduce the supply of drugs in  prisons and, in partnership with the South Eastern Health and Social Care  Trust, to provide a range of interventions and support services to prisoners  with addiction problems.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P J Bradley</strong>:  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s reply. Was that a one-off amnesty? Does the Minister  have plans to introduce further amnesties, if he cannot ease the drug  situation?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: Mr Bradley raises a fair point. There are no plans for further  amnesties, but that does not mean that further amnesties may not happen in the  future, if they are felt to be necessary in the interest of the health and  safety of prisoners. As I said in my substantive answer, this issue has to be addressed  from time to time by prison services and police services in every jurisdiction.  It is not a unique feature of Maghaberry or of Northern Ireland, but it is  important that we protect the lives of those who are in the custody of the  Prison Service.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. As part of a policy for clean health for  prisoners in relation to drugs, and in addition to the recent amnesty that was  seen in Maghaberry, has the Minister had discussions with the director general  of the Prison Service about education programmes and drugs awareness  programmes?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: The Member has raised a very interesting question. The simple  answer is that I, personally, have not discussed the issue with the director  general. I understand that it is an issue that is continually considered by the  Prison Service, but, in light of what has been said, it is, perhaps, an issue  that we need to prioritise.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Craig</strong>:  Will the Minister address another issue that is occurring in Maghaberry and  other prisons? Some prisoners are faking incidents. They get themselves taken  into hospital at taxpayers&rsquo; expense, get themselves treated with legitimate  drugs, then overdose on those legitimate drugs and cause even greater expense  to the public purse?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: I have no evidence of any occurrences of the sort that has been  suggested by Mr Craig. In the case of the recent incident that we talked about,  I understand that only one prisoner was taken to Lagan Valley   Hospital and that  prisoner received only outpatient treatment there.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Cree</strong>: Has  the Minister assessed the impact of the drugs amnesty in the prison on prison  staff morale? To what extent was the amnesty made necessary by the problems  associated with supervising visitors?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: I am not aware that staff morale was affected by the one-off,  short-term amnesty. As I said, amnesties are held in prison services in every  jurisdiction, and to suggest that the problem is unique to or particularly felt  in Maghaberry is flying in the face of reality.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Policing</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">5. <strong>Ms Lo </strong>asked  the Minister of Justice for an update on determining long-term policing  objectives. (AQO 1242/11<a name="AQO1242/11" id="AQO1242/11"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: I am working with the Chief Constable, his senior staff, the  Policing Board, partners in the policing and justice field and the wider  community to develop and shape the long-term policing objectives that our  community needs. Based on initial discussions, I have outlined some key themes  and proposals for new objectives. They are centred round the nature of policing  and the role of police in society.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In January, I published for public consultation a paper in  which those key themes were explored in more detail. The proposed objectives  cover the following areas: policing that is delivered in a way that protects  and vindicates the human rights of all; policing with the community as the  model for all policing; policing in partnership with other police services, the  public and statutory, voluntary and private partners; policing that responds and  adapts to emerging changes in society and contributes positively to that  transformation; and a police service that is free from external interference in  operational matters, but accountable, through the Policing Board, for  operational decisions and to the Department and the Assembly for the use of  public money.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The public consultation is ongoing and runs until  13 April. A number of meetings and discussions have already taken place during  the consultation period, and more are planned with key stakeholders before the  closing date.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lo</strong>: I  thank the Minister for a comprehensive answer, and I welcome the consultation.  I know that the Minister agrees with me that setting long-term objectives for  policing is a very important task and one that would benefit from the widest  possible participation, particularly from the community. Will the Minister let  us know the range of individuals and organisations he has so far engaged in  discussions?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: The range of organisations consulted was the usual wide range that  my Department would consult across many issues and included other Departments,  public bodies with any particular interest in policing, local councils and  DPPs. There is also the opportunity for the public in general to engage. I am  disappointed that, so far, we have received relatively few formal responses,  although they have come from, for example, the Lord Chief Justice, one or two  DPPs and the Police Superintendents&rsquo; Association. However, it is clear that, to  date, politicians in general, whether as Members of the Assembly or through  political parties, have not engaged with the policing objectives. I think that  that is something that we are all guilty of. We tend to respond when issues  arise, rather than respond at an earlier stage when consultation is going on. I  urge Members to take the opportunity to contribute to the discussion in  whatever format they wish in order to enhance the proposals for the new  objectives, which will be coming forward in the next Assembly.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Humphrey</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his answers so far. He has outlined to the House that  his Department is currently involved in a consultation process. Can he give an  assurance to the House that, when that process is completed, there will remain  one police service in Northern    Ireland and that there will not be two-tier  policing in this country?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: I can certainly assure Mr Humphrey that the objectives for the  Police Service of Northern Ireland are overarching objectives that will apply  to every part of the PSNI. Clearly local work will then need to be done in  conjunction with the new partnerships. I hesitate to name them for fear that  Lord Empey will pick me up on it. The issue is the overarching responsibilities  of the Police Service, in conjunction with the Policing Board. Mr Humphrey is  quite right to talk about a single police service meeting the needs of every  person in Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his answer. I have noticed his five overarching  objectives, but does he agree that the pre-eminent objective for the PSNI has  to be meeting the dissident threat and that, in doing that, the fullest  measures for the protection of police personnel must be in place?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: Mr Robinson is quite right to highlight the concerns we have about  the security threat, but it would be wrong to suggest that that is the  overarching issue as opposed to a very serious and significant issue that has  to be considered alongside the other work that being done to provide a modern police  service for every section of the community. We certainly need to take account  of the threat that this society is under, but to suggest that we should somehow  concentrate solely on that would be to undo a considerable amount of good work  being done by PSNI officers day and daily across Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  I am sure the Minister will concur that the single biggest objective facing  policing in the decade ahead should be to continue to build a police service  that is truly representative of our community as a whole. Does the Minister,  therefore, agree that any talk of ending 50:50 recruitment at this stage is  both premature and against the best interests of our community as a whole.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: No, I do not agree with Mr McDevitt. The policing objectives are  about setting appropriate objectives for the Police Service, regardless of who  serves in it in the years ahead. The 50:50 recruitment measure is the  responsibility of the Secretary of State and not the Department of Justice.  However, as an individual, I believe that in recent years we have seen a  significant improvement in the representativeness of the PSNI in serving this  community, and I certainly agree with those who believe that such artificial  measures do not have a place in a progressive, liberal society.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Question 6 has been answered. The Member is not in his place for question 7.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">DOJ: Budget</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">8. <strong>Mr  O&rsquo;Dowd </strong>asked the Minister of Justice what impact a &pound;7 million reduction in  his Department&rsquo;s budget would have on the work of his Department and its  agencies. (AQO 1245/11<a name="AQO1245/11" id="AQO1245/11"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: Any budget reductions for my Department would have significant  implications. Although a &pound;7 million reduction to a resource budget of &pound;1&middot;4  billion is only a 0&middot;5% reduction, recognition is needed that my budget is  ring-fenced. That does not mean that my budget is protected but that it derives  from the direct Barnett consequentials arising from changes in the funding  levels of the Home Office and Ministry of Justice. Given the security  situation, I could not reduce the police budget, so any additional cuts would  have to come from areas such as youth justice or probation. A &pound;7 million cut to  services in those areas would be significant and could be as much as 17% of  their annual budgets.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle agus a Aire. I thank the Minister for  that answer. The Minister will be aware that a recent SDLP proposal to deal  with &pound;4 billion of cuts imposed on the Budget by the Tories was that we would  remove &pound;7 million from the justice budget on the basis that it would have  absolutely no effect on the Justice Department. Will the Minister confirm, and  I think that he did confirm in his answer, that agencies such as the Probation  Board would suffer as a result of that? Will the Minister also confirm that  another agency already under pressure is the Police Ombudsman&rsquo;s office, which  is another area that could suffer under further cuts to his budget?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: I am not sure whether it is my function to sit between Sinn F&eacute;in  and the SDLP as they debate the election campaign. However, I answered Mr  O&rsquo;Dowd accurately: any such cuts imposed on the Department, failing to take  account of the issues about ring-fencing, would come from what are generally  seen as some of our most successful agencies, which provide significant  services in diverting adults and young people from crime, or from community  safety, the need to ensure the budget for which was discussed earlier. So, I am  extremely glad that in the context of a difficult financial settlement for the  Department of Justice based on that ring-fencing, with the exception of the  additional security funding grant, I am not facing a further &pound;7 million of  cuts.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Jonathan Bell for a supplementary. Sorry: Lord Morrow, Chairperson of the  Committee.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  That is the first time that I have discovered that the Chairperson of a  Committee has some benefits, anyway. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I listened carefully to what the Minister said about the  cuts. Can he confirm that the &pound;200 million that has been secured and confirmed  will ensure that the police have adequate resources to carry out the task  before them, particularly in relation to the dissident threat?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: Mr Speaker, maybe you should have called Jonathan Bell. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I entirely take Lord Morrow&rsquo;s point. He quotes the &pound;200  million. However, allowing for the additional funding granted from the Finance  Minister, we are talking about a package of about &pound;244&middot;5 million over four  years. So, I accept the grateful acknowledgement from my Committee Chairperson  that that is even better. However, it is necessary funding, predicated on real  threats to Northern Ireland  and the United Kingdom  and granted on the basis of serious and significant need. At the same time, the  Police Service has to make the same kind of efficiencies as other sections of  the Department of Justice. It will be a difficult settlement but provides  adequate funding. Of course, the option is there, should it be required, to  seek further additional funding from the Treasury.</p>

    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>:  Much has been said already about the amendments in group 1, and I intend to  keep my remarks fairly brief. At the outset, I join others in thanking  departmental and Committee officials for the many long hours that they have put  in. That work enabled us to get through the Bill with a high level of consensus  and to deal with what is probably the largest Bill that has ever come before  the Assembly, certainly the largest Bill in the lifetime of the current  Assembly. It is due to the work of the Department, the Minister and the  Committee that many issues were resolved. It is important that the Planning  Bill is got right, and the reason for the large number of amendments is so that  what we put in place will be fit for purpose.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I now turn briefly to a couple of the amendments in group  1. When councils take responsibility for planning &mdash; Mr McGlone and others  expressed caution about that &mdash; there will be a massive culture change for those  in the councils who will be involved in planning. Therefore, it is important  that it is got right. Although, the focus in most people&rsquo;s minds is on  individual planning applications, it is important that development plans, which  will be a key aspect for local authorities, are also got right. Consequently,  amendment Nos 13 and 14 to clauses 8 and 9, which highlight that plan  strategies and local policies plans must be approved by either the resolution  of the council or the Department, are important and significant. They will  provide a guarantee that what will be put in place will be supported and has  been got right.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Concerns were raised about the Planning Appeals Commission  and the creation of the independent examiner, and amendment Nos 15 and 16 will  mean that the latter should only really intervene when the PAC is unable to  conduct the independent examination. That issue was discussed at great length  by the Committee, and I am glad that the Minister took its position on board.  As a result of those amendments, what was implicit in the intention of the  Department will be made explicit in the Bill. Many Members expressed the need  to have something in place in addition to the PAC, and we can all point to long  delays in the planning process. Amendment Nos 15 and 16 will improve the  process and will ensure that the independent examiner is only used in limited  situations. As a consequence, it will be done in the right way.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">With reference to amendment No 5, there has been much  discussion about the importance of community involvement, the broader issue of  which will be discussed in a different guise when we debate the third group of  amendments. The position that was taken to try to front-load community  involvement and to get things right at the start, so that we do not need to  make corrections later, is correct. Consequently, there is a duty, at an early  stage, to work with the community, while the need to have a statement of  community involvement in any development plans, which is contained in the very  clear-cut departmental amendment No 5, should also be strongly welcomed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I indicated that there was a high level of consensus.  However, there are some aspects that concern us, and I will highlight one.  Other amendments largely involve tinkering with wording, which may not be of  major significance, but I have strong concerns about amendment No 6, which  proposes to add the potential impact of climate change as a matter for councils  to keep under review.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Climate change is largely dealt with on an international  basis. Certainly, where monitoring is done, it is on a high-level national  basis. The expectation that councils will make an assessment of the potential  impact of climate change in their locality will inevitably drive them in one of  two directions. The assessment may become, in effect, a tick-box exercise. A  high level of expertise and technical knowledge is required for a proper  assessment. Councils may give a vague, general assessment, perhaps through a  lack of evidence, in which case it becomes a slightly meaningless gesture. The  scientific or statistical value of that has to be questioned. Alternatively,  there will be a compulsion on councils to invest vast sums of money on highly  technical and sophisticated monitoring. Members, including, I think, Mr  McGlone, raised councils&rsquo; concerns that what is put in place must be  cost-neutral and must not place an extra burden on the ratepayer.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My concern is that focusing the issue of the impact of  climate change on local councils is to focus it in the wrong direction. That  issue needs to be tackled nationally and internationally. If amendment No 6 is  made, it will lead to one of two situations: it either becomes a glib, tick-box  exercise that benefits no one, or, if it is done properly, it will be at a high  technical and administrative level that would place a great burden on  ratepayers. Consequently, I do not believe that that amendment is to be  commended.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Most people will not have objections to the broad thrust of  the amendments in group 1. Therefore, having made my remarks, I am happy to see  the Bill move forward.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Savage</strong>:  The amendments in group 2 relate to enforcement and penalties. I welcome  amendment Nos 17 and 18.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. I remind the Member that we are at group 1. There may have been a  misunderstanding on his part.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Savage</strong>:  Thank you, Mr Speaker. I declare an interest as a member of Craigavon Borough  Council.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Group 1 relates to the functions of the Depart&shy;ment and the  local development plans. Amendment No 2 amends clause 1 and requires the  Department to take well-being into account as part of its planning functions.  Although I broadly support that principle, I question how it can be enforced or  what proof will exist that the Depart&shy;ment has actually taken well-being into  account. What or who will define what well-being is?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment Nos 4 and 5 introduce a time limit within which  the Department must produce and publish its statement on community involvement.  What penalty exists, should the Department fail to produce such a statement? I  ask that because I am aware that that requirement already exists in statute and  has done for several years, but a document has never been produced. What  assurance is there that the Department will comply this time and within what  timescale?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am broadly in support of what amendment No 6 sets out to  accomplish. However, I am concerned about the extra costs that could be  incurred by councils. Perhaps the Minister or the Member who tabled the  amendment could elaborate on how those potential costs would be paid and by  whom. I also welcome amendment No 15 as a positive step forward.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Amendment Nos 78 and 79 give me cause for concern.  Perhaps the Minister could provide further clarity and detail on how those  amendments would work in practice.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 86 is a new clause tabled by my Committee  colleagues, and I am keen to support it in principle. I am keen that  legislation, especially key legislation such as that before us today, is  reviewed regularly to ensure that it is fit for purpose. The legislation must  also be cost-effective. Will a three-year review and a review every five years  thereafter deliver value for money?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Those are my concerns. Other than that, I am content with  the group 1 amendments.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B Wilson</strong>:  I begin by paying tribute to the Committee Clerk, the Committee staff and the  departmental officials for all the work that they put into getting the Bill to  this stage. The Committee received this massive Bill in December, and I shared  other Members&rsquo; concerns about the speed with which it was being processed.  Without the exceptional efforts made by the staff, the Bill would not have  reached this stage.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I share Mr McGlone&rsquo;s concern that we are putting the cart  before the horse. He said that we should carry out the reform of local  government before we transfer any additional powers to councils. I well  remember the comments in the Macrory report on why planning powers were taken  away from councils and centralised. Having said that, I support the principle  of transferring planning powers to local government, and I support the  amendments, which will strengthen the Bill and can restore public confidence in  the planning system.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome amendment Nos 1 and 2, which are designed to put  sustainable development at the centre of the planning system. At present, the  planners argue that each planning application should be considered on its  individual merits, with no regard for the cumulative effect of each decision.  In many cases, that is unsustainable and will lead to problems in the future.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I also welcome amendment Nos 4 and 5, which strengthen the  opportunity for community involvement. I support amendment No 6, which links  planning to climate change. That is essential, given what is happening today.  Climate change will become increasingly important over the next few years, as  was recognised by many respondents to the consultation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I also welcome amendment No 15, which tightens the  conditions under which an independent examiner may be appointed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, I support the introduction of the new clause  through amendment No 86. Although I accept that the Department will keep all  new legislation under review, the specific timetable in the amendment will  ensure that the Department focuses on the issue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Overall, I support the amendments and believe that they can  increase public confidence and involvement in the planning system.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment (Mr Poots)</strong>: A number of the amendments in group 1 arose  from recommendations made by the Committee for the Environment during Committee  Stage. So I thank the Chair and Committee members for the considerable time and  energy that they devoted to the Bill, which has clearly been scrutinised carefully.  The Committee raised helpful questions and made a number of recommendations,  most of which I was pleased to accept.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As mentioned, a lot of work was done by the Committee staff  and my staff to ensure that we got to this point. I put on record my gratitude  to all parties involved in achieving that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Clauses 1 and 5 place a duty on my Department, councils and  others to exercise their functions under the Bill with the objective of</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;contributing to the achievement of sustainable  development&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">In amendment No 1, the Chair of the Environment  Committee proposes a change to &ldquo;furthering&rdquo; sustainable development. His  wording is at odds with the general sustainable development duty on public  authorities, as set out in section 25 of the Northern Ireland (Miscellaneous  Provisions) Act 2006.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As Ms Lo pointed out, the amendment would weaken the  sustainable development provision. So I am in something of a quandary: Brian  Wilson seems to support the weakening of the sustainable development proposal,  and Ms Lo is opposed to it being weakened. I am in the hands of the House on  that, but my Department&rsquo;s view is that the amendment would weaken the  sustainable development duty outlined in the Northern Ireland (Miscellaneous  Provisions) Act 2006.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">3.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Chairperson of the Environment Committee also proposed  through amendment No 2 that my Department&rsquo;s planning functions be expanded to  include, &ldquo;promoting or improving well-being&rdquo;. We are considering a new power of  well-being for councils but, as yet, that does not exist in statute. Therefore,  it may be deemed inappropriate to refer to it in the Bill as we do not have a  definition at this point and it may be some time before we have a definition of  well-being. Again, I will be in the hands of the House on that issue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In amendment Nos 3 to 8, I propose that, in exercising the  functions under the Bill, DOE and the councils should &ldquo;take account of&rdquo;  guidance issued by DRD and OFMDFM, rather than &ldquo;have regard to&rdquo; it. The wording  was recommended by the Environment Committee as a more accurate reflection on  the Department and councils in that context.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Clause 2 requires the Department of the Environment to  prepare a statement of community involvement. That statement sets out the Department&rsquo;s  policy for consulting the community about its planning control functions.  Through amendment Nos 4 and 5, I aim to make it clear that the Department must  also publish its statement and that that must be done within one year of clause  2 of the Bill coming into effect.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Clause 3 requires councils to keep under review matters  that affect the development of their district. Through amendment No 6, the  Chairperson of the Environment Committee proposed that councils must keep under  review</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;the potential impact of climate change&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The clause already requires councils to keep under  review an extensive list of issues, including</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;the principal physical, economic, social and  environmental characteristics of the council&rsquo;s district&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Across the UK, greenhouse gas emissions are  estimated in line with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate  Change reporting guidelines. Data are recorded annually, and included in the  greenhouse gas inventories is one for Northern Ireland. The gathering of  that information requires particular methodologies and expertise. It is costly,  and the amendment could place an expensive burden on councils with little  benefit derived. I want to make it clear that I am urging Members not to accept  the amendment, as it would be wholly detrimental to the work of local  government and would pass on a burden to local government that would not create  significant benefit. To that extent, I agree with Mr Savage that we should  resist the amendment strongly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Clause 6 states that a local development plan comprises two  development plan documents: the plan strategy and the local policies plan. The  clause also identifies the local development plan as the primary consideration  in the determination of planning applications. Amendment Nos 9 to 12 are  designed to add clarity to the clause.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Clauses 8 and 9 describe the preparation requirements for  the two development plan documents, and I propose amendment Nos 13 and 14 to  make it clear that the plan strategy and the local policies plan must be  adopted by resolution of the council or approved by the Department of the  Environment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Clause 10(4) requires the Department of the Environment to  cause an independent examination of a council&rsquo;s development plan document to be  carried out. The Department can appoint either the Planning Appeals Commission  or another person to carry out the examination. I have consistently made it  clear that the Planning Appeals Commission will be the Department&rsquo;s first point  of contact for an examination. An independent examiner would be used only where  the Planning Appeals Commission is unable to conduct the independent  examination within a reasonable time frame. We have just gone through a period  in which there has been a two-year tailback for individual applications. If we  look at the time taken to bring forward the Magherafelt area plan and the Belfast metropolitan area  plan and if the capacity does not exist in the PAC to turn those area plans and  significant decisions round within a reasonable time frame, we can see that we  need to have a fallback position. This gives us that fallback position, and I  strongly recommend it to the House.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee recommended that the Bill should make it  clear that the PAC should be the first port of call.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have designed amendment Nos 15 and 16 to fulfill the  Committee&rsquo;s recommendation. They make clear that the Department will appoint an  examiner only after it has had regard to the district council&rsquo;s timetable for  the preparation of its development plan.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Clause 221 re-enacts provisions of the Planning (Northern Ireland)  Order 1991. It allows my Department to award grants to non-profit-making  organisations to provide technical or other assistance to the community or to  further the preservation etc of historic buildings. Let me clarify for Mr  Kinahan that a not-for-profit organisation is an NGO or a voluntary body. The  Environment Committee recommended that this clause should allow grants to  bodies which have the objective of furthering an understanding of planning  policy proposals. I welcome that suggestion, and have proposed amendment No 78  to achieve it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee also suggested that DFP&rsquo;s oversight role in  relation to such grants was no longer needed. DFP is content that the  legislative provision requiring its approval is no longer required for all  grants. Of course, DFP approval will be required for any grant that exceeds the  relevant delegated limit. So, in amendment Nos 79 and 80, I propose to remove  the legislative requirement for DFP approval and, with it, a little red tape. I  thank the Committee for bringing that to my attention.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Cathal Boylan and Willie Clarke proposed, in amendment No  86, that a report on the implementation of the Bill should be prepared within  three years and at least once in every period of five years thereafter. The  Bill affords the Department of the Environment an audit role in relation to the  councils. As an additional safeguard, the Department will also have  consider&shy;able oversight and intervention powers. The Environment Committee and  the Department may choose to review the workings of the Bill or any aspect of  it at any time. The amendment itself is not necessary and does not add to the  Bill. I do not necessarily support it, but I am not opposed to it either. It is  something that we can do in any event, and it is not something that causes me a  great degree of concern.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will respond to a few of the Members&rsquo; points. Mr Boylan,  the Committee Chairperson, suggested that the amendment on climate change has  to do with councils taking action to reduce climate change. However, clause 3  is to do with councils keeping issues under review. As regards addressing  climate change through planning, it is our intention to address that issue in  the revision of Planning Policy Statement 1without adding that extra burden  onto councils, as I said earlier. Therefore, we have a way of achieving the  outcome which Members rightly desire without placing a heavy financial burden  on local authorities in the process.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Patsy McGlone engaged in a bit of revisionism and seemed to  be stuck in the 1970s. To bring him on: we are well into the twenty-first  century now, and we would do better to concentrate on what we are doing to take  things forward, as opposed to harking back.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As to the planning fees review, we are not bumping up  prices but adjusting the fee structure to ensure that the fee charged  realistically addresses the cost of processing applications. Historically, the  cost of providing a planning service has been subsidised by the taxpayer, often  to the benefit of developers and multinationals. For example, the maximum fee  for housing or commercial plant development is &pound;11,834, yet many of those  developments run to many millions of pounds. I am not one to ask the public to  subsidise those who are doing well, whether they are developers or  multinational supermarkets. The public should not have to subsidise them, and  that money can be better spent elsewhere. Therefore, I will seek to get a fee  structure that ensures that we get an adequate return.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McGlone referred to the &pound;10,000 that we would charge for  our work associated with each environmental impact assessment (EIA).</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">An awful lot of that is specialist work involving  environmental statements. We also have considerable advertising costs. In one  recent case, for example, advertising cost my Department &pound;9,000. Consultants  and developers build in &pound;100,000 to the cost of preparing an environmental  statement when an EIA is needed, so the &pound;10,000 that is associated with our  work is only 10% of what they already build in to the cost.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Willie Clarke referred to the Northern Ireland (Miscellaneous  Provisions) Act 2006 and the duty on all Departments and councils to contribute  to sustainable development, which I have already made clear will be weakened if  we accept the amendment. I advise him that OFMDFM leads on a cross-departmental  strategy associated with that duty, so I hope that he does not get into too  much trouble with the deputy First Minister for saying that no one is leading  on it. I am sure that the deputy First Minister will not be too sore on him for  his misdemeanour on this occasion. I am just politely pointing that out to him.  Each Department then has a responsibility to respond to it on those issues.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We are happy to go with most of the amendments, as they do  not do violence to the Bill. However, I strongly urge the House not to impose  something on district councils that would place a significant financial burden  on them in addressing climate change.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for the Environment (Mr Boylan)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a  Cheann Comhairle. It is clear from today&rsquo;s debate that planning functions,  which are currently with the Department but which will soon be with councils,  are of huge interest to us all. The Bill is the underpinning primary  legislation that will support a new way of planning in the North. Let us now  take the time to think about what that should look like and to listen to the  different contributions in this the first of four debates on the Planning Bill  today.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I particularly urge all in the Chamber to think about the  Committee&rsquo;s recommendations, all of which were made on the back of stakeholder  input. At the start of this process, the Minister suggested that we did not  need to ask stakeholders what they thought of the Planning Bill because his Department  had already undertaken several consultations on it. However, I can tell the  House today that, although he may have invited comments on several occasions,  stakeholders were quick to inform the Committee that he was not always willing  to listen or to act on their comments. That is what the Committee is doing  today. Our evidence has been consistent and compelling and is shared by most if  not all stakeholders. The Committee tabled amendments that the Department  refused to bring forward to address the concerns.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I thank Members for their contributions. I just want to  pick out some of the issues that were raised. Overall, the work from the  Committee was good and well-focused. I know that we have all heard about the  issues with the time frame, but I actually think that that made us more  focused. Mr Kinahan said that he supports all of the amendments, but he talked  in particular about amendment Nos 1 and 2, which deal with furthering  sustainable development and well-being, as did Mr McGlone. Mr McGlone also referred  to a review of the Planning Act, which is dealt with in amendment No 86. I do  not propose to go through everything that the Members said. However, I think  that confusion reigns over amendment Nos 1 and 7, which deal with furthering  sustainable development. Maybe we all need to have a wee look again at that in  the dictionary. It would not be like Planning Service to base everything on  interpretation, or the lack of it. Anna Lo made that point, and her views on it  have to be clearly recognised. However, other Members have a different view, so  maybe we need to seek clarity on that in the future. Mr Clarke strongly  supports the inclusion of well-being in the Bill and the amendment that he and  I tabled. I think that there is a need for a review. The Minister said that  that process already exists, but I think that it needs to be set out in the  Bill.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">3.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Weir welcomed amendment Nos 13 and 14. He also talked  about the statement of community involvement. He was correct in what he said  about front-loading, although he will no doubt use that argument when we debate  third-party appeals in the group 3 amendments. I thank him for his  contribution.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Savage talked about the well-being principle, but he was  concerned about support for amendment No 6, which deals with climate change. He  was concerned, in particular, with the cost implications. However, I believe  that we need that provision in the Bill. People should recognise the cost and  consider how we will deal with the issue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Brian Wilson supported most of the amendments. He has spent  a number of years on the Committee and has, from day one, talked about climate  change. He feels very strongly about that and wants to see the amendment on  that in the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will finish by mentioning some of the Minister&rsquo;s comments.  He alluded to maybe fitting the climate change issue into PPS 1 and the guiding  principles. He also supported amendment Nos 13 and 14.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We have another three groups of amendments to get through,  so I do not propose to go through all the amendments. I ask the Assembly to  support the amendments in group 1.</p>

    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: In explaining amendment No 17, I should say that this  group of amendments mainly arises from recommendations made by the Committee  for the Environment during Committee Stage. I repeat my thanks to the Committee  Chairperson, members and staff for their assistance.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill sets time limits within which enforcement action  may be taken in respect of breaches of planning control. When a breach consists  of the carrying out of building, engineering, mining or other operations  without planning permission, no enforcement action may be taken after four  years. That period begins with the date on which operations were substantially  completed. Similarly, if a breach consists of a change of use of any building  to a single dwelling house, no enforcement action may be taken after four years.  However, in the case of any other breach of planning control, including other  changes of use, no enforcement action may be taken after 10 years. When the  Committee proposed simplifying the system by having only one time limit, I was  happy to agree. Therefore, I propose amendment Nos 17, 18, 43, 44, 45, 48, 54  and 46 to simplify and clarify the system by setting the time limits within  which enforcement action may be taken for all breaches of planning control at  five years.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee expressed its strong and clear view that the  fines for a range of offences in the Bill were no longer a sufficient deterrent  and should be increased. The Chairman of the Committee has tabled amendment Nos  28, 40, 42, 49, 52 and 55, which propose that the maximum fine for offences  relating to certain breaches of planning control be raised from &pound;30,000 to  &pound;100,000. Those breaches are the unauthorised alteration, demolition or  extension of listed buildings, contraventions of hazardous substance control,  contraventions of tree preservation orders, contraventions of temporary stop  notices and contraventions of enforcement notices and stop notices. They appear  in clauses 84, 116, 125, 136, 146 and 149. The Minister of Justice has  questioned the proportionality of &pound;100,000 fines in that context.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Clause 102 establishes that anyone carrying out damage to a  listed building will be guilty of an offence. It also establishes that a person  who fails to prevent damage or further damage resulting from that offence is  guilty of a further offence. For each of those offences, the clause imposes  fines at level 3 on the standard scale, which is currently &pound;1,000. Given the  scale of the potential impact of such damage to listed buildings, I propose,  through amendment Nos 31 and 33, to raise the fine to level 5, which is  currently &pound;5,000. I am also pleased to support amendment No 32, which is  proposed by the Chairperson of the Committee. It would make acts causing damage  to a listed building a more serious offence by including an option of  conviction on indictment and an unlimited fine.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will move to amendment No 47 and refer first to clause  132, which provides for the issue of a planning contravention notice. That  notice gives councils the power to obtain information prior to taking  enforcement action. The aim is to encourage dialogue with any persons who are  thought by a council to be in breach of planning control and to secure their  co-operation in taking corrective action. Failure to comply with such a notice  within 21 days is an offence. On summary conviction, an offender would be  subject to a fine not exceeding level 3 on the standard scale, which is  currently &pound;1,000. Having taken account of the views of the Committee, I propose  that that fine should be raised to level 5, which is currently &pound;5,000. That  proposal represents a tougher yet proportionate approach. Once an enforcement  notice has been complied with, the requirements in it continue to stand for the  future use of the land to which it relates. That continuance of use must be  permanent, as must the alteration or removal of buildings. A breach of that  requirement is punishable by a level 5 fine, which is currently &pound;5,000. A fine  of &pound;7,500 would be a more appropriate and proportionate deterrent, and that is  what I propose through amendment No 53.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Those are the amendments in group 2.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for the Environment</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann  Comhairle. Amendment Nos 17 and 18 pave the way for an amendment later in the  group that the Committee was keen to see. Although the Committee was originally  content with the relevant clauses, I am confident that I can support the  amendments on the Committee&rsquo;s behalf.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will deal with amendment Nos 28, 40, 42, 49, 52 and 55  together because they all address the same principle. As I mentioned in the  debate on the first group of amendments, it is disappointing to note that,  during Committee Stage, the Department indicated that the Minister would bring  forward these amendments. The Department not only provided draft amendments for  the Committee to consider but even advised the Committee, which had pushed for  the first three amendments in this group, that the other three amendments would  bring consistency to the Bill. The amendments add up to six in total.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Many respondents to the Committee&rsquo;s call for evidence  stated that the fines mentioned in the Bill, whether listed as scales or  levels, were no longer of a sufficient deterrent value to prevent the  unauthorised demolition of listed buildings or protected trees. The Committee  felt that it was important that fines listed in the Bill gave a clear  indication of the seriousness of such breaches. Members are concerned that  developers no longer see fines as deterrents but as something more akin to  costs to be factored into their plans. The Committee was also mindful that the  fine amounts were largely determined some 20 years ago in the Planning Order  1991. Then, a fine of &pound;30,000 may have been appropriate, but it would not act  as a deterrent today. The Committee, therefore, recommended that all fines of  &pound;30,000 in the Bill should be increased to &pound;100,000 to ensure that the fine is  a proper deterrent that reflects the seriousness of the offences. On behalf of  the Committee, I support amendment Nos 28, 40, 42, 49, 52 and 55.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment Nos 31, 33 and 47 are also to do with fines. The  Committee called for current level 3 fines of &pound;1,000 to be raised, and it  welcomed the Department&rsquo;s agreement to amend them to level 5 fines, which have  a current value of &pound;5,000. Similarly, the Committee welcomes the Minister&rsquo;s  agreement to augment to &pound;7,500 the current level 5 fine, as proposed by  amendment No 53.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is not immediately clear to me why the Minister feels  that he can table amendments to raise those fines but not the other, much more  significant ones. The Committee and I believe that we must send out a clear  signal, through the Bill, that the days of developers treating fines as part of  the process are over. We need to have meaningful deterrents to stop deliberate  acts of damage to listed buildings and trees and to stop breaches of planning  permission, protection orders and so on. The amendments provide the opportunity  to do that, and I urge the House and the Minister to show more consistency by  supporting all the amendments that will increase fines.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee tabled amendment No 32 when it realised that,  unlike with most offences in the Bill, there was no option for fines on  conviction on indictment for acts causing or likely to result in damage to  listed buildings. The Committee felt that that must be rectified, and it was  disappointed when the Department refused to bring forward such an amendment.  Fines on conviction on indictment offer an opportunity for courts to reflect  the seriousness of a breach and to penalise repeat offences in a way that  upper-limited penalties cannot. If we are serious about protecting our  heritage, the House should support amendment No 32.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will now speak to amendment Nos 43, 44, 45, 46, 48, 54  and 58. The Committee questioned the continuation of the 10-year time limit for  breaches of planning control other than for building, engineering, mining or  other operations and for the change of use of any building to be used as a  dwelling house. The Committee asked the Department to consider reducing that period,  on the grounds that a single period would reduce confusion, lead to better  enforcement and require less time to identify such breaches.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Department indicated that the Minister accepted that  introducing a single time period would make the system simpler and less open to  misunderstanding. It suggested that seven years for all planning activities  might be appropriate. The Committee questioned the point at which a change  would become applicable and was assured that the time limits would not be  applied retrospectively. The Committee was not content for the current  four-year period to be increased to seven years, but it agreed that a single  period of five years would provide the most appropriate balance for time limits  on breaches of all planning controls. Members were content that the Department  accepted that, and, as Chairperson, I accordingly support the seven related  amendments.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That concludes my discussion of the Environment Committee&rsquo;s  position on the group 2 amendments. I know that my party colleague will say  more, but, on behalf of Sinn F&eacute;in, I would like the Minister to clarify why he  withdrew his support for the &pound;100,000 fine. I welcome the change of use limit  to five years. I know that there will be a wee bit of a debate on that in the  Chamber, which is welcome. I support the amendments.</p>

    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr T Clarke</strong>:  Compared to the Chairman of the Committee, I am probably starting off in  reverse on regularising the dates in relation to the time between types of  developments. I welcome the fact that we now have five years on both, because  there was confusion in the countryside about the four- and 10-year rules. I  welcome the amendment in relation to five years and five years, because that  will remove the confusion.</p>
    <p class="B3SpeakerinChair">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr Molloy] in the Chair)</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I would never wish anybody to say that we are going soft on  planning, and that was not the reason for or intention behind that. It was  actually to make things clearer and easier to understand. If we look at how we  have treated fines in all the amendments, we see that the Committee was  consistent in its argument that it wanted to prevent the opinion that we are  going soft on developers, which, in the past, many of us thought was happening.  The risk of a fine of &pound;30,000 has never deterred a developer from knocking down  a property if they have an opportunity to build many developments. Therefore, I  welcome the fact that the fine will increase to &pound;100,000. I could go further  and say that, in today&rsquo;s market, &pound;100,000 is probably not enough. Nevertheless,  it is quite a lift from the &pound;30,000 that was originally in the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As for the other amendments, we have taken the opportunity  to raise fines from level 3 to level 5. Again, I do not think that we have gone  far enough, but we are going in the right direction. In every amendment, we are  trying to increase the deterrent for people who flout planning rules. In  general, in the amendments, we are trying to bring these all into line by  increasing fines from &pound;30,000 to &pound;50,000, replacing level 3 fines with level 5  fines and regularising the two periods to five years. I welcome all the  amendments.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kinahan</strong>:  I am pleased to speak on the group 2 amendments on enforcement and penalties. I  must declare an interest as the owner of a historic building and demesne and of  many trees that are subject to tree preservation orders.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I shall start with breaches of planning permission. I  welcome the fact that we are moving both domestic and commercial to five years,  although I am slightly puzzled about why we are making it easier for one group  to carry on when, the rest of the time, we are increasing punishments. Here we  are actually making it easier to hide a breach in planning permission, so I  wonder whether we should look at that before Further Consideration Stage.  Nevertheless, I am happy to support those amendments.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome raising the penalty for damaging a listed  building, misusing hazardous substances and ignoring tree preservation orders  etc from &pound;30,000 to &pound;100,000. The Committee discussed the fact that we must be  much stronger on breaches. However, I would like the Minister to look at  whether a percentage of the value of the development land should be used,  rather than a figure of &pound;100,000. If the Bill is in place for 30 or 40 years,  as the previous one was, that figure may not seem as much. Maybe we should look  again at the mechanism at Further Consideration Stage.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr T Clarke</strong>:  I thank the Member for giving way. Surely that point was covered in the group 1  amendments. We are reviewing the whole Bill after three years and every five  years thereafter. If, after that time, the fines are not working, surely the  matter can be addressed at that stage.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kinahan</strong>:  I thank the Member for his intervention, and I hope that he is right. That may  be exactly the way that we have to deal with it.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for the Environment</strong>: Like me, the Committee decided to  support the notion of raising fines. The Member has brought up something in  relation to a percentage. I know that the Member has tabled an amendment that  will be debated later. Would he not like to see something set? Maybe the  Minister will respond on raising the fine by a percentage. If the fine in the  Member&rsquo;s amendment was to remain at &pound;30,000, it would not get much support in  the House. I would certainly like to see those fines increased, whether by a  percentage or a set figure.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kinahan</strong>:  I thank the Chairman for his intervention. It is certainly worth considering  whether to change to a percentage increase now. My concern, which I will raise  at this moment, is that, if the Bill sits on a shelf for some 14 months &mdash; we  have been told that it may &mdash; anyone with a listed building or trees that are  subject to a tree preservation order might feel that they would be better not  to take the risk of that stopping their development, so, in the meantime, they  might pull down the building or cut down the trees. So, one of my amendments,  on which I will go into a bit more detail later, is to try to make sure that  that is put into place as soon as possible following Royal Assent.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will return to this group of amendments. In other cases,  we have raised the fines and the punishment for breaches, and, again, I wonder  whether we have been tough enough. However, as Trevor Clarke has just said, we  can deal with that in the future when we are reviewing matters.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to raise one more matter. If we go down the route of  a &pound;100,000 fine, it would seem a shame if all that money were to go to the  Treasury. We should look to see whether there is a way to give that a different  title &mdash; a community levy or some other form of levy &mdash; so that the money comes  to the Department of the Environment in the same way that the carrier bag levy  comes to us here in Northern Ireland and is not lost to the main Treasury. I  support the amendments.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. On behalf of our party, I support  the amendments as they appear today.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Many of us have heard the stories, both true and anecdotal,  about occasions when developers have gone ahead with unauthorised and illegal  development &mdash; in some instances, that may have applied even to listed buildings  &mdash; in the sure knowledge that, although enforcement will come after them, it  will be for a petty fine. The developer will pay the &pound;2,000 or &pound;3,000 because  he is making many thousands of pounds out of the project. So, it is important  that we firmly convey, through the extent and scale of the fines, that that is  unacceptable. It is important that, first, the Planning Service has powers and,  secondly, it is prepared to implement those powers, which will then transfer to  the councils. That in itself is important.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The harmonisation of the period after which enforcement may  not be taken has been addressed through amendment Nos 17, 18, 43, 44, 45 and 46  and the consequential amendment Nos 54 and 58. For a dwelling, that period is  currently four years and, for a business, it is currently 10 years. Harmonising  the periods at five years is a useful and progressive step, because there was a  lot of confusion there. Many of us, including, I am sure, yourself, Mr Deputy  Speaker, if you will forgive me for referring to it, have come across cases  where that anomaly in the Planning Service regulations has led to complete and  utter confusion when we have sought to gather information about one form of  development and one form of use, particularly of a business, which then  translates into another form of use and where you have to try to establish more  than 10 years of continuous use. So, I welcome that as pragmatism and realism  on the part of the Department. It is a welcome measure to address that anomaly  and to harmonise the rules that apply for a dwelling and for a business.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In conclusion, we support the amendments, and I thank the  Department for working with the Committee to bring them before us.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr W Clarke</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I will speak about amendment Nos  28, 40, 42, 49, 52 and 55. Those amendments relate to the various types of  enforcement and the increase in the fines to &pound;100,000.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">During Committee Stage, I was keen for the fines to  represent a modern-day deterrent, and, after a while, the Minister agreed that  the fines needed to be increased, as they were not fit for purpose. However, he  has given an explanation today that the Department of Justice was either not  consulted or does not believe that the increase is valid. Others have talked  about that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will speak generally about developers during the boom  period, when they had a total disregard for enforcement laws in general. As  others said, they built into their development plans when they were carrying  out a development. If they cleared a woodland or a listed building, the fine  would match or be considerably less than for a single site. The Committee and,  indeed, Sinn F&eacute;in are keen to prevent that in future. The maximum fine of  &pound;30,000 is not a sufficient deterrent; it was set 20 years ago and is no longer  fit for purpose. Developers laugh at it, so this is our opportunity to increase  the fine and the enforcement duty to &pound;100,000. I am keen to hear from the  Minister the thoughts of other Executive Committee members.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There are examples in my constituency of developers&rsquo;  complete contempt for planning enforcement. I am sure that other Members from  my constituency have been in contact with the Department. As I said, there is  no deterrent, so there is a duty on us as elected representatives to ensure  that deterrents are included in the Bill. That is particularly the case with  clause 102, which deals with listed buildings. Across the North, a spate of  listed buildings suddenly burned down. As soon as they became redundant and  their windows were boarded up, they spontaneously combusted and burned in  considerable numbers across the North of Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In conclusion, clear guidance is needed on how to make  enforcement fit for purpose. Sinn F&eacute;in supports amendment Nos 43, 48 and 54.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Savage</strong>:  Group 2 relates to enforcements and penalties, and I welcome amendment Nos 17  and 18, which relate to time limits. Amendment No 28 provides a strong  deterrent for offences related to listed buildings. We ought to protect our  architectural heritage, and amendment No 28 is wholly in agreement with that  aim. Amendment No 53 will raise the fine from &pound;5,000 to &pound;7,500, maybe more for  developments without permission. I welcome that. The other amendments in the  group, to which I have not spoken, are technical and, that being the case, I am  content to support all the amendments in the group.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: Members raised a number of issues. At a personal level, I  welcome and will support the uplift in the maximum fine from &pound;30,000 to  &pound;100,000. I put that suggestion to my ministerial colleagues; however, as there  was an objection from the Department of Justice, I did not get clearance from  OFMDFM, which has to clear the issue. Therefore, I asked my staff to indicate  to the Committee that, if it tabled such an amendment, I would not oppose it.  At a personal level, I support the amendment, but I did not have the authority  of the Executive to table such an amendment myself.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Kinahan spoke about what he termed a relaxation from 10  years to five years. The amendment is about having something that is consistent  and easier to interpret, so the Department decided that we could accept the  Committee&rsquo;s proposal.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I should say that a Crown Court can, in certain instances,  impose an unlimited fine on conviction for a planning breach, so, in some  cases, &pound;100,000 will not be the maximum fine. However, in the cases that we are  referring to, moving the level of fine from &pound;30,000 to &pound;100,000 gives the  judiciary much more latitude where more serious crimes are committed. A few  years ago, in the constituency of Newry and Armagh,  a row of five cottages was demolished over a weekend. In that instance, the  developer received a &pound;5,000 fine, which was wholly inappropriate given the  scale of the offence. Therefore, I hope that giving judges the latitude to go  up to &pound;100,000 will mean that the fine will be proportionate to the offence. We  want to see that be the case. Clause 84 deals with the demolition of listed  buildings.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">4.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is fairly strong consensus around the House on most  of the issues, which is useful. A few Members may have some minor issues or  concerns, but I welcome the fact that there has been general agreement on the  issues before us this afternoon and wish that we move to the votes on the  amendments.</p>

    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: Amendment Nos 19, 26 and 27 are technical amendments. They  do not change policy. Amendment No 19 clarifies that the Department&rsquo;s power to  decline to determine overlapping applications for planning permission is  restricted to applications for development that are of regional significance.  Amendment Nos 26 and 27 ensure that Part 5 of the Bill applies to land owned by  councils and to development carried out by councils, just as it applies to any  other land or development.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The intention of amendment Nos 20 and 102 is to introduce  third-party rights of appeal through regulations made by affirmative  resolution. The Executive&rsquo;s position on third-party appeals is clear and  long-standing. I reiterated it at Second Stage on 14 December 2010, and I will  repeat it now:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;further consideration of third party appeals should  be deferred until the extensive changes to the planning system under planning  reform and implementation of the RPA have settled down and are working  effectively&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The planning system to be introduced by the Bill has been  especially designed to make sure that the public can become involved at every  stage of the planning process.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">They can comment on the Department&rsquo;s draft planning  policies. They will have the opportunity to influence councils&rsquo; planned  strategies and local policy plans. Most important of all is pre-application  community consultation, which is being introduced through the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Developers who bring forward applications for a major or  regionally significant development must consult the community about their  proposals. In making their applications, they must demonstrate to the planning  authority how they have modified their proposals to take account of the  community&rsquo;s views. If the planning authority is not satisfied with a  developer&rsquo;s pre-application consultation, it must decline to determine the  application. Pre-application consultation will give people a real say in  development proposals that affect them.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is also worth explaining that an earlier regulatory  impact assessment could not quantify the potential benefits of third-party  appeals. It did, however, identify adverse impacts for the planning system,  developers and, indeed, the economy. The planning system would become slower  and more costly. Delays would need to be built in to give third parties time to  appeal. Developers, planning authorities and the Planning Appeals Commission  would all face the cost of the appeal. Investors would face greater uncertainty  as to the outcome of the planning process. Therefore, in the strongest possible  terms, I urge Members to reject amendment Nos 20 and 102.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I turn now to the system of planning appeals that is set out  in the Bill. Through amendment No 21, I propose to restrict the introduction of  new information during a planning appeal. Having failed to obtain planning  permission for development proposals, some applicants revise their proposal  during the course of the planning appeal. Some revisions are so great that the  amended proposals should really be submitted to the planning authority as an  amended application or even as an entirely new application. Clearly, that is  wrong. The application that is considered by the Planning Appeals Commission is  different from the one that is seen by the planning authority. The planning  authority and any third parties are denied the proper opportunity to consider  and respond to the revisions. Therefore, amendment No 21 will prevent parties  to an appeal raising any matter that was not before the planning authority when  it made the decision that is being appealed against unless the applicant can  satisfy the Planning Appeals Commission that the matter could not have been  raised prior to the appeal or that there were exceptional circumstances that  prevented the matter being raised as part of the original application.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment Nos 71 and 72 would allow one party to an appeal  to apply for a cost to be awarded against another party in the appeal if they  believed that they had been left out of pocket by the other party&rsquo;s  unreasonable behaviour. Unreasonable behaviour includes that which results in a  hearing being unnecessarily adjourned, prolonged or cancelled. A planning  authority would be behaving unreasonably if it were unable to produce evidence  to support each of its reasons for refusing planning permission or for imposing  a condition on the granting of planning permission. The Planning Appeals  Commission would determine whether costs are to be awarded. The amount would be  agreed between parties, with any disputes being referred to the taxing master  of the High Court. The policy that underpins that amendment was consulted on as  part of the planning reform consultation and agreed by the Executive. However,  it could not be included in the Bill as introduced for technical and legal  reasons. That is why I am proposing that amendment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Clause 219 provides that multiple fees should be charged  for retrospective planning applications. Amendment No 77 ensures that multiple  fees will also be charged where deemed planning applications are submitted to  the Planning Appeals Commission on foot of an enforcement appeal.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 34 seeks to extend the scope of conservation  areas to include areas where there is no building or development. Clause 103  provides for the designation of areas of special architectural or historic  interest, the character and appearance of which it is desirable to preserve or  enhance. Designation is, therefore, not restricted to areas with buildings or  development. That means that amendment No 34 is not required. I urge Members  not to support it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Clause 121(5) ensures that tree preservation orders do not  apply to trees that are dead or dying and have become dangerous.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 41 seeks to remove dead or dying trees from  that exemption. Most trees that are subject to TPOs are in urban or suburban  areas, where they may be close to roads or footpaths. As trees die, they  deteriorate and lose strength. The risk of them shedding branches or even  falling increases. That could be a danger to the public. Depending on the  disease, it may be necessary to remove a diseased tree to prevent the infection  of healthy specimens. For both those very practical reasons, I urge Members not  to support amendment No 41.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 99 will require councils to list tree  preservation orders in a planning register. That will continue existing  practice by ensuring that information about tree preservation orders is  available to the public. I am therefore pleased to support that amendment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Environment Committee tabled amendment No 62 to prevent  councils being out of pocket where compensation has been paid for any decisions  that they make without the required statutory consultee input and before the  consultee has failed to respond within the set period required under clause  224. Ministers have not had the opportunity to consider the implications of  that amendment. Therefore, I am not in a position to comment on it further.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 63 is a technical amendment that will ensure  that councils can fully apply the procedure governing the use of purchase  notices, as provided for in clause 194.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 104, which the Environment Committee tabled,  would require that Part 3 of the Bill be commenced by affirmative resolution  only.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As Members know, the Bill provides for the transfer of the  majority of planning powers from the Department of the Environment to councils.  As I have said consistently, the transfer of powers will happen in  circumstances and within a timescale to be agreed by the Executive. The  intention is that new governance arrangements and an ethical standards regime  for councils will be put in place before the transfer of powers. I am  consulting on those now, with a view to legislation being made in the next  mandate.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In bringing forward amendment No 104, the Committee is  seeking to copper fasten the commitment that the introduction of new governance  arrangements and an ethical standards regime precede the transfer of planning  powers. I am happy to support that amendment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 105 will provide that the introduction of Part  2 of the Bill should also be subject to affirmative resolution. That amendment  is unnecessary, so I encourage Members to reject it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 106 proposes that clause 84, as amended, and  clause 125, as amended, should come into effect when the Bill receives Royal  Assent. That relates to the &pound;100,000 fines for breaches of planning control for  listed buildings and tree preservation orders. A number of technical and legal  issues relate to that amendment, which may make the provisions somewhat  difficult to impose. However, I have sympathy with the Member on the issue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Those are the group 3 amendments. I urge Members to support  the amendments that I indicated.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson of  the Committee for the Environment</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann  Comhairle. During Committee Stage, the Department advised the Committee of  several amendments that it would be bringing forward that were required to  ensure that a consistent approach was achieved throughout the Bill. They were  provided before the Committee produced its report. Members sought clarification  on them. Most of those amendments are included in the next group for debate,  but amendment No 19 falls into this category and was supported by the  Committee.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 20 will introduce the right of third-party  appeal. The Committee has discussed that issue, but it was not referred to in  the Bill. Due to the time constraints in Committee Stage, the Committee did not  take time to thrash out the complexities that are involved. Members were aware  that most respondents who were called for evidence had views on third-party  appeals and invited participants to a stakeholder event to present their  comments. Those are recorded in the Committee&rsquo;s report.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">During Committee Stage, the Committee recommended that the  Department consider an amendment to restrict any new material that can be  presented at appeal. Members referred to the frequent occasions when material  is presented at the last moment and that parties have little time to consider  it before a decision is taken. Members welcomed the Department&rsquo;s suggestion  that acceptable material be limited to that which did not exist at the time  that the case went to appeal or that could not have been provided due to  exceptional circumstances. The Committee was very content with that approach,  and I welcome amendment No 21, which brings that forward by introducing a new  clause to the Bill.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">4.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee also welcomes amendment Nos 26 and 27, which  are designed to delete an unnecessary reference, and which were provided to the  Committee during Committee Stage. I cannot offer a Committee position on  amendment Nos 34 and 41, as this is the first time that members have seen them.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In relation to amendment No 62, the Committee was extremely  concerned when advised by the Department that, in the event of a late or  non-response from a statutory consultee, a council would be liable for its  decision. Apparently, that would apply even if a decision that had been made  after the agreed time limit had to be revoked as a result of information coming  forward from a statutory consultee that had not responded in time. In the  Committee&rsquo;s opinion that is unfair, and members asked the Department to  consider an amendment. The Department refused, so the Committee decided to  table amendment No 62.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It cannot be right that a council can be held liable for a  decision that it has made in good faith. The onus should be on the statutory  consultee to reply in a timely fashion to ensure that the decisions of councils  are informed by all the relevant information being available at the time of the  decision. There is no fairness in a council being financially penalised due to  the inability of a statutory consultee to respond in time. On behalf of the  Committee, I support the amendment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I cannot offer a Committee position on amendment No 63, as  the Committee agreed to the clause as drafted during Committee Stage. However,  I can indicate that it does not appear to contradict the Committee&rsquo;s position  or alter the policy principles of the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In relation to amendment Nos 71 and 72, several respondents  to the Committee&rsquo;s call for evidence felt that the Planning Appeals Commission  should have the power to award costs where it felt that an appeal had been made  frivolously or vexatiously. The Committee agreed with that and asked the  Department to consider amendments, which the Department agreed to introduce. I  welcome those amendments on behalf of the Committee.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I cannot offer a Committee position on the wording of  amendment No 77, as the Committee agreed the relevant clause as drafted during  Committee Stage. However, the Department mentioned the principle of councils  being allowed to charge higher fees for late applications to act as an incentive  for proper procedure to be followed. The Committee welcomed that approach, and  I therefore support the amendment that allows for that. I cannot offer a  Committee position on amendment Nos 99 and 102, as the issues they cover were  not discussed during Committee Stage.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will now move on to the Committee&rsquo;s amendment &mdash; amendment  No 104. The Committee was extremely concerned about the timing of the Bill,  because the governance arrangements for ensuring equality and fairness in  council decisions are not yet in place. The Department insisted that the  Planning Bill would not be implemented until the local government reform had  taken place, and the two processes would progress in tandem. The Committee  sought and received a letter of confirmation from the Minister that planning  functions would not be devolved to local authorities until the necessary  governance arrangements were in place. However, as we are on the cusp of  elections and a new Government will be taking over, the Committee was keen to  ensure through legislation that the Bill could not progress without local  government reform. The Committee was advised that, because local government  reform legislation did not yet exist, it was not possible to link the Bill to  legislation yet to come. The Committee therefore agreed to table the amendment,  which will prevent commencement of any powers in Part 3 that devolve planning  functions to councils without the prior approval of the Assembly. It is only  right that the House has the final say as to when the planning powers transfer  to councils.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The governance arrangements and the code of ethics must  first be in place before we can have any confidence in transferring those  significant and far-reaching powers. The arrangements must also be allowed to  bed in to allow us to have enough confidence that they are fully understood and  functioning well. Only then should we even think about transferring the powers.  On behalf of the Committee, I support the amendment and strongly urge the House  to do likewise.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I cannot offer a Committee position on amendment No 105, as  this is the first time that members have seen it. Although members have not had  an opportunity to see amendment No 106, I can inform the House that the  Committee, mindful of the risk that increasing penalties might place on listed  buildings and protected trees, recommended that the Department looked into ways  of ensuring that compliance is enforced. It would appear that the amendment  aims to do that, and I suggest that it is in keeping with the Committee&rsquo;s  recommendation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I would like to say a few words on behalf of Sinn F&eacute;in in  relation to third-party appeals, and I know that my colleague will continue the  debate after listening to some of the contributions that will be made. The  Minister was keen to talk about a front-loaded system.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In an ideal world, a front-loaded system should be able to  protect and to give people the opportunity and right to be consulted on the  planning process. However, that has not been the case, and an independent  mechanism is needed to challenge that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It will be up to councils and the statement of community  involvement to ensure that people consult on the planning process. However, as  I said to the Minister, it is a question of how meaningful any contribution to  the planning process is and the impact that people who contribute to the  process have.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I take it that the Minister said that he would see how  things bed in and maybe look at a third-party right of appeal. I said earlier  that that might be the case with the review process. However, the Assembly  should look at a limited third-party right of appeal. If we are talking about  people being included at the start of the planning process, nobody should come  in at the eleventh hour to stop the process.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The issue is to get the balance right and to create proper  planning policy. However, there must be something there to ensure a challenge.  I support a limited third-party right of appeal, but maybe the Minister will  clarify his thinking on such appeals.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: It  was maybe remiss of me during the debate on the previous set of amendments not  to declare an interest as a member of North Down Borough Council, so I happy to  put that on the record. There is a range of amendments, and I do not intend to  deal with all of them. Nonetheless, Members&rsquo; attention should be drawn to a  number of significant amendments.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will come back to the issue of third-party appeals.  However, as an MLA, I have represented residents at planning appeals, so I  consider amendment No 21 to be prescient. At appeals, goalposts are suddenly  moved, particularly by developers with expensive legal teams that start to  throw in a lot of additional information, which means that there is not a level  playing field. It is reasonable that the PAC takes completely new evidence into  account. However, in limiting the circumstances in which that new evidence can  be introduced, amendment No 21 is a sensible way forward.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr T Clarke</strong>:  I am sure that the Member has sat at planning appeals at which developers had  submitted plans for large schemes, but, at the eleventh hour, after such  schemes had been through the Planning Service and a local council, those  developers reduced the size of the schemes. The PAC then views the file of the  reduced scheme, which has cut out the Planning Service and the community, which  may not have had concerns at that stage. That is how developers flout and abuse  the system.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: On  occasion that has happened, which is regrettable. Hopefully, the provisions of  amendment No 21 will counteract that. People submitting planning applications  use tactics and psychological moves. They submit plans that go beyond what they  believe that they are likely to be granted, and they then appear reasonable by  compromising and reducing the size of the plan at the eleventh hour. It is  important that that position is covered.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 71 on the power to award costs and amendment  No 72 on orders as to costs are interlined and are a sensible way to regulate  the appeals process.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 77 deals with the power to charge additional  or multiple fees in post-enforcement situations, or when there has been a  retrospective application. I am sure that other Members, particularly those who  have served in local government, have been frustrated time and again by people  who seem to flout planning regulations. They simply go ahead and build  something, occasionally through ignorance, but more often because they are  prepared to flout the regulations in the hope that the Planning Service will  not go after them. When enforcement is used against them, they try to obfuscate  things through retrospective applications. Clearly, the circumstances must be  judged on their merits, but the proposal in amendment No 77, which will link  this issue to a financial penalty for someone who acts in such a way, is a  sensible way forward.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I also welcome amendment No 99, which proposes to include  tree preservation orders in planning registers. It is right that these should  be included, and, as the Minister indicated, it is currently part of best  practice and should be supported.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am concerned that amendment No 105 goes beyond what  should be in the Bill, and my preference would be for amendment No 104, which  is the Committee&rsquo;s amendment. When the Planning Bill was being drawn up, the  Executive&rsquo;s intention was to link it to the reorganisation and reform of local  government. Much of the detail was worked out as part of the RPA process, and,  although some people will complain that that process was not brought to a  conclusion, many good things emerged from it. One of those was the creation of a  broad cross-party consensus on the way that local government could be  reorganised through the provision of checks and balances. There are concerns  about the planning system that date from the 1960s and 1970s, but how much  those are overstated is questionable. However, people genuinely want to ensure  that checks and balances are built in when significant power is granted. The  proposal in amendment No 104 provides that reassurance, because it links with  the transfer of functions under Part 3 of the Bill that will not occur until  there is affirmative resolution in the Assembly. That can be linked with the  issue of the reform of local government and provides, in and of itself, a  useful check and balance.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have sympathy with the proposal in amendment No 106. As  the Minister indicated, there may be technical and legal issues to be ironed  out in connection with the amendment, but it does address a genuine concern. If  we put in place proper and additional protection for listed buildings and tree  preservations orders, we should not have the situation in which some people act  unscrupulously and see a window of opportunity &mdash; or a window of destruction &mdash;  and use it to act inappropriately.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The most controversial amendments are amendment No 20 and  its consequential amendment No 102, which deal with third-party appeals. As  indicated, the proposed system is frontloaded as far as community consultation  is concerned. For a range of reasons, I am hesitant, at best, about third-party  appeals and I express grave concerns about them. The Chairperson of the  Committee for the Environment was prescient in his early comments on those  amendments, although it probably did not take a clairvoyant to anticipate the  sort of remarks that would be made. If we have a frontloaded system, which we  then backload with appeals, we will overburden it. The system will be already  overburdened when it comes to time: indeed; a major criticism of planning in Northern Ireland  is that it takes far too long for decisions to be taken. That could impact on  the construction industry and development, and it could impact on communities  by not giving them a certainty of result. It could also impact on the  commercial side of things, because, when we are looking for investment in Northern Ireland,  one barrier is a planning system that sometimes takes too long. Introducing  third-party appeals will extend that problem and overburden the system even  more.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Appeals would have to be dealt with through the Planning  Appeals Commission. I well remember a debate in the House not that long ago in  which the performance of the PAC and the time that it took to deal with appeals  were criticised. If we add to those appeals and, perhaps, open the floodgates  to a large number of appeals &mdash; some may be vexatious but would have to be dealt  with anyway, and some may have some merit &mdash; we will massively overburden the  Planning Appeals Commission and create a situation in which it will not be able  to deal with matters in a timely fashion.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Regardless of the procedures that are put in place, there  is concern that, although a lot of third-party appeals would have genuine  merit, the system is open to abuse. There may be a situation in which a  neighbour or someone else puts in an appeal with the aim of possibly being  bought off by the developer. There is concern that third-party appeals will  lead to a degree of corruption.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The case for third-party appeals would be stronger if one  of two circumstances pertained. First, the argument would be much stronger had  there not been early community involvement and the front-loading of the system,  because in that circumstance it would be a form of check and balance. However,  the check and balance is already built in. Secondly, the argument in favour of  third-party appeals would have more merit if this was simply a situation in  which decisions were taken by faceless bureaucrats &mdash; I mean no disrespect to  the officials who are here.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We are talking about a situation in which planning issues  are devolved to local councils. Democratically elected local representatives will  be able to reflect their understanding of what is best for their area. They  will be able to respect and give views and, ultimately, to make a local,  democratic decision on any planning application. Such circumstances weaken the  argument for third-party appeals. I think that to go down the route of  third-party appeals at this stage, in a situation that is untested as regards  planning, would be potentially disastrous for Northern Ireland. It would  overburden the system. Instead of ensuring that planning was fairer and more  focused, it would lengthen the process and potentially make it less fair,  consequently &mdash;</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">4.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: I  am happy to give way to Mr McCarthy.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  I have listened attentively to what has been said. Does the Member not agree  that there is certain disadvantage to the objectors? Hundreds of people may  object to plans, for instance, to infill a quarry with inert material, and  those are really dedicated people who are against what is being proposed. The  developer has the opportunity to take it the full hog. Yet, when the proposal  is approved by the Planning Service, the objectors do not have anywhere to take  their case. That is unfair, and there is an inequality. Is there no sympathy in  what the Member is saying for those people? Many objectors are good, genuine  people.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: I  do not doubt the genuineness of the people. The whole point is that any member  of the community will have their opportunity at the front-loaded community  involvement stage. If we were cutting out the community altogether &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lo</strong>: Will  the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: I  will finish the point that has been raised, and then I will be happy to give  way to the Member.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A planning application should be judged on its merits, not  on whether there is one person against it or 100 people against it. The volume  of objection should not be taken into account.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I return to the point about weighing up the arguments that  are used. The people who will be making decisions on applications in the future  will be councillors. It will be people such as Alderman McCarthy and me. I am  sure that Kieran McCarthy&rsquo;s good sense and that of his colleagues means that he  would have absolute faith in those people. If we are placing the decision in  the hands of people in whom Kieran McCarthy would have complete trust, what  have we to worry about? Local, democratically elected councillors will be  taking the decision. If Mr McCarthy has no faith in his colleagues, that is  perhaps a sad day. I see him shaking his head in response to my comment. He  clearly does have faith. That will be able to weigh in what the community is  saying. I am now happy to give way to Ms Lo.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lo</strong>: I  listened carefully to Mr Weir, and I hope to set out my argument later in my  deliberations. Mr Weir kept mentioning the front-loading of consultation.  However, the third-party appeals are limited to major developments; the other  developments would not involve pre-consultation with the community.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: The  Member is not a member of the Environment Committee, so I appreciate that she  has not gone through the discussions. The idea is that councils would structure  the consultations in such a way that they would take on board the opinions of  the community on any application. In that sense, there would be an open door.  Consultation would not just take place on the broad development plans or the  major applications. Rather, there would be consultation on broad development in  totality, so development control would also form part of the process.  Additionally, as I said, those democratically elected by the entire community  would ultimately be the decision-makers.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As with all groups of amendments, some in group 3 will add  greatly to the Bill, and I have greater concern about some others. I am happy  to leave my comments on the group 3 amendments there and listen to the rest of  the debate.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kinahan</strong>:  I am pleased to speak on the group 3 amendments, which deal with planning  control. I will go through them in chronological order.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment Nos 19, 26 and 27 are technical, and I welcome  them. Amendment No 20, which we have just been discussing, seeks to introduce  third-party appeals. I have a lot of sympathy for that amendment, as do the  mass of the public. I am extremely disappointed that a petition of concern has  been submitted in respect of that amendment, because that is the wrong way to  deal with a matter of that type. A petition of concern should be used only for  something that is sectarian. In a way, those who submitted it are trying to  steamroller the amendment because they know that they will not win the  argument.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is a strong move out there towards third-party  appeals. I understand the argument on the front-loading of consultation. It  will be hard, however, to get across to the public that there should never be a  need for a third-party appeal if councils carry out a proper survey, produce a  good local development plan, include the community and go through all the right  stages. We ask for a belt-and-braces approach. From the debates on the earlier  groups of amendments, we know that the legislation will be constantly under  review, and we will have a review within three years.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We need checks and balances. That is not a reflection on  fellow councillors, but having been a councillor, I know that decisions are not  always taken in the right way because lots of pressures are put on people. I will  support amendment No 20, but I want the Minister to look at it, because the use  of a third-party appeal should be an exception. There must be a tight limit on  third-party appeals so that they do not slow up the planning process. Amendment  No 20 starts the discussion, and maybe we need to have it tightened for Further  Consideration Stage.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We thoroughly agree with amendment No 21. I am slightly  stymied by the English in amendment No 34 and would love clarification on it.  As I understand it, it means that we can have a conservation area that does not  have a building or any development on it. I would like clarification, because  the double negative rather throws me.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 41, tabled by the Alliance Party, removes the  words &ldquo;dead or dying trees&rdquo; from clause 121. That has always concerned me,  because every growing tree is nearing its death and is, therefore, dying. When  tree surgeons are asked about a tree, if it suits them, the tree will be dying  or ill, and they will fell it. Keeping that in mind throughout, we should  support the amendment, because it allows dead or dying trees to remain subject  to tree protection orders. However, we need to find some way of dealing with  them if they are dangerous. I hesitate to throw out suggestions at this late  stage, but the Bill has come at us quickly. Maybe we need a body similar to the  Historic Buildings Council, which deals with listed buildings. Such an  organisation could deal with trees, look at them and give a fair judgement on  whether a tree is really dying and whether it needs to be felled or pollarded.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Ulster Unionist Party supports amendment No 41.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 62 deals with compensation to councils. I  thoroughly agree with the Committee and support that amendment. Amendment Nos  71, 72 and 77 are extremely welcome.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 99 adds &ldquo;tree preservations orders&rdquo;. It is  absolutely vital to get councils to keep registers of tree preservation orders,  and it is also vital that councillors are kept informed, so that they know  which trees in their patch are on the register of tree preservation orders. As  part of the survey that councils will have to do, I encourage them to  concentrate on all the special trees in their area and to put tree preservation  orders in place wherever they are needed, instead of just in the one or two  locations where somebody has raised an issue, as happens at the moment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As regards amendment No 104, I totally support the  Committee&rsquo;s wish to bring forward Part 3 to affirmative resolution in the  Assembly, and I am pleased to hear that the Minister supports it, as it is  essential that we get RPA and the local government reform in place before that  happens.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am not going to move amendment No 105, but my concern,  and that of many councillors, is that so much is being thrown at councils that  a massive cost will be incurred. The Minister has promised pilot studies and  many other matters. However, I am concerned that things will be thrown at  councils, and I wanted to include that, as in amendment No 104. I am not going  to move it this time but will, perhaps, look at it in a different form at the  next stage.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am pleased that the Committee Chairperson supports  amendment No 106, as, I think, do all Members. As I said before, I am concerned  that, in the lull before the Bill is passed, anyone could fell trees or knock  down historic buildings. I am sure that all Members have stories. I can think  of a line of Victorian houses in Ballycastle that were damaged by a fire one  weekend, and, by the end of the weekend, the whole terrace had been pulled  down. I want to see that practice stopped. By agreeing amendment No 106, I hope  that that will take place from the moment of Royal Assent, subject to the legal  side being sorted out. I am also asking the Minister to look at a way &mdash; whether  it is retrospective or whether something else can be brought in &mdash; to bring it  forward to today, so that, from today, anyone who pulls down a historic  building or cuts down a tree that has been preserved will be punished by the  fines that we have put in place. I urge the Minister to see whether he can find  a way of putting that in. Therefore, even if it is six or eight weeks until  Royal Assent, the more scurrilous people will not be able to pull down our  trees.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. In supporting the range of  amendments, I will select those that I want to speak on. I have given a lot of  thought to amendment No 20, which deals with third-party appeals. I can weigh  up and hear both arguments. There is the argument from one side that says that,  in order to develop a robust and efficient planning service and local councils  that are robust and efficient and deliver on time to the customer or the  ratepayer, there must be efficiency. However, there is no reason why that  should not be the case. Today, I talked to someone who has quite a substantial  project in England,  and he anticipates that it will take six weeks from application to  determination stage. That is a benchmark that the Department and Planning  Service should look at to see how quickly they can move to efficiently process  planning applications. With regard to efficiencies that are developed, it is  how we do things, as much as what is done that is important.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">5.00 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have thought a great deal about third-party appeals. I  represent a rural constituency where one is often on the side of the developer,  who could be building a single house or a small business. I am not as fully au  fait with many of the issues that occur, principally in urban areas, around  objections. Through the endeavours of my colleague at the Environment  Committee, I have listened to the objectors especially around Knock and heard a  range of objections raised there. Those people, too, are entitled to have their  views heard and their cases presented.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am absolutely honest when I say this: I see the genuinely  heartfelt integrity of people who have concerns about how the planning process  operates. I was not, by any stretch of the imagination, airbrushing history, as  the Minister said, or presenting my own view of it. We have to learn from the  excesses of the past and the things that went wrong and get it right this time.  If third-party appeals can contribute to that, I fully welcome their role and  function.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My one reservation is that, like many in the Chamber, I  have been to tribunals and seen situations where people have sought to use a  variety of levers, including public representatives, to extract the best they  can from a developer &mdash; who could be a person with a single-house development &mdash;  for a sight line or whatever it might be. I can foresee situations where  third-party appeal can be used as a lever or a tool for negotiation. We cannot  prevent that. However, what legislators and people of great legal wisdom can do  is develop criteria for third-party appeals. In that way, they could do what  they can to get people justice and underwrite the integrity of the planning  process by way of the third-party process while, simultaneously, making sure  that abuses cannot take place using that avenue. It is a challenge, I know, but  it has happened elsewhere. It is done elsewhere, and third-party appeals are  very much the norm in a robust, transparent and fair planning system. I stand  in favour of third-party appeals, and my party colleagues will speak in favour  of them.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I regret that a petition of concern has been raised against  that. Mr Kinahan referred to it earlier. It is very unfortunate that a lever or  mechanism that was built into the political process of this Assembly for other  purposes is to be used to nobble something that could serve a wider system of  justice for people who make third-party appeals. However, Members have chosen  to do that and they have a right and an entitlement to take that route.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I spoke on amendment No 21 in Committee. It introduces a  new clause that restricts the information that can be presented at an appeal; or,  rather than restrict, it clarifies what information can be presented. That,  too, is very important. Those Members who have attended planning appeals have  seen situations where someone may be suffering from a condition yet to be  diagnosed or awaiting further information or evidence of a medical nature that  might be crucially important. Such information could prove to be the linchpin  in presenting a case and in winning an appeal for a person who may require a  house or dwelling for special needs, as mitigating medical circumstances would  be taken into account. Amendment No 21 represents a fair recognition of  people&rsquo;s rights and entitlements and the difficult circumstances that some  people find themselves in, whereby they require an application for planning to  be approved.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Likewise, amendment No 62 is important, although for a  different reason. Councils are not liable to pay compensation in cases where  other agencies may not have been up to the mark in delivering evidence or  information material on a planning application that could have swung the  decision one way or another.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That may have consequences for a refusal or, indeed, an  approval, because the information, had it been up to speed, received in time,  adapted or improved, could have swung that decision one way or the other. If  that is external to the council, that council should not be held liable for it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 102 is obviously consequential to amendment No  20, but is important in its own right. Nevertheless, there is no need for me to  recite again why that is the case. Amendment No 104, on which I appreciate  Members&rsquo; input, is extremely important. As I said at the start of the debate,  the sequence of events involving the reform of local government, the review of  public administration and everything that goes with that should have taken  place before the Planning Bill came about or should have at least run in  parallel with that. Instead, we have a situation where the reform of local  government has still to be completed, where the safeguards, checks and balances  have yet to be delivered, and where those have yet to manifest themselves, in  whatever form, on paper for us to consider them. However, we are still tearing  away with a Planning Bill that everybody knows is being presented simply  because the Executive want to establish themselves and to show that they are  beginning to deliver, albeit after three and a half years when they were not  exactly delivering. The amendment is vital because it ties in the reform of  local government with &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  Certainly.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: Does the Member accept that the Executive have delivered  twice as much legislation as the one that was in power between 1998 and 2003,  when his party was one of the largest at the polls?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  I accept that, as well as the fact that his party was instrumental in trying to  pull down that Executive. We are talking about building the future, and that is  what the planning is all about. Nonetheless, I thank the Minister for his  comment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 104 is vital because it ties in one with the  other, and one cannot progress without the other. The SDLP believes that that  is important. I realise why Mr Kinahan tabled amendment 106, and the SDLP is  open to the suggestion that he makes. We thank him for that.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lo</strong>: I  will speak on five amendments in group 3 and will start with amendment Nos 20  and 102, on third-party appeal. Like others who spoke before me, I am  completely disgusted by the DUP&rsquo;s use of the petition of concern. The  amendments will benefit all sections of our community. This is not a  contentious issue between the two major communities, so for the DUP to try to  veto the amendment is a total abuse of power.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As an MLA for South Belfast  for the past four years, I have supported many residents and residents&rsquo;  associations in their dealings with the Planning Service. The majority of those  residents have told me that they have endured serious detrimental effects in  their residential and conservation areas for many years because of  inappropriate development and the cumulative effect of piecemeal development  projects. Furthermore, some streets are now blighted by abandoned properties  with overgrown gardens bought before the collapse of the housing market. There  is a great sense of anger and frustration that the planning system is always in  favour of the developer, and although the developer can appeal against a  decision, residents have no such right of appeal.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The issue of third-party appeal attracted a large number of  responses to the planning reform consultation, with strong views for and  against its introduction.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Of those who supported the introduction of  third-party appeals (TPA), many indicated that it should be a limited or  restricted right to avoid vexatious challenges. Some respondents see  third-party appeals as a fundamental part of a reformed planning system that is  fair and accessible to all, based on principles of equality and genuine  engagement. However, those against the introduction of such rights stated that,  with the proposed front-loading system of pre-application community  consultation, there is no need for third-party appeals, as Mr Weir advocated  earlier. Some were concerned that that could cause further delays in the  already slow and inefficient system. However, our amendment reflects the fact  that many stakeholders called for the introduction of TPA.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We recognise that the Department has decided that further  consideration of third-party appeals should be deferred until the extensive  changes to the planning system and the implementation of the review of public  administration (RPA) have bedded down and are working effectively. However,  nobody knows whether that will or will not happen. Even if it is going to  happen, it could be a long time in the future before it does. People would like  some reassurance now that third-party appeals are going to be included in the  Bill to give a degree of certainty.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is important to stress that the amendment does not  provide for the immediate introduction of TPA in Northern Ireland. Rather, it is an  enabling clause that would allow TPA to be brought forward by the Department in  an appropriate manner within an appropriate timescale with, as Mr Patsy McGlone  said, criteria attached to that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We fully understand the need for caution in introducing  third-party appeals to balance the right of individuals and other third parties  against the need for progress and development, especially at this time of  economic uncertainty. The fact that this is enabling legislation means that the  Department and the Assembly could ensure that the system of TPA introduced in Northern Ireland  is developed to make sure that the bar for appeal is set at an appropriate  level and conditions are in place to prevent the planning process becoming  hostage to frivolous or vexatious appeals. Final regulations would have to be  brought before the Assembly for affirmative resolution.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We believe that there are many good reasons to provide a  limited third-party right of appeal. It would provide an incentive for  developers to undertake genuine participation and meaningful pre-application  consultation. The public and communities would then feel that their comments  were being given proper consideration in pre-application consultations.  Planning authorities would be more inclined to get their decisions right in the  first place.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Evidence from the Republic of Ireland  shows that 99&middot;3% of third-party appeals in 2008 were wholly or partially  successful. That refutes claims that third-party appeals are frivolous and  supports the view that, over time, they improve decision-making by planners.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Developers have a right of appeal through which they  influence how policy is interpreted by establishing precedence. The public do  not have that opportunity. That creates a sense of unfairness, which can be  removed only either by abolishing appeals or by allowing third parties a  limited right of appeal. That would make planning authorities as accountable  for their approvals as they currently are for their refusals.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">5.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">People seeking to exercise the right to a third-party  appeal should demonstrate the soundness of their case so that it is not a  free-for-all. The soundness test should include showing that the appeal is in  line with planning policies, including the development plan, and that it is not  being made for financial or commercial gain.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A number of proposed measures might mitigate the potential  abuse of appeals. Those include the introduction of a levy fee, although a  balance is required so as not to restrict totally, or restrict unfairly,  access; the introduction of qualifying criteria, such as that the third party  must have made an observation to the original planning application; the  possible exclusion of major infrastructure; the setting of restricted  timescales for appeal decisions so as not to delay the process; and an ongoing  audit of the system. We will perhaps need a number of years to ascertain the  success of the system.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Planning Appeals Commission shall have absolute  discretion to dismiss an appeal when it is of the opinion that the appeal is  vexatious, frivolous or without substance, made with the sole intention of delaying  the development or is not based on sound planning grounds.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We need to balance the need for economic growth and the  rights of individuals who are affected by the planned development. Those people  have to live beside the new developments, which might blight their quality of  life, shadow their gardens and look into their bedrooms or bathrooms. We want a  planning system that is accountable, transparent and equitable. Therefore, it  is important that we include a third-party right of appeal.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Alliance Party also has three amendments that concern  trees. Amendment No 34 calls for areas to be made conservation areas in respect  of planning, even if there are no buildings in that area. An area with an  important historic landscape could be made a conservation area for planning  purposes. Areas thick with tree cover could also be considered as conservation  areas. I will be interested to hear the Minister&rsquo;s comments on that. If he can  convince us that amendment No 34 is not necessary, we may not move it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 41 changes the current wording of the Bill  that states that dead or dying trees, or those that may be dangerous, can be  felled even if a tree preservation order is in place. The removal of the phrase  &ldquo;dying or dead&rdquo; will mean that only dangerous trees can be felled if a tree  preservation order is in place. The key consideration must be whether a tree is  dangerous or not. Whether it is dead or dying is immaterial. Indeed, we believe  that even dead or dying trees can play a useful role in the ecosystem by  providing a habitat. Furthermore, there is a lack of clarity about what exactly  is understood by the word &ldquo;dying&rdquo;. It can be a broad category. The Woodland  Trust categorises trees as dying when their annual growth rings start to  decrease in size. However, an oak tree could be considered to be in that dying  phase for up to 400 years. Removal of the reference to &ldquo;dying or dead&rdquo; would  also bring Northern Ireland  into line with practice in the rest of the UK.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 99 simply adds tree preservation orders in  each council area to the list of things of which councils must keep a database.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr W Clarke</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Sinn F&eacute;in supports amendment No  20, which would mean that regulations can be made to allow third parties to  appeal planning decisions. That is the only way to make the planning system  fair for all citizens and remove the bias in favour of developers. I spoke  about that earlier. There needs to be a system that is tightly time framed,  with a quick turnaround. Other Members spoke earlier about creating a logjam in  the system.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is unfair to use the petition of concern mechanism, as  it was not designed to be used in instances such as this. I think it does the  House an injustice to use it in such a manner, because planning impacts on all  communities. We should be mature enough to have the debate. I will not waste a  lot of time on these matters, because there is a snowball&rsquo;s chance in hell of  getting the amendment through.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: The  Member may well be underestimating his powers of persuasion and argument. No  vote has taken place, and I am sure that if the Member presents an utterly  convincing argument the Members on these Benches could be persuaded.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr W Clarke</strong>:  I would not like to look at my odds for that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The system that we are designing is front-loading. We are  looking at community involvement and community planning. The system should work  a lot better than it does at present. Communities have to take a leap of faith;  the Members to my left outlined the difficulties that individuals have in  dealing with developers. I ask the Minister to have a review after three years,  as we talked about earlier. Maybe he could commit to including, in a review, a  consultation on third-party appeals as an appropriate option. If everything  works in the way that we are led to believe it will work, and if the  front-loading system will resolve the problem, then carrying out a consultation  should quite clearly show that the system in working fine. It will be  interesting to hear what the Minister has to say on that matter.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Sinn F&eacute;in supports amendment Nos 71 and 72, which allow the  Planning Appeals Commission to award costs where it is felt that an appeal has  been made in a frivolous manner. I welcome that. I support amendment No 77,  which deals with retrospective applications following enforcement proceedings  being subject to councils being allowed to impose extra charges. As the  Minister said, that will act as an incentive to follow proper planning  processes.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I understand that amendment No 34, which was tabled by the  Alliance Party, is a probing amendment. It certainly probed my thoughts,  because I was not really sure what it was about. Is it intended to designate a  buffer zone in and around a conservation area or a historic site or what used  to be historic woodland? I was not clear about it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I support amendment No 41, which removes dead or dying  trees from the exemption under tree preservation orders in clause 121. I just  needed clarity on the health and safety aspects, particularly in relation to  decaying trees in public parks or those that may fall on people in their homes  or in their cars.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr T Clarke</strong>:  If I picked the Member up right, he said that he is accepting the argument  about dead or dying trees. If he does so, how can he have concerns about people  being in danger from trees in public parks? If the trees are dead, they are a  danger. Surely, dying and dead trees should be included.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr W Clarke</strong>:  I do not accept that. A dead or dying oak tree could take 100 years to fall. It  would still be robust. It is a bit like human beings; as soon as we are born,  we are dying. As soon as the tree starts to grow, it is on its way to dying.  There are trees in Donard Park in Newcastle  that are a couple of hundred years old and have been dying for about 100 years.  I do not buy into what the Member said.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 99 is sensible. It requires councils to  include information relating to tree preservation orders in their planning  register. That is best practice and common sense.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Sinn F&eacute;in strongly supports amendment No 104, which will  offer reassurances to communities and minorities. Planning powers were taken  from councils because of abuse of powers, and discrimination was rife. I will  not get into historical debates or lectures, but it is very important to have  checks and balances in place before powers can be handed over to local  authorities. This is a very sensible amendment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I also support amendment No 106 and agree with the Member  who proposed it. Historical buildings and woodlands could be cleared away  overnight, and I think the amendment is a sensible precaution.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Savage</strong>: A  lot has been said today about planning regulations, but the amendments in group  3 refer to planning control. Amendment No 20 amends clause 58 and requires the  Department to provide regulations allowing persons other than the applicant to  appeal a decision. It is also useful to note at this point that the Environment  Committee did not discuss third-party rights of appeal during Committee Stage.  However, in light of the issues raised in this proposed amendment and amendment  No 102, I and my party are happy to support them.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, I note with amazement &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr T Clarke</strong>:  If, by some miracle, the amendments on third-party appeals are accepted, what  will the Member&rsquo;s opinion be if one of his constituents applies for planning  permission for a bungalow close to him and goes through the proper process, but  another neighbour decides that he should not be building there because they  just do not want him there and decides to take a third-party appeal against  that permission?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Savage</strong>:  Thank you.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 21 introduces a new clause restricting the  information that can be presented in an appeal. In most cases, it is right and  proper that new information is brought forward only if it is necessary,  expedient and applicable.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 41 amends clause 121 to remove dead or dying  trees from the exemptions under tree preservation orders. I welcome that  amendment. It has been supported by the Woodland Trust and will help bring Northern Ireland into line with best practice in  the UK.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 62 introduces a new clause to ensure that  councils are not liable to compensation if they made a decision on a planning  application that will later have to be revoked as a result of information being  made available by a statutory consultee that had failed to provide it within  the original deadline. The amendment is most welcome because it protects  councils from a problem not of their own making and transfers liabilities, and,  therefore, associated costs to the statutory consultee that failed in its  duties in the first instance.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 77 amends clause 219 to allow for fees charged  for retrospective applications to be higher than those for an ordinary  application. I welcome that amendment, as it gives applicants an incentive to  get things right first time and to conduct their planning applications in a  wholly appropriate manner.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 99 amends clause 237 to require councils to  include information relating to tree preservation orders in their planning  register. I welcome the amendment, as I think that it is good practice. I also  welcome the amendment proposed by my party colleague and fellow Committee  member Danny Kinahan that ensures that any commencement orders for parts 2 and  3 of the Bill cannot be laid without being affirmed by the Assembly. That was  agreed by the Environment Committee as a means of ensuring planning control  functions could not pass to councils until the Assembly was content that the  necessary checks and balances were in place at council level. It is designed to  provide a mechanism &mdash;</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">5.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: I  thank the Member for giving way. Mr Kinahan stated that he will not move that  amendment. The Part 3 element is in amendment No 104, which was agreed by the  Environment Committee and which, I think, will be supported. However, there was  no particular agreement on Part 2, which is also in Mr Kinahan&rsquo;s amendment.  That is where the difference lies.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Savage</strong>: I  thank Mr Weir for that intervention. The amendment is designed to provide a  mechanism to allow the Assembly to be satisfied that central government has  provided the necessary resources and capacity before councils are required to  prepare local development plans.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 106 will amend clause 247 to ensure that  clauses 84 and 125 come into operation as soon as the Bill becomes law. The  amendment is designed to reduce the time between higher fines being agreed in  the Bill and their coming into force. That will minimise the opportunity and/or  incentive for wilful damage to trees and listed buildings.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am content to support all the amendments in the third  group. I know that there has been a lot of talk today and concerns about what  has been going on, but we have to move the system forward and bring ourselves  into the twenty-first century.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I call Mr John Dallat.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: Hear, hear.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dallat</strong>: I  welcome the cheer from the far side of the Chamber. No doubt there are high  expectations of what I might say. I thank the planning officials, who were  extremely constructive in the help that they gave to the Committee. I  acknowledge that freely.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The vast majority of people whom I have met in my lifetime  are honest and submit their planning applications properly. When they do not  get it right, they accept the planners&rsquo; advice. There are, however, a few  people who are morally corrupt, if I may use that term. That is what the  safeguards are about. The third-party appeal issue, which has attracted the  petition of concern, would apply to only a very small number of cases where  whole communities have been affected by perhaps one major planning application.  My colleague Patsy McGlone mentioned Knock Golf Club. Perhaps we should not  focus on one particular case, but I am extremely proud that I saved the trees  in that club. I hope that, every time the Minister drives past it, he will  appreciate that there is sometimes a need for us to go outside our  constituencies. That was something else that he was critical of.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I see no reason why third-party appeals are not possible.  If as much thought was put in to the Planning Bill as was put in to how to  conduct third-party appeals, there would not be a problem. I hope that, given  that we are told that this is a living document, this opportunity is not closed  down. I also hope that, at some time in the near future, some Minister &mdash;  whoever it is &mdash; will take seriously the enormous number of people who gave  evidence to the Committee and submitted their opinions about the right to a  third-party appeal.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I come from a rural area where that is not a big issue.  However, I belonged to a bigger council for more than 30 years, so I saw what  happened in the coastal area where there was no opportunity for appeals. The  whole heritage of the place was pulled down, and the healthiest of trees became  diseased overnight. That could be called &ldquo;the chainsaw society&rdquo;. The people  involved in such activity need to be held accountable for what they do, and a  third-party appeal is one democratic way to do that. I am surprised that a  party that has &ldquo;Democratic&rdquo; in its title is so opposed to third-party appeals.  That is unfortunate.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Generally speaking, we should be able to face a future in  which planning legislation does not need a petition of concern presented,  because we will perhaps begin to trust each other. However, that must be  demonstrated. I am talking now about amendment No 21, which illustrates that we  have yet to agree what mechanism local councils will have to protect people  against the kind of abuses that happened in the distant past. I know that my  colleague was criticised for daring to even mention times past. However, we  lived through that era and would like to pass on to a new generation our advice  on how things can be done differently rather than be repeated. Let us hope that  common sense will prevail and that the general public will have some kind of  ownership of planning.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, amendment No 21 restricts the information that can  be put into a planning appeal. I suggest that a serious look should be taken at  information put into the planning application in the first place. My recent  experience, particularly with the Knock golf course case, was that letters of  support came from people in public life making the most outrageous claims about  planning applications. Such claims included that local councils had supported  the application, jobs would be created and community associations would  benefit. As the Chairman knows, we discussed that at the Committee meeting, and  we got an assurance from the planners that those concerns can be accommodated  as the Planning Bill makes its way to becoming the final product. I hope that that  will create a better society and one in which people can have confidence,  particularly the communities that have been so adversely affected by really bad  planning approvals in the past, some at ministerial level and others at a bit  more of a local level.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B Wilson</strong>:  I will deal first with third-party appeals. In my election campaign, I said  that, if I was elected to the Assembly, I would promote third-party appeals.  Therefore, I welcome this amendment. However, I now see that, because of the  petition of concern, my vote on the issue becomes irrelevant. Not only is my  vote irrelevant, but the people who voted for me who wanted to introduce  third-party appeals are totally disenfranchised on this issue, which is a total  abuse of the Assembly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That said, the Green Party supports limited third-party  appeals. There is a widespread public perception that there is a bias in the  Planning Service in favour of developers. Many residents feel frustrated and  have lost confidence in the planning system. Time after time, local community  groups get together to oppose developments and their views are ignored.  Recently, a development in Bangor  involved knocking down a Victorian house and replacing it with an apartment  block. That was opposed by all the residents, residents&rsquo; groups and, in fact,  unanimously by the council.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: I  thank the Member for giving way. Does he acknowledge that there would be no  need for a third-party appeal in those circumstances? The Bill envisages that  planning decisions will be passed to councils. As the Member rightly said, the  council unanimously opposed that development, so it would have been rejected by  the council. Therefore, there would not have been a supported planning decision  against which to appeal.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B Wilson</strong>:  I thank the Member for his intervention. I was going to make the point that  that would not apply when planning powers are given to councils.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Nevertheless, it still does not resolve the problem of  local residents being totally opposed to it. Members suggested that the problem  could be resolved by front-loading the system and by pre-consultations. That is  only partly true, because most applications will not be submitted for  pre-consultation; only major planning applications will be. We have faith in  pre-consultations leading to the Planning Service taking the correct decision.  However, if the service cannot get turning down an application wrong, it should  not be able to get an approval wrong. We should have a level playing field; if  applicants can appeal, objectors should also be able to.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As Ms Lo pointed out, there must be safeguards to prevent  abuse and vexatious or frivolous applications. However, given the expertise in  the Planning Service, I am sure that it could devise an appeals system that is  acceptable to the community as a whole, while ensuring that beneficial  developments go ahead without significant delay. The appeals system in the Irish Republic  seems to work, so I see no reason why a similar system should not work here.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I shall move on to welcome &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B Wilson</strong>:  Sure.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: Is the Member suggesting that the Republic of Ireland  is an exemplar of good planning?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B Wilson</strong>:  I did not suggest that at all, but people there seems to be happier with their  planning system, although I will not go into that, because if you scrutinise  other aspects of the planning system there, you will find problems. However, as  far as the Planning Appeals Commission and third-party appeals are concerned,  the part of the system that deals with such matters there seems to work OK.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome amendment No 21. Having, like other Members,  represented residents at Planning Appeals Commission meetings, I have found  that developers tend to come in at the last minute with totally new proposals,  and objectors have no opportunity, or perhaps they do not have the expertise,  to consider them. That is totally unacceptable.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome amendment No 62, which would mean that councils  would be liable for delays caused by others failing to produce information on  time. That is totally unfair on councils.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">On the removal of dead or dying trees that are subject to a  TPO, the most common problem is that perfectly healthy trees suddenly develop a  disease because somebody wants to build a house. When somebody puts in a  planning application, trees immediately become diseased. It happens all the  time. I am concerned that the power to cut down dying trees will be used to get  round the planning laws. TPOs are often put on trees or places designated as  conservation areas; however, having been protected, trees suddenly develop some  strange illness. As other Members pointed out, trees often have illnesses from  the day they start to grow. In that sense, it takes them hundreds of years to  die. Therefore, trees that are dying anyway generally pose no significant  danger to the population.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In some cases they are, but the vast majority of trees  affected by those planning applications would have lived. They may have been  dying, but they could still have lived for another 100 years. It is amazing how  many tree surgeons can confirm that every tree that a developer asks them to  look at is in the process of dying. It is part of the planning process. TPOs  give very little protection to trees, and we give should them further  protection and exclude situations in which dying trees can be cut down because,  again, it depends on the definition of &ldquo;dying&rdquo;. They provide habitat for  wildlife and perhaps have a particular presence in a conservation area. It is a  shame that, just because somebody wants to develop, they cut the trees down.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">5.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I also support amendment No 99, whereby the council has to  register TPOs. At present, the public have a problem in that, if they see a  tree that may be under threat from development or feel that it is a prominent  tree that they want to preserve, they do not know whether there is a TPO on it  and do not really know how to find out. If the council kept a register, the  public would be able to check that. That would also enable the public to ensure  that people do not cut down trees that have TPOs. At the moment, if someone  cuts down a tree, a member of the public might say that that tree should have a  TPO. However, they do not know whether it does and, therefore, cannot take  action. Therefore, the register that will be retained by the council will be  very useful in helping residents to make that decision and to, perhaps, apply  for a TPO. I support the other amendments.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  I want to take the opportunity to pay tribute to my colleagues on the  Environment Committee, which I do not sit on. I know that the Chairperson, the  Deputy Chairperson and all MLAs on that Committee have had an extraordinarily  busy period, and, under huge pressure, they have done the Assembly a great  service over that time. That needs to be said.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I rise to speak because I am an MLA for South   Belfast. Amendment No 20 is one that I and, I believe, Alex  Maskey, Dr McDonnell and Mr McGimpsey would have really loved to have added our  names to. Because of time constraints, that did not happen, and Ms Lo opted for  the comfort of her colleagues in the Alliance Party. However, we support the  amendment nonetheless, and it reflects entirely the wishes and desires of the  representatives of residents in our part of this city. I believe that the  amendment is on the Marshalled List because people want it to be there. Those  people have, for many years, been at the wrong end of bad decisions that have  blighted our communities, left lasting scars and, in some instances, caused  considerable unrest. We still have to live with the consequences of those  decisions today.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Holylands is a case in point. The Minister may or may  not be familiar with that area. If he is not, I invite him to join us there on  St Patrick&rsquo;s Day. If he chooses to take us up on that invitation, he will see  what bad planning decisions really mean. He will see what happens when  communities become entirely disenfranchised and when the voice of the few  begins to count more than that of the many.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I really struggle to understand what the problem could  possibly be with an amendment that provides an enabling power. It does not  actually technically make new law. It just enables new law to be possibly made  in the future by the Minister. Where is the threat in that? It is certainly not  threatening to the Minister or to his integrity. It is not threatening to his  stated policy position. It is not threatening to anyone&rsquo;s manifesto  commitments, because it is only an enabling power. It is certainly not  threatening to communities. It is not threatening to democracy or due process,  because, of course, the regulations that would be required to enable the power  would need to be properly consulted on and would receive scrutiny in Committee.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is maybe threatening to a few, a tiny minority of people  with a narrow vested interest in making a lot of money on the backs of  residents and communities and people who have sought to build lives in cities.  Ironically, cities are places that, as it says in the regional development  strategy and on the Minister&rsquo;s website, we want to reinvigorate and restore to  their former glory. They are places where we want to promote communities and  encourage families to live, so where is the threat in an amendment that  provides an enabling power? I would appreciate an intervention if the Minister  or his DUP colleagues could clarify that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It gets even more worrying that there is a petition of  concern on an amendment that does nothing more than introduce an enabling  power. What is possibly of threat to the unionist community in an amendment  that is one line long and which gives the Minister the power to make the law?  How does that, in any way, fulfil the purpose for which the petition of concern  was created?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is clear that, in this House, the DUP is a minority in  opposing the amendment. Colleagues in the Ulster Unionist Party support it. The  Alliance Party, obviously, supports it. The SDLP, Sinn F&eacute;in and the Green Party  support it, yet a tiny minority of people, who represent less than one in three  of the population, are abusing a technical power that was designed for an  entirely different purpose. It is awfully ironic that they are choosing to do  so on legislation that is aimed at returning powers to councils. Those powers  were taken away from councils because, at a time in our not-so-distant history,  a small number of people chose to abuse the powers that were in their hands.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>: The  Member is making much of the petition of concern. Is he now developing the  argument that we should get rid of the ugly scaffolding of the Belfast  Agreement and reform the structures to change all of that?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  I thank Mr Ross for his concern. It was a good attempt, Mr Ross. The answer is  no, and here is why. The safeguards &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  I will return to the amendment, Mr Deputy Speaker.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I remind Members to address the amendments that are before us.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  The amendment before us could not possibly, in anyone&rsquo;s mind, be argued to be  controversial from a community perspective. That is the issue. There is no way  that anyone could possibly argue that the amendment would have a detrimental  impact on one community or the other. It just would not work out that way.  There is a reason for those mechanisms. They are for occasions when decisions  could be taken by the House that could be perceived to have an impact on one  community or another; and those occasions do arise. The amendment deserves to  be decided on democratically. The amendment deserves to be agreed or disagreed  to by vote of a majority or a minority in the House. It is not an amendment  that qualifies in your wildest of dreams for a petition of concern, except if  you just happen to have the numbers to move it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I go back to the point of why we need the amendment. We  need this amendment because it is common sense to allow society a last backstop  against bad decisions. It is interesting to note that where third-party rights  of appeal exist, there are no huge delays in the planning system. It is worth  noting that, across these islands, they do not lead, as Members mentioned, to  massive backlogs, the clogging up of systems and spurious applications. When  they are put in place, they are rightly designed in a way that makes sure that  there are no opportunities for highly dodgy, spurious or dubious appeals. It is  ironic that we are trying to give the Minister and his officials the power to  make the best possible regulation. We are not trying to specify or determine.  We are just saying that he should do the best that he can in the time that is  available to him.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">If Mr Weir&rsquo;s express sentiment earlier was that he wished  to have an honest debate on the issue and that he remained to be convinced, I  respectfully suggest that he reflect on the amendment. It is an enabling  amendment. It is not threatening, determining or specific. It simply indicates  that we wish to allow ordinary people to be given the opportunity to have an  appeal. If that is threatening to him, we are in a much worse place than any of  us thought we were in. If he is serious about hearing this argument, I strongly  request that the petition of concern be withdrawn and the democratic will of  the House be heard.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: I was waiting for Mr McDevitt to continue and to deal with  some other issues, but he seemed to run out of steam on this occasion.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: I  noticed that Mr McDevitt spoke for less than 15 minutes. If Norris McWhirter  were still alive, we could call the Guinness Book of Records.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: We have done a good thing in this debate today if we have  restricted Mr McDevitt to 15 minutes. I think that we should congratulate  ourselves on that success story.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Members raised a range of issues, but the two key issues  that were raised related to the amendment around dead or dying trees and  third-party appeals. First, I will deal with the issue of dead or dying trees.  At this point, I encourage Members not to move the amendment and to wait until  Further Consideration Stage to move it. I would like to consult the Attorney  General and the Departmental Solicitor&rsquo;s Office to see the consequence of it,  as I have some concerns. There is a fundamental difference between a dead tree  and a dying tree. A number of Members made the point that an oak tree can be  dying for a considerable time. Therefore, although it may not be in the best of  health, it does not pose a particular danger to any property. On the other  hand, a dead tree can pose a danger to people. We need to get some legal  background on this issue before we go ahead and make legislation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I find it a little ironic that, yesterday, Mr Lyttle wanted  to include trees as well as hedges in the High Hedges Bill so that they could  be removed. That included deciduous trees, not just leylandii types, which the  Bill was aimed at dealing with. Therefore, we have some concerns that the  Alliance Party was looking for the removal of trees yesterday, yet today it is  looking to protect dead trees.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">6.00 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  At this stage, I am not sure whether we need an arborist or someone from &lsquo;CSI&rsquo;  to determine whether a tree is dead or dying. However, at this point in time,  does the Minister accept that the debate has become a wee bit surreal? I am not  sure whether you would get anyone at the Attorney General&rsquo;s office or the DSO  to determine whether a tree is dead or dying. Certainly, it would prove  difficult. In fact, I am sure that if anyone is listening to the debate, they  will find that it moves from one level of surreality to another.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: With respect, Mr Deputy Speaker, I did not introduce the  issue. It was not me who pointed out that dying trees can continue for many  years. However, if a tree is dead &mdash; the leaves are not growing and the bark is  coming off &mdash; and the Assembly decides that that tree still warrants protection,  we would be in danger of being a laughing stock. I think that the Member was  actually supporting that amendment. Therefore, the joke was on him.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  appreciate the Minister&rsquo;s giving way. Although I missed most of that, I caught  the drift.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>: <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  Very good, guys. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Surely, the key consideration is whether a tree is  dangerous. If it is dangerous, whether it is alive or dead is immaterial; it  should come down in those circumstances. Even if a tree is dead but is not  dangerous, it is still of value to the ecosystem and habitat. Indeed, we talk  about a tree dying &mdash; a big oak tree, for example, can actually be dying for up  to 400 years.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: As regards a dead tree being valuable, there is little  value in a dead standing tree. The Member may believe that to be the case, and  that, as a consequence, other decisions cannot be taken. I do not believe that  we should go down that route.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kinahan</strong>:  Does the Minister not agree that when a tree is dead and, possibly, not  dangerous, an entire ecosystem survives on it, from bugs and birds to  everything else? That is why it is important.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: In fact, the ecosystem and the bugs that Mr Kinahan refers  to could actually still survive in the tree if it was not standing. If the dead  tree were cut down, the ecosystem that he refers to would still enjoy it.  Several other trees could be planted in its place. To put a protection on a  dead tree is, in my opinion, not a good use of the Assembly&rsquo;s time. It appears  foolish. However, I encourage people not to make a decision on it until we seek  some further advice. The issue is clear: the dead tree could pose a danger to  members of the public and to people&rsquo;s property. Therefore, we do not want to  rush ahead into legislation without giving adequate thought and consideration  to possible pitfalls. There is ample time for further consideration at Further  Consideration Stage.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In respect of third-party appeals, quite a number of  Members complained about the use of the petition of concern. If those Members,  who cross a wide range of parties, want to join the Assembly and Executive  Review Committee in dealing with the ugly scaffolding of the Belfast Agreement,  we will be happy to dispense with petitions of concern. That will not be an  issue. We will not resist getting rid of petitions of concern. However, those  who introduced petitions of concern cannot come weeping, wailing and gnashing  their teeth when someone uses them and it is not to their liking.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  The Minister is a great champion of road safety. I applaud his efforts to try  to improve road safety in the region. One debate that he has promoted is the  lowering of the threshold for certain substances in a person&rsquo;s blood when he or  she is in charge of a vehicle. Does the Minister suggest &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. We are not debating the Good Friday Agreement, the  transport Bill, or anything else: we are debating the Planning Bill. Therefore,  I ask Members to return to the amendment.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I am happy to deal with the  amendment and the issues that were raised as a result of it, which certainly  did not relate to road traffic.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As regards third-party appeals, perhaps Members sometimes  need to use mechanisms like the petition of concern to save Members from  themselves. Even earlier today, there were instances when Members went into a  Lobby and, without any thought whatsoever, imposed another burden upon local  authorities without even knowing the costs that it would impose on local  government.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">If certain Members are going to go into decisions  ram-stam, and without going through the proper processes and giving them  adequate thought, perhaps we should use the mechanism to save them from  themselves and prevent them from causing further harm to Northern Ireland plc  as a consequence.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  assure you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that this is entirely on the matter in hand.  Does the Minister recognise that all that amendment No 20 is doing is to write  the concept of third-party appeals into the legislation and provide an enabling  clause for future debate on the subject? The question requires a simple yes or  no answer from Members on whether they are in favour of the concept. The detail  as to how and if this would be taken forward based on the enabling clause, and  on regulations if we want to go down that route, will be a matter for the  Department and the next Assembly. Therefore, there are plenty of safety valves  in place to ensure that anything put in place will be properly thought through,  if that is what a future Assembly wants to do. Today, we are simply enabling  the debate to happen.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: It is at times such as this that we miss our old friend  Bob McCartney. Perhaps he could have explained how the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; does not  leave a lot of flexibility. If the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; had been used, the Member would  have had a case, but the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; seems pretty clear to me. I suspect that  Mr McCartney, were he here, would agree with me on this issue.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maskey</strong>:  Dare I say it; thank God that we do not have Mr McCartney here. If we did, we  would be here until tomorrow night, notwithstanding tonight&rsquo;s 8.00 pm  watershed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I know that the Minister is resolute in his proposals to  front-load the system and, for the sake of protection, does not want to  backload it. However, will he consider the experiences that a number of Members  have had in their constituencies? Mr McDevitt mentioned the situation in our South Belfast constituency. The experience that many of  us have had with the Planning Service over the past number of years is that it  almost does not matter what the policy is; there is always a presumption in  favour of developers, in particular. A lot of people in our constituency have  expressed bad and negative experiences.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">If there is confidence that front-loading the system will  almost resolve any outstanding problems, why is there such resolute opposition  to providing the safeguard of a third-party right of appeal? If the system  works as the Minister and the Department intend it to work, surely there would  be very little cause or need for the recourse of a third-party right of appeal.  In a way, this would give people protection. We know that from our experience.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: I thank the Member for the point that he has made; it was  well made. If we were coming at the Bill from the current position of Northern Ireland&rsquo;s planning system, then a  third-party appeal system would make a lot of sense; but we are changing  planning in Northern Ireland  fundamentally, and that is where the difference lies. First, we are going back  to a situation in which democratically elected local people will make  decisions. Today, I heard a number of Members refer to planning decisions with  which local communities and local authorities disagreed. It will be the local  authorities who will be the decision-makers in this piece of legislation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">With respect to the people in the planning office, I do not  think that Belfast City Council would have made the decisions relating to the  Malone area or to Piney Hills. If councillors had had the overall say, they  would not have allowed those decisions to be made. However, councillors did not  have the overall say. As a result of this piece of legislation, the councillors  &mdash; who are accountable to the public &mdash; will be making the decisions. We seem to  have had the debate about third-party appeals with some sort of glaze over what  is happening in the Bill. It seemed as if we were continuing with the existing  planning system, when we are fundamentally and wholly changing it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I know that Mr McDevitt lived in another jurisdiction for  many years and that that jurisdiction has had a third-party appeal system for  many years. If Mr McDevitt has come up to Northern Ireland to tell us that he  has had a good experience of planning where he lived and that the planning  system that we are proposing for Northern Ireland is considerably worse, I  would be happy to give way to hear how it is such a better system.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  I am grateful to the Minister for giving way. He is, of course, right; I did  live in another country for many years. I grew up in the south of Spain, and  there is a third-party right of appeal there, which is devolved to local  municipalities, where councillors make planning decisions. The Minister will be  glad to hear that in that country, which is, indeed, a foreign country, the  third-party right of appeal sits alongside a highly devolved planning system,  such as the one he envisages.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister needs to reflect on two levels. It is  perfectly acceptable that, where there is highly accountable, democratic  decision-making in planning, there can still be a third-party right of appeal,  and it works exceptionally well. I commend the model to the Minister. When he  is no longer Minister and is on his summer holidays, he may want to visit Spain and enjoy  the benefits of that system in certain communities where it works.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: I have visited Spain on a number of occasions, and the  destruction that is being carried out on the coastline there is even worse than  the destruction being carried out in the other foreign country that Mr McDevitt  lived in, such as bungalow blight and everything else that has gone on in the  Republic of Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Dallat and others referred to the pre-1973 system. Let  me make it absolutely clear that there were considerably fewer complaints about  the pre-1973 system than about the current system. What has happened in  constituencies such as mine, where period dwellings on the North Circular Road were pulled down and  replaced by apartments, has taken place in many parts of south Belfast and in north Down, where we have seen  what has happened in the coastal areas. I suspect that if planning had been  under the control of councils, such as Coleraine Borough Council, Belfast City  Council, Lisburn City Council, North Down Borough Council or Newry and Mourne  District Council, half of the things that developers were able to do would not  have happened.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Dallat may wish to criticise what happened before 1973,  but I suspect that planning has taken a turn for the worse since then.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: I will give way in a moment. I am very glad that this  House will be vesting powers back into the hands of the local authorities,  which are democratically accountable.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  I thank the Minister for giving way on that point, but he has taken us into an  area. Will he accept that no case of discrimination has been proven against the  Planning Service?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: If the Member believes that the planning system in a  number of areas was not more lax and lenient than it should have been, he must  have cocooned himself in some cave or something for a period. One can look at  the lax attitude that was demonstrated in particular areas and the haciendas  that were built in those areas, which were wholly inappropriate for the  countryside. The Member must have been living somewhere different from the rest  of us, because it is quite clear that many poor planning decisions were made in  many areas.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  This is an important intervention, hopefully. I bear in mind the comments that  the Minister has made. I would hate to fall out with him over a single word:  &ldquo;shall&rdquo; versus &ldquo;may&rdquo;. Given the inevitability that the amendment will fall  because of the petition of concern &mdash; whether one is for or against such  mechanisms &mdash; in the event that the amendment is not moved today and a further  amendment, potentially on a cross-party basis, is brought back for Further  Consideration Stage on the basis of the word &ldquo;may&rdquo;, which does not bind any  future Minister or Assembly but simply enables it to be discussed, would the  Minister and his officials be prepared to reflect on that as a potential way  forward?</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">6.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: It was not the Minister who lodged the petition of  concern; it was the party to which the Minister belongs. Albeit that it was an  important intervention, perhaps unlike some previous ones, I am unable to  answer for the party without due consultation with my colleagues.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We have dealt adequately with the fact that councils will  make the decisions. The issue of front-loading the system is wholly different  from anything heretofore. The expectation is that developers will consult the  local community on all major planning applications. If a significant housing  development is taking place, developers will need to consult people, work  within the context of the planning policy statements on creating places and  other documents, and demonstrate to the Planning Service that they have taken  any public concerns on board.</p>
    <p class="B3SpeakerinChair">(Mr Speaker in the Chair)</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Indeed, if developers have not adequately addressed the  concerns of the local community, planning authorities could decide to discount  a planning application at the outset. Again, that is fundamentally different  from anything heretofore. It would be foolish for us to front-load a system and  facilitate engagement throughout the decision-making process, only for  third-party appeals to roll in thereafter.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I regularly hear complaints that decisions are already  inordinately slow in Northern    Ireland. Today, some Members propose to make  them even slower. I want a more efficient planning system that is more  responsive to the needs to the public as well as to those involved in  construction. If we want to encourage development and attract investment in Northern Ireland  that is desirable and for the public good, we need an efficient planning system  that is capable of delivering. The proposal to introduce third-party appeals in  conjunction with what the document proposes would result in a lack of  flexibility, and we would not achieve the decision-making time frames that  would be acceptable to many people.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It was Mr McDevitt who said that third-party appeals worked  well on these islands. I am not sure what islands in the British   Isles he was referring to. There are third-party appeals in the Republic of Ireland and on the Isle of Man. Perhaps  that is the second island to which Mr McDevitt referred. However, third-party  appeals are not available on the mainland, which is the other island of which  we happen to be an integral part.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Republic of Ireland has a completely different system of planning  from Northern Ireland.  In the Republic   of Ireland, planning  applications are much easier to approve in the first instance. Area plans do  not go through the public consultation processes that exist in Northern Ireland, and the third-party appeal in  the Republic of Ireland is very much a check and balance  on a lax planning system that led to thousands of acres being identified for  development. Those areas now have to be de-zoned.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We are going down a different route that will deliver  better for the residents, to whom many Members referred, than the route taken  by the Republic   of Ireland. In fact, in  the Republic of Ireland, third parties have to pay for  third- party appeals if they are deemed to be vexatious. That may mean paying  for QCs and planning consultants whom the developer employed. Third parties  must also have strong reasons for challenge. Despite that, it is much easier to  get approval from the system that approved those applications than would be the  case here in Northern    Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, getting through the first processes will be  considerably more difficult, given, first, the need to deal with the community  prior to the lodging of the application, and, secondly, the application process  itself. I believe that introducing a third-party appeal after all that would  slow the system down considerably, if not grind it to a halt.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We currently have a planning system where those who have  lodged appeals are waiting two years to have planning appeals heard. Therefore,  introducing a whole series of third-party appeals to that system would not be  conducive to economic growth in this country. It is important to remember that  planning is fundamental to economic growth in our country, and if we want  economic growth, we must have a flexible planning system. If some Members do  not want economic and job growth, more employment, more leisure activities and  more facilities to encourage tourism in Northern Ireland, perhaps they  should stand up and make their case now. However, I certainly want all those  things, and that is why I urge the House to resist amendment No 20, which deals  with third-party appeals.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lo</strong>: I  thank the Minister for giving way. Of course we want economic growth and growth  in the construction industry. The economy is our top priority, and we all agree  on that. However, that does not mean that we can trample over ordinary citizens  who should have a right to speak out.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: Perhaps I should bring this debate to a conclusion now,  because I am clearly not getting through. Members of the community will have  the opportunity to input into the system at the pre-consultation stage.  However, that input will not end at that stage. They can continue to engage in  the process, and their public representatives, who they elect, will ultimately  be the decision-makers. If that is not giving the community an opportunity, and  if it is trampling over a community, I am not sure what particular angle the  Member is coming at it from.

<p class="B1SpeakersName"><span class="BoldText">The Minister of the Environment:</span> The amendments in this group are technical. They include textual amendments to  ensure a consistent approach throughout the Bill, typographical corrections,  updating amendments and amendments prompted by comments from the Examiner of  Statutory Rules. These amendments do not involve any change in policy and have  been supported by the Committee. Therefore, I do not wish to prolong the debate  by commenting on each amendment individually, but I will highlight key  amendments.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Clause 174 allows a council to deal with the enforcement of  advertisement control. Clause 174(3) re-enacts article 84 of the Planning (Northern Ireland)  Order 1991 and contains defences where an advertisement is displayed in  contravention of the advertisement regulations. Those defences have been  amended by clause 37 of the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Bill as  introduced. That clause provides that anyone displaying an advertisement in  contravention of the regulations will not now be guilty of an offence if the  advertisement was displayed without their knowledge, and they took all  reasonable steps to prevent the display or to remove the advertisement after  the display. It is anticipated that clause 37 of the Clean Neighbourhoods and  Environment Bill will be brought into operation in advance of the Planning  Bill. By the time that the Planning Bill is in operation, article 84 of the  Planning Order will have been amended. Therefore, clause 174 needs to be  amended to reflect amended article 84. Amendment No 61 provides that amendment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Clause 202 sets out the procedure for the Planning Appeals  Commission. The Examiner of Statutory Rules commented that the rules made by  OFMDFM under clause 202(5) are subject to no Assembly procedure. Amendment No  68 applies the negative resolution Assembly control.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Clause 226 allows my Department to hold a public inquiry  when carrying out any of its functions of the Bill. The provisions of the  Interpretation Act (Northern    Ireland) 1954 apply to such inquiries. My  Department may make rules for the procedures to be followed during the inquiry  process, and the rules are currently subject to no procedure. The Examiner of  Statutory Rules commented that those rules should be subject to negative  resolution. Amendment No 89 gives effect to that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Under clause 227 and in relation to inquires to be held in  public, subject to certain exceptions, the Department of Justice may direct,  for example, for reasons of security, that certain evidence may be heard or be  open to inspection only by certain persons. Clause 229 allows the appointment  of a person to represent the interests of anyone prevented from hearing or  inspecting such evidence. As currently drafted, the clause conveys that power  on the Advocate General. My proposed amendment Nos 90, 91, 92, 93 and 94 update  clause 229 to the effect that the Attorney General for Northern Ireland  may appoint a person to represent the interests of any person prevented from  hearing or inspecting evidence. The Department of Justice may make rules as to  the person&rsquo;s functions.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Those are the amendments in group 4.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for the Environment</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann  Comhairle. As the name suggests, the amendments in this group are largely  technical. I will go through them very quickly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At Committee Stage, the Committee was content with  amendment No 22, having been given sight of the wording and an explanation by  the Department. I support the amendment accordingly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I cannot offer a Committee position on amendment Nos 23, 24  and 25, as the Committee agreed to the relevant clauses as drafted at Committee  Stage. However, those amendments do not appear to contradict the wishes of the  Committee or to alter any policy principles of the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee supports amendment Nos 29, 30, 35 to 38, 50  and 51, 59 and 60, 73 and 74, 81 to 85, 87 and 88, 95 to 98, 100 and 101. They  were provided to the Committee at Committee Stage to ensure a consistent  approach throughout the Bill and, having been advised by the Department about  their detail, members accepted the relevant clauses, subject to those  amendments.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In relation to amendment No 39, during Committee Stage,  members were content with clause 115, subject to a departmental amendment to  allow the hazardous substances consent to remain in place if the control of  land remains within the Crown. Therefore, I welcome the amendment on behalf of  the Committee.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee supports amendment Nos 56 and 57, which  specify the range of buildings on which urgent works can be carried out. The  Committee also supports amendment No 61, which reflects changes to the  enforcement of advertisement control provided by the Clean Neighbourhoods and  Environment Bill.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">6.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I cannot offer a Committee position on amendment Nos 64 to  67 and 69 to 70, as the Committee agreed the relevant clauses as drafted during  the Committee Stage. However, those amendments do not appear to contradict the  wishes of the Committee or alter any policy principles in the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 68 amends clause 202 to require that any rules  made under that clause for regulating procedures of the PAC should be subject  to negative resolution. Such orders are not currently subject to any Assembly  procedure and, on the advice of the Examiner of Statutory Rules, the Committee  has recommended the amendment, and I urge the House to support it. Similarly,  amendment No 89 makes rules for regulating procedures of the Department in  relation to local inquiries subject to negative resolution. Again, those rules  are currently not subject to procedure, and the Committee urges the House to  address that by supporting the amendment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment Nos 75 and 76 tidy up clause 215, as requested by  the Committee, and I welcome that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">With regard to amendment Nos 90 to 94, the Examiner of  Statutory Rules drew the Committee&rsquo;s attention to the fact that the Bill  allocates the function of appointing special advocates for the purposes of  clause 229 to the Advocate General. He pointed out that, as a consequence of  that, rules under the clause would be made by the Lord Chancellor and laid  before Parliament at Westminster  in accordance with the negative procedure there. The Examiner of Statutory  Rules suggested to the Committee that that is out of place in clause 229,  which, in contrast to clause 228, is the fully devolved provision on the public  interest relating to the security of premises or property other than that in  clause 228. He, therefore, suggested that clause 229 should, more  appropriately, confer functions on the Department of Justice and the Attorney  General for the North and that all the rules made under clause 229 should be  subject to draft negative resolution. Following consultation with the  Department of Justice, the Department agreed to make those changes, and I  welcome the appropriate amendments.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I cannot offer a Committee position on amendment Nos 103  and 108 to 121, as the Committee agreed to the relevant clauses and schedules  as drafted during the Committee Stage. However, once again, I suggest that they  do not appear to contradict the Committee&rsquo;s position or alter any policy  principles in the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">On amendment No 107, the Committee was advised of the  proposed amendment to schedule 2 and accepted the schedule as amended.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That concludes the Committee&rsquo;s position on the amendments  in group 4. I thank the Committee staff and the departmental officials for  bringing the Bill to this stage. Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kinahan</strong>:  Members will be pleased to know that I will be very quick. I support all of the  amendments in group 4. However, on amendment No 56, I want to raise a slight  concern. It seems to throw councils the ability to repair a listed building  that is in danger, which may allow someone to let his or her building fall  apart, knowing that the council will look after it. That is my only concern. We  support the amendments.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Savage: Group 4 consists of technical amendments  that I am happy to support.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName">The Minister of the Environment: I thank Members for  getting to this point and for their comments thus far. I welcome the fact that  the Bill has reached its Consideration Stage and will move to its Further  Consideration Stage on the back of today. The work that has been done thus far  has been very useful. At the end of the process, we will have a Bill that is  very significant in moving Northern    Ireland forward through the planning  legislation that it puts in place. Ultimately, as a consequence of the work  that has been carried out by the Department, the Committee and the House, the  Bill will make a real and considerable difference to planning in the future. I  ask Members to support the amendments.</p>

    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McKay</strong>:  The Second Stage debate on the Bill attracted significant discussion, and I am  grateful to Members for their contributions at that stage. At that time, there  were a number of recurring themes during the debate, including the need for  consultation on the proposals to allow all those who may be affected by the  levy, including retailers, to put forward their views. That is interesting  because, since that debate, there has been some media coverage, and I note that  one BBC report surveyed some retailers in Newcastle  about the levy, and they all supported it because it will save them money on  plastic bags.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Another recurring theme was the concern that the district  councils would be made responsible for the monitoring and enforcement of the  new arrangements. The amendments that I have tabled for consideration today  will address all those issues and, collectively, will remove the detailed  provision from the Bill on the basis that the legislative framework will be  established by regulations made under the Climate Change Act 2008.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That approach will achieve a number of objectives. First,  it will allow the Department to conduct further detailed research with a view  to developing the most efficient and effective means of implementing the new  arrangements. Secondly, it will enable the Department to provide for full  public consultation on the detail policy proposals. The legislative framework  for those proposals will then be established through subordinate legislation,  which will be made under draft affirmative procedure.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That will provide for scrutiny by the Committee for the  Environment and for further debate in the Assembly.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">7.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, the amendments remove from the Bill a specific  role for councils. That issue was raised by Brian Wilson and other Members  during the Committee debate on implementing the new arrangements. That will  enable the Department to consider alternative options, again with a view to  adopting the most effective and efficient approach. That gives the Department  more flexibility in dealing with the matter.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As I said during last week&rsquo;s debate, the primary purpose of  the Bill was and remains to generate a significant reduction in the number of  plastic bags that go to landfill and litter our streets and countryside. I also  indicated that the proceeds of the bag levy will help to fund environmental  projects. Those objectives can be achieved through the revised legislation. The  Department will need to conduct further research to determine the most  appropriate means of implementation. Therefore, I have decided to amend my Bill  to confer broad enabling legislation. That will allow the Department to use the  extensive regulation-making powers that are available already under the Climate  Change Act 2008.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In concluding, I will summarise those powers. The Climate  Change Act 2008 already allows the Department to require retailers to charge  for single-use carrier bags that they supply to their customers, to specify the  minimum amount that must be charged, to appoint an administrator to oversee the  arrangements that are set out and to provide for penalties in the event of a  breach of regulations. The Act, as it stands, does not provide for retailers to  pay the proceeds of the charge to the Department. However, the new clause that  I have proposed today will amend the Act to allow that to happen.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>:  When the sponsor of the Bill came to the Committee a few weeks ago and said  that his Bill would be changed significantly between Second Stage and  Consideration Stage, I thought that we might lose two or three clauses.  However, looking at the Marshalled List of amendments, I see that he was not  telling a mistruth when he said that the Bill would be changed significantly. I  suppose that, in legislative terms, it is the equivalent of Trigger&rsquo;s brush in  &lsquo;Only Fools and Horses&rsquo;. Trigger declared that he had had the same brush for 20  years but that brush had had 14 different heads and 20 different handles. There  are significant changes to the Bill, and I am happy enough to support many of  them.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is fair to say that there was significant media  attention when the Bill was debated at Second Stage. At that time, concerns  were raised by small retailers and even by Friends of the Earth. It is also  fair to say that I have had questions over the legislation, and anyone who read  what I said during Committee Stage will recognise that I had concerns that I  hoped the sponsor or the Department would be able to address. It is fair to say  that, at Committee Stage, there were unanswered questions, and perhaps the amendments  are trying to address some of those.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have always had questions over the argument that was used  about whether the Bill would benefit the environment. A concern was that one  plastic bag would be swapped for another, including pedal-bin bags and nappy  bags, which, of course, could be worse for the environment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In fairness to the sponsor, his amendments have addressed  the other issue that was raised, which was that, to avoid the tax, retailers  would simply swap plastic bags for paper bags. That way, they would get around  paying the tax, and, in fact, the processing of paper bags could mean that they  would have a worse impact on the environment than plastic bags. By changing the  wording in the Bill, the sponsor has, at least, addressed that issue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My belief was always that the policy was to produce a tax  and that it was not about saving or improving the environment. That was  confirmed when it was part of the overall Budget agreement, and it should be  viewed in that context. The DOE budget for the next four years is dependent on  the legislation being passed, and Members should bear that in mind.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Another concern, which we will be able to address, was that  adequate consultation on the Bill had not taken place. Local and independent  retailers have contacted me and said that they were concerned that there had  not been enough consultation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill is becoming nothing more than enabling legislation  or paving legislation. If a levy is introduced at some stage in the future, the  detail will be contained in the regulations. I pressed officials on this matter  in Committee, and they gave me a guarantee that all the regulations that will  be introduced will be fully consulted on. Perhaps the Minister can reaffirm in  the House this evening or tomorrow morning, when the debate is concluded, that,  when the regulations are introduced, they will be fully consulted on and people  will have a chance to have their say.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I turn to the specifics of the amendments. In respect of  removing clause 1 from the Bill, I am content with that; removing clause 2,  again I am very happy with that; removing clause 3, again more than happy with  that; removing clause 4, again happy with that; removing clause 5, again I am  happy with that; removing clause 6, again I am satisfied with that; removing  clause 7, yes, very happy with that; removing clause 8, more than happy with  that; removing clause 9, again very happy with that; removing clause 10 from  the Bill, yes, I am also happy with that; and removing clause 11, again I am  more than satisfied with that. Regarding the schedules, removing schedule 1,  yes, I am happy enough to vote for that and again removing schedule 2 to the  Bill.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McKay</strong>: It  is good to see the Member back in the Chamber again, and it is good to see him  supporting the Single Use Plastic Bags Bill.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Ross: Absolutely. As I said, I have no difficulty in  removing the 11 clauses and two schedules that I mentioned. I am happy to do  so, and I am glad of the support from the Bill&rsquo;s sponsor for that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 1 is probably more substantial and deserves a  bit of commentary. An issue came up in Committee, and someone said that the  Climate Change Act 2008 allowed for a levy to be introduced, so what is the  purpose of the Bill? At the time, it was explained to the Committee that the  Climate Change Act 2008 allows for a levy to be introduced but does not allow  for the Department to get that revenue. The amendment recognises that and  allows an amendment to be made to the Climate Change Act so that, if a levy is  introduced after consultation on the regulations, the revenue could be brought  back into the Department. That makes sense, and it corrects part of the issue  that had been brought up in Committee.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The cost, the procedure, how the levy would be collected,  how the Department would keep tabs on independent retailers to ensure that they  knew how many bags were being used and the cost of a plastic bag to the  consumer would all be included in regulations that would have to be fully consulted  on and would have to go through the due process.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As I said, amendment No 2 recognises the shortcomings in  the Bill and the fact that it only mentions plastic bags. As I said, plastic  will be substituted for paper. Therefore, the environmental argument does not  stack up in the Bill. In some way, the amendment corrects that, and I can see  the logic behind it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 3 changes the long title of the Bill, and that  is unusual. However, it recognises the fact that the Bill, in its original  state, was not going to deliver what the sponsor wanted it to.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The amendments and the sponsor&rsquo;s opposition to clauses 1 to  11 and to the two schedules recognise and reinforce the fact that this is  simply paving legislation. It is enabling legislation that will allow the  Department to consider bringing forward a levy in the future and to consult  fully on any regulations that will come forward. Many of the concerns that  Members have brought up are the concerns that independent retailers and other  organisations have brought up, and they have been addressed by the amendments.  Therefore, I am happy to support them.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Kinahan: I am pleased to speak on this Bill, but I  wonder why we went through the accelerated passage process, given that the Bill  was going to be changed so substantially. This has ended up being a victory for  everybody. I am pleased that the Bill has been changed and will be properly  consulted on. The accelerated passage of the Bill was wrong. The Bill has  completely changed. It is no longer necessarily there for the environment, but  it is there as a means to raise a levy.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I still have problems knowing whether the Bill will be  consulted on properly. I imagine that NIIRTA is still very much against the  Bill because the effect that it will have on small businesses and, indeed, on  businesses that produce all types of bags is still unknown. Having spoken to  Sue Christie of NIEL, I know that she is happy for it to go through today. More  consultation is needed in the future.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 1 changes the Climate Change Act 2008. I hope  that we have got that absolutely right, that Europe  will be happy with it, that it is the right legislation and that we will not  find ourselves subject to an infraction fee or fine. Again, we need to ensure  that it is properly consulted on with environmental groups, particularly to see  whether it all fits in with the Act.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have concerns, as we did previously, that the side effect  of having fewer plastic bags will be that more big black bin bags are used, as  well as more paper bags and cloth bags. However, the side effects will now be  from single-use carrier bags. I guess that that will mean that even more big  black bin bags will be used. We will probably raise much more money than we had  originally intended. We know that paper is worse for the environment and that  cloth is unhealthy, although I would like to see more details on that. We need  to know an awful lot more about the Bill. I also want to know how we will  define &ldquo;single-use carrier bags&rdquo;, as most bags can be used twice. I look  forward to seeing that in more detail. I still believe that we should look at  how to adopt the Danish system and raise funds on the back of that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will not go through all the clauses but will simply  welcome the fact that all the original clauses have been removed. If I am here  in the new Assembly, I will look forward to the clauses being dealt with properly.  My party supports the enabling Bill.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dallat</strong>: I  enthusiastically support the Bill. If Members do not mind the analogy, I will  say that it is, surely, the proverbial phoenix that has risen from the ashes in  a new form. It is, if you like, the Houdini of Bills that have fallen foul of  many a Parliament.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Of course, the need for the Bill has never been in any  doubt. The issue is just the packaging, if Members will pardon the pun, and the  claims that it would generate &pound;16 million. Oh, how I feel for the Minister, who  thought that he would get &pound;16 million to repair all those riverbanks and do  things that need to be done. Now, we do not have the money. In the short term,  the Bill, in its current form, will not raise any money &mdash; not a brass penny.  However, who knows? In the future, it may well do so. Of course, it will be a  good thing if the Bill brings about the clearing-up of carrier bags &mdash; am I  allowed to use the word &ldquo;plastic&rdquo;? Those bags have damaged the environment,  choked wildlife and caused farmers horrendous problems.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The concerns of small shopkeepers have been mentioned. They  are entirely genuine. I have had it in the teeth from loads of small  shopkeepers. They feel that they have had no opportunity for consultation. Some  I have spoken to had, in fact, embarked on their own campaign to reduce  packaging. They feel that they have been sidestepped.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am sure that the Bill&rsquo;s sponsor will justify its accelerated  passage. Again, I would have thought that, in a fledgling democracy, the use of  the accelerated passage procedure would be occasional. Now, it appears to  happen quite often.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  Not only has there been a proposal for the Bill&rsquo;s accelerated passage, but  there is an accelerated Bill: it is going so fast that it has become  unrecognisable. I am not sure whether it is now a private Member&rsquo;s Bill or, in  fact, the Department&rsquo;s Bill.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">7.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dallat</strong>:  My colleague is finished. I will conclude at this unearthly hour of the  evening.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brady</strong>: Mr  McGlone mentioned accelerated passage. When Ms Ritchie was Minister for Social  Development, accelerated passage was used frequently.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Let us stay on the subject of the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dallat</strong>:  Mr Brady&rsquo;s comment was not very nice. The Member, who seems to have a  particular affection for Ms Ritchie and gets her into all his speeches, must  realise that because of all the &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. We have to stick to the Bill before the House.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dallat</strong>:  Mr Deputy Speaker, from one Deputy Speaker to another, I have to agree with  you. I should not have taken the bait.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will be serious. Other issues came up when the Department  was discussing the Bill with the Committee. Our concern for the environment and  for the filling up of landfill sites extends far beyond carrier bags. The  Department has undertaken to look at other issues. There are loads of resources  from the European Union that could be used constructively to create hundreds if  not thousands of jobs, not only in recycling but in preventing material going  to landfill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I congratulate the sponsor of the Bill. He has had a hard  struggle with it. I am sure that he is grateful to the Department, which, like  Lochinvar, came and rescued the whole thing at the last minute. We will support  the Bill enthusiastically.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: We  are in unprecedented and surreal territory. Nevertheless, my party and I are  more comfortable with the proposed direction of travel that has been set out. I  am not going to detain the House and rehearse the points that have been made by  others. We welcome what is a step back from what was originally proposed and  are grateful that there is more time for consideration of the concept. We  support moving ahead with addressing the overuse of plastic bags. In that  respect, we continue to support the principles of the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Notwithstanding the unprecedented nature of what is about  to happen, I appreciate the rationale for doing it. I am deeply encouraged that  the Department believes that, potentially, it is acceptable to make major  legislative departures through regulations. That is relevant not only to this  debate but to other debates that we had earlier this evening.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although the Bill may well be enabling legislation, the  issue and the complexities around it, the way in which it can be introduced,  the views of the various interest groups in Northern Ireland and the competing  environmental arguments that we have been exposed to need to be properly  thought through and properly tested through public consultation. Like other  Members who have spoken, I look forward to hearing considerable reassurance from  the Bill&rsquo;s sponsor and the current Minister of the Environment that proper  consideration will be given to all the issues before the detail of this comes  back through regulations.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We support what is now before us, in its almost 100%  transformed status.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr W Clarke</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I support the changes to the Bill.  Obviously, they reflect the changes of the Department, not of its sponsor.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At Second Stage, the main discussions centred on  consultation. There were also discussions about district councils. The  amendments allow the Department time to carry out research and further  investigations to ensure that we deliver a very effective arrangement. They  allow the Department to carry out a full public consultation. That was discussed  at Second Stage, when it was said that there was not enough consultation and  people were being excluded.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Whoever is here after the election will have an opportunity  to scrutinise the subordinate legislation that will come through the House. The  Assembly will have plenty of opportunity for debate, and the new Environment  Committee will be allowed to really scrutinise the Bill. Members of the current  Committee felt that things were being rushed through and that they were not  aware of the full detail of the Bill. The amendments enable all those concerns  to be addressed. They will give small businesses, retailers and businesses that  supply plastic bags and other carrier bags the opportunity to feed into the  process.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At Second Stage, a lot of Members spoke about local  authorities having to implement or enforce the legislation. Obviously, the  amendments will remove that requirement. They will give flexibility to look in  detail at best practice in other areas that have implemented such a levy and  get the most cost-effective way to collect that levy.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Neither I nor Sinn F&eacute;in has changed position on supporting  a plastic bag levy. I will not rehearse all of that, but environmental reasons  are a big component. There were concerns at Second Stage about other carrier bags,  such as paper bags, that would cause more environmental damage. Amendment No 2  deals with that and gives greater flexibility in that regard.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Other reasons why I support the plastic bag levy include  reducing litter and improving the quality of recyclable material. Changing  consumer behaviour is one of the most important reasons, as is generating funds  for environmental projects, particularly the green new deal, of which I am a  great supporter.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The amendments allow us all the opportunity to reflect,  look at best practice throughout the world in gathering the levy and make sure  that we get it right.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: I  declare an interest as a local councillor. Councillors will have an interest in  the Bill, because single-use plastic bags frequently end up as litter. Also,  the original draft of the Bill placed a bureaucratic requirement on councils to  carry the administrative burden.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The sponsor of the Bill made a significant understatement  when he said that he had decided to amend the Bill. What has happened is  remarkable. The first 11 clauses have been entirely removed; Clause 12, which  is the short title, has been altered; and the schedule has been removed. To say  that the Bill has been changed is an understatement. It has been significantly  renewed, and I think that most reasonable people would say that it is  practically a new Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">During the earlier debate, I raised concerns that the  original proposal to charge 15p was unnecessarily excessive. Again, I highlight  the additional burden that would have been placed on local government, along  with a lot of other burdens that are falling on local government in connection  with other legislation currently completing its passage. We need to take care  that we do not create too great a burden. The other issue highlighted was how  other types of bag can require more energy to produce and be more polluting. I  am comfortable with the amendment to address single-use carrier bags. There was  also concern about the use of accelerated passage, rightly so with such  significant legislation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The contents of the Bill having been stripped out, new  clause A1 is merely enabling legislation, and it is, to all intents and  purposes, new legislation. There will be a consultation process involved in  drawing up the outworkings of the secondary legislation that will flow from it.  That will help us to get a better balance. The proposed new clause can also be  more easily adjusted as it proceeds, should it need to be, and as it tries to  achieve its purpose of creating a better use of our resources and of reducing  the litter scourge associated with any single-use bags, particularly single-use  plastic bags.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am comfortable with the proposed significant alteration  to the Bill, and I will support the new clause and agree to the other changes  that the original sponsor of the Bill suggested.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment (Mr Poots)</strong>: I welcome the modest amendments that have been  tabled. They will make some slight changes. I have stated that I support the  principle of the Executive&rsquo;s collective decision to introduce a levy on  single-use bags. I did that on the basis that it would not be an environmental  tax for the sake of having a tax, as I am wholly opposed to people using the  environment for tax-raising purposes. I think that that is wrong. I will  support the Bill only on the basis that investment will be put back into the  environment as a result of any funding that the levy raises.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">With that in mind, I am conscious of the need to undertake  comprehensive research to determine the best approach to the implementation of  the arrangements. Indeed, I have already asked my officials to commence that  process, and the amendments will allow for the consideration of all options to  ensure that the new arrangements are implemented in the best way possible. That  will include the amount of the charge. There was a lot of concern about 15p,  which was the figure that took hold. It would be good for us to identify the  right figure to charge. It may be a much smaller figure, which may raise more  money. Alternatively, it could be a much higher figure, in which case the  number of bags used could really be reduced. It remains to be seen how we will  take that forward. For example, how will the money be collected? Will we get  the co-operation of HMRC? Will we have to introduce our own system? If we  introduce our own system, how much might that cost us, and would it still  realise value for money? Would there be a system through which the plastic bag  levy could directly fund our NGOs without it coming through government, meaning  that it would not come out of our funding to begin with? All those issues need  to be addressed, and we need to be creative about how we do that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We also need to look at the administrative and enforcement  arrangements. I was surprised to hear Mr Beggs complain that it might put an  additional burden on councils. If I am not mistaken, the same Mr Beggs, along  with his party colleagues, voted this afternoon to put an additional burden on  local government by asking it to look after climate change arrangements, which  is something that other bodies do already. They said that we should have a  duplication of services and put additional cost and burden on to councils, and  then, a few hours later, they cried crocodile tears about the possibility of  burdens being put on councils.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Most importantly, the legislation will allow my Department  to conduct a full public consultation on detailed policy proposals. I think  that Members want to hear that. It is essential that we consult properly on  this issue. It has an impact on jobs and on our small retailers. Unlike Mr  McKay, I have not heard an awful lot of small retailers say that this is a  wonderful idea. I do not know where he is talking to them, but I cannot  honestly say that I have heard a load of small retailers suggest that this is a  great idea.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">If we go through full public consultation, however, we will  be able to make provision for subordinate legislation to be debated in the  Assembly. That should address the concerns that Members expressed at Second  Stage, and it should provide all key stakeholders, including retailers, with an  opportunity to consider the Department&rsquo;s detailed policy proposals and to  express their views.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At this point, there is not much more that I need to say.  The Bill, as amended, merely provides broad enabling powers, with the detail to  be established through subordinate legislation. In due course, my Department  will bring the draft legislation before the Assembly for consideration. I am  happy to support the few amendments that are before the House.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McKay</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank all the Members for their  contributions to the debate.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Alastair Ross kicked off proceedings, and it is good to see  him back in the Chamber again, engaging in and contributing to the debate. He  raised his concern that some retailers may change from plastic bags to paper  bags. In its response to the draft Budget, NIEL also expressed that concern,  and we want to take those concerns on board. There is a need to look in detail  at the use of plastic and paper bags in the retail trade to establish what levy  should be placed on each. The Member also welcomed the amendments, which, if  accepted, will put the Bill into a different state. However, he should bear it  in mind that a private Member&rsquo;s Bill is not only about what is on the sheet but  about getting Departments or the Executive to adopt a policy or an idea. In this  instance, the position has quite firmly changed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Danny Kinahan spoke about the need for consultation, and,  as the Minister outlined, the Department will conduct a full consultation  process, which will give everyone an opportunity to put their views across. The  Member also touched on the fact that NIEL is happy with the legislation as it  stands.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">John Dallat also referred to small shopkeepers, and their  concerns must be taken on board during the consultation process and before  regulations are put in place. He also expressed a general concern about waste  going to landfill sites, which is an issue in his constituency of East Derry.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Stephen Farry said that many issues and complexities needed  to be tested. He also said that he looked forward to the regulations coming to  the House at a later date. Willie Clarke supported the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Roy Beggs discussed changes to the Bill and expressed  concern that councils may have some roles and responsibilities with regard to  it. However, as the Minister said, that will be worked out in the finer detail.  We need to look at how cost-effective it will be to collect the levy, and part  of that will be deciding who carries that out.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister indicated that he had asked officials to  commence research. He said that his Department will take things forward and  that the detail will be worked out and addressed in the future.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I do not want to keep Members any longer than necessary.  The Bill has changed. It changed because the Department and the Executive  radically changed their position and indicated that they were committed to  implementing a single carrier bag levy. That was the original purpose of the  Bill. As I said, many private Members&rsquo; Bills do not get to Final Stage, because  their primary purpose is to get Departments and Ministers to adopt a policy and  change the law. However, this private Member&rsquo;s Bill has been successful. The  issue was brought to the Executive, and the Executive and the Minister adopted  the idea that we brought to the House.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question, That amendment No 1 be made, put and agreed  to.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">New clause ordered to stand part of the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: No amendments have been tabled to clauses 1 to 11.
