                adverse impact on the general environment as good reasons for
                opposing the mast. I support the campaign and present the

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, Mr Speaker. I notice
                from Hansard that after the debate on Tuesday 28 May on one
                elected position, one Member managed to take the subject of the
                debate to its logical conclusion and have his name recorded in
                both Lobbies. I refer to Mr McNamee who, according to Hansard,
                contrived to vote both for and against the motion.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I shall look into the matter, but there is
                nothing to prevent a Member from voting in both Lobbies. In
                fact, if a Member concludes that he has voted in the wrong
                Lobby, the only way of correcting that is to negate that vote by
                voting in the other Lobby.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I shall, however, check whether this is an
                error in the Hansard record or, perhaps, the first time that a
                Member has availed himself or herself of the opportunity of
                voting more than once — a practice not entirely unknown in
                Northern Ireland outside of the Assembly Chamber.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr J Kelly:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Further to that point of order, Mr Speaker.
                How do Members express their abstention from a vote? Pat McNamee’s
                understanding was that, to abstain from voting, Members must
                vote in both Lobbies. That was the reason for his decision.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member is absolutely correct. The only
                way to ensure that an abstention is recorded is to vote in that
                way. There have been those in the past, as the Member will
                recall, who have gone to some very considerable lengths to
                abstain in person. It is something that is not unknown in
                certain parts of Northern Ireland either.</p>

                been appropriate time to consider them. Is there a mechanism

                to provide material in advance of a statement. The only

                subject of the statement to the Speaker two and a half hours in
                advance so that the Speaker can decide whether to permit it. The
                purpose of most statements is to make available new material
                that the Assembly may wish to debate on foot of a normal motion.

                an tSeirbhís Sláinte agus chuig an phobal i gcoitinne.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Inniu, tá an tuarascáil ar fhiosrúchán na
                n-orgán daonna á foilsiú ina hiomláine agam. Agus sin á

                Uasal John O’Hara QC, a bhí ina chathaoirleach ar an
                fhiosrúchán, do bhaill an fhiosrúcháin, don Ollamh Eithne
                McLaughlin agus do Paddy Kelly Uas, as a dhíograisí agus a
                bháúla a bhí siad agus iad i mbun an fhiosrúcháin
                thromchúisigh seo. Tá sé 15 mhí ó shin nach mór ó d’fhógair
                mé go raibh fiosrúchán na n-orgán daonna á chur sa tsiúl
                agam. Ag an am, rith sé liom chomh tábhachtach agus a bhí sé
                beart a dhéanamh go práinneach le tacú le cearta agus le
                mianta na dteaghlach sin ar mór an méala leo bás duine
                clainne agus lena chinntiú nach ndéanfaí neamart ná faillí
                iontu. Ba mhian liom chomh maith muinín an phobail as na

                mhéadaigh go mór ar an mhéala agus ar an fhulaingt. Chuaigh
                an cleachtas a bhíodh ann sa réimse seo i gcion ar bheatha
                móran gnáthdhaoine anseo. Ba le deireadh a chur leis an

                daingean a cheapadh a bheadh mar mhúnla don chleachtas sa
                todhchaí a chuir mé fiosrúchán reachtúil ar bun. Tasc
                tromchúiseach a bhí san fhiosrúchán seo agus tá mé faoi
                chomaoin ag foireann an fhiosrúcháin, a thug go bríomhar,
                macánta báúil faoin dúshlán. D’obair siad go gníomach i
                gcomhar leis na teaghlaigh sin ar bhain na seanchleachtais
                dóibh, agus rinne siad gach dícheall le teacht ar na fíorais

                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wish to make a statement on the outcome of
                the human organs inquiry. Following the statement, the inquiry’s
                report will be circulated to Members, to the families who came
                forward seeking answers, to the Health Service and to the
                public.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Today, I am publishing in full the report of
                the human organs inquiry. In doing so I record my thanks to the
                chairperson of the inquiry, Mr John O’Hara QC, and to its
                members, Prof Eithne McLaughlin and Ms Paddy Kelly, for
                undertaking this difficult task with rigour and sensitivity.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is nearly 15 months since I announced the
                establishment of the human organs inquiry. At the time, I was
                struck by the importance of taking urgent action to support the
                rights and expectations of families who had been touched by the
                intense sadness of the death of a loved one and to ensure that
                they were not set aside or ignored. I also wanted to rebuild
                public confidence in post mortem procedures. Past practice,
                involving the removal and retention of organs, did not enable
                families to give informed consent and led to a great deal of
                additional grief and suffering. The impact of that practice has
                affected the lives of many ordinary people here.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I established the inquiry to draw a line
                under past practices and to develop a firm framework for shaping
                future practice. The inquiry was not an easy task, and I am
                grateful to the team, which took up the challenge with energy,
                integrity and sympathy. Its members actively engaged with
                families who had been affected by former practices and were
                industrious in establishing the facts and devising solutions for
                developing better future practice. I commend the report as a
                balanced, measured and thoughtful account of past practice. Its
                focus was not restricted to finding out where past practice had
                been deficient; it also considered how to improve practice and
                build in new rights and safeguards to ensure that the service
                has the full confidence of everyone.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report raises important questions about
                the service’s capacity to provide proper counselling and
                support for next of kin at the time of a loved one’s death. It
                also raises questions about our Health Service’s ability to
                provide urgent, sympathetic and appropriate responses when faced
                with unexpected crises.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Having given careful consideration to the
                inquiry’s report, I will implement its recommendations in
                full. I want to draw particular attention to several key areas
                covered by them. The Human Tissue Act (Northern Ireland) 1962
                should be repealed in its entirety. I fully accept the inquiry’s
                recommendations on replacing the current legislation, and I am
                taking immediate steps to initiate the process of introducing
                proposals for new legislation along the lines recommended. I aim
                to include this in the Assembly’s 2003-04 legislative
                programme.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department should issue guidelines on the
                future use of blocks and slides within six months, and no
                research involving new human material should be permitted
                without explicit consent being obtained. I will issue guidelines
                on the use of blocks and slides before the end of the year in
                consultation with the research ethics committees. I will also be
                issuing new governance arrangements for research ethics
                committees later this year requiring prior ethical approval for
                any proposed clinical research involving Health Service users
                conducted by university or Health Service staff.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr J Wilson] in the
                Chair)</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Trusts should introduce uniform consent forms
                and information leaflets, the final drafts of which must be
                cleared with the Relatives Reference Group. I have asked my
                officials to prepare new consent forms, supporting guidance and
                advice documents for issue before the end of 2002. Alongside
                that, I recognise the invaluable role played by the Relatives
                Reference Group, which I set up at the same time as the inquiry
                primarily to offer support to bereaved parents. I will now
                develop its role in line with the recommendations of the
                inquiry, formalising its funding and extending it to cover the
                period up until the new legislation comes into force. The group’s
                remit will also be recast to reflect its future role.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Trusts must inform the Department annually
                that post mortem practice has been in accordance with the
                principles of the report. I will require trusts to make an
                annual declaration to that effect. I will also consider making
                that a statutory requirement under the new human tissue
                legislation. The Department should engage in a two-year
                multimedia campaign informing relatives that they may reclaim
                blocks and slides. I will commission the development of such a
                campaign, in liaison with the Relatives Reference Group, to be
                initiated in the autumn.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are separate recommendations on
                education and information campaigns. They involve the Department
                educating the public about post mortems; obstetric, neonatal,
                and paediatric staff receiving mandatory training in patient
                grief and bereavement; and induction arrangements for new
                doctors, including mandatory training on obtaining fully
                informed consent. My officials will work directly with the Royal
                College of Pathology; Queen’s University, Belfast; the
                Northern Ireland Postgraduate Council for Education and
                Training; other training organisations; and the Relatives
                Reference Group to address those issues. I have asked them to
                come up with firm proposals in all of those areas by the autumn.
                I am committed to meeting the inquiry’s recommendations on
                training and to developing a public education and awareness
                programme for commencement later in the year.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In considering the report and its
                recommendations, I was struck by the statement in paragraph 8.8
                that, despite the very negative impact that the controversy has
                had on the delivery of a proper pathology service</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Post mortems remain an important and
                integral part of the proper provision of a National Health
                Service. They are important to the public generally but to some
                families they are essential … The system of obtaining consent
                from relatives to a post mortem and informing, advising and
                counselling those relatives has never been better in Northern
                Ireland than it is today.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Post mortem examinations and the retention,
                with appropriate consent, of blocks and tissue samples are
                crucial to building and developing better clinical practice and
                improving health outcomes for patients. The inquiry report cites
                examples where such practices have advanced clinical knowledge
                and saved children’s lives.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I recognise the concerns expressed by the
                inquiry, and by some families affected by organ retention, that
                arrangements for managing the flood of enquiries when the issue
                first arose were deficient. It is important that the Health
                Service learn from experience. With that in mind, I am writing
                to all trust chairpersons, asking them to review their
                arrangements for dealing with unexpected crises to ensure that
                they have plans in place to respond quickly, effectively and
                appropriately to any sudden requirement of that nature. I will
                be asking them to include an assurance to that effect in their
                annual declarations regarding post mortem practice.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I intend to draw up an action plan to provide
                a schedule for the actions that have been outlined, and I will
                share that with the Assembly’s Committee for Health, Social
                Services and Public Safety in the coming weeks. I believe that,
                taken together, the actions that I have outlined today represent
                a comprehensive response to the inquiry report. I commend the
                report and invite Members to note my proposed actions to
                implement its recommendations in full.</p>

                statement that she will take on board all the report’s
                recommendations. However, I am disappointed that, as far as I am
                aware, neither my Committee colleagues nor I had a chance to
                examine the report or the Minister’s statement earlier this
                morning. However, it is important that the report has been
                published. I also take on board your point, Mr Deputy Speaker.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that the report and the implementation
                of the recommendations will bring to an end almost two years of
                heartache for families. The psychological trauma has been
                massive and many hospital staff have tried hard to help and
                console those most directly affected. There must be proper and
                informed consent.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister referred to the repeal of the
                Human Tissue Act (Northern Ireland) 1962. The Department issued
                guidelines on the retention of blocks and slides and uniform
                consent forms throughout Northern Ireland. The Minister and the
                Committee have commented on that. Has a specific timetable been
                drawn up? The Minister has said that she will consult with the
                Committee. How will she ensure that the Committee is fully
                consulted and that it will have a part to play in advising the
                Minister on actions to be taken by her Department?</p>

                pressures on it since the issue of organ removal and retention
                was highlighted. It is crucial that confidence in the service be
                restored if we are to attract new medical students to pathology.
                The report makes several recommendations, and an action plan is
                being prepared to put those recommendations into effect. In the

                15 months since the scandal first came to light and since the

                failings be held accountable, because there is an issue about
                future breaches of practice? Queen’s University failed to
                declare that it had retained organs or tissue until the eleventh

                action to be taken against individuals. However, if any evidence
                of inappropriate conduct by specific individuals is brought to
                my attention, I shall consider it carefully. The main focus of
                my follow-up action will be to ensure that identified system

                donation throughout Northern Ireland, thus depriving many
                patients of that life-saving facility? If so, what action will

                are far from it. I am pleased that people continue to donate
                organs. In the past year, I have done several things to promote

                go some way to address the grief that parents have been through
                because of bereavement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I note that the Minister said that the
                Relatives Reference Group may be included in the now mandatory
                training for obstetric, neonatal and paediatric staff, as well
                as in the induction arrangements for new doctors. After all,
                nobody is better placed than the parents to be involved in that
                training. It may not be enough for the Department to speak to
                the Royal College of Pathology and to the Postgraduate Council
                for Education and Training. On all future occasions, where
                possible, we must continue to involve the relatives.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will the Minister answer Mr Coulter’s
                question on the time lag with post-mortems that exists as a
                result of the stress that the paediatric pathologist at the
                Royal Victoria Hospital has been put under? I have received
                letters from parents who are still grieving because they have
                not received the results of post-mortems — the wait goes on
                and on as a direct result of what has happened.</p>

                coroner in any interdepartmental arrangements for implementing
                the recommendations, because the recent scandal over Queen’s
                University’s discovery that it had not submitted all its
                evidence had to do with the fact that some of that evidence

                Executive have no powers over coroners. As I explained when the

                to ensure that relatives can have the results of post-mortems as

                all the information that they require before being asked to sign
                for a post-mortem? Last week’s disclosures of the amount of
                tissue and the number of foetuses laid aside were disturbing.

                professionals, trusts and other key interested parties to ensure
                that those important measures are expedited. By working with the
                Relatives Reference Group, the Department will ensure that the
                measures are developed appropriately.</p>

                I preface my question by thanking the inquiry membership and
                staff for this comprehensive report, and I thank the Minister

                the scandal of the organ retention issue has caused the families

                and Learning’s attendance this morning. Her presence will
                perhaps mark the beginning of addressing what happened at Queen’s

                alleviate the suffering of concerned relatives, the Assembly
                should also recognise the value to medical teaching and medical
                research — hence the long-term health of the entire population
                — of having an archive of blocks and slides. Considering that,
                does the Minister agree that where the identity of materials
                cannot be established and where families do not ask for the
                return of organs after the two-year publicity and media campaign
                proposed in the report, the archive collections — as at Queen’s
                University Belfast, for instance — should be maintained for

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I recognise the benefits that arise, and I
                have referred to them in my statement. The inquiry dealt
                specifically with that issue. In future, any research that
                involves human materials for which explicit consent has not been
                given should not be permitted. The inquiry’s terms on that are
                very clear. As part of its recommendations, it requests a
                two-year multimedia campaign to ensure that those who wish to
                reclaim tissue and organs that are being held know that they can
                reclaim them. The inquiry was explicit in recognising that it
                would not be of benefit that that possibility should be lost to
                medical science.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report clearly defines that there has
                been a loss of confidence in the system as a result of the
                revelations about past practices. There is a target date of
                2003-04 for the implementation of new legislation. Can we have
                an assurance that the new legislation will be the Department’s
                number one priority? How realistic is that date? Public
                confidence should be restored; that is paramount. Every effort
                must be made to ensure that the target date of 2003-04, which is
                going on to the legislative programme, will be met. It is only
                by the introduction of new legislation that some degree of
                confidence will be restored to the public and, in particular, to
                those who are most affected.</p>

                included in the Assembly’s 2003-04 legislative programme.
                However, that is not the only issue that the Department will
                address. In reply to an earlier question, I reported that key
                improvements will include not only the introduction of new
                legislation but new accountability arrangements, development in
                post-mortem practice and procedures and a public education
                information programme to make next of kin aware of what a
                post-mortem consists of and the safeguards that are in place.
                There will also be training for all staff involved in patient
                care and post-mortems.</p>

                personal social services to provide assurances about the quality
                of health and social services delivered here. That will include

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With your permission, Mr Deputy Speaker, the
                Deputy First Minister and I wish to make a statement on the
                issues that will affect the Executive’s work to develop a
                Programme for Government and Budget for the financial year
                2003-04 and beyond.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In his statement to the Assembly on 4 March
                2002, the Minister of Finance and Personnel identified the main
                stages for this year’s Programme for Government and Budget
                cycle. A key first phase is the development of the Executive’s
                position report on the Programme for Government and Budget,
                which has been made available to all Members this morning.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The position report reflects our commitment,
                under the agreement, to agree each year a programme that
                incorporates an agreed Budget. It gives the Executive an
                opportunity to outline for the Assembly’s consideration the
                key issues affecting public services, which should influence the
                preparation of the next Programme for Government and the Budget
                that will support it. The report formally launches the
                consultation, with the Assembly and others, on the next
                Programme for Government and the Budget.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The position report is distinct from the
                annual report; the number of reports on this subject can result
                in confusion. The annual report, which will be produced before
                the end of this month, outlines the Executive’s performance in
                the past year on their first Programme for Government: where
                progress has, or has not, been made; reasons, where appropriate,
                for any lack of progress; and the action that has been taken.
                The position report projects how the Executive can refine their
                priorities in the Programme for Government to target more
                effectively the resources in the Budget in order to deliver
                progress.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The development of the Programme for
                Government has been continuous. Less than six months ago, the
                Assembly endorsed the current programme, which focuses on the
                financial year 2002-03, and its implementation began just over
                two months ago. The current cycle represents an important
                opportunity. For the first time, we intend to set plans for a
                three-year period, which will be informed by a more thorough
                analysis of the needs and effectiveness of our major public
                service programmes. Our approach will depend on the conclusion
                of the negotiations on the Treasury spending review, which will
                be known next month.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In December, the Executive indicated, through
                their spending plans for 2003-04, their determination to change
                the pattern of public services in order to reflect more fully
                the priorities of the Programme for Government. In addition, the
                reinvestment and reform initiative, which we launched on 2 May,
                adds several new dimensions to the debate that is needed on how
                our public services develop under the Executive and the
                Assembly, in co-operation with the North/South Ministerial
                Council and the other structures created under the agreement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The development and annual revision of the
                Programme for Government, incorporating the Budget, is the core
                task of the Administration. Through that, they set out their
                policy direction, plans and priorities for the years ahead.
                Those plans and priorities will, in turn, inform budgetary
                decisions. We seek to develop, among the four parties in the
                Administration, a collective direction of agreed priorities,
                through which we shall continue to build the basis of the new
                democracy. Through discussion, debate and consultation, in the
                Chamber and further afield, we seek to draw together the views
                of the Assembly and society on the priorities for Northern
                Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The position report reflects clearly the
                Executive’s desire to focus debate on the quality of our
                public services, and to ensure that those are fairly and
                effectively administered. We emphasise the need for investment
                in infrastructure; the desire to improve service delivery; the
                importance of tackling social exclusion, especially poverty; and
                of working in partnership with others. We want to deliver
                reinvestment and reform that will result in high-quality public
                services. The reinvestment and reform initiative provides an
                opportunity for us to invest substantially in improving and
                modernising our infrastructure. In allocating resources, we need
                to identify closely the reforms that may be required and their
                potential outcomes. The Executive are already committed to
                reviewing the structure of public administration, which involves
                considering the types of structures that best serve the needs of
                Northern Ireland and how we might improve efficiency to allow
                resources to be focused where they are most needed.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">11.30 am</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As we said in our statement on the
                reinvestment and reform initiative, resources and reform must go
                together. The position report makes that clear. It sets out the
                Executive’s determination to articulate their vision for
                public services and to explain how they might reform those
                services and improve their quality. The position report also
                underlines their commitment to ensure that everyone can share
                the benefits that should flow from the investment and reforms
                that they want to see.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Executive recognise that, for too long,
                poverty has blighted the lives of too many people. They remain
                committed to developing policies and programmes, to allocating
                resources to support them and to focusing on areas and people in
                greatest objective social need — in line with targeting social
                need (TSN). The position report also recognises the need to see
                how different Departments can best work together in that and
                with other partners. The Executive rely on others, such as local
                government, business and the voluntary and community sectors, to
                help them to deliver the Programme for Government. It is right
                that those relationships should be developed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Executive’s work to develop and agree
                the Programme for Government and the Budget does not take place
                in a vacuum. Important contextual issues need to be understood,
                reflected in the Executive’s work and taken account of by the
                Assembly and others in response to the position report. First is
                the financial context. The position report explains that the
                spending power available to the Executive for the years 2003-04
                to 2005-06 will be largely determined by the outcome of the
                2002-03 spending review. It is understood that that will be
                announced by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in July 2002. The
                Executive’s key reference point, and the baseline for the
                entire process, will be the spending plans for 2003-04. Those
                were first set out in the spending review for 2000 and were
                updated and converted to resource accounting and budgeting stage
                2 classifications to provide the foundation for that spending
                review, which will set revised plans for 2003-04 and new plans
                for the two succeeding financial years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chancellor’s Budget announcement on 17
                April 2002 has already provided significant additions for the
                period from 2003-04 to 2007-08 — arising from the application
                of the Barnett formula to the allocations for services in
                England and Wales. The Chancellor has also given signals of the
                likely outcome of the spending review. He has confirmed that the
                Treasury envisages real growth in spending over the spending
                review period — growth that is over and above the provision
                that has already been made for the Health Service. That suggests
                that there will be further limited additions for public
                expenditure in total and hence, through the Barnett formula, for
                Northern Ireland. The precise amount will depend on the outcome
                of discussions with, and within, the Treasury.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Even limited growth in spending could lead to
                substantial additional spending for Northern Ireland in 2004-05
                and 2005-06 if the Chancellor applies the increase to spending
                areas that are comparable with our programmes. However, if he is
                obliged to use the spending power that is available for
                annually-managed expenditure, such as social security benefits
                or debt interest, or for spending on defence and other
                non-comparable programmes, additional amounts available to the
                Executive will be much more limited.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are, of course, other contexts for our
                work. With regard to the economic context, it is encouraging
                that over the past year our economy has performed well.
                Employment is at a record high, and unemployment is approaching
                the lowest level for a generation. However, the impact of
                foot-and-mouth disease and global economic uncertainty have
                constrained progress in some areas — Northern Irish firms face
                difficult trading conditions, particularly in industries in
                which there has been a worldwide decline in trade. That has
                contributed to problems in manufacturing output. Agriculture and
                tourism have also experienced declines in earnings as a result
                of foot-and-mouth disease and the wider economic and fiscal
                environment. While there has been a modest improvement in the
                past year, farming is still well short of levels seen during the
                mid-1990s.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The outlook for the economy over the next few
                years is reasonably benign. Growth is expected to accelerate in
                2002-03. However, the Assembly needs to understand the
                conditions in which we currently operate. We need to be able to
                identify the economic challenges we are likely to face, and we
                need to develop our proposals for tackling those challenges as
                we take forward the Programme for Government and the Budget.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We also need to be aware of the social and
                environmental contexts — we know the challenges too well. I
                have already highlighted our determination to focus on poverty
                and social exclusion, but our work must also reflect
                responsibilities to promote good relations within and between
                communities. We also need to be aware of wider environmental
                issues and ensure that the principle of sustainable development
                underpins everything that we do.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The position report, which Members will be
                considering in Committees in the weeks ahead, recognises the
                importance of ensuring that the Programme for Government
                reflects the economic, social and environmental challenges that
                we face. It provides an appropriate, relevant and evidence-based
                policy framework for decisions on financial allocations and for
                departmental work programmes. To that end, the Programme for
                Government must set out a thorough analysis of the context in
                which we work.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report also needs to explore, and seeks
                views on, the Executive’s priorities and sub-priorities. It is
                important that the priorities we set reflect and keep pace with
                the changing environment. The current priorities, which have
                received broad support here and from social partners, continue
                to provide a useful framework for our work. However, we want to
                explore ways in which we might refine our overall economic and
                social strategies.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Executive are not solely content with
                setting out a work programme for the years ahead. We are also
                committed to maintaining a focus on measuring results and
                assessing impact. Our first two programmes have sought not only
                to explain the policy priorities that we have identified, but
                have also clearly set out the actions that we will take to
                deliver those priorities and the sub-priorities that support
                them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have gone further. The priorities
                incorporate public service agreements (PSAs) that aim to set out
                targets reflecting the key outcomes that Departments want to
                achieve with the resources voted to them by the Assembly. The
                PSAs are, in turn, supported by service delivery agreements (SDAs)
                for each Department, which explain the actions that each
                Department will take in order to deliver its Programme for
                Government commitments and PSA targets and to raise standards.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Open and accountable government is, and
                should be, a defining characteristic of the Executive. We want
                to be responsive, to listen to the views of others and to ensure
                that the Assembly and the public can see the benefits that a
                locally accountable Executive can deliver for the people of
                Northern Ireland. The position report, therefore, seeks views on
                current arrangements for measuring results and the effectiveness
                of those arrangements.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To further underline that commitment to open
                and accountable government, we will shortly be bringing a full
                report on the progress made during the first year of our
                programme to the Assembly. It will provide information on the
                actions contained in the programme and the targets in the 11
                departmental PSAs. We will also be making the report more widely
                available so that the public can assess our progress.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are also determined that the programme
                should continue to reflect our responsibility to promote
                equality of opportunity and good relations. The position report,
                therefore, seeks views on the equality aspects of the issues
                that we have raised and how those can best be taken into account
                as we develop the Programme for Government and the Budget.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Today’s statement does not only provide a
                starting point for the Assembly’s consideration of the
                position report; it also represents the start of a process of
                wider consultation on those issues. It is crucial that we have
                the views of the Assembly on the issues raised in the report.
                But in keeping with the theme of partnership that I mentioned,
                it is worth noting that we also recognise the value of a wider
                debate. For that reason, we intend to make the position report
                more widely available following this statement, sharing it with
                our social partners and our colleagues in local government and
                with other interested organisations and individuals.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The position report sets out the timescale
                for providing views on the issues that it raises. We will need
                comments from Committees on issues that relate to the Programme
                for Government before the end of August. As was the case last
                year, the Committee for Finance and Personnel will co-ordinate
                the comments on the associated resource issues, and we will be
                seeking those comments before the end of July. We look forward,
                of course, to receiving the views of Assembly Committees and of
                individual MLAs.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have outlined some of the key issues that
                we must address as we develop the Executive’s Programme for
                Government. The Deputy First Minister will now elaborate on some
                of those matters, particularly those that relate to the
                financial context in which we operate.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy First Minister (Mr Durkan):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the First Minister’s statement,
                and I will develop some of the themes that he covered in his
                opening remarks. In particular, I would like to focus on the
                financial context in which we find ourselves and on the resource
                issues that the Executive have highlighted in their position
                report on the Programme for Government and the Budget for
                2003-04 and beyond.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Budget that was agreed by the Assembly in
                December 2001 set &quot;indicative minima&quot; figures for
                Departments for 2003-04. By holding back some £125 million of
                available spending power at that time, we retained the option of
                making changes in our expenditure programmes to reflect local
                needs and priorities and to maintain a significant degree of
                flexibility.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Aside from the money that remains unallocated
                from the Chancellor’s Budget, we are committed to maximising
                other immediate sources of funding available for allocation to
                services. For this Budget cycle and for the longer term, we are
                taking important action to improve the quality of public
                services and get better value from the resources available to
                us. That includes the needs and effectiveness evaluations, which
                are being carried out in health and social care, education,
                housing, training and vocational education, financial assistance
                to industry and culture, arts and leisure. Those six areas
                account for about 75% of planned public expenditure here.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Important issues must also be addressed in
                agriculture, regional transportation, water and sewerage
                services, long-term unemployment and the work of the
                employability task force, hospital services and the review of
                post-primary education. The Executive are scheduled to receive
                evaluations on those major areas of work in the next couple of
                months.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The evaluations will also be important for
                informing the Executive as they make funding decisions about the
                2002 Budget. Although changing strategic direction or skewing
                resources to new areas of expenditure takes time and careful
                planning, the Executive are determined to make a real difference
                and to reshape public expenditure to support key priorities.
                Reports from each study will be made available to the Assembly
                and more widely.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The First Minister referred to the
                reinvestment and reform initiative or RRI, which will provide a
                unique opportunity for a substantial infrastructure investment
                programme. Many of our services, especially health, education
                and transport, require levels of capital investment far in
                excess of the available resources if they are to be funded in
                the traditional manner.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">From 2004-05, a new borrowing power will give
                the Executive and the next Assembly the option of using
                additional revenue sources. That will make possible a
                multibillion-pound programme for the coming decade and beyond to
                address our most acute infrastructure needs.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those resources will help to meet a pressing
                need, but money alone will not produce the scale of change that
                the Executive are seeking. It will be just as important to take
                a highly innovative approach to managing and financing the
                infrastructure programme, so that resources will be used wisely
                and will complement our existing programmes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Executive have decided to create a new
                organisation in the form of a strategic investment body to
                ensure that strategic infrastructure is planned and delivered in
                a way that makes the most of all the available means and
                resources. It is intended that the strategic investment body
                should have the necessary expertise and resources to serve the
                Executive’s programme of strategic capital investment. By
                using the new body, the Executive hope to provide the best
                possible opportunities to promote the effective use of all the
                various means available.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">11.45 am</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">More work is required to settle the detailed
                arrangements for that body. As a first step towards securing the
                best possible approach, we have invited our Executive Colleagues
                to nominate representatives to a project board. That board,
                which will work closely with an Executive subcommittee to scope
                the way ahead, will be asked to work within a tight timetable.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If Northern Ireland is to be a better and
                more prosperous place in which to live and work, the means of
                delivering the priority commitments in the Programme for
                Government must be established on a sound and equitable basis.
                The rating policy review examines the appropriate distribution
                of the revenue burden between households and businesses, and in
                each sector. The review will address the inequities and
                anomalies of the current system in order to produce a fairer and
                more equitable one. That will be of fundamental importance,
                should the future Executive and the next Assembly choose from
                2004-05 onwards to raise more finance locally to fund
                reinvestment in our infrastructure through the borrowing power.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The First Minister, the other Ministers and I
                have often been asked in the Assembly to address the shortfall
                in public services by securing bonds or increasing our block
                baselines. The short-term position can be addressed by
                negotiating that package. We must now decide the extent to which
                we want to avail of the borrowing power. That decision must be
                based on priorities. Aside from our own sources of revenue, we
                shall explore all possible means of financing and providing
                affordable public services that deliver value for money and
                provide effective solutions to meet our needs. The use of
                public-private partnerships (PPPs) is a possible means of
                addressing the needs of our public services. Other options are
                provided by the creation of the strategic investment body and
                the possible use of borrowing financed by local revenues. In
                that new context we have examined all options carefully and
                objectively to develop a clear policy and to learn from national
                and international experiences. We will consider carefully the
                responses to the Financing Our Future consultation exercise
                before settling an Executive policy on PPPs, and so forth.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Against that background, the position report
                highlights various issues that must be addressed as we begin to
                develop the Programme for Government and the Budget for 2003-04
                and beyond. The Executive are determined to make a difference
                through the services and policies for which they are
                responsible. We want to break away from approaches that are no
                longer effective or relevant to the best interests of this
                community. Not surprisingly, despite a recent trend of rising
                spending in real terms, spending pressures have intensified. We
                must face up to significant backlogs in investment and the great
                demand on some programmes. For that reason we have emphasised in
                the position report the need to consider seriously and
                extensively the scope for reprioritising spending. We must focus
                more carefully and effectively on the Administration’s top
                priorities, the region’s most strategic requirements and the
                most pressing needs of our community.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The position report concludes with a short
                summary of the strategic issues faced by each Department. The
                summary highlights the many substantial demands being made on
                future spending power, together with a host of useful and
                desirable purposes for which additional resources could be
                allocated. However, many of the departmental pressures outlined
                in the report and in the individual position reports provided by
                Departments to their corresponding Committees will have to be
                absorbed through reprioritisation in a departmental budget, or
                simply not be met. Nevertheless, as we move to develop our
                Programme for Government and Budget, we must consider some of
                the strategic issues faced by the Executive.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In agriculture, key challenges include
                progressing the work of the vision group and ensuring that
                Northern Ireland’s views are represented effectively in
                negotiations on the reform of the common agricultural policy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In education, consideration must be given to
                the future reorganisation of post-primary education following
                the Burns review, though we do not expect that there will be any
                significant expenditure implications in the 2002 Budget. Other
                strategic studies to be either concluded or undertaken in that
                timescale include a curriculum review and an assessment of the
                local management of schools (LMS) common funding formula.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a need to implement strategies to
                address long-term unemployment, to improve adult literacy and to
                meet the changing skills needs of the local economy. We must
                enable the economy to respond and to increase employment through
                business expansion and inward investment. Increased
                participation in education and training, especially by those at
                the bottom of the economic and social ladder, can have
                significant economic and social impact. Progress has been made
                locally on that through the student support review, but more
                must be done, not least in further education.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The creation of Invest Northern Ireland (INI)
                provides new opportunities for us to facilitate the development
                of large and small businesses that can compete and win business
                in global markets and in the face of changing consumer demands.
                However, INI will face several strategic and operational
                pressures as it seeks to implement new strategies and to
                establish new relationships and methods of operation,
                particularly in the areas of innovation and entrepreneurship.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our agenda for modernising the devolved
                Administration and improving the efficiency and effectiveness of
                public service delivery is also wide and challenging. Key
                initiatives will be developed and implemented in the areas of
                public procurement, Government office accommodation and
                e-government. We will also implement the review of public
                administration and determine our policy framework for
                public-private partnerships following the current consultation
                exercise.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Health and personal social services continue
                to demand our attention. The acute hospitals review and the
                measures needed to address capacity problems in the acute
                sector, including winter pressures and waiting lists, remain the
                most significant issues. The Minister of Health, Social Services
                and Public Safety will shortly issue a consultation paper on the
                proposed way forward.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must introduce a large volume of EU
                environmental Directives to Northern Ireland legislation and
                implement them through monitoring and enforcement. If the risk
                of infraction proceedings is to be reduced, it is essential for
                work on EU Directives to be further advanced. We also want to
                modernise the planning framework to ensure that that development
                takes place in line with the principles of sustainable
                development and that it can contribute to a quality environment
                and meet economic and social aspirations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The regional development strategy has
                outlined the strategic planning framework for the spatial
                development of Northern Ireland and is designed to shape our
                social, economic and environmental well-being between now and
                2025. The ten-year regional transportation strategy is an
                important component of the regional development strategy.
                Consultation on the proposed transportation strategy was
                recently completed, and we must consider its implications.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Key challenges for the Water Service include
                the development of a leakage strategy and a water efficiency
                plan. Considerable investment in water and sewerage
                infrastructure is needed to secure a proper service for the
                public. That will also ensure that we comply with EU Directives
                on water quality and waste water standards.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To fulfil our social agenda, we will continue
                to drive forward the welfare reform and modernisation programme,
                keeping pace with similar developments in Great Britain. In line
                with targets in the Programme for Government, strategies for
                neighbourhood renewal, the Belfast regeneration initiative and
                regional town centre reinvigoration are emerging.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We also want to focus on culture, arts and
                leisure issues, including consideration of the future role of
                the public library service. Several reviews have been planned
                during the 2002 Budget period, including an examination of
                museums and galleries and a community arts review.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Office of the First Minister and the
                Deputy First Minister will implement several strategic measures.
                They include the arrangements for the appointment of a
                commissioner for children and young people; a children’s
                strategy; a new community relations strategy; and work to
                implement the commitments and actions identified in the victims
                strategy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that those remarks have helped to
                contextualise the important work that the Assembly will
                undertake in the summer when it scrutinises and reviews the
                Executive position report. We accept that the timetable is
                tight, but that is a necessity. However, as the First Minister
                made clear, it is important that there be debate in Committees
                and between Members on the issues that the position report
                highlights. It is also important that this debate translate into
                comments and suggestions that can inform the Executive’s work
                in the coming months so that the Programme for Government and
                the Budget can be developed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The First Minister mentioned the Programme
                for Government’s role in building the basis of a new
                democratic society. The philosopher John Dewey said that
                &quot;democracy is born in conversation&quot;. Conversation and
                debate are needed in the Assembly and elsewhere. We assure
                Members that Ministers, their Departments and the Executive will
                consider carefully their comments and suggestions. Those
                comments will be used to inform the Programme for Government and
                the Budget for 2003-04 and beyond.</p>

                available to Members, an explanation will be given to the

                to all MLAs this morning. The statement was delayed because of
                the long bank holiday weekend, which meant that the final
                revisions were done early this morning. I had the final revision
                in my hand only 10 minutes before making the statement. I am

                do they propose to spend that nest egg?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The First Minister:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are monitoring rounds at various times
                of the year, depending on departmental expenditures. With regard
                to a nest egg, the only thing to which I can refer the Member is
                the table on page 21 of the Executive position report. That
                table sets out how we arrive at the baseline, and the
                significant figure that refers to the Chancellor’s Budget
                additions is at the bottom of the table. Those Barnett-related
                additions have become available as a result of the Budget, but
                have not yet been allocated formally.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Budget that the Assembly agreed in
                December 2001 set indicative minimal figures for Departments.
                That involved holding back sufficient funds at the start of
                Budget 2002 to provide a clear starting point for the Budget and
                an opportunity to address local priorities. We adopted that
                approach in anticipation of limited increases in public
                expenditure so that we could retain some flexibility. The
                Executive have recognised that it may be necessary to restore
                some of the amounts that have been held back, but resources are
                not available to restore all those amounts.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No nice gloss can be put on this bad news
                story for Northern Ireland today. It means taking a scalpel to
                Departments and cutting back resources. Ten million pounds will
                be cut from the Housing Executive and £9 million will be cut
                from public transport. Despite there being a rates increase,
                £4·4 million will be cut from local government services and
                £21 million will be cut from the budget for recurrent schools’
                problems. It is little wonder that there are 100 redundant
                schoolteachers in my North Antrim constituency.</p>

                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wish to consider the policies and resource
                issues identified under the section for the Department of
                Agriculture and Rural Development. Again, as regards policy,
                there is no agreed version of rural proofing, which is very
                disappointing — the Department has had some time to put that
                in place. There is a proposed overall decrease of £8·8 million
                and that will affect the two most important areas: rural
                development, which will be cut by £1 million; and food and
                farming. Are those cuts not inconsistent with the Department of
                Agriculture and Rural Development’s stated aims? The cuts will
                have an immediate impact on 40% of the population. More than 40%
                of the population lives in rural areas, and yet the rural
                development programme is being reduced.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am also disappointed to see that the
                Government are —</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yes. The Government have shown that the
                vision group needs resources, but no resources have been
                identified for it. I am also disappointed that there has been a
                change in the language used. The first statement mentioned an
                end to the beef export ban —</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Madam Deputy Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Order. I realise that the Member has already
                asked two questions. If he has a third question, I would like
                him to ask it instead of making a statement.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Paisley Jnr:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am coming to the question. Will the First
                Minister and the Deputy First Minister explain why there has
                been a change in language between their first statement, which
                considered the issue of an end to the beef export ban, and the
                current report, which calls for a relaxation of the ban? Why has
                there been a change in the language used? Are they no longer
                committed to achieving an end to the beef export ban?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Madam Deputy Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Order. The Member has asked the three
                questions.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy First Minister:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I return to the Deputy Speaker’s question
                of why our statement was not available. Preparing and clearing
                joint statements is more difficult for the First Minister and me
                than it is for individual Ministers because we must agree who
                will make certain points so as to minimise repetition and
                maximise complementarity. It is also important to remember that
                the Executive position report came before the Assembly only last
                week. The Assembly receives the report from the Executive hot
                off the presses, which really is a sign of just how transparent
                the new arrangements are. What is being published is exactly
                what came before the Executive.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not know how many times we shall have to
                explain the nature of the exercise to the Member and the people
                in his party. This is a position report, drawn from Departments’
                assessments of their priorities and pressures. The Departments
                have consulted and engaged with Committees already, and there
                will now be significant consultation with Committees. This
                report is in advance of Budget planning; we are setting out the
                issues before the draft Budget in September.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to the Member’s nonsense about
                proposed cuts to various programmes, I refer him to what the
                First Minister and I said about the indicative minima set out in
                last year’s Budget. The indicative Budget for 2003-04, which
                we introduced in December 2001, set indicative minima so that we
                would not commit all the resources in the indicative Budget for
                2003-04.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Who told us not to automatically commit all
                the money to the Departments because that would make them think
                that they need not do anything? Members told us that. Members
                told us to take £10 million from every Department to make more
                money available for priorities. We managed to take £125 million
                from the indicative Budget for priorities, including, possibly,
                the priorities that the Member mentioned. Who agreed with that
                approach to indicative minima? All the Ministers agreed to
                taking £125 million from next year’s Budget so that it could
                be available for what would then be our priorities, after full
                consultation by the Executive, the Committees and the Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is a good government story, not a bad
                news story.</p>

                First Minister for presenting the report; however, the Members
                did not see their comprehensive statement beforehand. I welcome
                their comments that we need time to examine and debate the
                report. We must consider properly the many serious and
                fundamental questions that it poses, and both Ministers invited
                the Committees and the Departments to do so. I look forward to
                taking that opportunity.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The needs and effectiveness evaluations

                conclusions of those evaluations, which will determine Members’
                budgetary considerations and the financial implications?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">How do the First Minister and the Deputy
                First Minister envisage the operation of the strategic
                investment body? The agency is a welcome development, but who
                will hold the decision-making power? Will it lie with the
                Executive, or could it be held by the strategic investment body,
                which would not be fully democratic?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The First Minister:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Member for acknowledging that the
                report was available, although Members may have found it a
                challenge to absorb its 141 pages in the time that was available
                before the statement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We presented the report as quickly as
                possible to maximise the time in which to debate it. The report
                was presented to the Executive only last week. Time is
                constrained by the Budget timetable: we shall not know the
                outcome of the spending review 2002 until July, and we shall
                have to start to take decisions on the Budget in September or
                October.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The timescale for needs and effectiveness
                studies will be constrained also. The studies are in their final
                stages and will be discussed by the Administration, among the
                Departments, and between the Deputy First Minister, the relevant
                Ministers and myself, culminating in decisions by the Executive.
                We shall then have to consider the budgetary implications. The
                timescale will, therefore, be extremely tight, but the
                Administration will want to have the broadest possible
                discussion — internally and with others.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are well aware of the sensitivities that
                Mr Maskey highlighted as regards the strategic investment body,
                and he is not alone in raising those points. Another party,
                which takes a slightly detached position with regard to the
                Administration, raised the same issues. That is partly why we
                have invited the parties that participate in the Administration
                to nominate Members to the project board of the strategic
                investment body. We are glad that parties have made nominations,
                and we hope that their involvement will enable the strategic
                investment board to proceed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The strategic investment body will be crucial
                to the delivery of the Administration’s programme — the key
                word is &quot;delivery&quot;. It will seek solutions to
                financial problems. The Executive will make decisions on the
                programmes and priorities, while the strategic investment body
                will exist to seek solutions, and to implement and deliver them.
                The practice of that structure remains to be seen.</p>

                more often that Members are obliged to respond to a statement

                reason suggested for the delay by the Deputy First Minister is
                wrong; that it was due to a lack of agreement as to what they
                would say. I hope that that was not the real reason. No doubt he
                will correct me if I am wrong.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the statement, the Office of the First
                Minister and the Deputy First Minister correctly states the need
                to identify more closely the reforms that might be required and
                the outcomes that might be achieved from such reforms. I welcome
                that. I want to know when the Executive propose to give Members
                some idea of what outcomes are proposed from the different
                reforms. For example, as regards the review of public
                administration, are the Executive aiming towards the type of
                resources that could be released from a proper review of public
                administration? I could repeat that comment with respect to the
                other ongoing reviews, such as on procurement et cetera. It
                would be useful to have a quantifiable figure that we knew was
                possible to achieve through saving and making better use of
                resources.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My understanding is that needs and
                effectiveness evaluations act as a tool to advise the Executive
                on policy and priorities. As they have not yet been completed, I
                have difficulty in knowing exactly what value to place on a
                document that develops the Programme for Government. If we are
                not yet sure about the outcome of the needs and effectiveness
                evaluation, there may be some flaws in the document. Perhaps the
                First Minister and the Deputy First Minister could elucidate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My final question refers to the reinvestment
                and reform initiative. Will the First Minister and the Deputy
                First Minister assure the House that negotiations are ongoing
                with the Treasury to ensure that we are not getting a pig in a
                poke, and that these gift horses will not have bad breath and
                cause problems in future years with our departmental expenditure
                limits across Departments through capital charges, cost
                depreciation and the cost of making good?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy First Minister:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was always warned not to look gift horses
                in the mouth; now, I seem to be being advised to smell them in
                the mouth.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The delay was not a result of disagreement as
                to what was to be said, we were trying to ensure that we have a
                reasonably coherent and balanced statement. In answering the
                questions, the key point is the position report itself. In our
                statement, we have summarised and highlighted aspects of the
                position report and not used any different inflections other
                than those in the position report itself.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member asked several questions. We hope
                to have stage one of the review of public administration
                completed by next March. In many ways, work in stage one will
                determine whether we can indicate amounts of money that might be
                saved or the targets that should be put in place. Given that
                many in the House said that they wanted the review to have as
                much independence as possible and not be dictated to or
                constrained simply by Ministers and the Executive, we did not
                think it appropriate, or a good basis, to fix an amount of money
                that we wanted to save, or outline a particular way. The review
                of public administration is an open review. I am glad that
                people want to ensure that that review leaves us in a situation
                where less money is spent on structures and systems and more of
                our public expenditure goes to services.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We definitely want to achieve that, and it
                was one of the underlying motives behind the review.</p>

                the Treasury on. We shall not make any headway with the Treasury
                if we do not start to play our part in the initiative and to
                take advantage of our opportunities. That includes setting up
                the strategic investment body that will provide financing

                needs as we can. We are engaged in developing the Programme for
                Government, and in sharing it with the Assembly and the public.
                It is an ongoing reform. The position report is a pre-draft

                community interests. As far as key community interests are
                concerned, it is an exercise in joined-up government, joined-in

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Executive’s position report states that
                the Executive are scheduled to receive five of the needs and
                effectiveness evaluations in June and July, and we are already
                in June. Will the First Minister or the Deputy First Minister
                say which evaluations will be reporting this month, so that
                Members can do some work before the recess? The deadline will be
                the end of August or September, and we must have the evaluations

                &quot;representative&quot; mean? Does that mean an MLA, a party
                member, a Minister or someone else? If democracy is based on
                having conversations — to paraphrase the John Dewey comments
                at the end of the Deputy First Minister’s statement — why is
                it limited to representatives of the Executive parties, given
                the difficulties that the Executive face in getting
                collaboration from all the parties on it?</p>

                report to the Civic Forum. Our concluding comments showed that
                we want to distribute the position report as widely as possible.
                The object of the exercise is to develop discussion and debate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The position report gives Colleagues a
                snapshot of the position immediately before the Chancellor makes
                his decisions on the spending review 2002, so that it will be
                easier for them to work out what the possible impact of the

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The needs and effectiveness studies are being

                June, and that the deadline will not become July.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms McWilliams will gather from my remarks
                that we expect to get the reports soon. Significant discussion
                and debate will then have to take place within the
                Administration, and we shall have to consider precisely how to
                act on the reports.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We were not prescriptive about who the
                parties should nominate to the project board of the strategic
                investment body. We approached the parties in the Administration
                because the implementation of the decisions that are made,
                departmentally and collectively, will relate to the
                Administration’s work. It is entirely open to the parties
                concerned to make nominations. I think that I am right when I
                say that we have received three such nominations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We were not prescriptive because we wanted
                the board to be open to a party, it if wishes, to nominate
                someone who has particular expertise in financial matters —
                financing programmes et cetera. It will be open to parties to
                nominate an MLA, if they so wish. We do not consider that
                failure to do so will in any way detract from accountability to
                the Assembly. Ministers will make decisions, and they are
                accountable to the Assembly. The strategic investment body will
                examine the most cost-effective way to deliver those decisions
                and solutions. That will require a degree of expertise, but it
                will also require the parties in the Executive to work together,
                which is why we look to them to form the basis of the project
                board.</p>

                also welcome their intention to have an innovative approach to
                managing and financing the infrastructure programme, and note
                that a similar approach has been adopted south of the border.
                Can we be assured of collaboration?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy First Minister:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs Courtney has made an important point by
                emphasising what must be done to manage infrastructure. We have
                often heard in the Chamber about the historic deficit that we
                have inherited with regard to investment in infrastructure and
                other key public service fabrics. That is one of the reasons why
                we negotiated a package with the Prime Minister and the
                Chancellor that will allow us to undertake significant
                investment programmes. As that involves our capacity to
                undertake capital expenditure far in excess of what would have
                been possible under existing funding lines and current patterns,
                it is right that we look at an innovative way to manage that new
                level of expenditure and consider a strong means of driving
                investment on such a scale. For that reason, we opted for the
                concept of a strategic investment body. By coincidence, people
                came up with the idea of establishing a similar body in the
                South to drive a significant infrastructure investment programme
                — proof that great minds think alike. Taking advantage of
                facilities such as the common chapter and using the devices
                available to us through the North/South Ministerial Council, it
                is right to compare notes where possible, and to co-ordinate
                investments and co-operate where we can. That is particularly
                fitting, given that both bodies will want to consider not only
                how they can use the moneys from managed public expenditure, but
                to see what other moneys can be levered in from elsewhere. Such
                money might come from not only the domestic private sector but
                from further afield. It would make sense for the two bodies to
                know what each other is doing and to ensure that our strategic
                investment plans, especially for infrastructure on the entire
                island, complement each other and are well co-ordinated and well
                matched to ensure that everyone gets the best possible return on
                that significant investment opportunity.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Dr William McCrea:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is not surprising, given the cuts
                suggested in the report, that the First Minister and the Deputy
                First Minister did not release the statement before the debate.
                I trust that Members will have picked up on the details of the
                report’s figures, in respect of the potential disastrous
                impact on support to district council resource grants if the
                figures are reflected in the final Budget. The combination of
                not carrying forward the 2002-03 grant levels and the impact of
                the indicative minima would represent a drop in overall grant
                from £20 million to £13·6 million in 2003-04.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have the unanimous support of the Committee
                for the Environment when I say that such a cut would undoubtedly
                have a major impact on district rates and on the services
                available in many district council areas. As resource grants
                only apply to the poorest councils, I ask the First Minister and
                the Deputy First Minister to explain the justice of such cuts,
                as they blatantly contradict the Executive’s policy of
                targeting social need. Will the Ministers give a commitment to
                the House to re-examine the issue as soon as possible? A
                sizeable increase in the £105 million to the Department of the
                Environment would be marginal in the Northern Ireland block
                grant of some £7 billion, but would have a significant impact
                on the protection of the environment. The First Minister and the
                Deputy First Minister should seriously examine those issues.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The First Minister:</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are aware that there are problems on
                councils, especially on environmental issues that arise from EU
                Directives. The position report provides for a general resources
                grant, which consists of a derating element compensating for
                loss of rate income due to the derating of properties, and a
                resources element. In the latter part, a total of £50 million
                has been allocated for distribution in 2002-03, determined by a
                statutory formula.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, the Member must bear in mind the
                indicative minima that the Deputy First Minister explained in
                his first response. They involved an initial withholding of
                £125 million across the Departments. If I remember correctly,
                it is the Member’s ministerial Colleague who has talked about
                the need to pare and, indeed, withhold more money from
                Departments. One must question the consistency in those matters.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As the Member knows, this is a progress

                in rearing young children. In Northern Ireland, 17% of
                households have at least one child under the age of six. That
                equates to 120,000 people who are parents of a young child or of
                a child with a disability. Those parents have a key role to play
                in the economy, as their children will one day.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It should not be necessary for anyone to feel
                that they have to choose between being a good parent and being a
                good employee. The Employment Bill addresses the real-life
                problems of work and parenting. It introduces a series of
                measures designed to help employees balance their family and
                employment responsibilities while taking account of the need for
                businesses to compete in an increasingly competitive market.
                Specifically, the Bill provides for new rights to paid time off
                for fathers and adoptive parents, extends the amount of paid and
                unpaid leave available to new mothers, and gives a new right for
                parents of young children to request flexible working
                conditions. These measures mirror provisions in the Employment
                Bill currently before Parliament at Westminster and will ensure
                that our employers and employees have the same family-friendly
                employment rights as are enjoyed by their Great Britain
                counterparts.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Other related measures, such as revised
                paternity pay arrangements that correspond to social security
                provisions in the GB Employment Bill, are included in the social
                security Bill being brought forward by the Department for Social
                Development.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department for Employment and Learning
                carried out extensive public consultation on the proposals in
                the Bill, and they received widespread support. A summary of the
                responses received is on the Department’s web site.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Social inclusion and equality of opportunity
                are at the heart of the Executive’s Programme for Government.
                Advancing the social inclusion agenda is also a key priority for
                my Department, and I am pleased to say that an assessment of the
                equality impact of the proposals in the Employment Bill has
                confirmed that they will have a positive impact on promoting
                equality of opportunity. For example, they will enable single
                parents to participate more fully at work by recognising the
                particular difficulties that they face. I am sure Members will
                join me in welcoming this.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We need to avoid, where possible, imposing
                burdens on businesses. There will be some costs to employers,
                for instance, in setting up systems to administer the new
                arrangements and facilitate requests for flexible working, but
                there will also be advantages. Members will be aware of the
                difficulty for businesses of recruiting and retaining skilled
                staff. Research carried out by the Chartered Institute of
                Personnel and Development reveals that the cost to an employer
                of filling a vacancy is, on average, £3,500. To lose a trained
                and skilled person because no effort was made to try to
                accommodate his parenting responsibilities does not make good
                business sense.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Work-Life Balance campaign managed by the
                Department for Employment and Learning has demonstrated the
                benefits to business of enabling employees to achieve and
                maintain a better balance between work and other aspects of
                their lives. Employers are discovering for themselves the
                wide-ranging benefits from working with employees to find
                mutually agreeable solutions tailored to particular
                circumstances. Businesses that do that tend to attract talented
                people, and they have a more motivated workforce with reduced
                stress and sick leave and a lower staff turnover. These are the
                very real benefits as a consequence of addressing employees’
                needs as a whole, not just at the workplace.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will take a few moments to comment on the
                core elements of the Bill. With regard to paternity leave and
                pay, the Bill provides for a new right to two weeks’ paid
                paternity leave following the arrival of a new child. That will
                allow new fathers more time to care for the child and build a
                relationship with the child and offer support to the mother. The
                payment mechanism will be standardised with that of maternity
                pay, thus making for simplicity. In Northern Ireland, around
                12,000 employed fathers will qualify each year for the new
                right. However, many employers already voluntarily provide paid
                paternity leave. The costs associated with paternity leave will
                be low for most employers, as the majority will be reimbursed.
                As with maternity and adoption pay, businesses qualifying for
                small employer’s relief may recoup 100% of paternity leave
                pay, plus an additional 5% compensation for administration
                costs.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bill has the effect of simplifying the
                arrangements for maternity leave. That was a key priority for
                employers — particularly small employers — who responded to
                the public consultation. Most of the changes will be implemented
                by subordinate legislation. Ordinary maternity leave will be
                extended from 18 weeks to 26 weeks with the option of additional
                unpaid maternity leave of 26 weeks. Members will welcome
                anything that can be done to make the system easier for women
                and their employers to understand. Increasing the amount of
                leave available to new mothers will provide them with greater
                choice about when to return to work. Enabling mothers to take a
                longer time off work allows them to return when they are
                stronger, and it allows them more time to secure appropriate
                childcare arrangements. At the margin, that will enable some
                mothers to remain in employment, with recruitment and training
                savings for their employers. Detailed arrangements for the
                changes will be set out in the Regulations, but it is
                appropriate to mention them now in the context of the suite of
                measures planned to support working parents.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For the first time, under the provisions of
                the Bill, adoptive parents will have the right to paid time off
                work to care for their children. The introduction of paid
                adoption leave is a valuable step in recognising the important
                role that adoptive parents play. An adoptive parent will be able
                to take 26 weeks’ paid leave and 26 weeks’ unpaid leave,
                which is the same as women on maternity leave. As with maternity
                and paternity pay, small employers will recoup 100% of adoption
                pay plus additional compensation for administration costs.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to flexible working, I have
                already commented on the need to ensure that the world of work
                allows people to combine home and employment responsibilities.
                Flexible working arrangements are viewed as a potential means of
                relieving pressures that arise from trying to combine family
                life and work. I feel strongly that flexible working has a role
                to play in enhancing working arrangements in Northern Ireland. I
                am pleased to note that the majority of responses to the
                consultation agreed with the proposal to legislate to give
                parents of young children the right to request flexible working
                conditions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have said that I appreciate that employers
                may have concerns about the potential financial burden that the
                measures may entail, and I accept that there will be some costs
                for employers in processing applications and accommodating
                requests. Businesses that have not yet explored the potential of
                flexible working hours will need time to familiarise themselves
                with the processes involved in considering requests from staff.
                Small businesses, in particular, will need assistance in
                implementing the proposals. I intend to ensure that my
                Department addresses their needs through the provision of
                comprehensive guidance.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is difficult to estimate the extent of
                likely uptake of the right to seek flexible working hours. I
                fully expect costs to reduce significantly as the principles of
                a work/life balance become imbedded in our business culture. I
                anticipate that such practices will become commonplace as
                employers adapt to the needs of modern society. The availability
                of the new right may well contribute to the development of
                innovative ways of working, rather than always accepting
                traditional practices. For example, new technology provides
                rapidly increasing opportunities for different approaches.
                Change is an inevitable process in all our lives, and it should
                be welcomed, not feared.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A change of mindset should be encouraged in
                business, with employers being open to new ways of organising
                work and using new technology. Communication between employers,
                managers and employees is a key component to good employment
                relations. The new flexible working conditions do not oblige
                employers to introduce flexible working arrangements. I
                recognise that some small firms may find it impossible to
                accommodate such requests. However, employers are being asked to
                consider carefully the possibility of meeting the requests of
                staff. The employee has a duty to consider how the employer
                might accommodate the request for flexible working without any
                detrimental impact on the business. That is where dialogue, good
                employment relationships and open communication between
                employers, managers and employees are vital. Ultimately, the
                Bill must be viewed not only from the narrow perspective of its
                impact on employment rights, but in the wider social context of
                its potential to contribute to a better society in Northern
                Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I firmly believe that businesses must address
                work/life balance issues if they are to succeed in the modern
                economy. Providing support for working parents is not only about
                retaining their skills and experience in the workforce, it also
                creates more opportunity for mothers and fathers to spend more
                time with their children at key points in their lives. As a
                working mother, I know only too well the challenges that parents
                face as they try to reconcile their home responsibilities with
                the demands of their professional lives. The Employment Bill
                will provide parents with greater choice, in turn leading to a
                more flexible, motivated workforce. I am confident that by
                encouraging employers to put the work/life balance on the
                agenda, the provisions of the Bill will contribute to Northern
                Ireland’s business moving forward in a modern, socially aware
                twenty-first century.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Committee for
                Employment and Learning (Dr Birnie):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am grateful for the opportunity to speak.
                There have been several Committee actions on issues addressed in
                the Bill. For example, in a letter to the Minister on 21
                January, we stated that the Committee was broadly in agreement
                with proposals outlined in the Work and Parents Taskforce’s
                ‘About Time: Flexible Working’ report, produced for the
                Department of Trade and Industry in London. The Committee also
                had no objections to Statutory Rule 135/2002, the Maternity and
                Parental Leave etc. (Amendment No. 2) Regulations (Northern
                Ireland) 2002, which enabled parents of children born or placed
                for adoption up to five years before 15 December 1999 to take
                parental leave between now and 31 March 2005.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee notes the broad principles of
                the Employment Bill, which have been outlined by the Minister:
                first, the proposals to attempt to retain working parents in the
                labour market as a key element in the strategy; secondly, the
                commitment to a work/life balance, and thirdly, the proposal to
                introduce rights for working parents in Northern Ireland that
                will match those provided by the forthcoming Employment Bill in
                Great Britain.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I may have to declare an interest, as some of
                the issues have become of personal interest to me in the five
                weeks since I became a parent for the first time. Several MLAs
                and many others in the labour market could, and hopefully will,
                benefit from some of the provisions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some considerations that are likely to be
                taken at Committee Stage include the position of low-paid
                workers, self-employed workers and other non-employees, the
                costs of the provisions to other workers, and issues of possible
                discrimination. The Committee is also likely to consider the
                cost of the Employment Bill to employers. It wants to ensure
                that compliance costs for the corporate sector are kept as low
                as possible. Ideally, flexibility arrangements between parents
                and their employers should be made by mutual agreement. The
                regulatory touch should be light, as in the GB legislation. The
                Committee has also noted a new report, issued in May 2002 by the
                Better Regulation Task Force in London, which calls for a review
                of the overall effects of the employment legislation on firms.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee notes the parity with the
                Westminster Bill, which the Minister has rightly pointed out.
                The Department for Employment and Learning’s Employment Bill
                is intended to come into effect simultaneously with the GB
                Employment Bill on 6 April 2003. The provisions of the
                Department for Employment and Learning’s Bill correspond with
                clauses in the GB Bill with regard to paternity leave and
                adoption leave, statutory paternity pay and statutory adoption
                pay, administration and enforcement of pay, rights during and
                after paternity leave, and flexible working. Other provisions in
                the GB Bill are not included in this Bill. The Committee noted
                — as the Minister also pointed out — that the Department for
                Social Development’s social security Bill, which will be
                progressed simultaneously with the Employment Bill, includes
                provision for statutory maternity pay in relation to rate,
                period and entitlement, maternity allowance rate, work-focused
                interviews for partners, and use of information for or relating
                to employment training, all of which correspond to clauses in
                the GB Bill.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the opportunity of moving the Bill
                forward to Committee Stage.</p>

                the new father?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Birnie:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thank you.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dallat:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The issues outlined by the Minister are
                fundamental to building a society in which the rights of all
                workers are respected and protected by employment laws. Scenes
                of mothers who have not fully recovered from giving birth
                leaving carrycots at the homes of childminders in the early
                hours are inappropriate in a modern society. It is not fair to
                those mothers and it is not in the best interest of their
                children, whose umbilical cords have perhaps not yet healed.
                That can hardly represent the best circumstances for employers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The SDLP hopes that the Bill will address the
                difficulties that arise when parents have to cope with work and
                parenting, and believes that it will address some of the
                fundamental issues of equality of opportunity and social
                inclusion. However, my only concern is that the new legislation
                might impose an unfair burden on small and medium-sized
                businesses, which do not have the same resources as large
                organisations. We must be reassured that there will be
                advantages for those employers. I am pleased that the Minister
                has outlined some of those in her introductory remarks.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am particularly pleased that paternity
                leave has been built into the legislation. However, is two weeks’
                paid paternity leave sufficient for a father to contribute
                meaningfully to parenthood? What happens if the mother is
                suffering from post-natal depression and needs the father’s
                support for longer?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, maternity leave is the core issue.
                Although an extension from 18 weeks to 26 weeks is welcome —
                with an additional 26 weeks without pay included in the
                proposals — there is still inequality. That is particularly
                true of low-income and one-parent units. It is now better
                understood that differences between children with regard to
                academic achievement begin long before they reach school age.
                The Assembly must be mindful of that when provision is made for
                extended maternity leave, especially if children have special
                needs or are not born with a silver spoon in their mouth.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the greatest injustices done to
                working mothers in the last decade by some employers, especially
                some larger employers in the retail sector, has been to compel
                them to work antisocial hours when they should have been at home
                with their children. Does the Bill address that problem? Have
                the details been worked out? I ask again that small employers be
                fully supported when implementing the legislation so that they
                are not driven out, to the delight of the multinationals.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Employees should have every opportunity to
                update their training so that their work can be addressed in
                different ways. They should always be able to seek jobs that are
                more appropriate to their needs while they are parenting. I
                welcome the Minister’s statement, especially the recognition
                afforded to adoptive parents.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Can the Minister assure us that the Bill will
                genuinely advance the cause of equality and social inclusion
                among people who require it most? They are responsible for
                bringing the next generation into the world. The Government have
                a responsibility to address those people’s needs when they are
                most vulnerable and to protect them through legislation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bill is going in the right direction. I
                support the motion.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy Chairperson of the Committee for
                Employment and Learning (Mr Carrick):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Before I comment on the Second Stage of the
                Employment Bill, I must declare an interest in that my wife is
                an employer with a small retail business in the Craigavon area.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I recognise the positive aspects of the Bill,
                given the social contexts in which it is brought forward,
                especially modern domestic arrangements and the objective of
                establishing a more realistic work/life balance with the
                creation of family-friendly work practices. I also recognise the
                aspects that mark parity with legislation in other parts of the
                United Kingdom. However, having said that, other matters must be
                closely examined in the Committee Stage, because they could have
                an adverse effect on the performance and, indeed, the viability
                of some small businesses here. For instance, in March 2002 the
                final report on flexible working of the Work and Parents
                Taskforce said that</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Employers will have to manage the high
                number of requests for flexible working and will have to
                rearrange work patterns where parents are granted flexible
                working. That will impact on small businesses in particular,
                which usually have less flexibility than larger organisations.
                It is likely that there will be increased management costs both
                in dealing with requests, appeals and industrial tribunals and
                in managing work.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That highlights the increased costs. Indeed,
                the regulatory impact assessment shows that the total impact on
                employers here is estimated at between £1·6 million and £3·8
                million in recurring annual costs. There are additional start-up
                costs of between £200,000 and £800,000, so there will be
                additional overheads for small businesses here that they can ill
                afford.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee has already said that many
                small businesses and their proprietors are unpaid tax collectors
                already. They operate the Pay As You Earn (PAYE) scheme for
                National Insurance and income tax. Recently, the tax credit
                scheme was imposed on employers, and the operation of statutory
                sick pay and statutory maternity pay and the collection of
                student loan repayments are additional administrative burdens on
                the small employer. We must be careful that we do not impose the
                final straw that breaks the camel’s back.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister must listen carefully to what
                the small businesses say on the subject. They operate in a
                highly competitive world, and, in the global economy, they
                suffer from competition from multinationals. However, they are
                the backbone of Northern Ireland’s economy, and we do not want
                to impose additional burdens that will impact adversely on their
                ability to trade.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will the Minister elaborate on her statement,
                published in ‘The Irish News’ on Wednesday 29 May, that</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The costs in relation to the adoption,
                paternity and maternity provisions are not overly burdensome,
                and can be recouped in full by small businesses&quot;?</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The House should have her explanation of that
                statement on record.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will the Minister tell us what she thinks
                about the inequality of a system where people who look after
                young children have the right to request flexible working, but
                those who care for elderly parents or relatives do not? That
                issue is of particular concern, given that we have an ageing
                population. Does the Minister have plans to include paid leave
                for those who must look after a terminally ill family member,
                for example?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does the Minister have any plans to address
                the inequalities faced by the self-employed? Self-employed
                people have children and families too, yet there seems to be no
                provision in the Bill for them. How will they be gathered into
                the net?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These matters will be subjected to close
                scrutiny at the Committee Stage. Members of the Committee have
                asked questions during the discussions that led up to today’s
                debate. I trust that, when the Bill reaches Committee Stage, the
                Minister will take cognisance of the valid case that will be
                presented.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs Nelis:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.
                I welcome the Bill, although its title is something of a
                misnomer. The Bill concerns the equality rights of working
                parents, and it might have been better named &quot;The Parenting
                Employment Rights Bill&quot;. The Bill also concerns parity, and
                I have serious reservations about parity Bills. Contrary to what
                some Members may believe, we are not as British as Finchley, nor
                could social and economic circumstances here be compared to
                those in Finchley. Our situation is different in many ways. To
                begin with, I understand that our birth rate is the highest in
                Europe. Our social and economic structures are different.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That said, however, I welcome the broad
                principles of the Bill. It increases paid maternity leave for
                working mothers to 26 weeks, and provides two weeks’ paid
                paternity leave. I should have liked paternity leave to be
                extended, especially where more than one child is involved. I
                also welcome parity for natural and adoptive parents.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A LeasCheann Comhairle, in respect of
                flexible working requests, we could start with the Assembly and
                all Departments. The legislation could, however, be more
                specific and a little stronger. It allows parents of children
                under six years old to request flexible working, but not to
                compel its provision. The Bill does not state that employers
                must comply. I ask the Minister to explain what options have
                been considered for employers. Giving parents the right to work
                reduced hours for as long as they wish following maternity
                leave, and the payment of maternity pay directly to mothers,
                must be a step in the right direction, but the legislation is
                weighted heavily in the employer’s favour.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Neither does the Bill distinguish between
                small and large employers. It is not clear how small employers
                can recoup the administration costs involved. Will the
                additional burden on employers encourage discrimination against
                pregnant women in job opportunities? Those are serious
                questions, because the track record of discrimination against
                pregnant women has not been fully examined or properly recorded.
                The Bill is not clear about maternity and paternity leave for
                parents on training schemes or on fixed-term contracts.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Nevertheless, I welcome the Bill as a first
                step in the recognition of parental rights and the importance of
                creating a balance between work and home. It will certainly ease
                the anxiety of working parents during pregnancy, at childbirth
                and afterwards. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms McWilliams:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Bill with a sense of near
                déjà vu. So many of us who campaigned 25 years ago for such
                parental rights now face the Bill’s introduction when our
                children have grown up. It is important because many of us never
                thought that such legislation would see the light of day.
                Obstacles were put in its path, especially by employers who felt
                that increasing regulation was a burden to their business. It
                should not be seen in that way. Mr Carrick said that those
                points were made in 1970 against the introduction of the Equal
                Pay Act and in 1975 against the Sex Discrimination Act. It was
                argued that equal work for equal value would cripple businesses
                to the extent that they would go out of business. Far from it;
                we have been able to recruit and retain more women in business.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree with Mary Nelis that the Bill’s
                title is rather drab and is something that the Health Committee
                may consider revising. A problem with the devolved Assembly is
                that it gives innovative and original Bills generic titles that
                do not describe their intentions. Therefore, it would be
                interesting if Members could decide on a short title that truly
                explains that the Bill will legislate for parenting rights.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members referred to statutory maternity pay
                and the introduction of statutory adoption pay and statutory
                paternity pay. It may not have been possible for those who
                financially costed the Bill to include the reduction of
                statutory sick pay, but Members must consider it. Given that the
                proposed rights, especially 26 weeks of paid maternity leave,
                were not available in the past, employees took that time off as
                sick leave. Often, to get a certificate from their doctor that
                would allow them to claim statutory sick pay, they had to find
                an illness with symptoms similar to their own. I look forward to
                the days when such practice is no longer necessary. That measure
                may create a saving, although others may see it as a cost.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome that another saving has been
                recognised. There has been an annual reduction of £2·45
                million in recruitment costs due to the predicted increase in
                the number of mothers who return to work after pregnancy.
                Therefore, although there are costs, there are benefits. As we
                push through the legislation, it will be important for us to
                monitor whether statutory sick payments are reduced as a
                consequence.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have one concern. Will the Minister outline
                the practical reasons why those who choose intercountry
                adoptions are not entitled to the same rights as those who
                choose domestic adoptions? Members need to know those reasons in
                order to explain them to people who discover that they are not
                entitled to the same rights. The term &quot;intercountry
                adoptions&quot; is more applicable than the word
                &quot;abroad&quot;. The Health Committee recently considered
                legislation on intercountry adoptions, and it found that those
                adoptive parents do not see their children as coming from
                abroad.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that employers will comply with the
                legislation. The Equality Commission states that most complaints
                come from pregnant women who are not given their entitlement
                under current legislation. The Equality Commission says that it
                spends many hours dealing with such complaints, many of which
                result in tribunals. In order that the public and those who run
                small businesses are not overly alarmed by the introduction of
                such welcome legislation, will the Minister state when the
                comprehensive guidance will be available? It is important that
                it is available as soon as possible.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bill is welcome. I am pleased that the
                Assembly is finally recognising the role of all parents —
                natural and adoptive. For many years, those who could not have
                children and therefore adopted children, whom they reared as
                though they were their own, were not entitled to the same rights
                as natural parents. It is good that Northern Ireland has
                introduced real rights for adoptive parents.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Hanna:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members have referred to a wide range of
                employment issues. The Bill’s core principle is that it is
                important to realise that what is good for employees can also be
                good for employers. The best employers offer the best conditions
                for their workforces, and that is no coincidence.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Successful employers need valued, skilled and
                committed employees — as does the economy as a whole — and
                my Department’s role is to spread that successful model
                throughout the economy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Northern Ireland needs modern, productive
                workplaces that can meet the challenges of the new century. That
                is why the Bill is aimed at helping parents to balance the
                competing demands of work and family, so that they have a choice
                of continuing their careers if they wish; increasing maternity
                leave; introducing paid leave for fathers and adopting parents;
                simplifying the procedures to claim those payments; and giving
                parents of young children the right to request working hours
                that will allow them to balance their professional and home
                lives more effectively.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The modern economy faces the potential
                long-term problem of needing to increase the supply of skilled
                and unskilled workers. Much of that supply could come from
                women, who, traditionally, have taken long, and often
                involuntary, absences from employment. Any provision that makes
                it easier for women to return to work should be welcomed and
                encouraged, as long as it is properly balanced. It is also
                important to recognise the key role that fathers play in raising
                their children.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Chairperson of the Committee for
                Employment and Learning for his welcome of, and agreement with,
                the Bill. I assure him that we shall look into the issues in
                much greater detail at Committee Stage. Mr Dallat and Mr Carrick
                referred to the impact that the Bill would have on small
                businesses, and Mr Carrick specifically mentioned my press
                release of 20 May. I should explain that larger firms will be
                able to recoup 92% of maternity, paternity and adoption pay.
                Smaller businesses will be able to recoup the full amount of
                paternity and adoption pay, plus an additional 5% to cover
                administration costs.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is difficult to estimate what the costs of
                flexible working would be, especially for small firms. However,
                I hope that the Bill will encourage employees and employers to
                reach sensible and mutually acceptable arrangements that will
                minimise the costs. As I mentioned, some of the costs will be
                offset by reductions in the cost of such matters as training,
                recruitment, and time off due to stress.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dallat queried whether two weeks’ paid
                paternity leave was sufficient. The provision is intended to
                support the father at the time of the birth to allow him to
                become more involved in supporting the mother and caring for the
                new child. Two weeks is a balance between the interests of the
                employee and the employer. It will be necessary to keep the
                period of leave under review as we gain experience of how the
                provision works in practice. Of course, fathers may take up to
                four weeks’ parental leave in a year, although it would be
                unpaid.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dallat queried the Bill’s impact on
                low-income families. I presume that he is concerned about those
                fathers, or parents who adopt, who do not meet the earnings
                qualifications for statutory paternity pay. Relatively few
                fathers will not qualify for such pay. We must remember that the
                Bill is intended to help ease the problems of combining work and
                parenting. It does not seek to deal with the entire range of
                social security issues. Other forms of financial support, such
                as the new tax credits, will be available to working families in
                2003. Of course, fathers who have the relevant continuous
                service with their employers will be able to take paternity
                leave, even if they do not qualify for paternity pay.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Carrick asked about what I am doing to
                facilitate the work-life balance of individuals other than
                parents. I support flexibility in the workplace for all, but I
                see helping parents of younger children to achieve a better
                balance between the needs of their work and children as a
                priority. My Department continues to fund the national ‘Work-Life
                Balance’ campaign, which asks employers to consider the
                business benefits of enabling all their employees to achieve and
                maintain a better balance between work and other aspects of
                their lives.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs Nelis also asked about small businesses,
                and I hope that I have answered that question. On the wider
                consultation, we came up with similar suggestions and proposals
                to those in Great Britain. Mrs Nelis also mentioned that the
                introduction of more family-friendly policies might have the
                unintended consequence of harming younger women’s employment
                opportunities. However, I would be surprised if most employers
                did not opt to employ the best person for the job.</p>

                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Monica McWilliams spoke about the Bill’s
                title. It may be possible to consider an addition to the title
                that would better describe what the Bill will do.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Children adopted from abroad deserve exactly
                the same chance to spend time with their new families as those
                adopted here. Adoption leave is designed to allow all parents
                time off work to spend it with the child so that they can adjust
                to their new relationship.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Northern Ireland needs a modern, productive
                workplace that can meet the challenges of the new century, and
                that is what the new Bill aims to achieve. It is designed to
                help parents to balance the competing demands of work and family
                so that they have the option of continuing their careers if they
                so wish.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This Bill is very important. I am convinced
                that greater partnership and trust between employers and staff
                are key to enhancing productivity. As Ms McWilliams said, we
                should have had the Bill years ago, but I am pleased that we
                have it now. I wish that we had had it many years ago when I was
                a young staff nurse with four small children, but I welcome it
                today. It covers a range of issues with a common thread —
                better employment arrangements for everyone. The package offers
                a balance of rights and responsibilities; provides for a
                workplace reflecting a modern economy; encourages the retention
                of skills; extends help to working mothers; and recognises the
                role of fathers. It will reduce stress and conflict at work to
                the benefit of society.</p>

                Investment (Sir Reg Empey):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I beg to move</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That this Assembly endorses the principle of
                extending the consumer protection measures in the Enterprise
                Bill to Northern Ireland.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I seek the Assembly’s endorsement of the
                principle that certain transferred consumer protection measures
                in the Enterprise Bill be applied UK-wide. If endorsed, that
                will be done with the agreement of the Department of Trade and
                Industry in Great Britain by inserting certain clauses into the
                Bill during its Report Stage. The relevant measures in the Bill
                are mostly outstanding items from the consumer affairs agenda
                set out in the 1999 White Paper entitled ‘Modern Markets:
                Confident Consumers’. The measures mainly amend and replace
                corresponding provisions in the Fair Trading Act 1973, which was
                given UK-wide effect under direct rule, despite the fact that
                consumer protection was and remains a transferred matter.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I seek the Assembly’s agreement to notify
                the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry that those
                measures and other related consumer protection measures included
                in the Bill should be considered by the UK Government and
                introduced at Westminster. I wish to explain why it is sensible
                that one instrument in one place should carry all those
                necessary amendments.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A key factor in my consideration is to strike
                the right balance between establishing local accountability and
                securing the benefits of utilising UK-wide legislation for the
                advantage of Northern Ireland consumers, especially when it can
                be secured at no local cost. Another key factor in my
                consideration is the proposed establishment of a new authority
                with extensive expertise — a new fair trading authority —
                whose remit might be extended to include Northern Ireland, again
                at no local cost.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The legislative approach that I propose would
                have the effect of maintaining the status quo, whereby the Fair
                Trading Act 1973, to which I referred earlier, would continue to
                operate on a UK-wide basis even though it would be dealing with
                transferred matters. That approach will ensure that consumers in
                Northern Ireland are not disadvantaged in any way as regards
                their standard of protection compared with people in England,
                Scotland and Wales.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members should also be aware that to adopt
                the proposed approach would not preclude the Assembly from
                taking a different approach at a future stage and introducing
                its own legislation. If that is seen as the desired longer-term
                preference, it will be facilitated. In the meantime, I propose
                to have my Department conduct a review that will address the
                unusual policy and legislative situation that has arisen in
                Northern Ireland concerning consumer protection matters and make
                recommendations on the best way forward in the longer term.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I should now like to inform Members of the
                details of the particular consumer protection measures in the
                Enterprise Bill that I propose should be applied throughout the
                UK. First, part I of the Fair Trading Act 1973 will be amended
                to replace the Office of the Director General of Fair Trading
                with a new statutory authority. That authority will exercise the
                director’s current functions of consumer protection, which is
                a transferred matter, and competition, which is a reserved
                matter, in a more effective and efficient way.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, part II of the 1973 Act will be
                repealed. That part was intended to provide a means of dealing
                with new trade practices that might develop and that might have
                an adverse affect on consumers. It has not been successful and
                has not been used since 1977. The two Orders already made under
                part II, the Consumers Transactions (Restrictions on Statements)
                Order 1976 and the Business Advertisements (Disclosure) Order
                1977, would remain in place.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thirdly, part III of the 1973 Act will be
                reformed to enable the new statutory authority and other
                enforcement bodies, such as my Department’s Trading Standards
                Service, to take proceedings to obtain a court order against
                traders who do not comply with their legal obligations to
                consumers. That will be possible if the provision is extended to
                Northern Ireland. The new remedies available to enforcing
                bodies, and the procedures to obtain them, will be included in
                the Bill. That will make it much easier for trading standards
                officers to take effective action against rogue traders.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Fourthly, the powers of the new statutory
                authority will be enhanced to approve and monitor industry codes
                of practice, which safeguard and promote consumer interests.
                Fifthly, the new statutory authority will be given a broad power
                to produce and disseminate educational material on matters
                affecting consumers’ economic interests, or otherwise to take
                part in educational activities. Finally, the Secretary of State
                for Trade and Industry will be granted a power to fund third
                parties to provide consumer advice, information, and educational
                activities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To conclude, there are sound reasons to vote
                in favour of the motion. As Members may be aware, the Fair
                Trading Act 1973, which is one of the key foundation stones of
                consumer protection in Northern Ireland, operates across the UK.
                If the Enterprise Bill’s new consumer protection measures were
                not to be extended to Northern Ireland, the 1973 Act would
                continue to apply unchanged in Northern Ireland until the law is
                amended. The result would be that there would be the anomalous
                situation of the Office of the Director General of Fair Trading
                being retained in Northern Ireland even though it would be
                abolished and replaced by a new authority in Great Britain.
                Secondly, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry would
                continue to operate the 1973 Act in Northern Ireland while
                operating the Bill’s new powers in Great Britain. Finally, and
                in my view the most serious deficit, Northern Ireland consumers
                would be forgoing the enhanced levels of protection offered by
                the Bill until such time as a Northern Ireland measure could
                become law, which could take two years or more.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am pleased to confirm that the Executive
                have endorsed, subject to Members’ approval, the proposal that
                those transferred consumer protection measures be applied
                throughout the UK. I also confirm that the Committee for
                Enterprise, Trade and Investment, at its meeting on 29 May,
                agreed in principle with the consumer protection measures in the
                Bill and that Northern Ireland be included within the Bill’s
                scope. I commend the motion to the House.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy Chairperson of the Committee for
                Enterprise, Trade and Investment (Mr Neeson):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;The Committee considered the proposals
                at its meeting last week, and it supports the endorsement of the
                Enterprise Bill. It is important to recognise that this is a
                special situation. The Committee’s one reservation, which I am
                sure that the Minister would appreciate, is that it would prefer
                to see home-grown legislation. As the Minister said, the
                proposals do not preclude that happening.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee consulted the General Consumer
                Council, which is in favour of the proposals. In many ways, it
                is a method of fast-tracking. The Minister and the Department
                are determined to strengthen consumer protection law in Northern
                Ireland, and they recognise its importance. At its meeting this
                morning, the Committee supported the Department and the Minister
                in the four bids to obtain extra funding to strengthen consumer
                protection. The Committee is in favour of that and looks forward
                to an extended consultation on further necessary consumer
                protection law.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One consumer protection issue that I would
                like to be considered is whether the laws that deal with public
                transport could be strengthened, in much the same way as there
                is a regulator for electricity prices.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee supports the endorsement, and I
                call on the Assembly to support the Minister.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr McDonnell:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I shall be brief. Time is short and my speech
                was disrupted by Ireland scoring in the ninety-third minute. We
                live to fight another day, but that is perhaps for a different
                occasion.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I strongly endorse the Minister’s
                recommendation, which has the full support of the General
                Consumer Council. Consumer protection must be strengthened here.
                The 1973 arrangements must be upgraded for several reasons,
                because life has changed considerably in those 29 years. In the
                past few weeks, I have said on the record that an energy agency
                should be set up. Although we stopped short of doing that,
                nevertheless all the issues contained therein and the fragmented
                nature of consumer protection concern me.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the Minister in his efforts to
                strengthen the hands of trading standards personnel against
                rogue traders, and those who are less than honest and
                honourable. There is a need for better educational efforts
                across the range of consumer entitlement, because we often buy
                goods when we are away from home, in places we are unsure about
                or when we are on vacation. All too often it is more bother than
                it is worth to take action if those goods are faulty. There
                should be a mechanism to deal with that. The funding of third
                parties would go a long way to addressing that issue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My time is running short, Mr Deputy Speaker,
                and I am grateful to you. On my behalf and on behalf of my

                Personnel are needed in the United States to secure investment.
                For example, in the past two days I have met, in the USA,
                companies that are considering investing in Northern Ireland or
                expanding their businesses there. Without legwork in areas where
                we have a significant trading partner or potential sources of

                who watch the competition from other developing countries and

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Far from creating obstacles for SMEs, we are
                all doing all we can to give incentives to them. Financial
                support of up to 50% of set-up and first-year running costs up
                to a maximum of £1,500 is being offered. Five Invest Northern
                Ireland officials are going around businesses to point out the
                advantages of the technology and the concept of broadband. In
                addition, an e-solutions business centre is based at the former
                Industrial Research and Technology Unit (IRTU) offices in
                Lisburn with every conceivable form of technology on display.
                People can come in off the street, see that technology and get
                advice from officials.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The chairman of Invest Northern Ireland and I
                have made statements and speeches at every opportunity to draw
                the attention of the business community to the benefits that can
                be accrued by availing of those technologies. I assure the

                approved, and we have the resources to do that.</p>

                launched to encourage the aggregation of demand in local areas.
                Thanks to resources from the Department of Trade and Industry, a
                further sum of money can be made available for, for example, the
                establishment of wireless networks in certain areas. That is

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Within Invest Northern Ireland, and its
                predecessor organisations, growing use has been made of hot-desking,
                and practices that allow employees to access e-mails and
                messages from external locations. I hope that such innovations
                will increase, because our Department has several e-government
                targets to meet. Clearly, the Department must set an example,
                and a major project is already well under way to achieve that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I assure the Member that no stone will be
                left unturned in fulfilling our desire to ensure that maximum
                use of these systems is made. We do not specify or promote a
                particular technology, because one technology may suit one
                client, while another may suit somebody else. In built-up areas
                with a significant density of activity, ADSL Internet access can
                be provided. The exchange in Londonderry is being converted to
                make that provision available, and I welcome that, but in rural
                areas that technology is unaffordable, hence my response to Mr
                Byrne that a different type of technology may be suitable there.
                One of the key objectives of the Department and Invest Northern
                Ireland is to ensure competitiveness in businesses by
                encouraging them to take up the opportunities provided by those
                new technologies.</p>

                Some of that number have been made redundant through the closure
                of local branches of multinational companies. What redeployment
                of that skilled workforce has occurred, particularly into new
                and locally based businesses? Will the Minister, in conjunction

                alternative reskilling and training courses exists in order to
                position workers to benefit from any global upturn in the

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I understand the Member’s anxiety. His
                constituency has experienced several setbacks in the last 18
                months with one or two large employers in the area. The Member
                knows that my Department and the Department for Employment and
                Learning provided significant back-up and went out of the way to
                establish tailor-made training programmes for certain companies.
                Significant amounts of money have been advanced through the
                Department for Employment and Learning and my Department’s
                company development programme. There is no doubt, therefore,
                that the Government have shown their commitment to provide the
                companies with the skilled employees that they demanded.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unfortunately, some people completed their
                training only to find that they had been made redundant. That
                was a deep psychological blow. From correspondence that I have
                received from the Member and other Colleagues, I know that it
                was felt widely throughout the constituency. I am pleased to be
                able to say, from anecdotal information that has been given to
                me, that several people have been redeployed. Once a skill has
                been learned, it will travel. Those who show the flexibility to
                leave one form of employment to be retrained and move into
                another are in demand in the economy, particularly if they have
                technical skills.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I assure the Member that we will continue to
                keep the provision of assistance in his constituency under
                review. It is frequently the case that, in letters of offer to
                new investors or to existing investors who are expanding, a
                training package is included.</p>

                will be aware that a new and dynamic chief executive has been
                recruited. He has come into Northern Ireland after many years’
                international experience, and he has set to work to create
                client teams. He is creating a new approach and aims to create
                teams of people who have certain skill sets so that they can be
                &quot;client-facing&quot;. He intends that the team will deal
                with a client, rather than one person with one skill doing part
                of the job before bouncing the client off to someone who has
                another skill. That should mean that the client gets a more
                seamless service.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The chief executive is anxious to increase
                the percentage of client-facing staff. Inevitably, a certain
                amount of work will continue to be backroom or overseas work.
                However, I determine that all overseas work is client-facing —
                I have seen evidence of that in the past 48 hours.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a certain amount of administration
                that cannot be avoided, particularly when public moneys are
                being expended, when there are accountability issues, and when
                special expertise, such as land management, is required. As the
                months unfold, the advisability of this course of action will
                become apparent, and I assure the Member that there will be a
                single and new culture for Invest Northern Ireland. It will not
                inherit the culture of any one of the other organisations.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Invest Northern Ireland has considered the
                matter at board level. I said during the passage of the
                Industrial Development Act (Northern Ireland) 2002 that there
                would be a significant regional dimension to Invest Northern
                Ireland’s activities. The Invest Northern Ireland offices in
                Northern Ireland were formerly offices of LEDU. They dealt with
                one particular client base. The offices that Invest Northern
                Ireland will be operating must deal with a broader base. That
                means that the skills of the people in those offices will have
                to be added to and enhanced to provide a broader range of
                activity. I hope that the Member will shortly hear from Invest
                Northern Ireland on its proposals.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am confident that the proposals will meet
                the vast majority of Members’ concerns: I am conscious that
                some areas of the Province do not have offices. While I am not
                in favour of widespread proliferation simply for the sake of it,
                there should be outreach in areas where there is economic
                activity or the potential for it. Potential clients should have
                access to the agency and its skills. I look forward to an early
                response from Invest Northern Ireland on that range of matters.</p>

                sitting in those offices waiting for people to come to them?
                Will he assure us that the offices will be bases from which
                officials will go into the community, particularly the rural
                community, to pass on their skills and knowledge to other

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am pleased to give the Member that
                assurance. The intention of Invest Northern Ireland is to change
                the character of the area. As I said to Mr&nbsp;Byrne, five
                Invest Northern Ireland officials are concentrating on trying to
                promote the satellite broadband scheme in rural areas. They are
                meeting their client base and pointing out the benefits that can
                be achieved by using the technology. They are also pointing out
                the financial assistance that is available.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I recognise the thrust of the Member’s
                question that it is no longer adequate for people to sit in an
                office waiting for someone to arrive. I assure him that that is
                neither the intention nor the desire of Invest Northern Ireland.
                I am assured that they intend to run their offices with
                evangelical zeal. They have to get out and do work that is
                similar to some of the better enterprise centres. People from
                such centres have been going into the local community and
                generating activity; they have not been waiting for people to
                come to them. If we achieve nothing else but that, it will have
                been worth the effort.</p>

                currently being designated as eligible for TSN funding, while

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am aware of the Member’s anxiety, and it
                has been expressed to me on several occasions. I said that we
                are working to finalise revised New TSN area maps. We are
                looking at a range of issues because the Noble measures of
                deprivation are a much more flexible instrument than the
                previous Robson index, although my Department uses the Robson
                index together with unemployment data. As an integral part of
                the revision, we are using the unemployment measures in addition
                to the Noble Report.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In some of the boroughs that the Member
                represents, the unemployment levels have been stubbornly and
                persistently high, and that will form part of our consideration
                prior to the publication of a revised map. The Noble index gives
                us the flexibility to add in and take out. If a particular area
                is currently in a map, it does not mean that it cannot
                subsequently come out. Likewise, areas that are currently not on
                the map can come in, so the Member will have to be patient for a
                little longer.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The answer is that they are not used.
                However, I understand that Northern Ireland venture capital
                funds have invested in a small number of inward investment
                cases. The Northern Ireland Local Government Officers’
                Superannuation Committee (NILGOSC) has also invested in the new
                Viridian growth fund, which became operational in January this
                year.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Neeson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister is aware that when we visited
                Montréal last December, we were impressed by the large amounts
                of pension funds that were being invested in local economic
                regeneration. Does he agree that there is a need for greater
                investment of pension funds — not only local funds but also
                national and international funds — in economic development in
                Northern Ireland? Does his Department have any plans to try to
                attract more inward investment from pension funds?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I sympathise and largely agree with what the
                Member has said. In the United States, local pension funds are
                effectively obligated to invest up to 5% of their funds in local
                businesses, and that makes sense. We have at least made a
                breakthrough with the Viridian growth fund because NILGOSC,
                which is a well-financed pension scheme, has put resources into
                it. That money will be used to finance the growth and expansion
                of new or existing businesses, and I welcome that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would encourage and support further
                involvement. I accept that a pension fund, by definition, has to
                spread its assets widely and that its primary purpose is to
                protect the long-term interests of pensioners. However, that
                does not preclude wise investment in the local economy, which
                should, in turn, benefit the future pensioners of such a fund. I
                would support any measure that encouraged local companies to
                take a modest risk — and we would only expect a modest risk
                — in supporting local industry. That is entirely consistent.
                It works well in other countries, including the United States,
                and there is no reason why it cannot work here.</p>

                enhancements have been introduced to meet the needs of Northern
                Ireland participants more effectively. An enhanced New Deal
                programme, titled 25 plus, which comprises features that are
                unique to Northern Ireland, was introduced in April 2001. A
                review of the New Deal programme for 18- to 24-year-olds has

                is failing the unemployed, especially those who face multiple
                barriers to employment. Does the Minister accept that it may be
                time to examine some of the alternatives to New Deal, such as
                the excellent proposal from the Lenadoon Community Forum, which

                participants considered it to have had a beneficial effect on
                their job prospects. However, the Member is correct to say that
                weaknesses were identified. If there were other barriers to
                employment, the New Deal programme did not work as well. That is
                one of the main issues that the task force on employability and
                long-term employment will consider. It will identify new and
                innovative ways to tackle unemployment.</p>

                for my Department. Between 1999-2000 and 2000-01, the number of
                mature student enrolments at further education colleges
                increased by more than 8%; the number of disabled student
                enrolments increased by 11%; and adult basic education
                enrolments increased by 4%. The percentage of Northern Ireland
                applicants from lower socio-economic groups who are accepted on

                policy? Or, is the widening access policy being resourced from
                existing funds, thus placing increased pressure on the funding
                available for third-level education?</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The widening access policy is aimed at
                increasing and facilitating the participation of those groups
                that are under-represented in the higher education sector. It is
                especially aimed at students from disadvantaged backgrounds,
                students with disabilities and students with learning
                difficulties. The Department is addressing the issue of widening
                access to higher education through several broad policies and a
                range of specific target actions. The strategy of promoting
                lifelong learning overcomes barriers to increased participation
                in education by traditional non-learners through the provision
                of access to good information and advice. Northern Ireland is
                piloting foundation degrees, which are a new vocational higher
                education qualification. The Department has introduced a
                widening participation premium for students from disadvantaged
                backgrounds, and it is providing a widening access premium for
                students with disabilities. It has allocated special funding for
                projects for students with learning difficulties and
                disabilities. To make access to higher education available to
                under-represented groups, it provides special project funding to
                allow universities to test their strategies and approaches. The
                Department also supports projects aimed at developing
                partnerships between universities and those schools that
                traditionally have low levels of higher education participation.</p>

                that the Housing Executive should not sell any commercial
                properties unless there were good reasons for doing so. There

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Minister for his brief and
                concise reply. It looks as though he may equal the previous
                Minister’s achievement in answering questions quickly. Where
                commercial tenants are willing to invest in the development of
                properties owned by the Housing Executive, public funds would
                benefit if those tenants were allowed to buy those properties
                and develop them as normal commercial enterprises. Now that we
                have a new Minister, the matter merits reconsideration; a
                different policy might be devised in the Executive.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dodds:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I compliment the Member for the concise
                wording of his question. Most commercial properties owned by the
                Housing Executive are shops or garages that it has built or
                inherited. Some are derelict buildings acquired under the
                special purchase of evacuated dwellings (SPED) scheme. The
                current policy is to sell only if it makes good economic sense
                to do so, and providing that there would be no detrimental
                effect on tenants. The rationale for the retention of such
                properties is that, when the last review was carried out, it was
                thought desirable for the Housing Executive to retain control
                over the nature of the outlets. This is to ensure, first, that a
                mixture of shops is maintained; secondly, that the residents
                benefit from local shopping facilities — these properties are
                mainly in or near housing estates; and, thirdly, that the risk
                of problems associated with particular types of outlets is
                minimised. In addition, rent from such outlets contributes to
                Housing Executive income over a longer time.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Once such properties are sold, covenants
                governing the use of the shops are valid for only three years,
                after which time, market forces dictate use. That is not
                necessarily in the interest of the community. However, I note
                the Member’s remarks and am happy to give the matter further
                consideration.</p>

                proposals for changes to its house sales scheme, including that
                element concerning tenants over 60 years of age. My Department

                tenants because of their age. Like discrimination of any kind,
                it must be made illegal as soon as possible. Will the Minister
                encourage the Housing Executive to scrap this discriminatory
                regulation at the earliest opportunity?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The exclusion from sale of pensioners’ and
                old people’s dwellings has been the subject of a recent
                judicial review. It was accepted in court that there is an
                objective and reasonable justification for the exemption from
                sale of dwellings suitable for the elderly. It was also accepted
                that there is a reasonable relationship of proportionality
                between the means employed and the aim.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, until the Housing Executive submits
                proposals for changes to the scheme, and my Department and I
                consider them, I cannot say what any revised scheme might
                provide for generally, or for those types of dwellings in
                particular.</p>

                is engaging in, will the Minister ensure that due consideration
                is given to protecting any new scheme from the abuses that this
                scheme suffered? Equally, will he ensure that the equality
                requirements, which are on all Departments, are covered as well?
                If this scheme is made more open to sale, will the Minister give
                us an undertaking that sufficient resources will be put into new
                build, whether through housing associations or whatever, to
                ensure that there is a good stock of houses available for old
                age pensioners in our community?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Equality provisions are a matter of law, and
                Departments are bound by the provisions in the legislation —
                that goes without saying. As far as stock for the provision of
                accommodation for senior citizens is concerned, I want to see as
                much money as possible in the general housing budget to cover
                not only the needs of the elderly, which are a priority, but
                also the needs of the homeless, people on waiting lists, and
                people in housing need across the board. That should be a
                priority for the Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While focus has naturally, and, in some
                cases, inevitably, fallen on areas of public policy in recent
                times, one should not forget the enormous contribution that
                housing makes — not just in providing a roof over people’s
                heads, but also in contributing to their general well-being,
                their health,their education, their social inclusion, and so on.
                It is important that the issue remain a priority for the
                Assembly and the Executive as regards budgetary provision.
                Finally, I will certainly provide the Member with the assurances
                he seeks on the other matters</p>

                has been considering have been subject to a lengthy period of
                consultation and review. The Housing Executive has yet to submit
                them to the Department, which will consider them in due course.
                The main issues cover things such as a requirement for joint
                purchasers to be resident in a property; the capping of
                discount; the exclusion of dwellings suitable for the elderly
                from sale in any circumstances, and a new residency period of
                two years after which applications can be made to purchase a

                thoughts expressed by Mr McCarthy, and I understand the
                difficulties that the Housing Executive has in matching stock to
                potential clients. Will the Minister take local situations into
                account during the review? There are areas where there is ample
                stock, and Housing Executive area managers could be given leeway
                to release suitable housing stock to the over-60s in particular
                areas.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hear what the Member says on the issue of
                allowing local circumstances and discretion to dictate what
                happens. However, as all tenants would not be treated equally
                under such a policy, it could fall foul of equality legislation.
                Mr ONeill raised this very issue earlier. For example, under the
                sort of proposal that Mr Hussey has spoken of, those living in
                dwellings for the elderly in some parts of the Province might be
                eligible to buy, while those in other parts of the Province
                would not. That would pose serious legislative difficulties.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The points-based design of the common
                selection scheme incorporates transfer cases. However, the
                management transfer policy allows district office managers the
                discretion to transfer tenants, under certain circumstances,
                without reference to their points status under the common
                selection scheme. That can mean that tenants are transferred to
                available accommodation ahead of other applicants to facilitate
                the best use of stock and for the redevelopment or clearance of
                a particular block or area. Vacancies that arise may be
                available for allocation to other applicants, including the
                homeless, if the vacancies are in an applicant’s area of
                choice.</p>
                <b>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does the Minister not agree that this is a
                wholly iniquitous system that allows the Housing Executive to
                bribe people with £1,800 to move out of a perfectly good house
                that they do not want to move out of and then to move them into
                another area ahead of people who are homeless? Surely the
                homeless must be in the greatest need, and management transfers
                should take account of that. In my area, in the district of
                Carrickfergus, people who are homeless take precedence. Areas
                have been knocked down, but they can wait. In Larne, it seems to
                be the reverse. The Housing Executive is paying people to move
                out of houses so it can knock them down, and other people
                continue to remain homeless as a result.</p>

                Member, particularly the Member who has just spoken, about any
                specific cases that they wish to draw to my attention. There are
                circumstances in which management transfers can be made and in
                which district offices can exercise their discretion and create
                such transfers. Those operate within certain guidelines. There
                are exceptions to the general rule of allocation to the
                applicant with most points. For instance, applicants who have
                been awarded priority status under the previous selection scheme
                and who retained that status when the new scheme was introduced
                can be offered a tenancy before those with a points-based
                priority. In addition, rent arrears, illegal occupation of a
                dwelling or involvement in serious antisocial behaviour can
                militate against the offer of a tenancy, regardless of the
                number of points awarded.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There should not be any question of inequity.
                There may be justifiable cases where a management transfer can
                ease a housing problem and allow a situation to be unblocked
                that would otherwise cause serious housing difficulties. It is
                not a case of unfairness. The common selection scheme was
                designed to be fair and open, and it gives applicants a greater
                choice of areas in which to live. As far as management transfers
                are concerned, the common selection scheme sits alongside, and
                does not always take precedence over, other policies designed to
                make the best use of existing stock and to facilitate, for
                instance, regeneration or redevelopment.</p>

                We must address the fact that participation in the warm homes
                scheme has been greater in some areas than in others. We should
                ensure that the scheme is publicised; for example, public

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In autumn 2000, a package of measures was
                announced to introduce enhanced social security provision for
                carers. From April 2001, the earnings limit for invalid care
                allowance was increased to the level of the lower earnings
                limit, and the carer premium paid through income-related
                benefits was increased by more than £10 a week. I hope that the
                remaining provisions, including allowing carers over the age of
                65 to claim the allowance, will be in place by autumn. From 6
                April 2002, carers can avail themselves of an additional state
                pension through the state second pension.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dallat:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does the Minister agree that many are still
                left out of the loop, including relatives who leave professional
                jobs to care for their loved ones, thereby losing their pension
                rights? Does he agree that legislation that encourages people to
                care for their sick and elderly relatives must be updated
                constantly?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dodds:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am sure that all Members share Mr Dallat’s
                concern and would pay tribute to carers, especially family
                members who have made sacrifices to care for a relative. People
                accept that burden for many reasons, and their enormous
                contribution should be recognised by everyone in society.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I accept the need to constantly review the
                legislative regime that affects people in that situation. The
                issue has arisen before; therefore, Mr Dallat and other Members
                will recognise that this part of the United Kingdom, and others,
                have a parity system.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In April 2002, the state second pension was
                introduced as a replacement for the state earnings-related
                pension scheme (SERPS) to assist low and moderate earners,
                carers and people with a long-term illness or disability to
                build up an additional state pension. That should help in the
                circumstances to which Mr Dallat referred.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Social security legislation in Northern
                Ireland closely mirrors that of Great Britain, and provision
                operates on the principle of parity between Northern Ireland and
                Great Britain.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Given that brevity is required, that reply
                might become the record.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I recognise the importance of Northern
                Ireland’s keeping in general step with the rest of the United
                Kingdom on issues such as housing and other benefits. Are there
                any avenues that would enable the Minister to exercise
                discretion as regards such benefits? If so, would he permit such
                leeway in the local interpretation of Regulations?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dodds:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, the parity principle is not new. It
                has been maintained since the inception of social security. The
                Member will be familiar with the provisions of the Northern
                Ireland Act 1998, which gave legislative expression to parity
                for the first time. The 1998 Act requires the Secretary of State
                in Great Britain and the Minister for Social Development in
                Northern Ireland to run single systems of social security, child
                support and pensions to the extent that they agree to do so.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member asked about the issue of
                flexibility of payments; I caution him and other Members to be
                careful. Parity means that people in Northern Ireland pay the
                same rates of income tax, make the same National Insurance
                contributions and, in return for that, have the same range of
                contributory and non-contributory benefits, paid at the same
                rates and subject to the same rules and conditions as people in
                Great Britain. If that were to change, it would have a major
                financial implication in that the money to establish that extra
                provision and the computer systems to operate it would have to
                come out of the Northern Ireland block. It would also have
                implications for the easy movement of citizens between Northern
                Ireland and the rest of the UK with regard to their entitlement
                to benefits. We should hesitate before going down that line.
                Members will recognise that the principle of parity has served
                the people of Northern Ireland well over the years. We tamper
                with that at our peril.</p>

                homes scheme is categorised by postal code area. However, 320
                households have benefited from the warm homes scheme in the
                postal code areas that equate approximately to the constituency

                administrative staff are available to process warm homes scheme
                applications? Are there enough select tender- approved
                contractors available to carry out the installation work on
                approved schemes?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dodds:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The number of administrative staff available
                and the number of contractors on select tender lists have not
                been an issue for the Department for Social Development in
                seeking to fulfil the objectives of the warm homes scheme. The
                Department has no concerns on that matter. However, as I said
                earlier, I am concerned that we should ensure that as many
                people as possible across the Province take up access to the
                scheme. Thus far, £340,000 has been spent in West Tyrone, which
                is low in comparison to other constituencies and other areas.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must try to improve knowledge of the
                scheme so that people can access it. As public representatives,
                we all have a role to play. The scheme’s managing partnership
                has been running a continuous promotional campaign since the
                scheme began in July 2001.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am glad that I was not called at 2.30 pm
                because I have just heard the sad news that Germany did not win
                the match in the World Cup. I happily walked into the Chamber
                believing that the Germans were leading 1-0 only to find out
                that a certain other unmentionable country had equalised. The
                shock has worn off, and I have more or less recovered my
                equilibrium.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the Minister’s proposed
                legislation on consumer protection. The Enterprise Bill is a
                parity issue. The Committee has looked at it and is reasonably
                happy with it. All Committee members would have preferred
                home-grown legislation made and tailored to the needs of
                Northern Ireland, but they accept the circumstances and that
                this is the best that can be done.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that the Minister will not join the
                cohort of his Colleagues who are introducing legislation in
                great dollops leading up to the recess. I do not know what is in
                the pipeline, but I hope that this is the first of a few Bills
                that are coming up between now and the end of the month rather
                than many.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I especially welcome the tightening of
                legislation on rogue trading. That is a great problem in many
                areas, particularly those close to the border. I had a meeting
                with the local divisional police commander the other day, and he
                told me that the police raided a certain Sunday market somewhere
                in south Armagh, which will also remain nameless. In that raid,
                60% of all the seized goods were counterfeit, fake or stolen.
                That is a remarkable statistic, because it shows that 40% of the
                goods were not counterfeit, fake or stolen. I do not believe
                that anyone who goes to that market is under any illusion that
                the stuff is from the top shelf. He knows that the stuff was
                brought in by unusual means. That is having an effect on genuine
                traders; in many cases the genuine traders cannot compete, so
                the legislation needs to be tightened.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was a member of the old Assembly between
                1982 and 1986, and one of its successes was the establishment of
                the General Consumer Council for Northern Ireland. That
                organisation has worked well, but there is a need to increase
                its powers and scope, and the Committee for Enterprise, Trade
                and Investment is more than happy with anything that does that.
                It will watch the progress of the legislation with interest and
                hopes that it gets a speedy passage.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs Courtney:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy Chairperson of the Committee for
                Enterprise, Trade and Investment has already spoken about the
                Committee’s discussions and its welcoming of the Bill. It has
                received backing from the General Consumer Council, given that
                it contains several advantages for business and consumers, and
                that it paves the way for business across the United Kingdom.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Under the reform of part III of the Fair
                Trading Act 1973, the new enforcement bodies will have the power
                to obtain a court order against traders who do not comply with
                their legal obligations to consumers. The amendment will make it
                easier to take action against rogue traders. The Bill may also
                help to target social need as the new provisions are likely to
                benefit vulnerable and disadvantaged groups that suffer at the
                hands of rogue traders.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bill makes provision for the Office of
                Fair Trading to become a more proactive body. It grants the
                Office of Fair Trading a stronger input into codes of practice
                for formal approval, and there is the requirement to monitor and
                withdraw approval if necessary. The Bill will also grant power
                to the new enforcement bodies to produce and distribute
                educational materials on matters that affect consumers —
                economic or otherwise.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry
                will be unable to fund third parties to provide consumer advice,
                information and education. There is a new super complaints
                procedure. Under the new legislation, consumer bodies will have
                the right to bring a super complaint to the Office of Fair
                Trading for investigation when the market is not working. That
                should improve efficiency and increase the protection of
                consumers’ rights.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the Assembly embraces the Bill in line
                with the rest of the United Kingdom, it is unlikely that there
                will be additional costs, as the Minister has said, since the
                Trading Standards Service will enforce the new measures in line
                with its other operational priorities. If, however, the Assembly
                does not support the Bill at this stage, the cost could
                ultimately be far greater for the people of Northern Ireland.
                Therefore, I have no hesitation in supporting the Enterprise
                Bill and its expeditious inclusion in the Northern Ireland
                Assembly.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The main purpose of the debate is to give
                Members an opportunity to endorse the principle of extending the
                consumer protection measures in the Enterprise Bill to Northern
                Ireland. Agreeing to such an extension is the best way to ensure
                that Northern Ireland consumers are not disadvantaged in any way
                as regards their standards of protection compared with consumers
                in England, Scotland and Wales. However, that in no way removes
                the right of the Assembly to look afresh at measures in future
                and to introduce our own legislation. I have become increasingly
                concerned that that is an area in which the law is confused, as
                we have a transferred matter with regard to consumer protection
                that is regulated by primary reserved legislation — the Fair
                Trading Act 1973. Therefore, in the autumn, I shall establish a
                review of all consumer legislation in Northern Ireland to
                clarify that and to ensure that we have proper protection for
                consumers. If remedial action were necessary, I would not
                hesitate to introduce measures.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department of Enterprise, Trade and
                Investment will introduce more legislation; I shall propose two
                further measures next week, and I hope to introduce major
                legislation on energy in the autumn. I commend the motion to the

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mindful of your comments, Mr Speaker, the key
                words are &quot;Convention on the Future of Europe&quot;. The
                aspects that may be considered were included in the declaration,
                a copy of which has been circulated to Members.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the opportunity to initiate the
                debate. It is a subject of some complexity, but also of
                potentially great importance for all that are in the EU and for
                the accession countries that plan to join over the next few
                years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Today’s debate is the start of the process,
                not the end. We are not offering the Executive’s views on the
                issues raised by the future of Europe debate. During the summer,
                the Executive will consider their view on the future of Europe
                and prepare their report, which will serve as input to the work
                of the convention. Any consideration or response made by the
                Executive will take account of the views expressed today, as
                well as those expressed at the conference planned for 27 June
                and any other views that are put to us in the coming weeks.
                Views can be offered through the web site that we shall
                establish on the future of Europe debate. That will provide an
                opportunity for people to contribute their views, and for others
                to read and offer comment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The importance of having a debate in Northern
                Ireland is highlighted in our EU strategy framework, which is
                the first step towards developing an EU strategy for the
                Executive. The future of Europe debate is an important part of
                that strategy, and we want to look at the contribution that we
                shall make to the Convention on the Future of Europe.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Nice Intergovernmental Conference in
                December 2000 launched the debate on the future of Europe in
                light of the challenges that the European institutions would
                face upon enlargement. At the Laeken European Council in
                December 2001, the European heads of Government decided to call
                a convention that would supplement the national and regional
                debates with a Europe-wide forum to debate the issues and to
                agree a conclusion within a year.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The convention will be chaired by an
                ex-President of France, Mr Valéry Giscard d’Estaing, and it
                is currently in what is described as its listening phase, which
                is likely to last until September or October 2002. The
                convention will then enter an analytical phase before producing
                recommendations. Those recommendations are expected to emerge in
                the spring or summer of next year. That will inform an
                intergovernmental conference on the future of the EU, which will
                be held in 2004. At that point, decisions will finally be taken
                on the issues that we discuss today. It is therefore vital that
                we consider what contribution we should make to that debate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We need to be clear about the nature of our
                role. As one region among many in the EU, we must recognise the
                limits of our influence and seek to deal with issues that are of
                fundamental importance to Northern Ireland. We do not have to
                reach a view on all the elements of the debate. However, we must
                identify what matters to Northern Ireland and deal with those
                issues.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We recognise that there are different views
                in the Assembly on the EU, as there are in wider society. The
                debate focuses on the reforms that are needed in order that the
                EU can operate effectively after enlargement, so that it can be
                more meaningful to its citizens. It may be difficult to reach a
                consensus on all issues, but we do not need to address them all.
                None the less, the process of debate will bring out many of the
                factors that we need to consider.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must try to agree the way ahead on the
                role of the regions and their place in the EU. A decade ago, the
                EU established a new advisory institution, the Committee of the
                Regions, to give a limited place for sub-state authorities
                within the European institutions. Northern Ireland has two
                representatives on that Committee, Mr Dermot Nesbitt and Mr
                Alban Maginness. Although we are conscious that the status and
                composition of the Committee of the Regions has been criticised,
                it is an advisory rather than a decision-making body. In recent
                years, the devolution of parts of regions has occurred in many
                member states, most notably in the UK, Spain and Italy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The increase in the number of devolved
                regions and the increase in the powers that they exercise have
                yet to be fully recognised by the EU. At present, Northern
                Ireland’s role in decision-making in Brussels is limited and
                indirect. That gives rise to some questions. Should regions such
                as Northern Ireland make their voices heard in the EU? Is there
                sense in our seeking to co-operate with similar regions to
                maximise the influence that we can bring to bear? Should the
                regions have direct access to some EU institutions? Should the
                EU recognise the growth of regional power in relation to how it
                seeks to regulate for its member states?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is clear from the discussions that my
                Colleague Mr Haughey and I have had in Brussels that that
                question is currently exercising the Commissioners. We must bear
                in mind that although the United Kingdom has devolved regions
                — as do Spain and Italy — there are various European
                countries that work on an opposite principle.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.15 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In considering the matter, we must be
                pragmatic about what is achievable. Irrespective of one’s
                views about Northern Ireland as a region, nothing should
                diminish the importance of the principal member states in the EU.
                When trying to determine the role of the regions, we should be
                mindful that an enhanced position — imagined or otherwise —
                for the regions might enable the Commission to divide and rule.
                When it deals with the major member states only, it can find
                that more difficult. We must therefore carefully consider the
                cause and effect of any proposals.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We shall continue to contribute as actively
                as possible to the development of the UK Government position,
                concentrating specifically on areas in which we identify
                interests for Northern Ireland. The Joint Ministerial Committee
                is the vehicle for doing that. The Committee meets regularly at
                Westminster; indeed, it meets next week. It draws together
                Ministers from across Whitehall and the devolved Administrations
                to consider what the UK line should be on European matters.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Laeken declaration essentially raises
                four matters. First, who does what in the European Union? Linked
                to that are questions about what the balance should be among the
                EU institutions, the member states and the regions, and how any
                changes can be made. There is, therefore, a specific context for
                discussing the role of the regions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, there is the matter of EU laws.
                Many Members feel that too much regulation comes from Brussels
                and that there should be greater flexibility in its
                implementation by member states. To take that further, there
                should be further flexibility within member state regions. The
                entire business of who produces the law, and how much of it is
                produced, has major implications for the consideration of where
                sovereignty lies. That is a source of considerable interest and
                debate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thirdly, issues arise concerning democracy,
                transparency and efficiency. Specifically, those involve looking
                at the balance of power within the European institutions —
                among the Council, the Commission and the Parliament. Again, the
                question is raised as to whether the regions should have a more
                direct voice in those institutions than that which the Committee
                of the Regions provides. That is an area in which the impact of
                enlargements on the workings of the EU is most significant. If
                one considers the issues that are raised by having 15 member
                states, and the difficulties in getting the sort of demographic
                expression that we would understand to bear on the decisions, it
                will be much more difficult if there are 25 or 30 members.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The fourth question raised in the declaration
                is whether there should be a constitution for Europe and whether
                the Charter of Fundamental Rights should be incorporated into
                the treaty. Those questions go to the heart of the way that the
                European concept and the associated institutions will develop
                over time. Again, that raises significant issues of sovereignty.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All those issues impact on Northern Ireland.
                Issues such as a constitution of Europe will affect all parts of
                the EU similarly. Others, such as the possible incorporation of
                the Charter of Fundamental Rights, could have unpredictable
                outcomes in Northern Ireland because we already have a complex
                framework of rights and equality law, which is derived from the
                Human Rights Act 1998, the Northern Ireland Act 1998 and local
                anti-discrimination law. That could lead to a classic situation
                whereby the sovereignty that has thus far been exercised on our
                affairs is in conflict with measures arising from a constitution
                for Europe as a whole.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that the debate will begin to tease
                out the Assembly’s thinking on Northern Ireland’s key
                interests in the future of Europe debate. It will set the tenor
                for progressing a wide-ranging discussion in Northern Ireland on
                the future of Europe. That will include a conference on 27 June
                that will include social partners, academics, the
                non-governmental sector, local government and Assembly Members.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An issue that may occupy the attention of
                that conference is the conspicuous absence in the Laeken
                declaration of any reference to economic and financial matters.
                Those clearly have a bearing on the structure and future of the
                European Union and are significant to the single currency.
                Although that is not within the scope of the debate, none the
                less one cannot make any sensible judgements on the future of
                Europe unless economic issues are considered carefully.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When the United States suddenly starts to
                protect its steel industry and enhance support for its
                agriculture industry, we must ask ourselves what kind of playing
                field we are on and where that leaves the World Trade
                Organization. The free trade area in Europe must decide whether
                it is working to protect its own trade bases or working on a
                wider worldwide free trade basis. Those issues cannot be left
                out when the future of Europe is being considered.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The debate also signals our determination to
                engage meaningfully with the Assembly on major European policy
                issues. That will be followed by discussions with the Committee
                of the Centre, although I appreciate that other Committees have
                areas of specific interest on European matters. We are also
                finalising our response to the Committee of the Centre’s EU
                inquiry report, which was debated some weeks ago, and we expect
                to agree broadly with its recommendations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition to our engagement with the
                Assembly, we are also determined to draw in civic society, of
                which our planned conference is one element. In his winding-up
                speech, my Colleague Denis Haughey will provide more detail on
                the progress that has been made with the Northern Ireland Centre
                in Europe (NICE) to ensure that we can utilise to best effect
                the expertise available to the Executive. The debate marks a
                start to an important discussion.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Committee of the
                Centre (Mr Poots):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee of the Centre welcomes the
                motion on the Laeken declaration and the subsequent
                establishment of a Convention on the Future of Europe. The issue
                goes to the heart of how Europe will be organised and managed.
                The Committee therefore welcomes the proactive approach taken by
                the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister
                in assessing the views of the Assembly. It gives the Assembly an
                important opportunity to make its views clear.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We also welcome the conference to be held on
                27 June by the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First
                Minister. That will involve wider civic society in Northern
                Ireland in the debate. Greater involvement of civic society was
                an area of major concern in the Committee’s recent EU inquiry
                report, and the conference is a welcome indication that the
                Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister is
                beginning to take it on board.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The European Union will be enlarged in the
                near future, with the potential for a further 10 countries to be
                added to the current 15. The future of Europe debate is about
                how the European Union will meet that challenge.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Laeken declaration agreed to set up a
                convention to consider changes to the European Union’s
                treaties; its working methods after enlargement; and how it can
                find a role for itself in a rapidly changing, globalising world.
                However, many see the convention’s biggest challenge as how
                the widening gap between European institutions and citizens can
                be tackled. There are no easy answers to those complex matters.
                The convention has outlined 64 separate questions that cover a
                wide range of issues and it expects to get a large number of
                diverse responses.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee of the Centre’s consideration
                of those matters has allowed it to identify several major
                themes. The first of those is the simplification of the
                treaties. There is widespread agreement that the four EU
                treaties are extremely complex and should be simplified.
                Objectives, powers and policies are spread across the treaties,
                and the many amendments that have been made to them over the
                years have left them a tangle of regulation. However, the
                treaties are complex because they cover the concerns and issues
                of 15 member states. The Committee of the Centre agrees that
                simplification is needed, but not to the extent that it
                eventually leads to some type of constitutionalism.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some form of common standard and text that
                the ordinary person can grasp is needed. Making the EU easier to
                understand is, perhaps, a first step in tackling the widening
                gap between the citizen and European institutions. However, a
                major concern of the Committee is how simplification can be
                achieved, given the impact of the enlargement of the treaties.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The second issue that the Committee of the
                Centre looked at was the delimitation of competences — who
                does what in the European Union. Critics hold that the current
                system is imprecise and unclear, with the result that it is
                often the courts that decide who can do what. That imprecision
                and lack of clarity is seen as enabling the EU to legislate in
                areas in which it is not competent to do so. The Committee
                agrees that there must be clarity on that issue. Some 60% of our
                regional legislation arises from EU law. Are we sure that the EU
                has a right to create so much of our legislation? The Committee
                wishes to see the roles of the EU, the member state and the
                region clarified, but it agrees that any system that is
                developed must be flexible.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Of all the issues to be explored by the
                future of Europe debate and the convention, that of subsidiarity
                and proportionality is one of the most important. There is a
                view that the lack of definition in that area has led the EU to
                legislate in areas in which it may not be needed and to go
                beyond that which is necessary to achieve its objectives. The
                Committee of the Centre expressed most interest in that concept
                as it applied to ensuring that a distinctive Northern Ireland
                viewpoint is heard when appropriate. The Committee recognises
                that the devolved institutions will not always agree with the
                position taken by the UK as member state, especially in respect
                of agriculture and fisheries – such disagreement is quite
                common in other UK and European regions. Although difficult to
                attain, any strengthening of the regional position is to be
                welcomed. There are more than 200 regions in the European Union,
                a number that will increase after enlargement, so how can the EU
                take account of the differing needs of so many regions? The
                Committee of the Centre wishes to see Northern Ireland have a
                stronger voice and receive greater EU accountability, but it
                recognises that that would be difficult to achieve. The
                Committee also applied that reasoning to the convention’s
                structure. With so many regions and interest groups contributing
                to the convention, it will be a difficult task to ensure that
                the Northern Ireland viewpoint is heard.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are limited routes to the convention
                open to us. We can provide input via the two UK parliamentary
                representatives on the Committee of the Regions. We can only
                attend the convention as observers only or access it through a
                web-based forum. The Committee of the Centre has decided that it
                will provide input to the convention through those two UK
                parliamentary representatives, and to that end it has invited
                them to meet the Committee on 20 June.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The issue of achieving more democracy in the
                EU is being explored Europe-wide through ideas such as having a
                second chamber, a President of the European Commission and/or
                the European Council, with more openness and transparency in the
                Council’s decision- making process.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It has been suggested that the main role of a
                second chamber would be to give national and regional
                Parliaments a say in EU power structures by allowing them to
                police the subsidiarity principle. The Committee of the Centre
                does not feel that a second chamber is a viable option for
                increasing democracy in the EU. It feels that that could be
                better achieved by increasing and strengthening the role of MEPs.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee recognises that the concept of
                an elected President of the Commission and/or the Council
                probably appeals to those who believe in a federal Europe. The
                current system whereby each country has a six-month presidency
                works well, although it may not be so suitable following
                enlargement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee of the Centre finds that the
                current system works well. It allows the Committee to invite the
                UK ambassador of the country that holds the presidency to come
                to the Committee and give an authoritative view on the
                priorities of the presidency. Therefore, the Committee can check
                that Northern Ireland is prepared. Twice each year the Committee
                can check that Northern Ireland is keeping up with EU priorities
                and is prepared for the EU agenda. That would be much more
                difficult if the president were to be elected.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The real power in the EU lies with the
                European Council. As regards the openness of the Council, the
                Committee of the Centre sees no reason why almost all of the
                European Council’s sessions should not be held in public,
                particularly those applying to legislation. Public meetings
                would allow regional Parliaments to see whether their viewpoint
                had been noted by member states and to see how member states
                voted on important issues such as the common agricultural
                policy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Briefly — and taking off my Committee
                Chairperson’s hat — I do not support further federalism in
                Europe. There is much concern among my community that the EU has
                undermined the sovereignty of the national Government and that
                that will be further eroded as the EU vests more powers in
                itself.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I trust that the debate will be open and will
                not be used to create further federalism. I hope that the debate
                will genuinely reveal whether there are issues of subsidiarity
                for national Parliaments and not be about the EU taking more
                power for itself. The EU has a major role to play and, whether
                we like it or not, we are members of the EU and must therefore
                be bound by it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The UK is the fourth largest economy in the
                world and it must not wholly tie itself to the EU. We must keep
                our options open: we must look to our historical links with the
                Commonwealth and north America. I recently attended a function
                held by the British Ambassador in Washington at which it was
                indicated that more than £100 billion of trade takes place
                between the United States of America and the UK. Exchanges on
                the money markets because of investments between the UK and the
                USA are even greater. It is, therefore, important that our
                country retain its national independence and integrity. The
                debate offers the United Kingdom the opportunity to make its
                mark and to assert that, although it wants to be in Europe, it
                wants to be a nation in its own right and does not want its
                sovereignty to be undermined.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr K Robinson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the junior Ministers for tabling the
                motion and note the proposed conference on the future of Europe,
                which will take place later in June, as an indication of a
                positive response from the Executive.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The establishment of a convention to consider
                the future of Europe is a defining moment in the life of the
                European Union. It is made necessary by the accession of 10
                member states, mostly in central and eastern Europe. Chaired by
                a former French President, with two former Prime Ministers of
                Italy and Belgium as his deputies, the convention is a serious
                body and no mere talking shop. Driven by a presidium that meets
                twice a month, it possesses an inbuilt mechanism for forward
                momentum. Therefore, the direction that it takes is critical.
                Representatives of the national Governments and Parliaments
                heavily outweigh the representatives of the Commission and the
                European Parliament by almost three to one. That is a critical
                equation and demonstrates that the vision of a Europe of
                co-operating nation states has prevailed over a centralised
                bureaucratic vision, which is a good start. It is how Britain
                has always seen it and it is how France and other member states
                are increasingly seeing it.</p>

                currency, without this jeopardising Member States’

                institutions inveigling their way into every nook and cranny of
                life&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The convention is a great window of
                opportunity to mould the future of the European Union. Europe is
                a treaty-based free association of states, which is why a
                constitution for Europe is wrong; it logically presupposes the
                existence of a superstate. It is counter to the expectations of
                the European people. People want to gain advantages from Europe
                and to see tangible benefits from its mutualism. On the other
                hand, bureaucracy is a disease. Under the guise of being logical
                and organising affairs better, it is a parasitic organism that
                grows at everyone’s expense.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A balance must be struck between the benefits
                of organising the affairs of state, both economic and political,
                en masse and the democratic deficit and sense of disempowerment
                that over-regulation and bureaucracy cause. Therefore, the
                Laeken declaration is a crossroads. We must establish a European
                Union with the light touch of networking and mutual benefit, not
                the heavy hand of bureaucracy. A protracted, detailed debate on
                the form and structure of a European constitution would be time-
                consuming. That time would be better spent focusing on how to
                make Europe less bureaucratic and more democratic.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The desire of the European institutions and
                national Governments to jealously guard their competencies
                against encroachment is understandable, but their shared
                willingness to exclude regional input is unforgivable and
                represents a weakening of their declared aim of greater
                involvement with the citizen. It would be remiss therefore of
                the Assembly, given its local experience with agriculture and
                fisheries, not to make the case for a stronger regional voice.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a constitutional region, it is important
                that we use the opportunity to play a full part in the crucial
                debate on the future of Europe. We must therefore use all three
                channels that are available — the European convention, the
                Committee of the Regions, even if it is an observer to the
                convention, and the forum that runs parallel to the convention
                itself.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Having said that, we in the regional
                Assemblies, which have proliferated all over Europe, must assert
                our role in that new Europe. The regional Assemblies and
                Governments have an immediacy that enables them to relate to
                Europe more directly, more responsively and more effectively
                than a national Parliament can ever hope to. The essence of how
                those regional Assemblies and Administrations can interface with
                Europe is through networking. The House will recall that a
                Committee of the Centre report on how Northern Ireland could
                interface more effectively in Europe said that informal, as well
                as formal, networking was the key. That is a function of size
                and immediacy, part of that informality generated by smaller,
                more local and less formal regional Assemblies, as compared with
                national Parliaments.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is a question of scale and of tailoring
                economic and governmental packages to suit the specific needs of
                a particular province or region. There must be a dynamic and
                vibrant relationship between the regional Assemblies, such as
                this one at Stormont, the national Parliaments and the European
                Parliament. Westminster is in danger of becoming a bit of a
                backwater as it increasingly rubber- stamps the many decisions
                that are made in Europe in the first instance. Strangely, the
                less formal regional Assemblies interface better with the
                central European institutions, the European Parliament and the
                European Commission. More democratic accountability, the
                creation of an upper chamber of the European Parliament fed by
                members of national Parliaments, with an injection of democratic
                accountability for the Commission and the Council of Ministers,
                may be a way to achieve this.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That course, however, is fraught with danger
                for the nation states. As the European Parliament became a focus
                of real democratic accountability and, therefore, of power, it
                would increasingly challenge the independence of the national
                Governments and Parliaments. Power moves with spending power;
                that is the way of the world. That is why we must craft a new
                post-Laeken Europe with care, for every opportunity contains a
                threat, and every threat contains an opportunity.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr ONeill:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some interesting comments have been made, and
                I am inclined to think about the origins of the European Union.
                It began as an economic unit, instituting the coal and iron ore
                agreements. The parliamentary tier was introduced later, and
                that provided a role for representation. Now, some 50 years
                later, we stand at a crossroads, facing two basic challenges
                about where we should go in Europe. One of those challenges
                comes from inside the union, and the other from outside, as has
                been mentioned already. There is a challenge in Europe to make
                the institutions more relevant, more accessible, and more
                identified with the needs of the people. Matters under
                discussion with regard to a revision of those institutions
                include changes in representation, a further chamber, which has
                been mentioned in the debate, and different forms of election
                and representation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For me and my party, however, it is the
                outside pressures that dictate one of the great reasons for the
                existence of the European Union, and one of its great successes
                — and it has been tremendously successful. There have been no
                major European wars since it was established. That was not the
                case in the previous centuries when the European Union did not
                exist. The European Union has also succeeded in economic
                development. It is now a major international player and may be
                one of the richest communities in the world. We must remember
                those major successes.</p>

                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The nation state is not a suitable form of
                government in the modern world. For example, the head of cabinet
                at the European Commission’s environment private office, Rolf
                Annerberg, recently reported to the European Commissioner for
                the Environment, Margot Wallström, that 84% of European
                citizens consider environmental protection to be a priority. In
                a situation such as the Chernobyl disaster, which affected many
                countries and was dealt with internationally, an individual
                nation state would be powerless. The same applies to whaling,
                which the EU has dealt with effectively. Such issues motivate us
                to hold greater expectations for the European Union in creating
                environmental policy or preventing crime, for example. More can
                be done through international co-operation. All transnational
                issues could be dealt with in an improved way, and much work
                remains to be done.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After the destruction of the Berlin Wall,
                many thought that major international tensions, divisions and
                wars might end. Yet, on 11 September we saw another frightening
                aspect of international violence. Europe has a potential
                peacekeeping role to play, which could be developed, possibly to
                create a European foreign policy. Such areas are open for
                discussion.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Convention on the Future of Europe opened
                on 28 February, and the SDLP believes that it should provide a
                draft treaty that would serve as a European constitution.
                Perhaps it is time to take a bold and positive step by designing
                a constitution that would not need to be substantially altered
                every few years. The constant process of treaty revision through
                successive intergovernmental conferences may have reached its
                limit. Such a constitution would have to address certain issues.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The European Union Charter of Fundamental
                Rights should be given a constitutional basis and status. The
                enhancement of the political and social rights of our citizens
                must be a top priority, and Europe should never become
                indifferent to injustice. A key test for any new constitution
                will be its capacity to bring citizens closer to the European
                Union and its institutions, and that is a major internal problem
                for the EU. That will not be easy, given Europe’s unique
                structure — it is not a state, but it has many of the
                characteristics and functions of one. The respective powers of
                the EU, the member states, and the regions of Europe should be
                delimited — a matter that is under consideration in the
                European Parliament.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Given the debate over the democratic
                legitimacy of the institutions of the EU, the possibility of
                direct or indirect elections for the presidency of the European
                Commission should be examined thoroughly. Although it is clearly
                a matter for each member state, there should be a minimum set of
                standards — for scrutiny by members in state Parliaments —
                for the activities of Government representatives in the Council
                of Ministers. That may be an accountability gap, but a set of
                standards could overcome many of the concerns of member state
                Parliaments about their role in the EU decision-making process,
                and obviate the need for another tier of organisation in the EU.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The distinctive feature of the EU is its
                commitment to providing decent social conditions for all its
                citizens — a commitment often defined by the term &quot;the
                European social model&quot;. The SDLP believes that that model
                must be maintained and enhanced, as an EU limited to a free
                trade zone is not desirable. To that end, it is also important
                that the powers of the Council of Finance Ministers are balanced
                by an enhanced role for the Council of Employment and Social
                Affairs Ministers. In particular, employment and social
                indicator targets should be given comparable status to economic
                and monetary targets. The position of employment policy, health,
                education, equality, industrial relations and the treaties must
                all be upgraded.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The SDLP strongly believes that the single
                market and single currency are only sustainable if the citizens
                of Europe are assured of high levels of employment and social
                standards. It is also important for the political legitimacy of
                the EU that its citizens be convinced that it pursues economic
                prosperity and social justice.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Moreover, in a more global world,
                transatlantic relations cannot be a one-way street. Europe must
                provide greater assistance to those seeking peace and justice,
                which is one of the other issues identified as being a problem.
                Globalisation cannot go unrestrained: we must take hold of it
                and render it positively to democracy, and it must be regulated
                in an ethical manner.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All constitutions require periodic review and
                amendment, and we must ensure that that takes place in an
                adequate, open, and democratic fashion. The SDLP believes that a
                European constitution should be put to the people for
                acceptance. That would be a time for real decisions, and I hope
                that we do not lose the opportunity to make them.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Neeson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the opportunity to speak in this
                debate. I understand that it is essentially a take-note debate
                dealing with the Laeken declaration, but I want to make some
                observations that relate directly to Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Devolution provides a major opportunity for
                us to ensure that our citizens benefit as much as possible from
                the EU. I am a member of a newly formed organisation called
                Northern Ireland into Europe, which recognises the role of the
                regions in relation to membership of the EU. I welcome the
                growing realisation among Members of the importance and impact
                of the EU. A recent debate on a Committee of the Centre report
                was helpful, constructive and worthwhile.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are two main issues in the declaration.
                The first is the Europe of the regions. As Minister Haughey
                knows, I acted as an alternate on the Committee of the Regions
                for several years; it was a worthwhile experience.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The second issue is the enlargement of the
                European Union. We have all come to accept the effect that the
                European Union has on our everyday lives through its many
                Directives. However, European Union bureaucracy must be
                considerably reduced. European Union instruments must be
                simplified. Reform of the European Union is not only desirable,
                it is essential in developing national, regional and European
                institutions that are effective, efficient and democratic.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the establishment of the convention
                to discuss those issues and to consider the needs of European
                citizens in the twenty-first century. Europe today is very
                different from 50 years ago, when the first moves were made
                towards European co-operation. The needs of twenty-first-century
                citizens must be taken into account.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As the Laeken declaration suggests, it is
                vital that European institutions be brought closer to Europe’s
                citizens. The declaration rightly questions the need for so many
                EU Directives, and it also acknowledges the need for greater
                regional consultation. This is one of the issues that has given
                the European Union a bad name. Many of the European Union
                Directives can be very helpful. Recently in the Chamber, I spoke
                about the European Directive on energy and on equalising cost to
                consumers throughout Europe. That is good legislation. However,
                talking about bananas does nothing to encourage association
                between the European Union and its citizens.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have been concerned by the antipathy and
                ambivalence of many here towards the European Union. The
                European Union must now create a sense of ownership towards its
                institutions and between its citizens, not just in Northern
                Ireland but throughout the EU.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">James Leslie spoke of the conference on 27
                June. I am pleased that a broad spectrum of people will be
                involved in it. I also welcome the involvement of the Committee
                of the Regions to feed the views of the regions of Europe into
                this vital debate.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.00 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I look forward to the enlargement of the
                European Union, and Northern Ireland should look on that as an
                opportunity rather than a threat. Like other Members, I
                regularly receive ‘The Parliament’, and recently it has been
                assessing the developments in those countries that would like to
                be considered for accession. I am impressed by the progress in
                their economies, social development and democracy. It is
                encouraging to see that, for many of those countries, accession
                to the European Union is a major incentive.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, Ministers and the Executive should
                note that all Members want to be involved in this debate. We can
                be constructive, and I look forward to further debate on this
                vital issue.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Morrice:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I declare an interest. I am a former head of
                the European Commission Office in Northern Ireland, a member of
                Team Europe, a speakers’ panel, and, like Sean Neeson, a
                member of Northern Ireland in Europe.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am one of the few — although I hope the
                numbers are growing — designated Unionists in the Chamber who
                is ready, willing and proud to be described as a truly committed
                European. The term &quot;European Unionist&quot; springs to
                mind, but I do not think that traditional party politics here is
                ready to embrace, let alone understand, that concept of
                political inclusivity — at least not for a while anyway.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a European, I have become totally
                disillusioned, as Sean Neeson said, by the half-hearted approach
                that Northern Ireland has had to the hugely important and
                enormously exciting project that is the future of the European
                Union and Europe in general. Our entire demeanour has been to
                milk it dry and cry foul any time it asks us to do anything in
                return, such as clean up our beaches, ensure that our animals
                are free from disease or even label our children’s toys
                correctly.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr K Robinson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does the Member agree that some local
                councils, such as Newtownabbey Council, have been actively
                engaged in the expansionist aspect of Europe to the east in the
                town of Rybnik in Poland, and that many people in Northern
                Ireland are involved at that level?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Morrice:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Superb stuff and more of the same. I
                appreciate exactly what Mr Robinson says, and I shall refer to
                some of his remarks. Several Unionists here are beginning to see
                the light with Europe.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As the junior Minister said, one of the key
                problems is how we simplify the law-making procedures, the
                framework Directives, et cetera. However, although that is
                important, it is also important to start allaying some of the
                misconceptions about those procedures. All too often when good
                things happen in Europe we say that we are wonderful. However,
                when bad things happen, we say that the Brussels bureaucrats are
                interfering again.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">People must understand how the system works.
                Interfering Brussels busybodies do not make the laws. Laws are
                decided at European Council meetings where the UK representative
                is the democratically elected Minister. More often than not,
                thanks to devolution, that Minister can be from here. If Brid
                Rodgers were in the Chamber she could testify to that, as she
                has attended meetings several times to negotiate for Northern
                Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is no doubt that Northern Ireland has
                reaped tremendous benefits from belonging to the European Union.
                This debate is about giving something back. We have had peace
                programmes, a common agricultural policy, structural funds,
                cross-border initiatives, INTERREG — the list is endless. I
                agree that we have not always spent the money wisely. A new
                industry is growing here — consultants are teaching us how to
                access the money rather than how to make it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That said, we must realise that we should be
                using the funding not as a sofa but as a springboard; we have
                not done that often enough. There has been discussion about
                enlargement. We know that the money will run out in 2006. What
                will we do when those more needy countries — the 10 in the
                first raft to enter the European Union — get preference? That
                is part of the debate on the future of Europe.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For example, do we follow Sinn Féin’s line
                — I am sorry that none of its Members is present — in the
                Nice referendum, and do everything in our power to keep Eastern
                bloc countries out so that we can have more spoils for
                ourselves? Or do we begin in earnest to play a constructive role
                in building the future of Europe?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Northern Ireland is described as a
                constitutional region of the European Union, and its people are
                being asked their opinion on the future of Europe. In my vast
                experience of European affairs, I have never before known the
                people of Northern Ireland to be asked that. It is hugely
                important.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What is our reply? According to the motion,
                we &quot;take note&quot;. We should be doing a great deal more
                than that, and I welcome the fact that we are doing so. We must
                take positions on the main issues.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What is the problem? For many in the United
                Kingdom and in other parts of the European Union, Brussels is
                foreign, faceless, and far too far away. I shall repeat that
                because Members who have just entered the Chamber may appreciate
                the description. For many, Brussels is foreign, faceless and too
                far away.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are simple remedies. The problem is
                that the Laeken declaration describes those remedies as the
                delimination of power, status of charters, et cetera. All that
                Euro-talk is far too hard to understand. Let us deal with the
                problems: foreign, faceless and too far away.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">How do we deal with Brussels being too far
                away? I agree with Mr Ken Robinson that the role of the regions
                should be strengthened. We must bring Europe closer to home and
                to its citizens. Thus, it becomes less far away.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We had a debate on subsidiarity, but we
                should come out of the closet and mention the &quot;F&quot; word
                — federalism. In the days of Margaret Thatcher, we were taught
                that federalism was a centralisation of power in Brussels.
                However, the German, Spanish and Belgian examples show us that
                federalism is not about centralising power in Brussels — it is
                about decentralising it. Sure enough, it means less power to the
                capital of the nation state and more power to the regions. That
                is an interesting concept that we must debate more fully. We
                should not be afraid of that debate. I appreciated Éamonn
                ONeill’s contribution that he was not sure that the nation
                state is a suitable form of government in the modern world.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The debate on federalism should be brought
                out into the open. In the United Kingdom, it is called
                devolution; the European Union calls it subsidiarity as a means
                of avoiding the &quot;F&quot; word. However, it is important
                that we debate it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The next consideration is the idea that
                Europe is faceless. Some of the questions that have been raised
                today are valid. Why are meetings of the Council of Ministers
                not held in public? It is wrong that they are held behind closed
                doors. I was a journalist in Brussels behind those closed doors,
                hoping to get stories about what was coming out of those Council
                sessions. The UK Minister would tell us one story, and the
                French Minister would tell us a totally different one. We never
                knew who won and who did not. If the meetings are open, we can
                judge for ourselves, which is very important.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The notion of an elected President is
                fascinating. That would certainly get us more involved in
                European affairs. Perhaps a President would have more powers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It would be worth examining the idea of a
                second chamber. I am disappointed that, according to Mr Poots,
                the Committee of the Centre has ruled that out. A second chamber
                with representatives of national Parliaments would bring it
                closer to home and make it less faceless.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many other ideas have been mooted, but I
                shall not take up more time than both Ministers together. We
                want more transparency and to bring Europe closer to home. We
                have something to offer. We are a region that is emerging from
                conflict, and the means by which we are making that transition
                with help from our European and American friends could serve as
                a tremendous example to other regions in the world. We should
                start to flex our regional muscle and contribute to the debate
                on Europe. Foreign matters can be a cause of fascination, not a
                cause of fear.</p>

                However, I did hear the SDLP abandon Nationalism. Suddenly, they
                have become Unionists, and Éamonn ONeill says he wants to be a
                European Unionist. National Socialism and Republicanism are no
                longer relevant; there has been a volte-face, and the SDLP has
                left the junior Minister on his own. Its members have suddenly
                become European Unionists. That is interesting, because then I
                have heard someone else speak who was a Unionist one day, became
                something else for the next, but is back to being a Unionist
                this afternoon. We are becoming well used to conversions and
                lapses.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let us look at what is happening. The
                Convention on the Future of Europe has been called because
                Europe is in a mess. It has no relevance to people. The number
                of people who participate in European elections declines every
                election year. Europe must look at how it can become relevant
                again. The convention has set out a three-stage process but asks
                64 questions. In the ‘European Voice’ magazine we can see
                how the disparity and disagreements begin. The Centre for
                European Reform has suggested that</p>

                problems that enlargement in the Union will face. The debate
                could also be incoherent, owing to the number of voices

                be part of this convention — it was suggested in the debate
                that the 240 regions of an extended Europe be included. There
                will not merely be competing voices, there will be a large
                number of competing voices. There will be great difficulty in

                the convention floor which would not be practical as the
                convention would be massive if each country had original
                representatives. There would be an opportunity for structured
                dialogue in which the regional dimensions, which are important,
                can be heard. The principal vehicle for British and Scottish

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The numerous revisions of the last 50
                years have led to an impressive increase in treaty provisions,
                turning them into a tangle of regulations sometimes dating back
                to different historic periods not always co-ordinated. Some
                articles contain reference to concepts that are obsolete such as
                the title on economic and monetary union, even now the European
                euro is already in existence. Besides the treaties, there are
                also various protocols for obtaining exemptions and reservations
                on countries’ positions in certain matters which undermine the
                unity of the system and above all the clarity of the
                rules.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is the reason for the convention. Europe
                has become a stack of uninterpretable protocols and Directives,
                some of which are getting into the system in spurts and gulps.
                Some of our Departments are having difficulty in meeting their
                deadlines. Northern Ireland will be heavily fined by Europe if
                it cannot deliver on time.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some people claim — and Mr Éamonn ONeill
                made a great point of this — that we are getting a great deal
                of money from Europe. However, the United Kingdom is a net
                contributor to the extent of around £1,900 a head. In 1973, we
                were net contributors of around £500 a head. It now costs us
                almost four times as much to be Europeans. We do get money from
                Europe, but the reason for this convention — and I welcome it
                — is the fact that we shall get an opportunity to put forward
                a different perspective from that of rainbow politics.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Europe does not have a record of being
                successful on any unified front throughout history. The first
                great attempt at unifying Europe was by the great Church, and
                that ended in disaster. Since then it has fragmented. What has
                been suggested under this great convention of the regions would
                take us back into history to the great Christian state of the
                Holy Roman Empire, which did not even have 240 regions. What has
                been suggested is, therefore, a historically backward step
                rather than a forward one.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Committee of the
                Centre was correct to point out that the American Business
                Association, which is the largest single business grouping, did
                more business with the United Kingdom than with any other
                region. Therefore, all those who hail commercial importance and
                global activity should not think in European terms only.
                Commercially, we think globally, but we should not put all our
                eggs in one European basket, given that we have to spend three
                years and three stages deciphering the present ritual of
                protocols. By 2004, we will have as many more protocols and
                Directives to be simplified, and it will take another four years
                to make sure Europe is in a real mess.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The conference will be a great opportunity to
                debate and discuss six areas of concern, rather than having
                three areas to discuss. Europe needs be examined and considered
                — but considered with reality.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Birnie:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Laeken declaration starts with some
                expansive claims about how the European Union and its
                predecessors have promoted prosperity and peace in Europe. The
                first page of the declaration states that</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The European Union is a success story.
                For over half a century now, Europe has been at peace. Along
                with North America and Japan, the Union forms one of the three
                most prosperous parts of the world.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to evaluate the contribution that the
                European Union has made to prosperity and peace in Northern
                Ireland, because we are thinking today about Northern Ireland’s
                unique input to that convention. It is true — and many Members
                have referred to it — that we have been net financial
                beneficiaries from Europe to the order of several hundred
                million pounds a year in transfers from Brussels, mainly through
                the farming policy. However, as Mr Gibson has pointed out, the
                United Kingdom as a whole is still a substantial net financial
                contributor to the Union.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are two aspects of overall unified
                policies across Europe that do not seem to have worked well for
                Northern Ireland. It could be well argued that, in the long run,
                the prospects for the farming and fishing industries here would
                be much better if the common agricultural policy and the common
                fisheries policy, which in the past week has been subject to
                reforms and revisions, were to collapse.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is likely that they will unravel, given
                their cost and the impact of EU enlargement to the east, which
                is a driver behind the Laeken declaration and this process.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr ONeill referred to the need to use the
                European Union to give an ethical steer to globalisation. The
                outlook for the Third World, especially parts of Africa and
                Latin America, would be much better if the European Union, the
                United States and Japan did not distort world agriculture
                patterns, especially the food trade, to such an extent.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Laeken declaration emphasises Europe’s
                peace- building role in Northern Ireland. The impression is
                sometimes given that the European Union was a major broker of
                our so-called peace process. That is almost certainly an
                exaggeration, although some help was undoubtedly given, for
                which we should be grateful. However, the impact of the
                so-called peace and reconciliation money, derived from the
                Delors packages, will become clear. It is feared that some of
                that funding will have a limited effect. Similarly, it is absurd
                to claim, as the Laeken declaration seems to suggest, that the
                EU is the main cause of peace in western Europe since 1945 — I
                should imagine that the Cold War and NATO had a part to play in
                that regard. Furthermore, it could be argued that aspects of
                foreign policy that arose from the EU had a malign effect on
                Yugoslavia during its disintegration and troubles of the 1990s.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The best position on the future of Europe is
                one of Euro-realism: we are part of the European Union, but that
                does not mean that we should give all its institutions a blank
                cheque, as some of them have damaged the interests of Northern
                Ireland, the rest of the United Kingdom, or both. Culturally and
                geographically, we are part of Europe, but we have strong links
                with the rest of the world, especially the United States and the
                Commonwealth. We shall rely mainly on our own efforts to build
                peace and prosperity in Northern Ireland. Although the European
                Union is important, it is a facilitator, at best, for such
                activity.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wish to concentrate on the questions that
                were posed at the convention. First, how can the EU treaties be
                simplified? That seems to be a good aspiration; however, I doubt
                whether it could be achieved if we continue to strive to fulfil
                the increasingly impossible goal of achieving policy harmony
                among all European Union member states. Harmony among the 15
                members is difficult to achieve; therefore, I cannot imagine how
                much more difficult it will be if, or when, the European Union
                expands to comprise 20, 25 or 30 member states. If the European
                Union is to survive as a confederation of states it will have to
                accept a good deal of variable geometry — I apologise for
                using such Euro-jargon. In other words, subgroups of member
                countries would form different &quot;sub-clubs&quot; with common
                standards on certain issues, while other member countries would
                opt out. That structure already exists with respect to the euro;
                it could also apply to immigration, farming or fisheries
                policies.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The relationship between the EU institutions
                and the member states is a further issue. The Blair Government
                seem to oppose a delineation of competencies between, for
                example, the Commission and member states. In theory, the idea
                of setting cast-iron limits on the total powers of the
                Commission is attractive; however, in practice, any such
                barriers would be breached progressively.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the United States, notwithstanding the
                constitutional provision that all powers that are not declared
                as resting at the centre — Washington DC — remain with the
                governments of the states, powers have drifted to the centre
                over the past 200 years. That is one reason why I disagree with
                the praise that Ms Morrice gave to so-called &quot;federal
                systems&quot;. Historically, in practice they tend to centralise
                over time.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.30 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Similarly, on the third question relating to
                the Laeken declaration, regarding so-called subsidiarity, I
                recognise the apparent attraction of the ideal but doubt its
                practicality. Subsidiarity can be a &quot;weasel word&quot;
                because of the problems of defining and enforcing it. The
                Assembly must be careful about recommending the pursuit of
                separate regional negotiating lines by, for example, the
                component parts of the United Kingdom. Occasionally, Northern
                Ireland is best served with regard to relative bargaining power
                within the EU by a common United Kingdom position.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The fourth question relating to the Laeken
                declaration addresses the Charter of Fundamental Rights. I
                remain to be convinced about it. If each member country has
                already incorporated the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR),
                as the United Kingdom has done, it is unclear to me what
                additional protection is provided by the EU itself subscribing.
                Incidentally, the Republic of Ireland has yet to subscribe to
                the ECHR.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The final question relating to the Laeken
                declaration is to do with how &quot;more democracy&quot; can be
                promoted within the EU institutions. As Mahatma Ghandi said of
                Western civilisation, &quot;It would be a good idea&quot;. There
                are great concerns with that. Like Ms Morrice, I wonder why
                Council of Ministers’ meetings cannot be held in a more
                transparent way. The European Central Bank in Frankfurt am Main
                is an example of how massively significant decisions are already
                being made in a way that is well out of touch with many of the
                peoples of Europe. Is the common interest rate that is set
                across the euro zone truly appropriate for the South of Ireland,
                which is threatened with inflation and a rise in the price of
                houses and other assets?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The long development of the euro will
                probably require not just the centralisation of monetary
                policy-making, the setting of interest rates, and so on — and,
                indeed, a common European exchange rate relative to the dollar
                and the Japanese yen — but the centralisation of fiscal
                policy, such as taxing and spending power In that regard, there
                may be a time bomb ticking away that has worrying implications
                for Northern Ireland and the entire United Kingdom. Many
                continental European social security systems, and particularly
                their pension systems, have large liabilities building up. It
                must be asked whether, if the United Kingdom joined the euro,
                Northern Ireland would become liable for bailing out the
                Italian, German or French Governments by funding their state
                pension schemes in the future — leading to our citizens
                becoming poorer.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Even the d’Estaing Convention on the Future
                of Europe is less than wholly open, because a 12-member
                presidium decides which issues will be discussed by the
                convention, rather than the 105 members as a whole. The word
                &quot;presidium&quot; is interesting because, I believe, the old
                Soviet Union’s governing Cabinet was called that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not think that an elected President
                would be a good thing. Obviously, those who favour
                euro-federalism can look towards that. I do not think that there
                is a sufficient common European political culture to warrant it,
                although perhaps the Prime Minister is looking for his next job
                — for when he leaves UK politics.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Laeken declaration and associated
                convention are important. However, there is a danger that they
                will remain a babble of conflicting voices. Perhaps I should say
                a &quot;Babel&quot; of conflicting voices — separate voices on
                pro- or anti-federalism or on whether the EU is viewed as a
                destination or a final process. The d’Estaing convention is
                unlikely to parallel the convention of Philadelphia, which
                produced the United States constitution in the late 1780s.
                Europe is not now, and perhaps never will be, ready for a United
                States of Europe.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Armstrong:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many people believe that the treaties on
                which the EU rests have become a tangle of regulations. There is
                a serious lack of clarity surrounding the European articles. It
                is, therefore, necessary that the treaties be simplified for the
                sake of open and accountable government.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is in everyone’s interests that the EU’s
                objectives, powers and policies be unambiguous. There must not
                be codification. I do not want a European superstate, nor a
                one-size-fits-all approach.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Devolution was meant to give us accountable
                and representative government. Therefore, any future convention
                must respect the important role carried out in the Assembly. I
                call for a greater role for regional Assemblies to help maintain
                producers’ incomes, encourage more guarantees in food safety
                and quality, and preserve our rural landscape. The EU was set up
                for practical reasons, and we must ensure that it does not stray
                from those purposes. It should not become something in its own
                right. I urge the Commission to simplify and clarify the common
                agricultural policy, reduce the need for red tape and help
                farmers. There must be an urgent review and fair implementation
                of EU laws.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our sovereign state still has a very real
                part to play in today’s society, especially in the light of
                the massive turnouts for the recent Jubilee celebrations. In the
                aftermath of the Laeken declaration, I call for a more
                accountable EU that will not impinge on matters concerning our
                regional and national legislatures.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Shannon:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Laeken declaration broke new ground when
                15 Prime Ministers referred to constitutional regions and
                invited them to play their full part in the debate on the future
                of Europe. As individuals and elected representatives, we are
                probably more familiar with EU regulations than most. In the
                past, there have been issues about square strawberries,
                correctly coloured carrots and the diameter and shape of
                bananas. Indeed, it has been said that there is too much
                chocolate in our chocolate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although we are aware of those issues, we
                also find it difficult to understand why regulations should come
                from the EU to do away with things that we have had and that
                have been of no harm to anyone. Those highly publicised issues
                astounded many of us. People wonder what real impact the EU has
                on their daily lives. The Laeken declaration has made a move to
                at least discuss, and, I hope, to address, the problems and the
                perceptions of the EU held by many people here.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee of the Regions should be given
                more powers, which should be enhanced and built upon. People see
                the EU as a source for grants, whether they are for farming or
                other issues, or for peace money to address community problems.
                That is the perception that many people have of the EU. As some
                Members said, it is a way to get money to use here. We are all
                aware that we pay out more than we receive.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our Objective 1 status will disappear in a
                few years. In tandem with that, other countries will be admitted
                to the EU, which will directly impact upon everyone. The Laeken
                declaration has provided a forum to discuss the changes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The declaration looks at the simplification
                of the treaties, as has been mentioned. No one can say that that
                has happened in the past. Indeed, it has been quite the
                opposite. A tangle of regulations exists instead. People see
                Europe as a bureaucratic nightmare or a web that prevents them
                from getting in or out of the process. They also see it as a
                place where decisions are made, but far divorced from where we
                live and our problems. If European citizens knew what their
                constitutional rights, were that would be an enormous advantage.
                If this process becomes a pretext for centralising power and
                creating a superstate, no one will be interested, so we need to
                be careful what goes forward.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In relation to the limitation, many feel that
                it lacks clarity, with the result that European citizens find it
                difficult to understand how powers are divided between the
                European Union and the member states. They have the impression
                that the European Union intervenes in areas in which it should
                not and, conversely, does not intervene in areas in which action
                at European level is necessary.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some of the issues are raised in the Laeken
                declaration. Subsidiarity is one of the biggest worries, and
                Members have all commented on it. People have said that
                decisions are taken, and I will give one example; other Members
                have given examples that are detrimental and create hardship
                for, for example, the fishing industry. EU decisions are taken
                in Brussels that ignore Northern Ireland as being on the
                periphery of Europe. That has a direct impact on jobs, the
                economy and our business sector. Where is the accountability?
                That is what we want to see coming out of this process —
                accountability. Where is the responsible attitude that should be
                given and, indeed, offered? If it turns out that the Laeken
                declaration is only to be a talking shop, our paper mountain
                will be disastrous. For many of us and for many of the people
                whom we represent, the EU is over there, and we are over here.
                If the Laeken declaration can address that issue, at least we
                are starting to move. I want to see European decisions that
                affect our constituents being discussed openly and in a
                transparent fashion, and with the regions, before any Directive
                whatsoever from Europe is made.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is with great pleasure that I rise to
                close this debate on the future of Europe. It is important to
                point out at this stage that I am only closing this debate in
                the House. The debate generally in Northern Ireland and Europe
                on the future of Europe is only just beginning. I welcome the
                contributions made by many Members today, and I would like to
                respond to some of the issues raised. First, however, I want to
                talk about the context in which we approach the issues raised in
                the debate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">James Leslie drew attention to our desire to
                engage the Assembly and, indeed, wider civic society in Northern
                Ireland on the issues involved in the whole question of the
                future of Europe. Today’s debate is part of our engagement
                with the Assembly, and, in addition, we will be talking about
                this regularly to the Committee of the Centre. The conference
                that we plan for 27 June is part of the process of working with
                civic society. It will focus on the future of Europe, but its
                purpose goes wider than that. The conference will be the first
                step towards an EU forum, which will draw in the key sectors of
                our society, and enable us, not only to consider the future of
                Europe, but to address regularly and continuously the question
                of how we work together to deal with the issues that arise out
                of our membership of the European Union. It should also help to
                maximise our contribution to the European Union and the benefit
                that we derive from membership.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a need to take a step back from the
                day-to-day activity of politics and life and consider Northern
                Ireland’s place as a region of the European Union and what its
                place should be. The European Union institutions cover a huge
                range of issues. Some have greater importance and resonance here
                than others do, but we need to focus our reference on what is
                really important to us. To attempt to range over all the issues
                addressed by the European Union would be futile and a waste of
                our efforts.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.45 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To that end, I am pleased to report that last
                week the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First
                Minister, working with the Department of Finance and Personnel,
                agreed projects on which the assistance of the Northern Ireland
                Centre in Europe (NICE) would be sought. Members have
                consistently pointed out the need to use the expertise that NICE
                has built up over years — in my case, they have been pushing
                at an open door. For a considerable time, I have been convinced
                that the Executive must supplement their existing efforts by
                using people with expertise based on experience derived from
                working with key players in the European scene and from dealing
                with European matters in Northern Ireland and further afield.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have put a means of utilising that
                expertise into place. In the coming months, NICE will lead, and
                seek to support, a process from which we hope a vision of
                Northern Ireland as a region of the EU will emerge. NICE will
                work in participation with the key sectors. The work will be
                publicly available, and I look forward to a tangible outcome
                that will assist the Executive and the key sectors in Northern
                Ireland society to develop new thinking and new ways of doing
                things. It will be an outward-looking expression of our role.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Minister Leslie has already reflected on our
                work to develop an EU strategy. That strategy will draw together
                departmental priorities and needs alongside the wider EU policy
                context. We have met departmental Ministers to identify the
                issues to be addressed, as well as the clear priorities already
                established in areas such as agriculture and the environment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The strategy, on which we shall elaborate,
                will also examine our influence on the UK Government’s
                position overall and our means of interaction, both with the
                other devolved Administrations in Cardiff and Edinburgh and with
                the Government in Dublin.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The debate will deal with the core issues of
                how the EU can be accessible to the people of Europe and how a
                better connection can be made in the context of enlargement and
                against the background of citizens who feel increasingly remote
                from Government, particularly from the EU institutions. The
                debate is very important, and I am glad that Jane Morrice
                emphasised that so vigorously. We cannot afford to stay out of
                the debate; we should enter it and think our way through it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As members of the European Community, we have
                a voice on how Europe should be shaped for the future; that
                voice should be heard. As Europeans, we have an interest in how
                an enlarged EU will operate and what that will mean for Northern
                Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a region, Northern Ireland needs to
                consider what place regions should have in an enlarged EU. That
                was a constant theme in the contributions to today’s debate.
                We must also reflect on the influence we have, and on how that
                can be best targeted for maximum impact.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those are among the core questions to be
                addressed in the debate. Today we have begun to debate them, and
                they will be discussed for some time to come. It was not our
                intention to reach conclusions today, but rather to open up
                those ideas for further examination and exploration.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to reflect on some of the ideas that
                today’s debate offered. First, I welcome the contribution by
                Mr Poots on behalf of the Committee of the Centre. I am sorry
                that he is not present. His measured contribution helpfully
                teased out several core issues for the Convention on the Future
                of Europe, and those will help in the wider debate we seek to
                develop. As the debate moves forward, I look forward to further
                discussion with him and with the Committee of the Centre.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rather than deal with the contributions in
                detail, I will refer simply to the themes that arose in the
                speeches. Common to almost all contributions was, first of all,
                an insistence on the need for less bureaucracy in European
                decision-making and policy processing. Secondly, Members
                stressed the need for greater simplification of structures and
                instruments to bring the EU closer to people by making it more
                user-friendly and easier to understand. Thirdly, almost all
                Members who spoke were in favour of greater accountability and
                transparency — democratisation — of the EU’s processes,
                although there were differing opinions as to how that might be
                facilitated.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several Members, in particular Ken Robinson,
                stressed the need for formal and informal networking. Mr
                Robinson made the interesting point that that is easier for
                regional legislatures, such as our own, than it is for national
                Parliaments. Also, the need to strengthen the role of the
                regions and to bring decision-making closer to the ground, where
                practical, through the subsidiarity process was a constant
                theme.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Different opinions emerged on the overall
                objective and final shape of Europe. Several Members, including
                Jane Morrice, favoured greater integration of Europe, moving
                towards a more federal, or confederal, model.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members disagreed on the need for a draft
                treaty or a constitution for Europe. Éamonn ONeill suggested
                that, if there were such a process, there should be a referendum
                to give the new European arrangements greater legitimacy. Jane
                Morrice mentioned the possibility of having an elected
                presidency in Europe to give greater popular involvement in
                decision-making. The possibility of a second chamber was
                mentioned, and there was constant reference to the need to more
                clearly delineate the competencies of the various levels of
                decision-making in the EU.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Éamonn ONeill referred to the need to
                balance the regulation of the free market and the promotion of
                industrial and economic development with the continued
                elaboration and development of a European social model. He spoke
                of the need to have regard for the EU’s global
                responsibilities for international development and peacekeeping.
                He also dwelt on the issue of human rights and equality.
                However, not all Members who spoke agreed with him.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Oliver Gibson made an interesting point about
                the SDLP abandoning Nationalism. I am sorry to contradict him,
                but my party continues to believe in the national ideal of a
                united Ireland, and that is what Nationalism means in the
                context of Irish politics. However, Nationalism in Europe means
                something quite different. It represents tattooed bully-boy
                skinheads in jackboots who enforce racist views that would not
                find widespread sympathy in this community. Mr Gibson also
                accused my party of abandoning National Socialism. Given that it
                has never adopted a National Socialist model, I find that theory
                interesting.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Birnie made a considered speech that gave
                me food for thought. I understand his point about the federal
                model in the United States and the gradual and seemingly
                inexorable expansion of federal power. If the United States
                model were the only federal model, that would be a fair point.
                As Dr Birnie said, latent power in the United States lies with
                the federal Government, and only specified powers rest with the
                states. The reverse is the case in Canada and Australia, for
                instance. The powers of the federal Governments in those
                countries are delineated in their constitutions, and all latent
                or residual powers lie with the provinces and the states.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Birnie:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I may be wrong, but I understand that that is
                precisely the situation with the American constitution: it
                confers defined powers to the federal Government. It is
                principally the provision on the regulation of interstate
                commerce that, over the past 200 years, has allowed the gradual
                drift to Washington DC.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Haughey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was going to make that point. The Supreme
                Court has been the motor for the expansion of federal power in
                the United States because its expansionism rests on provisions
                such as interstate commerce. The exact case that gave rise to
                that was the Schechter Poultry Corporation v. United States —
                I am showing off slightly there.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, Dr Birnie raised several interesting
                points. He legitimately questioned the effect of the net inward
                transfer of resources from the European Union. He questioned the
                extent to which that has been responsible for economic
                development here, and whether its contribution was a lasting
                one. Net inward transfers have made a useful input to our
                infrastructure’s development. However, they have not been as
                important a factor in our economic growth as they have been in
                the Republic of Ireland, where they have made a useful impact.
                If net inward transfers of wealth were the key factor in
                generating economic growth, then, given that every year we
                derive approximately £4·5 billion more from the Exchequer in
                London than we generate, our economic growth rate should be
                about 10 times that of the Republic — but it is not. One must
                question where the wellsprings of economic growth are. Dr Birnie
                appropriately raised the matter, and it requires further debate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also recognise Dr Birnie’s point about
                the limitations of a common currency on countries such as the
                Republic in determining interest rates, and so forth, to
                regulate the economy and combat inflation. The last time that
                Europe had a common currency was under the Roman Empire, when
                the denarius was used from the Black Sea to the Atlantic. I am
                not sure what they did about interest rates in those days. We
                need to explore those issues, because economies can be regulated
                in ways other than manipulating interest rates.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Having gone over the general themes that
                arose in the debate, I welcome Members’ contributions. This is
                the first stage of a debate that will continue until at least
                2004. We have not sought to set the terms of or limit the debate
                in any way; we have simply reflected the fact that the Executive
                will need, in time, to consider their contribution to the
                Convention on the Future of Europe under the chairmanship of
                Giscard d’Estaing. We will then be able to draw on the views
                raised in this and further debates, in our discussions with the
                Committee of the Centre and in exchanges we conduct in any other
                forum.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We want any input that we make from the
                Administration to the convention to reflect as closely as
                possible the views that are widely held in this society.</p>
