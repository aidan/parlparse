                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is clear that several Members wish to
                raise points of order, which is understandable, and I shall do
                my best to accommodate those requests. However, I caution
                Members and remind them that in criminal matters the sub judice
                rule applies strictly from the moment a person is charged until
                the verdict and sentence have been announced. Members must also
                be aware that as regards parliamentary privilege covering what
                they say in the Chamber, it applies to the law of defamation and
                not to other matters. It will not give them protection, for
                example, in matters of contempt of court, and I draw that to
                Members’ attention.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several Members have indicated that they wish
                to make points of order and I will now try to take them. I will
                be unable to take them in the order that Members wish, but I
                shall do my best to accommodate them. I noticed Mr Conor Murphy’s
                hand first, then Ms Lewsley’s, Dr Paisley’s and Mr Foster’s.
                I shall take those points of order first, then continue.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Will
                you confirm that your Office is investigating the breach of
                Parliament Buildings last Friday morning by armed police who did
                not have a warrant? In that investigation will you address the
                fact that members of my party were not informed by the police or
                Assembly staff that our offices were being searched, sealed off
                and raided?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I confirm to the House that I received notice
                of events taking place here, and briefed the Assembly
                Commission, whose members were with me at the Quebec National
                Assembly, as soon as was possible that morning. At the end of
                the briefing, we agreed that an emergency meeting of the
                Commission would be held today, after Question Time, when a
                report would be made.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also made it my business to request a
                meeting with the Chief Constable, and that meeting was held at
                3.00 pm on Saturday. The Chief Constable has subsequently
                corresponded with me, and that correspondence was received this
                morning. I expect further meetings to take place.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those various matters are for the Speaker and
                the Assembly Commission to attend to, and we are doing so with
                all possible speed and, I hope, with conscientiousness.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, Mr Speaker. Did you have
                any prior knowledge that the police were coming here?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I said earlier, we must be careful about
                the question of sub judice. I understand that charges have been
                preferred, and obviously Friday’s events may bear some
                relation to that. Therefore, I will seek to be as open as I can
                with the House, but it is also my view that when there is a
                cliff one drives as far away from, not as close as possible to,
                the edge of it. I will, therefore, be careful with regard to
                matters of sub judice. I trust that the Member will understand
                if I do not give an answer on the Floor of the House.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Dr Ian Paisley:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker, when you were absent, events took
                place at one of the Doors of the House. Two Members of the
                Assembly were seen on television hastening journalists and
                television cameras into disobeying the order that on entering
                the House, their machines should be checked. The Members were
                then seen escorting the media representatives upstairs to their
                room, without their cameras being checked. That is a breach of
                the security of the House. Anything could have been brought in
                inside those cameras.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The two Members, Mr Gerry Kelly and the
                Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety, then made
                statements, which were clearly heard. It was clear that they
                were justifying what they had done in advocating a breach of the
                security of the House. If the security of the House can be
                breached in that way, nobody’s safety can be guaranteed or
                provided for. If we do not have security of entrance to the
                House, then we have no protection in our offices.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The other matter I wish to raise is that the
                House should have the opportunity to debate the matter. Everyone
                is debating it — in the streets, in homes and schools, and in
                places that people frequent. The House should be discussing this
                urgent business. Mr Speaker, have you called a meeting of the
                Business Committee for it to advise Members when it will let us
                have an immediate discussion and proper, open-ended debate on
                the matter within, of course, the sub judice rules that you
                mentioned?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the question of a breach of security and,
                indeed, breach of privilege that the Member referred to — an
                alleged breach of security and an alleged breach of privilege
                — I have asked for, and have received, some initial reports,
                which I am pursuing. I trust that it will not be out of order to
                say that I have received from Dr Paisley’s Colleague, Mr Peter
                Robinson, a specific letter in relation to the question of
                breach of privilege. I have met the Chairperson of the Committee
                on Standards and Privileges to advise him that he may expect
                questions of privilege to be raised, and I will forward Mr Peter
                Robinson’s letter to him.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are complex matters involved. Several
                bodies in the Assembly may have responsibilities with regard to
                this matter. The Assembly Commission is one, the Committee on
                Standards and Privileges is another, and the Speaker’s Office
                is another. Those are just three examples. I take the matter
                that the Member raises very seriously, and it is being pursued.
                His Colleague has done that in writing, which is entirely
                proper.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have called a meeting of the Business
                Committee for 1.00 pm today, and a meeting of the Assembly
                Commission for after Question Time this afternoon, to address
                the various issues. It is for the Business Committee to decide
                precisely how it handles the requests before it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have noted that there has been debate and
                discussion about these matters in all sorts of places and in the
                press. I have also noted some of the comments reported in the
                press to be factually completely incorrect. Some of those were
                in relation to the House and its staff. It is important to have
                an early debate, but it is also important to have an informed
                debate on the Floor of the House — informed by proper law and
                procedure and by the proper facts. I know that that is what the
                Member and the House in general would want. There is a balance
                to be found between expressing the quite proper feelings of
                anxiety, concern, and indeed anger, which I sense in the Chamber
                and the community, and ensuring that, as is right and proper, it
                is tempered by proper process and by the facts, insofar as we
                are able to discern them at this stage.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Foster:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the light of recent serious developments,
                particularly the implications of the potential threat to Members
                of the House, and being aware that the First Minister will meet
                the Prime Minister tomorrow, I propose that the proceedings of
                the Assembly —</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Order. The Member will resume his seat. He
                knows perfectly well that what he is doing is not a point of
                order — it is entirely out of order, and I am not prepared to
                accept it. I shall say no more about that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will say that, when I met the Chief
                Constable on Saturday, I received an assurance that the security
                of the House had not been prejudiced, or rather, the most
                accurate way to put it is that there was no evidence that that
                was the case. I trust that that is of some small assistance to
                Members, in view of what the Member alleged earlier.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr C Wilson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker, some two weeks ago, I brought to
                your attention my concerns about security in and around
                Parliament Buildings at Stormont. In light of that, Mr Speaker,
                and as an interim step while these matters are being considered
                and discussed, I ask you to approach the Police Service of
                Northern Ireland to ensure that it has a greater presence —
                or, indeed, a presence per se, because police officers are not
                presently in evidence — in the Building. Without any slur on
                the work of the doorkeepers and those responsible for internal
                security, given the grave situation that we face, I suggest that
                there should be a greater police presence.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The referral of this matter to the Business
                Committee and the Assembly Commission creates a dilemma, because
                Sinn Féin is represented on those bodies. That causes me grave
                concerns. Can I just say —</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Order. I think that I have been reasonably
                flexible with regard to points of order. I am assuming that the
                point of order that the Member raises is in respect of whether
                it is in order for him to ask for some review of security.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to matters of security, the
                Assembly Commission has responsibility, but took an early
                decision to devolve that responsibility to me, as Speaker. I
                take that very seriously. I take seriously the concerns that the
                Member raised with me some time ago, and the question of proper
                security arrangements here. That has been a matter of ongoing
                and regular discussion, meetings and correspondence, and
                substantial and energetic activity by our staff internally. I
                take on board the concerns that the Member raises, but it would
                not be proper for me to discuss security on the Floor of the
                House. Indeed, that would be particularly inappropriate to the
                Member’s point of order if he considers what he has said.</p>

                significant. They could not be justified unless there was
                significant cause for the police to enter the Building. I do not
                believe that the police would have acted without that just
                cause. It seems to be imperative that there is a debate in the
                Assembly at the earliest possible moment to consider those
                issues. I assume that in the interrupted attempt by the Ulster
                Unionists to make a contribution, there is a willingness on
                their part to have a special recognition of the impact of those
                events felt in the Assembly. Therefore, I trust that they will
                support the Democratic Unionist Party in the Business Committee

                past a security check, without their being checked in person and
                the proper arrangements being made. They rushed them into a
                lift, took them through parts of the Building that are not
                specified for that purpose and engaged in activity that is not

                requirement for you to do so on the Floor of the House. I have
                accepted your correspondence, on what I regard as a very serious
                matter. I have met the Chairperson of the Committee on Standards
                and Privileges, and the matter will be pursued. If there is a

                implied that you had indicated to the Chairperson of the
                Committee on Standards and Privileges that the issue would be
                raised. If you are saying that you are happy to refer the matter
                to the Committee, I am content to leave it there. That would be

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member raised one or two other points. He
                referred to a point of order that I aborted earlier. The reason
                that I did so is that it is not in order to simply stand up on
                the Floor of the House and propose a motion, which is what was
                being attempted. That is not in order; nor is it in order — as
                the Member knows because he has on occasion tried it in the past
                — for an emergency debate to be proposed on the Floor of the
                House. What is possible is for the Business Committee to meet
                and to address the question of whether it is agreeable to
                business being taken. That is the purpose of the meeting today
                at 1.00 pm. What the Business Committee itself decides is
                another matter entirely.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker, you have rightly pointed out that
                there are concerns inside and outside the Chamber about all the
                events that occurred on Friday. It is certainly serious for
                anyone — any organisation or any party — who plays fast and
                loose with the Good Friday Agreement. That extends to more than
                one person and to more than one party in the Chamber.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker, in your capacity as Speaker of
                the House and in your particular responsibility for security in
                the House, you referred to conversations that you have had and
                correspondence that you have received from the Chief Constable.
                Would it be in order for you to share further with the Assembly
                the content of both those conversations and any letter or
                correspondence you received from the Chief Constable on events
                that occurred in the Building on Friday? If you are not now in a
                position to share that with the Assembly, when will you be able
                to share the content of the conversations and the
                correspondence?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is in order for the Member to put the
                point of order, but it would not be in order for me to divulge
                the contents of the conversations or the correspondence at this
                stage, not least because the matter is sub judice — as he,
                being a lawyer, will know — and also because there are certain
                conversations on matters of security which it is inappropriate
                to address in any case. There will be a meeting of the
                Commission this afternoon; I will, again, brief the Commission
                as fully as I am able. I have referred to an earlier briefing,
                and I will keep the Commission as informed as I possibly can.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is not unlikely that at some stage, when
                issues of sub judice and so on are not around, it may well be
                that I will have to make reference to the implications of such
                events in my capacity as Speaker, as Chairperson of the Assembly
                Commission and as having responsibility as the Member describes.
                I trust that he will understand that I am being as open as I
                possibly can, but there are certain things that it is neither
                right nor proper for me to speak about on the Floor of the
                House, particularly at this time.</p>

                they might be vulnerable in this context. What the Member said

                people who searched the Sinn Féin support offices on Friday
                morning? Was any member of your staff present when that

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I understand the Member’s questions and the
                import of them. I am not in a position to respond, because of
                the sub judice rule that I have already mentioned. The Member
                will not have to think very hard before he finds the connection
                between charges that have been preferred and the question of sub
                judice. It is not in anyone’s interests for interference in
                the proper due process to be embarked upon.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In respect of the second aspect of the Member’s
                question, he and his Colleagues will know that we have
                procedures when any search is taking place, either in this
                context or in other more prophylactic contexts. I am assured —
                because I have asked — that those proper procedures were
                followed by our staff. I cannot say further than that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the Member has concerns on that, or on any
                other score, I would welcome his bringing those directly to my
                attention. I did receive a formal complaint from one of his
                Colleagues on behalf of his party, and that matter is being
                taken very seriously. I have subsequently met the Member to

                simply suspend the proceedings. Standing Orders are clear on
                when suspensions may take place. It is not simply a matter for
                the Speaker to suspend proceedings of his own volition. What the

                security vetting procedures for officials of the Assembly, and
                if you have not already done that, would you consider it? Should
                that also be extended to cover staff employed on a temporary
                basis by parties here? Clearly there are grave implications if
                the least of the allegations made is proved to be correct.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the light of the tremendous interest that
                there is in the country in relation to those issues, it is
                clearly the desire of some Members that we should not simply
                proceed in the normal way.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I therefore propose that Standing Orders be
                suspended, particularly Standing Order 10 and such other
                Standing Orders as are necessary, to allow forthwith a debate in
                relation to the issues which have come before us, particularly
                as it would make no sense to proceed with business as normal.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to the Member’s first question,
                I do not feel at liberty to discuss all that we are doing on the
                security side. I try to reassure the House that we are doing all
                that is appropriate, but one must handle things in a proper
                fashion, and that is what I am trying to do. I trust that
                Members will, for good reason, feel reassured as to how we are
                handling things.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I must remind the House of what I said
                earlier. Simply because one finds reports in newspapers does not
                mean that they are the truth. There are certainly a number of
                reports with a bearing on recent events that I know to be
                completely and factually incorrect — to my certain knowledge.
                I trust that that in itself is of some help to Colleagues.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dodds will know that even a proposal to
                suspend Standing Orders is a motion which must be presented in
                the Order Paper — and I think that he may have done so in the
                past, for various reasons, in his ministerial capacity. I hear
                what the Member says, but the order is that it must be on foot
                of a motion and, therefore, it is not possible at this stage.</p>

                dogs in the streets know is inextricably linked to a violent
                terrorist organisation, namely the Provisional IRA — should
                remain in ministerial office over the law-abiding people of
                Northern Ireland? The demand of the public is that action be
                taken now to remove Sinn Féin/IRA, and surely the Assembly has
                a duty to act.</p>

                there is also order. The Standing Order is quite clear. The
                Member may table an exclusion motion if he has sufficient
                support. If he checks the Standing Orders and he has sufficient
                support, he knows very well the route to my office, because he
                and his Colleagues take it from time to time. The provision for
                the presentation, and the requirements for the passage, of any
                such motion are present in Standing Orders. The Member is aware
                of it and has experience of doing it. It is all there. It is not
                a question of duty or anything else. It is there, and if the
                Member and his Colleagues wish to pick it up and run with it,
                they know the Standing Orders and the procedures that are there.</p>

                Is it not a fact that you have received such a motion, signed by
                Members of the House? In fact, the DUP is just waiting for the
                other Members, namely the Ulster Unionists, to sign the

                was as a direct result of a request that you made to them for

                IRA/Sinn Féin in the House as to their behaviour in the breach
                of security on Friday? Is it not odd that members of Sinn Féin
                are so concerned about proper search warrants when they do not
                seem to have any difficulty when their crowd break into

                irresponsible for me not to have sought such a meeting. The
                Chief Constable was most constructive in the conversations that
                we had. He then responded to me in writing as an interim to
                further conversations that we intend to have, and I trust that
                they will be held soon. No one should jump to conclusions about

                for all Members, but, on security matters, I do not put any of
                them in the same position as the Chief Constable of the police,
                who has particular responsibilities in these matters. As far as
                questions of privilege, and breaches of privilege by anyone in
                the House, are concerned, I have already advised the Member’s
                Colleagues that I am addressing that matter. That, therefore, is
                not a new point of order. However, if he really wants me to
                regard the Chief Constable in the same light, and with the same
                responsibilities, as others that he has mentioned, I am afraid

                addressing the matter. However, I would like to think about
                whether it is the only way. There are many creative politicians
                here and many different ways in which things can be achieved.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, Mr Speaker. One
                expression of the creative nature of the politicians here was
                the view that David Trimble would be saved by the storm troopers
                who were put in here on Friday. Will you confirm that you will
                ask the head of the storm troopers — the direct descendants of
                the B-Specials — if their weapons were put through the
                Assembly’s scanning equipment? Will you treat them as
                intruders?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Order. I listened with care to what the
                Member said. I would be cautious to confirm very much, given
                some of the references that he made, save to say that I take
                seriously the concerns which underlie what he said, and they
                form part of our exploration of matters. As I said, an initial
                report will be brought to the Assembly Commission. However, it
                will be only an initial report because there are legal and other
                complexities which require further investigation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Being patient is not a problem for me, but,
                in all fairness, the Minister of Agriculture has been patiently
                waiting to make a statement to the House.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The seventh meeting of the North/South
                Ministerial Council in its agriculture sectoral format was held
                at the St Patrick Centre, Downpatrick on Friday 27 September
                2002. I chaired the meeting and was accompanied by Mr James
                Leslie, junior Minister in the Office of the First Minister and
                the Deputy First Minister, who has also agreed the content of
                this statement. The Irish Government were represented by Mr Joe
                Walsh TD, Minister for Agriculture and Food, and Mr Éamon Ó
                Cuív TD, Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The recent restructuring of Government
                Departments in the South meant that the majority of items
                discussed at the September meeting fell within Minister Walsh’s
                area of responsibility. Minister Ó Cuív’s Department has
                specific responsibility for the item relating to cross-border
                rural development.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council considered a paper on
                co-operation in the field of animal health and noted that it had
                previously agreed to the establishment of an animal health
                steering group and some working groups tasked with examining
                specific issues. In relation to those issues, the Council noted
                a paper stating the principal policy differences, the
                possibilities of convergence and the timetable for action to
                achieve such convergence. The Council endorsed the paper as a
                further contribution to the development of an all-island animal
                health strategy and acknowledged that further progress on
                aligning policies and measures was fundamental to the
                development of the strategy. The Council noted the indicative
                timetable for convergence and also agreed that officials should
                seek to finalise discussions with the authorities in Great
                Britain before final agreement of the strategy by the
                North/South Ministerial Council.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council also considered a progress report
                on the work of the steering committee on cross-border rural
                development. In April 2002 the Council endorsed the principle of
                an area-based approach to cross-border rural development, and at
                the September meeting it was agreed that the steering committee
                should initiate action to invite applications from partnerships
                for the selection of four or five geographically defined border
                areas under INTERREG. The Council noted that the steering
                committee would have to give further consideration to an
                appropriate response to the recommendations arising out of the
                cross-border education, training and research study. The Council
                was pleased to note that the Rural Community Network and Irish
                Rural Link have been successful in their application to deliver
                the cross-border community development measure of Peace. The
                total aid being provided amounts to 970,000 euros. The aim of
                the measure is to provide support for the development of a
                cross-border strategy to address the problems of weak community
                infrastructure and marginalisation in border communities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council then considered a paper on plant
                health, pesticides, diagnostics and research co-operation and
                noted the continued level of cross-border activity in that
                sector since the last meeting and new developments with the
                pesticides monitoring and registration review. The Council also
                noted the proposal to organise reciprocal familiarisation
                visits, workshops, training and ring tests for diagnostic
                purposes as a means of improving cross-border scientific and
                technical co-operation in plant health, including forestry.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council agreed that Departments, North
                and South, should explore the establishment of a plant health
                risk assessment panel and approve the identification of lead
                figures in each jurisdiction to initiate and develop effective
                cross-border action.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council had an initial discussion of
                issues relating to EU matters and areas of co-operation within
                each sector that could be proposed for the future North/South
                Ministerial Council work programme. Those discussions arose from
                a commitment reached at the fourth plenary meeting of the
                North/South Ministerial Council, which was held in Armagh on 28
                June 2002.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council then considered salary increases
                for chief executive officers of North/South implementation
                bodies, and, subject to the approval of Finance Ministers,
                approved salaries and salary range increases for chief executive
                officers based in Northern Ireland, with effect from 1 April
                2002. It was proposed that this year’s annual increase for all
                chief executive officers based in Northern Ireland should be
                based on Senior Northern Ireland Civil Service pay increases.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council also agreed that its next meeting
                would take place in the South, in December 2002. The text of a
                communiqué for issue after the meeting was agreed upon, and a
                copy has been placed in the Assembly Library.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have particular interest in the convergence
                and harmonisation of animal health policies, of which there are
                many, on both sides of the border, so that there is an
                all-Ireland system. The steering group on animal health was to
                produce an animal health policy by 31 September. Is that still

                finalise the all-island animal health strategy by the end of the
                year. The differences between North and South are outlined in
                the matrix. There are differences of approach in dealing with
                brucellosis and tuberculosis. I will take account of the
                consultation on the review of brucellosis and tuberculosis and
                of the policy in the South.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Northern Ireland differs in its approach to
                sheep identification. I am considering bringing forward
                proposals on that issue later in the year.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the South, measures are being introduced
                to mirror the action taken to control Aujeszky’s disease in

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Salaries for chief executive officers differ

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to the plant health risk
                assessment panel, has the Minister taken any note of the grave
                concerns in Northern Ireland about the introduction of
                genetically modified organisms, given that some testing is
                ongoing in the South? Will she do anything to ensure that
                Northern Ireland can maintain its current green image and remain
                GM-free?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is no question of introducing GM
                organisms into Northern Ireland. The Executive have not taken a
                position on that. I can only give my party’s position, which
                is very much opposed to the introduction of GM organisms into
                Northern Ireland. The Executive have not yet discussed the
                matter, but I do not imagine that there will be much enthusiasm

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My policy review on brucellosis and TB is
                currently out to consultation. There are points of difference
                between here and the Republic — the capping of compensation
                payments, for instance. Those are quite controversial issues.
                When I get the result of the consultation, I will consider it
                carefully and discuss it with the Committee for Agriculture and
                Rural Development and the Assembly before making a final
                decision. Given that disease does not recognise the border, I
                want to work towards having similar, converging policies, North
                and South. There are implications for both sides if there are
                different policies.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In view of the current political climate,
                would the collapse or suspension of the institutions have
                implications for the work in hand in the North/South Ministerial
                Council, especially on the negotiations preceding the mid-term
                review of the common agricultural policy (CAP)?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Rodgers:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would be extremely concerned if the
                institutions were to collapse, and the agriculture industry
                would have particular reason for concern. The Member asked about
                the mid-term review of the CAP. It is no secret that Northern
                Ireland and — I was going to say UK, but — English interests
                have very different priorities. The UK Minister will have
                different views, and a Minister appointed through direct rule to
                represent Northern Ireland will, of course, take the UK Minister’s
                line. To put it mildly, that would not be helpful to us in the
                run-up to those negotiations, especially considering the dynamic
                that has been introduced through the North/South Ministerial
                Council, whose agreed priorities have been endorsed by the
                Assembly and in the South. Again, those priorities are not
                similar to those expressed by the UK Minister.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A return to direct rule would rob Northern
                Ireland of the important opportunity to have its own voice in
                negotiations and to articulate the priorities for the industry
                here. That is not a political point; rather it is one that
                indicates the practical reality that the farming community will
                face.</p>

                </font></b><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have received notice from the Minister of
                the Environment that he wishes to make a statement on water
                quality and planning.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister of the Environment (Mr Nesbitt):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am putting the following remarks on the
                public record for at least two reasons. First, the construction
                industry, potential householders and other sectors need clarity
                and certainty. Secondly, this is a matter of genuine and general
                public interest to elected representatives and their
                constituents.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Downpatrick provided an early example of an
                unfolding problem, and Members may recall the debate in the
                Assembly. At that time we sought, and achieved, a solution to
                the difficulties experienced in the Downpatrick area. As I did
                not want that situation to be constantly repeated across
                Northern Ireland, thus giving rise to continued uncertainty, I
                implemented the following approach to address the wider issues
                across Northern Ireland: to analyse the problem, thus providing
                a context for developing a solution and, in the meantime,
                holding applications recommended for refusal by the Environment
                and Heritage Service (EHS); to consider what we should do, how
                we should do it and to set a clear timetable for achieving an
                outcome; to provide a mechanism to evaluate and review progress
                regularly in striving to meet that timescale; and, having agreed
                the way forward, to inform the House and the public fully and
                promptly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members are well aware that Northern Ireland’s
                sewerage infrastructure falls well below modern standards. As
                the environmental regulator, I have worked with Mr Peter
                Robinson, because the operation of the sewerage system is the
                responsibility of the Department for Regional Development. The
                Department for Regional Development also has a clear duty
                through its Water Service to comply with EU and domestic
                water-quality standards.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members are also aware that the Department of
                the Environment’s Planning Service has been holding — I
                emphasise not refusing — some applications in some areas as a
                result of concerns expressed by the Environment and Heritage
                Service about the environmental compliance and pollution
                implications of further development pending urgent consideration
                of the way forward by both my Department and the Department for
                Regional Development.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I take this opportunity to do two things.
                First, I would like to explain why it was necessary to hold some
                applications. Secondly, I would like to explain the agreed way
                forward. I have already referred to deficiencies in the sewerage
                infrastructure. It has been recognised that they are not the
                fault of this devolved Administration; rather they reflect the
                decades of underinvestment before the matters became a local
                responsibility. As environmental regulator, I am concerned about
                those deficiencies. Peter Robinson and the Department for
                Regional Development, as operators of the system, are also
                concerned.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The deficiencies exist within an increasingly
                stringent legal and environmental framework. In particular, the
                EU Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive introduces increasingly
                demanding standards for sewage treatment and effluent discharges
                to our watercourses. Domestic environmental standards are also
                tougher. The Assembly will recall the Public Accounts Committee
                report on river pollution that called on my Department, and the
                Environment and Heritage Service in particular, to take a much
                more rigorous approach to environmental regulation, not least in
                respect of discharges from waste water treatment works. The law
                is now much less tolerant of pollution than it was before, and
                that trend is continuing.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To illustrate the point, I will use two
                important indicators that are monitored by the Environment and
                Heritage Service in its role as environmental regulator. First,
                compliance of sewage treatment works with EU standards fell from
                53% in 2000 to 35% in 2001. Secondly, compliance with domestic
                standards fell from 81% in 2000 to 57% in 2001. That compares
                with 95% compliance in England and Wales for at least the past
                five years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important to note that the situation
                reflects the increased stringency of the regulatory standards
                and not an overall deterioration in the system’s performance.
                This forms the background against which the Environment and
                Heritage Service and the Planning Service operate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Furthermore, it is important to understand
                that my Department has a statutory duty to promote the
                conservation and cleanliness of Northern Ireland’s water
                resources and waterways. In that context, and in the light of
                the significant reduction in Water Service compliance with EU
                and domestic standards, the Environment and Heritage Service
                expressed concern about the implications of further development
                with regard to environmental compliance and pollution risks in
                56 locations across Northern Ireland. The concerns identified by
                the Environment and Heritage Service were sufficiently serious
                to raise complex and far-reaching legal, environmental,
                operational and resource issues. Those issues touched on the
                functions of the Department for Regional Development’s Water
                Service as well as those of the Department of the Environment’s
                Environment and Heritage Service and Planning Service.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Initial legal advice emphasised the need for
                a precautionary approach, taking account of both European and
                domestic law, and for careful consideration of the issues. The
                Planning Service therefore decided to hold — again, I
                emphasise &quot;hold&quot; and not &quot;refuse&quot; —
                planning applications for developments that the Environment and
                Heritage Service had recommended for refusal pending detailed
                examination of the issues.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That examination has proved more complex and
                has taken longer than we wished. It has, undoubtedly, been a
                source of real difficulty and concern for the construction
                industry as well as for actual and potential householders. I
                have met with representatives of the industry several times, and
                the Quarry Producers Association, and have apprised them of our
                deliberations. I have kept the Executive and the Committee for
                the Environment fully apprised, and I have met several
                delegations regarding the issue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Needless to say, the linked issues required
                the Department of the Environment and the Department for
                Regional Development, Peter Robinson and myself to work closely
                together, as well as consideration by the Executive as a whole.
                The essence of that work has been a location-by-location
                examination of the compliance problems and the work needed to
                resolve them together with a comparison of the projects and
                priorities in the Water Service capital works programme. The aim
                was to determine whether the necessary improvement work is
                programmed and over what period. I am grateful to Peter Robinson
                and his staff for their efforts in undertaking the work.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am glad that that co-operation has allowed
                us to develop a pragmatic approach, designed to balance the need
                for physical development with the need to protect the
                environment. It is important to emphasise that balance — or
                compromise, if you like — is at the heart of the issues I am
                reporting to the Assembly today. The approach that we, as
                Executive Ministers, have adopted reflects an acknowledgement
                that an absolute constraint on development in those areas with a
                significant degree of non-compliance with environmental
                standards until such time as the deficiencies in the sewerage
                infrastructure can be corrected would have a crippling effect on
                physical development across Northern Ireland. Such an approach,
                despite the high level of environmental protection it would have
                afforded, would have carried a high price in respect of
                constraints in economic growth and social progress.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I shall now turn to the agreed way forward
                and address four aspects of the issue. First, there are the
                environmental considerations. The joint Environment and Heritage
                Service/Water Service examination of the 56 locations identified
                14 areas where the environmental impact is low. Remedial works
                in the current Water Service capital works programme should be
                completed within three years at five of those locations, and
                within five years at a further seven locations. No remedial
                works are planned for the remaining two areas. However, because
                of the low environmental impact, the Environment and Heritage
                Service will not object to the granting of planning permission.
                The Planning Service will complete the processing of the
                affected applications and will issue decisions. Where the
                decision is to approve the application, development may normally
                begin immediately.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the remaining 42 locations, where the
                environmental impact is medium or high, remedial works are
                scheduled for completion within three years at 23 locations and
                within five years at a further 19 locations. In those cases, the
                Environment and Heritage Service will alert the Planning Service
                to the environmental issues, but will not object to the granting
                of planning permission. Moreover, in those cases the Planning
                Service will complete the processing of affected applications,
                issue decisions and, if approved, work may normally begin
                immediately. A complete list of the 56 locations, together with
                an environmental comment, will be available at the following web
                site: www.ehsni.gov.uk.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I emphasise that, in the context of
                development control, the Environment and Heritage Service
                provides advice; it does not direct the Planning Service. The
                Planning Service will, as it must, determine each planning
                application on its merits, taking into account all relevant
                factors, including the Environment and Heritage Service’s
                advice.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The result of that approach is that those
                planning applications that have been held on a precautionary
                basis pending an examination of the issues, and future planning
                applications in all 56 locations, will be processed to decision.
                Although I appreciate that that will be welcome news to the
                construction industry and more generally, I also acknowledge
                that it means that developments will continue to connect to the
                public sewer in areas where the current inadequacy of the sewage
                collection and treatment systems is having a high or medium
                environmental impact, and will continue to do so for some years,
                pending completion of the Water Service’s capital works
                programme.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As environmental regulator, that situation
                does not rest comfortably with me, nor does it, I am sure, with
                Members. The Executive have adopted that pragmatic approach to
                protect people’s jobs and livelihoods and to ensure that the
                objectives for economic growth and social progress outlined in
                the Programme for Government are not jeopardised.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the first instance, our approach is based
                on the Water Service’s commitment to deliver the capital works
                programme as currently planned, subject to the completion of
                statutory processes. In considering future funding, the
                Executive have not agreed any increase in the capital budget for
                the Department for Regional Development’s Water Service. At my
                request, and to inform the Executive’s discussion, the
                Minister for Regional Development, Mr Peter Robinson, provided a
                paper outlining the additional resources that the Water Service
                would need to provide interim solutions at some locations in
                advance of the main schemes, to settle the advance plans’
                start dates at other locations, and to undertake by traditional
                procurement some schemes currently comprising a public-private
                partnership/private finance initiative package. The Executive
                noted the paper and agreed to consider the way ahead in Water
                Service investment as part of the infrastructure strategy to be
                developed between now and the final Budget in December.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To assist their consideration, the Executive
                agreed to commission from Peter Robinson further details of the
                costs that he provided and his proposals for meeting them,
                including his plans for re-prioritisation and restructuring.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My officials in the Environment and Heritage
                Service will monitor progress carefully in the capital works
                programme and the continuing environmental impact of
                development, especially in the high-and medium-impact locations.
                They will work closely and at senior level with Water Service
                officials. My aim is to avoid any serious exacerbation of
                pollution in those areas. I therefore caution that, in the
                longer term, it may not be sustainable to continue to connect
                developments to non-compliant sewerage systems in which remedial
                works remain some way off. However, I will keep the situation
                under continuous review, considering the balance between
                environmental protection and facilitating development, and will
                do so in an open and transparent way, fully involving the
                Chamber and the industry.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Peter Robinson and I have agreed that
                developers should also introduce proposals to meet
                infrastructure deficiencies, and we will encourage them to do
                so. It is to be hoped that my statement provides certainty and
                clarity for the construction industry and actual, or potential,
                householders who have been affected by the problem. I am mindful
                that continuing to hold up planning applications could have
                drastic implications for house supply and house prices and could
                potentially destabilise the housing market, which is a vital
                element of the Northern Ireland economy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Therefore, we have identified the source,
                level and nature of the environmental and legal risks,
                established a clear timetable to deal with funding issues, which
                is a vital element of the approach that I have outlined today,
                established clear monitoring and review mechanisms by way of a
                close and clear relationship between the Department of the
                Environment and the Department for Regional Development, and
                sought to encourage opportunities for the construction industry
                to assist in the solution of those problems. I commend the
                statement to the Assembly.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Minister’s statement, which
                is much needed. The Minister has made the best of an extremely
                bad job in trying to make some sense of the issue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must comply with the stringent — the
                Minister’s word — European legal environmental framework,
                which is enshrined in the EU Urban Waste Water Directive. Our
                almost-obsolete sewerage systems hold effluent that goes into
                the river system; that concerns me. Eutrophication of our rivers
                and lakes is a problem, and in the Lough Erne system we have not
                only our own system, but the problem of pollution coming from
                the Republic of Ireland. I ask the Minister to consider that,
                because it concerns me greatly. Water is abstracted from the
                Lough Erne system and goes into domestic water, so I hope that
                the Minister will consider all those standards.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Minister’s report, and I look
                forward to its being implemented as soon as possible.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Member for saying that I am
                making the best of a bad job. However, it is the usual saying:
                you cannot control the hand of cards that you are dealt; it is
                how you play that hand.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs Carson mentioned eutrophication and
                pollution from the Republic of Ireland. Under the EU Urban Waste
                Water Directive, we are considering river basins and how water
                should be standardised. Part of that process involves
                cross-border work, because at least one of the basins is
                transnational between Northern Ireland and the Republic of
                Ireland. All those issues will be dealt with in due course.
                There is no quick fix to the problem of river pollution.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Minister for his statement, which
                everybody welcomes. The statement and the proposed action aim to
                create certainty and clarity. However, I am not certain that
                that will have been achieved as a result of the statement,
                because it is so dependent on getting a clear timetable for the
                Department for Regional Development to deal with the funding
                issues. Clarity and certainty are also dependent on the creation
                of monitoring and review mechanisms.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will the Minister assure the Assembly that
                that timetable for funding can be reached fairly quickly to
                provide clarity and certainty for the public?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Nesbitt:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank Mr Alban Maginness for saying that
                everybody welcomes my statement. I am beginning to worry whether
                people from all sides welcome it, but I take the point.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As regards certainty and clarity, we all
                remember the debate about development in Downpatrick. I did some
                interviews then, and the word &quot;widespread&quot; was used.
                The question was asked about where the next development would
                take place. I said that we should put a hold on development and
                ascertain the depth of the planning problem. I am clarifying
                where the 56 problems are, their depth from an environmental
                perspective, and when there is likely to be a capital works
                programme to rectify those difficulties.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Maginness said that he was unsure about
                the clarity of the matter. There are two financial elements.
                There is the capital works programme to which the Department for
                Regional Development agreed. It was on that basis alone that I
                gave the chronological listing of up to three years or up to
                five years. Having said that, the reinvestment and reform
                initiative and various other programmes are necessary, and the
                Executive have commissioned the Minister for Regional
                Development to introduce further information. I cannot answer
                that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have identified the problem from a planning
                point of view, brought it to the public domain and made everyone
                aware of the implications. I have no doubt that Members often
                hear about constituents’ housing concerns on this. I have
                given the issue a space for planning development to take place,
                and I look to the Department for Regional Development to bring
                forward that additional capital programme and to discuss and
                agree its funding in the Executive. That will bring the
                certainty and the clarity that are required. We all agree that
                sewerage infrastructure is behind that of the rest of the United
                Kingdom, never mind the rest of Europe.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.
                I welcome the Minister’s statement; it is better late than
                never. Was he aware that sewerage infrastructure was well below
                standard and that the Department of the Environment was required
                to comply with the EC Directive in January 2001? If he was aware
                of that, why were planning restrictions introduced a year and a
                half later in May 2002?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will the Minister give clarification on the
                Culmore sewage treatment works, which was given planning
                permission in 2001? Even if that proposal proceeds now, it will
                take three years to complete. The Water Service’s
                representative stated on television some weeks ago that the
                money was available to proceed with the Culmore sewage treatment
                works. However, the Minister, Mr Robinson, contradicted that
                some weeks later in the Assembly. Will the Minister say when the
                Culmore sewage treatment works proposal will proceed and what
                possible restrictions developers are likely to encounter as a
                result of the delay? Has the Minister discussed with his
                counterpart in the Department for Regional Development the
                alternative that developers will have to resort to, in the form
                of modern cesspits and packaged treatment plants, which will
                have a far more serious environmental impact than the current
                discharges to water, worrying though they may be.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Nesbitt:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member said that my statement was
                &quot;better late than never&quot;. I stress that this is an
                extremely complex issue because of the geographical breadth and
                depth of the environmental risk that the Department is taking on
                these sewage treatment works. I maintain that it was worth
                stepping back to identify the magnitude of the problem. Unless
                or until we quantify the problem, we will not be able to
                identify the proper solution.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member said that the sewerage
                infrastructure is &quot;well below standard&quot; and that it
                was supposed to comply with the European standard in January
                2001. She is correct. That was the date when the European
                Directive raised the bar and 200 extra sewage treatment works
                were brought into the reckoning. That led to a lowering
                compliance level, and only 35% of our sewage treatment works are
                now in compliance. However, consider the chronology: only when
                the figures were brought together in March 2002 did the
                proportion of non-compliance become apparent. Statistics for a
                specific year apply only after the year has run, at which time
                they are analysed. It is similar with balance sheets and public
                accounts; the balance sheet for the year ending 2001 would not
                be presented until, perhaps, March, April, May or June of the
                following year. There is a time lapse.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In March 2002, when the magnitude of
                non-compliance became known, which paralleled the debate in the
                Assembly about Downpatrick, action kicked in to identify the
                problem and find a solution and a way to monitor the situation,
                and we had to be clear about what we were doing.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not plan to get into a discussion about
                an individual sewage treatment works, and I hope the Member
                understands that in relation to her third point on Culmore
                sewage treatment works. That is why I made sure that the
                information is available on the Department’s web site. People
                can search for Culmore waste water treatment plant. It will be
                categorised as having a high, medium or low environmental
                impact. The web site will define simply each of those
                categories. If anyone wishes to ask me, I will explain them. The
                web site states when the capital works programme is meant to be
                completed, because only when the programme is complete will the
                risk of pollution be eliminated. There is clear information on
                the Culmore waste water treatment plant on the web site, because
                it was one of the 56 hot spots.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hasten to add that there is a small
                complication. It has been said that there are infrastructure
                problems, and there are. Effluent may be entering a river, but,
                depending on the speed of the flow and the volume of the water,
                the dilution of the sewage may take place very quickly.
                Therefore, there may not be pollution.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I said, the information is on the web
                site, but I will help the Member. I am told, and I thank those
                who told me, that the plant at Culmore will take up to three
                years to meet the standards. However, there is no significant
                impact on Lough Foyle at present. The problem is the sewerage
                system.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have granted some licence with regard to
                the length of questions and answers because of the relatively

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the co-operation at ministerial
                level on this issue. We all realise that that was absolutely
                essential. The Minister spoke about having to work with the hand
                that he was dealt. The Minister’s flush was facing a royal
                flush from European Directives.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister referred to compliance with EU
                standards. What are the compliance levels in other European
                countries? I share Mr Alban Maginness’s concerns about the
                timetable of infrastructure improvement that will be needed. I
                trust that, to achieve the timetable, we will not consider
                short-term fixes that would cause problems beyond the five-year
                period. Does the statement take immediate effect?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister also stated that it is important
                to understand that his Department has a statutory duty to
                promote the conservation and cleanliness of Northern Ireland’s
                water resources and waterways. We all understand that and
                support his Department’s efforts to achieve its aims.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Deputy Speaker, I hope that you will
                forgive me for speaking slightly at a tangent. Will the Minister
                make every effort to consult with the Department of Agriculture
                and Rural Development and the agriculture industry with regard
                to future legislation on water cleanliness, particularly in
                relation to the disposal and spreading of slurry? Will he ensure
                that a practical approach is adopted that will not further
                disadvantage our agriculture sector? Furthermore, will he ensure
                that any decisions are based on sound scientific facts and
                figures, and that conclusions will also follow that pattern?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I understand, as I am sure the Minister does,
                that, with regard to pollution, there are concerns that nitrate
                levels are being studied, when there is a suggestion that
                phosphate levels should be studied.</p>

                exorcise it from their minds.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Hussey mentioned the statistics for other

                agriculture. I share the Member’s concern. I wish to, and do,
                work co-operatively with the Department of Agriculture and Rural
                Development and the farming industry. He mentioned scientific
                fact. Policy should be based on evidence, not emotion. That
                applies to many issues, not just this one. I am conscious that
                he mentioned nitrates, phosphates and the causes of
                eutrophication. I am also conscious that John Gilliland, the
                president of the Ulster Farmers’ Union, has made this point
                clearly to officials and to me. I will ensure that the decisions
                to be taken on slurry, sewage and the causes of the problems

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Murphy pointed out an environmental aspect
                that we all recognise exists. I will ensure that no short cuts
                are taken. I have made it very clear that one of the four key
                elements is to monitor and review. It is no good identifying a

                that some sewage treatment works were brought into the reckoning
                during our assessment. Some may not be up to standard. Sewage
                discharge can lead to pollution, depending on whether it dilutes
                quickly in the river.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, there is a problem, and we have
                tried to identify it and to find a way forward. We have tried to
                make the problem and the solution known in the public domain.
                That will require careful monitoring. It is also an integral
                part of the process. The situation will be monitored, and those
                sewage treatment works that are not up to standard will be
                brought up to standard fairly quickly — the number of years is
                estimated. We wait to see what further capital provision comes
                through the various strategic investment initiatives that are
                planned over the coming weeks with the Department for Regional
                Development. I have given the lead from a planning point of
                view, and I look to the Department for Regional Development to
                play its part.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Amendments No 1 and No 2 cover clause 4 and
                clause 8 respectively. I have tabled the amendments in order to
                clarify the Bill’s powers to make Regulations. Clause 4
                inserts provisions on statutory adoption pay into the Social
                Security Contributions and Benefits (Northern Ireland) Act 1992.
                It provides my Department with the power to make Regulations on
                statutory adoption pay. However, statutory adoption pay may have
                effects on social security benefits such as incapacity benefit.
                Therefore, the Department for Social Development also needs
                powers to make Regulations in that area. Amendment No 1 confers
                that necessary power on the Department for Social Development.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Clause 8 inserts provisions about decisions
                and appeals on statutory paternity and adoption pay into the
                Social Security Contributions (Transfer of Functions, etc.)
                (Northern Ireland) Order 1999. The Department for Social
                Development normally makes Regulations under that Order.
                However, it is right that the power to make Regulations about
                entitlement to statutory paternity pay and statutory adoption
                pay should be vested in my Department, which has the policy
                responsibility for those matters. Amendment No 2 confers that
                power on my Department. The amendments ensure that the
                Regulation-making powers in question are conferred on the
                appropriate Department. The amendments are purely technical in
                nature, and I seek the Assembly’s approval of them.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Amendments No 4, No 5, No 6 and No 7 are
                consequential to amendment No 3. The lead amendment arises from
                our concern about parents with disabled children, and the
                eligibility of those disabled dependants beyond the age of 18
                years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Employment Bill does not make it clear if
                the right to flexible working will be extended to parents with
                disabled children who are 18 years or older. There are 7,000
                children under the age of 18 with disabilities in Northern
                Ireland. The statistics for those over 18 years were queried,
                but there may be approximately 14,000 adults with some kind of
                disability between the ages of 18 and 44. However, how many of
                their parents are working and would benefit from access to
                flexible working? In practice, some but not all might benefit
                from that. As the Bill stands, the parents of disabled children
                who depend on them beyond the age of 18 are not entitled to the
                provisions of the Bill.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.45 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Parents of disabled dependants have great
                needs, and extensive research has been carried out by the Joseph
                Rowntree Foundation, which has done admirable work over the
                years, on the role of carers. However, the research to which I
                refer is a study of parents with disabled children who are now
                adults. The study is called ‘Juggling Work and Care: the
                experiences of working carers of older adults’. As part of the
                study, the foundation interviewed 40 families who have tried to
                combine employment with caring for disabled adult children. They
                point out the difficulties that such parents have in sustaining
                secure but flexible work and how, as a consequence, many such
                families are trapped into poverty. Some had to give up work and
                were then dependent on benefits, but they do not want to be on
                benefits; they prefer to be out working to avoid feeling
                isolated and vulnerable, but they cannot reconcile the two. Now,
                for the first time, we have a Bill that is concerned with
                parental rights on flexible working, but it denies those rights
                to one of the most needy groups of all — the parents of
                disabled children who are over 18 years of age.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There was a widespread assumption about the
                mothers of disabled dependants being available for work at any
                time, if they were in work. As a consequence, that group was
                often afraid of being labelled &quot;in need&quot; and therefore
                needy. They did not want that to continue. They wanted to be
                able to speak about their special needs as parents of disabled
                dependants. When they were out of work they suffered excessive
                personal and financial hardship. If this Government can do
                anything about linking up pieces of legislation and preventing
                poverty — particularly the poverty of those with disabled
                children or disabled dependants — let them do it in the
                Employment Bill.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The foundation’s study concluded that if
                the Government were to give employees a right to ask for
                flexible working arrangements, it would greatly help the parents
                of disabled dependants, since employees would have a legal right
                to have that request considered seriously by employers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee for Employment and Learning
                asked an official if there was any forthcoming legislation to
                take on board the role of carers. I am talking about the parents
                of disabled dependants, not other carers, although I hope that
                some day the Assembly will have legislation to deal with carers’
                responsibilities and rights in work. The official said that as
                far as he was aware no such legislation was being considered, so
                this amendment must be incorporated into the Employment Bill. If
                it is not, it will be lost.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee for Employment and Learning
                took evidence from Ms McSorley from the Equality Commission for
                Northern Ireland, who said:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The Commission certainly feels that the
                right should be made available in relation to disabled children
                while they remain dependent.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Likewise, Prof Barry Fitzpatrick of the
                Equality Commission for Northern Ireland said:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The reconciliation of working and
                family life makes for better workers. If people are not given
                this sort of leave it will affect how they work. A sensible
                leave system covering the purposes for which people want time
                off is better than them taking leave regardless of the
                rules.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have no doubt that that was the purpose of
                the legislation in the first place, and, therefore, it addresses
                the needs of parents whose children are under the age of six and
                parents who have disabled children up to the age of 18. Those
                disabled children will remain, to all intents and purposes,
                children, as in the word &quot;dependants&quot; of their
                parents, beyond the age of 18. Ann Hope, from the Northern
                Ireland Committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, rightly
                said:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The key issue should be the needs of
                the child and the parents and not an artificial age
                barrier.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Why is age 18 the cut-off point for disabled
                dependants? A departmental official responded to the Committee’s
                inquiry. He stated:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;I do not recall whether the Department
                used statistics or whether it simply came to a conclusion
                following the consultation and suggestions made in that about
                the age of disabled and non-disabled children whose parents
                should be entitled to flexible working hours.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Consensus emerged that the appropriate age
                was six for non-disabled children and 18 for disabled children.
                The next words are extremely important. He said:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The decision was probably not made in a
                scientific way.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Given all the scientific and empirical
                evidence about the needs of parents who have disabled children
                over the age of 18 but with the same needs as children under the
                age of six, I urge the Minister to become more scientific and
                extend them that right in this legislation. What will happen to
                parents whose children have reached the age of 18 by the time
                that the Bill is passed? Given that it is going to be
                prospective, they may have exactly the same needs as they
                previously had. We must address those needs.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bill implicitly states that if the
                contractual rights were there before they reached the age of 18,
                they may still have those rights after the age of 18. What
                happens to those who can be regarded, to all intents and
                purposes, as dependants — who are entitled to disability
                living allowance, which is the eligibility criteria — but who
                will be denied that right?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Given that the evidence was rather
                unscientific, it may lead to cases of indirect discrimination.
                Equality legislation under section 75 of the Northern Ireland
                Act 1998 proves that people with or without dependants are not
                discriminated against in that category. The Equality Commission
                tells us that there is currently much confusion about the role
                of carers, particularly women who have caring responsibilities.
                If we do not include this amendment, we will add to that
                confusion. For example, if I were working and had a child who
                was under 18, and someone were working with me whose child had
                just turned 18 and had become incapacitated as the result of an
                unfortunate sporting accident, those two parents would have
                entirely different rights, yet that person’s needs might be
                greater than mine.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With that mind, I am concerned that the Bill
                is unclear about what will happen to the group who are under the
                age of 18, after they become 18. However, it is equally
                important that Members should address the needs of those in
                poverty, particularly given that it is a priority in the
                Programme for Government, allow them the opportunity to work,
                give them flexible working rights and the same rights as those
                who have dependants under the age of 18.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Birnie:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank Prof McWilliams for raising this
                issue, which was discussed at length in several Committee
                meetings. It is sufficiently important to merit being raised
                again today.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bill, as it stands, states that the right
                of parents to request flexible working should be limited to
                cases where the child is aged under six or, if the child is
                disabled, 18. In a desire to be as helpful as possible to
                parents of disabled children, the Committee considered the
                possibility of removing the age limit of 18. However, the
                majority of Committee members determined against that course of
                action. The Committee identified two main problems, which seem
                to be attached also to the amendments.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, the use of the term &quot;disabled
                dependant&quot; in amendment No 4 will widen the measure to
                include all dependants, not simply offspring. That is an
                important distinction that will widen the provision, no matter
                what the original intention of the amendment was. If that
                amendment is accepted, it will significantly change the nature
                of the Bill.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, there is a concern about the
                compliance and budgetary cost of the measure. When taking
                evidence, the Committee detected a certain lack of precision on
                the part of the Department about how many parents of disabled
                children would benefit from the provisions as they stand. That,
                in turn, makes it difficult to estimate how a wider casting of
                the net might increase eligibility and cost. That said, on page
                74 of the Committee’s report there are figures provided by
                Assembly Library and Research Services which include the number
                of people claiming disability living allowance plus attendance
                allowance, and which show that up to 211,000 people could be
                affected if we went for a form of words such as &quot;disabled
                dependant&quot;.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the Assembly is to go down that road, it
                will constitute a major policy change. It can be argued that
                that change should be considered, whatever its merits. It does
                have some merit, but such a change should be considered in its
                own right, rather than being introduced through amendments to
                the Bill.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although I am bound to restate the view of
                the majority of Committee members on the subject, I appreciate
                that the amendments raise important policy issues. The position
                of carers other than parents must be considered, and I urge the
                Minister to do so, because it is part of the general theme of
                tackling the so-called work/life balance.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bill is concerned with granting the right
                to request flexible working. In the case of parents of disabled
                children, that right exists until the child reaches the age of
                18. However, as Ms McWilliams pointed out, if flexible working
                is granted, there is a question about whether that right
                continues after the child reaches the age of 18. As I understand
                it, it would continue. However, given that that is a
                sufficiently important issue, it would be useful if the Minister
                would clarify the position of such cases.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In other words, once flexible working has
                been granted to a parent, does that continue once the disabled
                child has passed the age of 18? In previous discussions, a
                majority of the Committee came down against this group of
                amendments, although I concede that there was another view.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, I should certainly like to hear the
                Minister’s views this afternoon regarding some of the issues
                raised by Ms McWilliams, particularly on two points. First, what
                does the Department propose regarding equitable treatment of
                carers in the round — other than simply those who care for
                children? Secondly, what happens once the right to flexible
                working has been granted but the child is no longer under the
                age limit specified in the Bill?</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.00 pm</p>
                </i><b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Gildernew: </b>Go raibh míle maith agat,
                a LeasCheann Comhairle. I support the amendments. The issue was
                discussed at length on several occasions, as the Chairperson of
                the Committee for Employment and Learning has said, and we took
                a vote on it. Although the Chairperson kept talking about the
                majority of the Committee, that majority was of only one.
                Committee members were, by and large, very sympathetic to the
                view that a person who has a disabled child under 18 years of
                age and who is entitled to flexible working arrangements should
                be able to continue those hours after the child has turned 18.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We all know families with children who are
                over the age of 18 but who are still very much dependent on
                their parents. Those families have many problems to deal with.
                People come to me about matters as simple as lowered kerbs in
                the town centre so that they can get about adequately in a
                wheelchair. They come to me about the benefits system and the
                disabled living allowance for their children. They come to me
                about transport and educational arrangements. Often an entire
                family is disabled by the circumstances in which it finds itself
                with a disabled child.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If we are to do something good to benefit the
                wider community, we must be more imaginative and creative in
                bringing about legislation that will make a real difference to
                people’s lives. Extending the flexible working arrangements to
                families who have children over the age of 18 who are still
                dependent would make a huge difference.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee has discussed the issue at
                length. I agree with much of what Monica McWilliams said on the
                issue and support her amendments. It is critically important
                that we try, in the limited time that we have left in this
                Assembly — and it might be even more limited today than it was
                last week — to pass legislation that will improve people’s
                lives. These amendments, if carried, will do that, and I support
                them. Go raibh míle maith agat.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Hanna:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I understand that, in proposing these
                amendments, the Member intends to give the parents of disabled
                children the statutory right to continue with flexible working
                arrangements when their child passes the age of 18. Secondly,
                she would like the right to flexible working for the parents of
                disabled children who are over 18 years of age when the parents
                request flexible working arrangements.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I fully support the Member’s sentiments.
                Indeed, I have worked for many years with the parents of
                disabled children. I share their concerns. After all, just
                because a disabled child turns 18 years of age does not mean
                that it is no longer dependent on its parents. Parents of
                disabled children still require the right to flexible working
                arrangements when their children become adults.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Employment Bill confers on parents of
                disabled children the right to request flexible working
                arrangements, not just until children reach six years of age,
                but throughout the childhood of a disabled person. Although the
                request for flexible working hours must be made before a child
                with a disability reaches the age of 18, the flexible working
                arrangement does not end at that point.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to clarify what would happen in
                practice with regard to flexible working arrangements under the
                provisions of the Bill. When the parents of a child under the
                age of six, or of a disabled child under the age of 18, request
                flexible working arrangements, the employer and employee will
                enter into dialogue to explore how the request can be
                accommodated without there being a detrimental effect on the
                employer’s business. I am confident that the request can be
                facilitated in most cases and that a mutually suitable
                arrangement will be reflected in the permanent employment
                contract between employer and employee.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The permanent contract would continue
                indefinitely until an event occurs, such as the employee
                leaving, the employer ceasing to operate, a new contract being
                established or a contract being varied. A contract can only be
                varied, or a new contract entered into, after due consultation
                involving both parties. The contract would continue
                indefinitely. Therefore, a situation would arise in which
                employees who are parents of disabled persons over the age of 18
                would continue with that flexible working arrangement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I cannot agree with Ms McWilliams’s
                amendment. It would confer the right to request flexible working
                arrangements beyond the targeted beneficiaries of the Bill. I
                sincerely appreciate the fact that parents of disabled children
                over the age of 18 when the application is made for flexible
                working arrangements will miss out: that goes beyond the
                targeted beneficiaries of the Bill. However, the Department will
                review the legislation and if it is working successfully for
                employer and employee, the Department may extend its scope. I
                hope that the Member will feel able to withdraw her amendment.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms McWilliams:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am pleased that it was clarified that much
                debate took place in the Committee and that the majority was
                only one. Had the Committee considered the issue at greater
                length, certain members might have been won over by some of the
                arguments. It is good to have the Minister’s clarification
                that the contractual arrangement could be varied for those who
                have the right and are beyond the age of 18.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, I was taken by the Minister’s own
                words when she said that a disabled person’s dependency does
                not necessarily end at the age of 18. I am heartened that the
                Minister, having worked with the parents of disabled adults,
                understands their needs. I believe, therefore, that it is
                possible for the Assembly to work on the amendment. I am not
                referring to the wider interpretation that covers all carers of
                dependants. I agree that that may require further legislation. I
                am referring to the working parents of a disabled dependent
                child or adult who is beyond the age of 18. The Assembly must
                legislate for that group. Therefore, the amendment must stand.
                If it is passed, the Assembly can agree upon the legal wording
                that will accommodate that group.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Given the current political situation, it
                would not serve us well to leave it out of the legislation and
                to have to tell interested groups that we may return to it one
                day. The time is now, and it is a good time to include the
                amendment in the legislation.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Amendments No 9 and No 11 have the effect of
                enabling the Labour Relations Agency both to conciliate in
                disputes about flexible working and to extend its binding
                arbitration scheme to such disputes. A key principle behind the
                flexible working provisions is that of promoting dialogue. It is
                important to encourage employers and employees to find solutions
                that suit both. Conciliation and arbitration can help to achieve
                that. It is in everyone’s interests to ensure that disputes be
                settled to the satisfaction of the parties without recourse to
                the tribunal system. The flexible working provisions lend
                themselves well to conciliation and arbitration, which are well
                suited to resolving straightforward cases. Essentially, the
                issues to be resolved are factual rather than legal. The Labour
                Relations Agency has much expertise in the areas of conciliation
                and arbitration. The resource should be made available when
                disputes arise over flexible working. To that end, I have tabled
                the two technical amendments.</p>

                classes of workers. The Committee for Employment and Learning
                has expressed concern that the Bill’s provisions do not cover
                the relatively small group of workers not classed as employees.
                The right that the Bill confers applies to employees for several
                practical reasons, which have been accepted by the Committee.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am sympathetic to the Committee’s
                interest in the rights and benefits afforded to workers. My
                Department recently issued two related consultation documents on
                employment status and working conditions for temporary and
                agency workers. I look forward to hearing views that may arise
                from the public consultations on individual employment rights,
                including those introduced by the Bill. The Employment Relations
                (Northern Ireland) Order 1999 gives the Department the power to
                extend the rights contained in some existing employment
                legislation. Some of the rights introduced by the Employment
                Bill will be covered by that power because they are inserted in
                existing legislation. Other rights are, however, only contained
                in the Bill, and to ensure that they can be extended, I tabled
                amendment No 12.</p>

                opportunity be used to consider whether &quot;workers&quot;
                could in some cases be given rights equal to those that apply to
                people who are defined as &quot;employees&quot;. The Committee

                strategic investment board and to allow for the regeneration,
                through the reinvestment and reform initiative, of former
                security and military sites. The draft Budget does not contain
                specific provision for the strategic investment board or for the
                costs associated with the transfer of sites because we were
                unable to quantify those meaningfully when proposals for the
                draft Budget were drawn up. The situation will be reviewed when
                the final Budget is prepared and when work on the initiative is
                taken into account in the next few moths.</p>

                infrastructure for 2004-05 and 2005-06, which was announced on
                24 September, is insufficient to tackle our infrastructure
                deficit. More is needed for our capital programmes, but more
                will come through the reinvestment and reform initiative, which
                we hope will be announced later in the autumn.</p>

                and which are restricting development in my constituency? Does

                resources for it. We already have a significant increase in
                resources, thanks to the immediate measures that we negotiated
                with the Treasury, and we expect legislation to be forthcoming
                from Westminster that will give us a substantial borrowing power
                that will greatly add to our available options. Of course, the
                Administration and the Assembly must consider carefully how

                There is substantial underinvestment in infrastructure, and a
                substantial job must be done. The initiative is not merely about
                reinvestment; it is about reinvestment and reform. The intention
                is to improve how we do things, and the Administration has not
                been as effective as we would have liked in pursuing
                public-private partnerships and exploring the options there. We
                are centralising expertise so that the 10 Departments do not
                each have to reinvent the wheel. That is why we want to attract
                skills and disciplines from parts of the private sector to
                improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the system. It will

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In January 2002, the Department queried the
                Equality Commission’s increasing expenditure on legal fees.
                The Department asked the Commission to carry out an internal
                audit of its financial systems and procedures relating to the
                legal services budget. We agreed the terms of reference for the
                audit, which covered three distinct areas: the reasons for the
                increasing expenditure on legal fees; a review of the processes
                for commissioning and paying legal fees and budgetary financial
                management and approval systems; and a review of systems and
                processes in the legal division as a whole, with reference to
                the integration of services across all the legislative grounds.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The auditor’s final report on the first two
                areas was presented to the Equality Commission on 5 July, and
                the Department asked the Commission to draw up an implementation
                plan for the recommendations. That has been accomplished and is
                being monitored by the Department. Significant progress has been
                made on implementing those recommendations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The third part of the review, which will
                include benchmarking the legal services directorate against
                other organisations carrying out similar functions, is due to be
                completed by the end of November.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs E Bell:</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Deputy First Minister for his
                answer to that important question. Does he agree that recent
                newspaper reports on this, which I understand are generally
                inaccurate, must be dealt with, so that staff morale is not
                further undermined?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy First Minister:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I recognise that concerns have arisen over
                newspaper reports. Staff morale is a significant factor, and the
                Department hopes to ensure that any damage is compensated for by
                progress. As well as that, those who want the Equality
                Commission to be available to give support must have their
                confidence in and concerns about the Commission addressed.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Is OFMDFM concerned that some people have had
                legal assistance withdrawn at short notice, and was it aware
                that that would happen? Does OFMDFM agree that the Equality
                Commission is well funded, and can it say what support it
                provides?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy First Minister:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree that the Equality Commission is well
                funded. It gets £6·7 million each year while the Northern
                Ireland Human Rights Commission gets only £750,000 and the
                South’s equality authority gets 5 million euros — about half
                the funding for twice the number of people. The Commission may
                spend up to £1·8 million on legal assistance this financial
                year. That is well over budget. Last year it is estimated that
                the UK Disability Rights Commission spent £220,000.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">OFMDFM was not aware that the Equality
                Commission had started to withdraw assistance at short notice,
                and as it was concerned about that, it met with the Equality
                Commission. OFMDFM is monitoring the situation to see what
                additional resources should be made available to it this year to
                ensure that important aspects of its work are carried forward,
                while dealing with increased expenditure on legal fees. OFMDFM
                wants to ensure that assistance is not withdrawn at short notice
                and that the large increase in expenditure and legal aid do not
                prevent the Commission from carrying out other important aspects
                of its work. OFMDFM has also agreed measures to assist the
                Commission to manage its legal aid strategy. The Equality
                Commission is not a legal aid body and should not be expected to
                act as such. At a personal level, I would like to see legal aid
                made available for such cases.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs Carson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will the Minister agree that, in the past,
                the Equality Commission has been too willing to back every case
                brought to it and that that has been the cause of its financial
                problems? That policy has also discredited the Equality
                Commission in the eyes of the public.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy First Minister:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unlawful discrimination is unacceptable. The
                Equality Commission is a strategic enforcement body that
                enforces existing anti-discrimination law and uses its resources
                to ensure the development of legal issues. Support to
                complainants is one of the ways in which the Equality Commission
                can fulfil its functions to eliminate unlawful discrimination
                and to promote equality of opportunity.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Last year, in recognition of the increasing
                proportion of its budget that was being taken up by legal fees,
                and of the need to bring a more strategic focus and coherence to
                the consideration of requests for assistance, the Equality
                Commission undertook a review of its legal assistance strategy.
                The review identified the need for a more strategic use of its
                legal budget. Again, I make the point that the Equality
                Commission is not responsible for providing legal aid and cannot
                be expected to act as if it is. Legal aid is a reserved matter,
                and it is the Lord Chancellor’s policy not to provide legal
                aid to tribunal cases. I have already given my view on that
                matter.</p>

                regulation that it imposed. I hope that, at an appropriate time,
                in the not-too-distant future, the Secretary of State will
                institute a proper inquiry into what happened on his watch and

                the Assembly on 20 May this year? The Minister announced
                approval for development at Harland &amp; Wolff’s harbour
                estate of land that was no longer required for shipbuilding,
                permitting the financing of a new business plan. Will he
                establish whether the proposal of 200 redundancies is part of
                that business plan, or whether it is an attempt to free up even
                more Harland &amp; Wolff land for disgraceful speculative profit

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There was a brief discussion of those matters
                at the Executive’s last meeting. Sir Reg Empey gave the
                Executive an account of the development of the situation. As I
                recall — and I hope that I recall accurately — the
                protective notices with regard to redundancy were necessitated
                by the state of the construction of vessels at Harland &amp;
                Wolff; the second ship is about to be completed. He also told us
                about discussions on the development of the harbour estate.
                Plans are being prepared, and these matters will be brought
                before the Executive again, when appropriate. With regard to the
                redevelopment of the estate, an effort is being made to include
                more light industry and commercial development as a means to
                replace the jobs that are threatened and the jobs that have

                developing countries through the valuable work of Concern,

                worthy of our fullest support. I would certainly encourage other
                councils to follow that sort of initiative. I am aware that in

                Council in relation to Kebele 37 in Addis Ababa. More recently,

                Sharing experience and expertise between local authorities and

                reinvestment and reform initiative in May, we established a
                project board, on which all the parties in the Executive are
                represented, to advise us on the way forward on the development
                of the strategic investment board. During the summer the project
                board considered the detailed arrangements for the strategic
                investment board and how it should function.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the Executive’s meeting on 23 July, it
                was agreed that work should begin immediately to prepare the
                necessary legislation to establish the strategic investment
                board. The Strategic Investment and Regeneration of Sites Bill
                was introduced on 30 September and will have its Second Stage
                tomorrow. We hope to complete the Bill’s passage through the
                Assembly and for it to receive Royal Assent by March 2003. There
                is confidence for you.</p>

                expertise required to enable the board to operate successfully.
                It will also address other key issues, such as corporate
                governance and accountability.</p>

                partnership (PPP) or private finance initiative (PFI) contracts?</p>

                centralise the expertise needed to manage the increased levels
                of capital investment that we are hoping to achieve using the
                reinvestment and reform initiative. It is hoped that by so doing
                we will reduce the amount of money that ends up being spent on
                consultants in our capital undertakings from one contract and

                they are deemed to be appropriate as one part of that overall

                and it is to be a part that adds to the net investment that we
                are able to achieve, beyond what would be available to us under

                £750,000 and £900,000 a year, and a plethora of new civil
                servants to be added to the Office of the First Minister and the

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The strategic investment board will be there
                to serve the investment programme of the Executive at large and
                to ensure that we will be able to improve and increase the
                capital expenditure that we are undertaking. We have to do that
                in dramatic ways.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members will recall that they often criticise
                cases of underspend and delays involving capital projects. The
                idea of a strategic investment body is to cut through many of
                those problems by having expertise centralised and available in
                Government to support the work of the different Departments and
                the Executive, and also to reduce the undue reliance on outside
                consultants. Members often criticise the constant reliance of
                Departments on outside consultants and want us to do more
                in-house in a programmed way. That is exactly what the strategic
                investment body is about.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Consistency is a bit much to ask for, but
                Members may recall that some time ago all parties represented on
                the Committee for Finance and Personnel supported a report
                calling for a new central driver for capital expenditure. The
                type of case set out in the Committee for Finance and Personnel’s
                very good report into public-private partnerships and private
                finance initiatives is exactly the one that we are answering

                Shankill Sure Start project at the Alessie Centre on Belfast’s
                Shankill Road on 17 September. That project operates from three
                early year family centres — the Alessie centre, the Hanna
                centre and the Martin centre, which are located in the greater
                Shankill area. Those centres provide high-quality settings for a
                range of activities covering play development, health and
                well-being, and parenting and education. The centres also host a
                range of drop-in facilities, parent and toddler groups, art and
                craft sections and one-to-one support services.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy First Minister was given a
                presentation on the work of the Shankill Sure Start project. He
                met with parents and users of the service and saw at first hand
                the impressive range of facilities, activities and services
                being delivered to children and families. Giving our children
                the best possible education, and encouraging people to learn and
                develop throughout their lives, has a fundamental place in the
                Programme for Government.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We recognise the longer-term benefits
                associated with early years education, and the Executive are
                providing additional support through the Sure Start programme,
                targeting children under four and their families in areas of
                need. Initiatives such as the Sure Start project on the Shankill
                Road help to promote a positive image of the area and
                demonstrate what can be achieved through communities and
                statutory agencies working together in partnership.</p>

                value of such visits, particularly to the staff and the

                disadvantaged community in a Nationalist area of Belfast?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I take both of the Member’s points. It is
                one of the great pleasures for the Deputy First Minister and me,
                and, indeed, other Ministers, that we can go and visit people
                delivering services at the sharp end and see what is happening.
                It is good for us, it is good for them, and it is good for the
                service. It is one of the pleasures of this business and helps
                to compensate for other aspects that are not always such a
                pleasure.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In relation to the Member’s specific
                proposal, there is a certain parallel that if the Deputy First

                devolution, the Executive have agreed substantial additional
                resources year-on-year for health and personal social services.
                During the period 2000-01 to 2003-04, the health budget will
                have increased by £1·1 billion to over £3 billion,
                representing growth approaching 60% over the period, and an
                average growth of 12·8% over that period.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The draft budget announced on 24 September
                offers £300 million more for health than would be provided
                through the simple application of the Barnett formula based on
                changes in English health expenditures. The draft Budget
                proposals further provide year-on-year increases of 4% and 7·7%
                in 2004-05 and 2005-06. Health funding for those two years will
                be further increased by allocations from Executive programme

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr P Robinson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You got your chance and you blew it, Mr
                Speaker. The consultation proposal, ‘A New Start for Public
                Transport in Northern Ireland’, which I issued on 17
                September, would see the Northern Ireland Transport Holding
                Company and its Translink bus and rail subsidiaries amalgamated
                into a new, dynamic, publicly owned operating company, Transport
                Northern Ireland. It would also establish an independent public
                transport regulatory body. Significantly, I am also proposing
                the progressive injection of private sector finance and
                expertise into the public transport market insofar as it makes
                sound commercial sense and is acceptable to the wider community.
                I am convinced that these proposals would lead to improved
                public transport provision.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also propose to issue shortly a
                consultation paper on extensions to the concessionary fare
                scheme. If the Assembly is prepared to allocate the resources to
                enable me to introduce such extensions, I am confident that they
                will increase public transport usage as well as benefiting
                less-well-off members of society.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As for capital investment, Translink has 23
                new trains on order, has completed work on the Bangor line
                relay, and will commence work on the Belfast to Whitehead relay
                this year. Translink is also continuing to upgrade its ageing
                bus fleet. With the assistance of 50% grant aid from the
                Department for Regional Development, Translink is expected to
                spend £5·4 million this year and £11·4 million next year
                buying about 130 new low-floor buses. These developments should
                make rail and bus travel more attractive.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Looking further ahead, the 10-year regional
                transportation strategy includes many measures to encourage
                greater use of public transport such as refurbishment of
                stations, improved passenger information systems, more
                park-and-ride facilities, more quality bus corridors, more town
                bus services and a rapid transit system for Belfast. However,
                the outcome for public transport will ultimately be determined
                in the budgetary process, and I trust that I can call for Mr
                Byrne’s support in this regard.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Byrne:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does the Minister agree that the number of
                journeys travelled on public transport declined last year by 2%,
                and that, therefore, a proactive approach must be taken by
                Northern Ireland Railways, Ulsterbus and Citybus to make public
                transport more attractive? Does he accept that the Department
                for Regional Development has a public responsibility to ensure
                the increasing use of public transport, including rural areas
                beyond the Belfast metropolitan area?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr P Robinson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In spite of the statistics showing
                significantly increased use of public transport by senior
                citizens as a result of the free fares scheme, unfortunately
                there has been a 2% downturn in the number of passenger journeys
                on public transport. That is a disturbing trend, and it
                encouraged me to introduce the consultation document ‘A New
                Start for Public Transport in Northern Ireland’.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Evidence elsewhere in the world shows that
                where private sector finance and expertise has been introduced
                into public transport, it has reversed that decline. It has also
                shown that where public transport is the responsibility of the
                public sector, the figures decline. That is one factor that we
                can use to turn the figures around and ensure greater usage.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member will know, coming from west Tyrone
                and also from his background on the Committee for Regional
                Development, that unless we can raise the standards of the
                product that we offer to the public, we will not encourage more
                members of the public to use public transport — hence the
                injection of Assembly funds into railways and new buses. That
                kind of good service with regular, dependable, comfortable buses
                and trains is more likely to encourage people to use public
                transport than anything else.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Roads Service receives many requests for the
                provision of controlled pedestrian crossings, whether pelican or
                zebra. Requests are assessed using a formula based on national
                guidelines to ensure a consistent and equitable approach.
                Consideration is given to sites if</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">P x V<sup>2</sup> &gt; 0·5 x 10<sup>8</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">where P is the number of pedestrians crossing
                the road per hour, and V is the number of vehicles per hour.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The purpose of the formula is to assess the
                degree of conflict between pedestrians wishing to cross a road
                and the number of vehicles using it. The formula acts as an
                initial sift. If the threshold is exceeded, the site is
                considered in more detail, and other factors are taken into
                account when making the decision. Those factors include vehicle
                speed, road geometry, accident history and proximity to shops,
                schools, community centres, hospitals, and so on.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is an important matter and, therefore, I
                have asked the Roads Service officials to review the formula and
                the other factors taken into account to ensure that pedestrian
                crossings are provided where they will be of most benefit. In
                undertaking the review, my officials will consult the Committee
                for Regional Development.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McCarthy:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was going to take down the formula, but I
                got lost. I will get it in Hansard tomorrow.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister will be aware of the demands
                from elderly people and parents of young children for crossings
                to ensure safe passage across busy main streets. In the
                circumstances, can the Minister promote a reduced formula, which
                would provide crossings and, thus, reduce the risk of injury or
                fatality?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr P Robinson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have asked my officials to report to me
                after the review. The existing formula — complex though it is
                — can be tweaked to allow more crossings. It simply involves
                changing the factor 0·5 in the formula. Nonetheless, there are
                requirements if we are to be able to fund additional pedestrian
                crossings. That is another factor that depends on budgetary
                issues.</p>
                <b>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sometimes it does not save lives. That
                depends on the circumstances in the area. The more pedestrian
                crossings there are, the less regard cars pay to them, and
                especially to zebra crossings. Many factors must be taken into
                account. I am happy to allow my officials to speak to the
                Member, if he wants to submit views to the review. The
                Department will consult with the Committee for Regional
                Development to hear its views on the formula and any changes to
                it.</p>

                change the criteria along the lines that he discussed with
                elected representatives and community groups at a meeting in
                Ards and bring them into line with the needs of the people of
                Northern Ireland? When does he envisage consultation starting
                and finishing, so that the communities of Ballywalter, Greyabbey,
                Kircubbin, Millisle, Ballygowan and Comber can benefit from it?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The review is under way. I asked officials to
                carry it out, so, naturally, I assume that they have begun it.
                It would be unhelpful for me to make any assumptions about its
                outcome before I have heard what the Committee for Regional
                Development has to say or what the review establishes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During the meeting in Ards, I was made aware
                of several factors, which can be just as important in judging
                the dangers as the numbers of pedestrians or vehicles. The
                Department wants to see if the formula can reflect more
                accurately the danger to people crossing a road, as opposed to
                the number of pedestrians or vehicles on it.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister has answered my query in part.
                To take the issue of traffic calming beyond pedestrian
                crossings, I understand that he is looking objectively at the
                figures and formulae that seem to cause Mr McCarthy so much
                concern. I urge him to ensure that the review takes a more
                subjective approach to traffic-calming measures, because it can
                be difficult for rural communities to meet the indicative
                figures that the formulas require.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr P Robinson:</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Leaving aside pedestrian crossings,
                traffic-calming measures are determined by a scoring system,
                which is based on several factors. I am concerned about moving
                away from objective criteria. If a Minister determines his own
                subjective criteria, people will question his decisions, and he
                will have no defence unless he operates according to objective
                criteria. For that reason I would far prefer to use objective
                criteria that adequately respond to the dangers that exist in an
                area rather than subjectively decide, according to the mood of
                the moment, the most appropriate point to have pedestrian
                crossings or traffic-calming measures.</p>

                I know that Lisburn City Council would prefer it to be somewhere
                else. However, the site identified by Translink is one to which
                it has legal access, and which is, therefore, its obvious
                choice. It is an operational matter that the council will no
                doubt wish to take up with Translink directly. However, a
                station in the middle of Lisburn can be a help to the city
                centre and should not be considered a nuisance by anyone.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The development planning process is a matter
                for the Department of the Environment. I am advised that, as
                part of that process, the Department of the Environment consults
                with the Rivers Agency of the Department of Agriculture and
                Rural Development about potential sites for housing and other
                developments. The Rivers Agency assesses the potential for
                flooding in the area and whether preventative measures regarding
                improvements to infrastructure would be required if the site
                were zoned for development.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is also consultation with the Water
                Service, the Roads Service and, where necessary, the Rivers
                Agency, on planning applications for specific housing
                developments to ensure that they have adequate facilities for
                the discharge of storm water and that it will not create or
                exacerbate flooding problems in the area. The Water Service
                advises the Planning Service on the availability of water and
                sewerage services and any difficulties envisaged relating to the
                capacity of the existing public sewerage infrastructure and the
                proposed timing of new or improved infrastructure to absorb new
                development.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am also advised that some planning
                applications for housing developments require the submission of
                an environmental statement under the Planning (Environmental
                Impact Assessment) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 1999. Such
                environmental statements must take account of any significant
                environmental effects likely from the proposed development and
                include a description of the measures envisaged to prevent,
                reduce and, if possible, offset any significant adverse effect
                on the environment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those arrangements ensure that the potential
                impact of storm-water discharges arising from proposed housing
                or other developments is properly considered at the stage of the
                development plan or development control in the existing planning
                process.</p>

                housing and commercial developments — and, indeed, those
                already in existence for at least the past 10 years — with
                specific reference to the prevention of flooding incidents such

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The instances to which the Member refers
                resulted from significantly higher rainfall than had been
                experienced for a considerable time. The Assembly will always
                have a judgement to make regarding the level at which storm
                drainage facilities should be available.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the Assembly wants to raise standards, it
                will have to cough up and give the Department the funding with
                which to do that. However, the existing planning mechanism gives
                the Planning Service, the Water Service and the Rivers Agency
                sufficient ability to consider the storm drainage implications
                of any planning application. The planning process does not
                require a new stage. It already includes consideration of that
                element of planning.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Entitlement to compensation from the
                Department is not automatic. For a claim to be successful, it
                must be shown that the Department failed to carry out its
                statutory duty or was negligent in some other way. Every claim
                is, therefore, thoroughly investigated. If no evidence of
                negligence by the Department is found, the claim is turned down.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Following the serious flooding that occurred
                on the evening of Friday 21 June 2002, the Department received
                346 claims for compensation. However, the Department’s
                investigation revealed that the flooding was caused by the
                exceptional thunderstorms and heavy downpour that occurred that
                night. Those extreme weather conditions were localised. Flooding
                in the worst-affected areas — parts of Newtownabbey and
                Carrickfergus — was exacerbated by water that ran off higher
                ground. Therefore, in the absence of any other significant
                factors, the Department believes that it has a defence in law
                against the claims. In those circumstances, they must be turned
                down.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As with all claims, the Department’s
                decision can be challenged through the independent legal
                process. Claims like those, where the value is under £2,000,
                fall within the jurisdiction of the Small Claims Court. However,
                before any claimants consider that step, I believe that it would
                be helpful if I had the benefit of an independent opinion from
                senior counsel on the correctness or otherwise of the Department’s
                position. I have, therefore, asked my officials to arrange that,
                and the independent opinion is expected soon. A copy of senior
                counsel’s opinion will be lodged in the Assembly Library.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many of my constituents received letters from
                the Department for Regional Development stating that the
                flooding was an act of God. However, many of the areas that were
                worst affected by the flooding in June 2002 have been affected
                regularly — places such as Chichester Square and the lower
                Woodburn Road. Taylors Avenue in Carrickfergus was flooded and
                devastated for the third time in a year. Flooding regularly
                occurs on the Shore Road at Whiteabbey. Many of the residents
                who are affected by that simply cannot afford house insurance.
                Many of them have great difficulty getting house insurance
                because of the regularity of the flooding. Is it not time that
                the Minister, his Department and the Rivers Agency accepted
                their responsibility towards my constituents in East Antrim?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr P Robinson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The rights of the Member’s constituents are
                no different to those of other Members’ constituents elsewhere
                in the Province. The same criteria must apply to all. If the
                Member is suggesting that the Department should fork out money
                irrespective of the circumstances or whether there was any
                negligence on its part, that would be absurd. The Assembly
                simply could not afford to do that. Therefore, negligence on the
                part of the Department must be clearly shown before any
                compensation is paid.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am happy to consider circumstances where
                there is a case for negligence. However, I honestly believe that
                I will not have to consider such a case, because the Department’s
                compensation agency attentively considers any details that
                suggest that the Department would be unable to sustain a refusal
                of a claim in court. We are, therefore, keen to ensure that a
                payment is made where there is a case. With so many cases
                involved, rather than simply follow the basis of the Department’s
                initial consideration, I determined that I would have the case
                considered by independent senior counsel to examine the
                Department’s legal position.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have also asked the Department to instruct
                senior counsel to provide a clear guideline on the circumstances
                in which it is right and legally required for the Department to
                make compensation payments. I propose to put a copy of that
                guideline in the Assembly Library. It will be useful for Members
                to recognise circumstances that, according to the law as it
                stands, will give entitlement to compensation and those that are
                unlikely to. It does not remove anybody’s right to take legal
                action, but it will give some indication of the circumstances in
                which a case is likely to be successful.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I can well understand, for I have seen it too
                many times in my own constituency, the anguish suffered as a
                result of flooding. However, every flood is not the result of
                negligence by the Department for Regional Development or the
                Water Service. We must recognise that if the Assembly were
                simply to pay every claimant who submitted an application, it
                would have a very considerable bill to pay, and money would have
                to be taken from other heads of expenditure.</p>

                agencies never contribute to flooding? Could blocked drains and
                culverts have contributed to flooding? Will he acknowledge that,
                where the Roads Service has had to carry out remedial work to
                repair faulty culverts, that agency’s blocked structures will
                have contributed to the flooding of some of my constituents’

                negligence by the Department, the Member’s constituents will
                have a valid claim. However, if, for instance, the Water Service
                staff clear blockage in a drain on a Thursday, it is blocked on
                a Friday and flooding occurs, nobody could say that the
                Department was negligent. Staff cannot stand for 24 hours of
                every day at every drain throughout the country. That would not
                be negligence in those circumstances. Therefore, it is necessary
                to show that the Department has been negligent in how it has
                dealt with drains and other matters of its responsibility.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The A2 Belfast to Bangor road is one of the
                arterial routes into Belfast. It has a two-way traffic flow of
                almost 40,000 vehicles a day and is of high strategic
                importance. Safety along the route is of particular concern, and
                in recent years the Roads Service has implemented several
                measures directed at improving road safety.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This summer, the Roads Service carried out
                two important schemes specifically directed at improving the
                safety and structural condition of the road. One scheme involved
                resurfacing the section of the road between Whinney Hill and
                Ballygrainey Road and included a junction improvement at Whinney
                Hill, localised widening at Cultra Avenue and central hatching
                between Whinney Hill and Ballygrainey Road. The other scheme
                involved amendments to the layout and provision of traffic
                signals at the junction of the A2 Rathgael Road/Old Belfast
                Road, which has the worst history of accidents on the A2. In
                addition, work to replace a safety barrier at a tight bend near
                Seahill continues.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The benefits arising from those improvements
                are already apparent to all users of the road. I assure the
                Member that the Roads Service will continue to monitor the road
                with a view to introducing, where appropriate and practical,
                further measures to address any safety problems that can be
                remedied by engineering.</p>

                ask the Minister to ask his Department to take note of the
                dangers of entering and exiting side roads to the expanding

                enforcement powers. The aims of the Planning (Amendment) Bill
                are to make it simpler and easier for the Department’s
                enforcement officers to take enforcement action against those
                who flout planning law, to make available to the Department
                tough new enforcement powers and to make stiffer penalties
                available to the courts. I plan to review enforcement staffing
                levels in Belfast and other planning offices after the Bill

                strengthen the management of the development control and
                enforcement sections in the Belfast division. That was his
                answer on the 30 April, and it is still his answer in the first
                week of October. I visited the office recently and know that
                there is only one enforcement officer, who is dealing with 777
                cases. Two officers are on leave. What does the Minister mean

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Nesbitt:</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I empathise entirely with what the Member
                said about the lack of enforcement officers. There is a total of
                21 officers throughout Northern Ireland — four of the
                divisional planning offices have three officers each, and three
                of the offices have three officers each. Many thousands of
                enforcement cases are brought each year; I am aware of the
                problem. However, there is a certain thing called money, which
                is needed so that we can have more enforcement officers in
                place. It is hoped that that money may come through in the
                Budget process.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One issue that must be addressed in the
                Budget process is the planning process itself. I hasten to add
                that a strengthened Planning (Amendment) Bill is in the offing,
                with new enforcement powers, increased fines and penalties for
                non-compliance. I hope that, collectively, those provisions will
                act as a deterrent to the lack of will to abide by the law. In
                that context, when the Bill is passed, the necessity for
                additional staff will be reviewed.</p>

                in relation to the provision of new enforcement officers, if not
                the intention to deliver them. Will he confirm that, although
                there is a need for more officers in Belfast, the same need
                exists in other areas, for example in the Ards borough?
                Moreover, does he agree that, with the Department’s reluctance
                to employ extra enforcement officers, many enforcement actions
                are on hold? Does he not feel that action should be taken to
                clear those up? Some of them have been on hold for 12 to 24
                months.</p>

                reluctance on the part of the Department of the Environment —
                and certainly not on my part — to ensure that the law is
                enforced. I repeat: I want to see planning decisions taken
                efficiently and effectively for those within the law, and I want

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Union Theological College is a very important
                listed building. At the &quot;Look up to Belfast&quot; seminar
                last week, we saw that other places in the world try to maintain
                their listed buildings by utilising them, improving them
                internally and ensuring that they are in good stead for usage.
                That is what has happened to Union Theological College. It has
                been retained in ownership and continues to be used as it was
                previously used. I recognise that the skyline has been broken
                asymmetrically. However, the building fulfils what could be
                called &quot;international standards&quot; for its type in that
                nothing can be removed from what was put in place originally.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Nesbitt:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The regional development strategy sets an
                aspirational target of 60% of new urban housing growth in
                settlements of population of 5,000 or more, to be accommodated
                in existing urban limits as defined at the 2001 baseline year.
                That has been referred to as the brownfield target. The strategy
                also advocates that the potential for achieving the target is to
                be assessed through the development plan process using urban
                capacity studies. My Department is already carrying out urban
                capacity studies in association with the preparation of current
                plans. These will be published along with each draft plan to
                provide the public with the technical reason behind the choice
                of housing sites. My Department adopts a sequential approach in
                allocating lands for housing in the preparation of development
                plans.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Urban capacity studies form the important
                first stage by identifying potential sites within the urban
                limits. Allowance is then made for windfall sites — for
                example, sites in urban areas that become available over the
                course of the plan period due to unforeseen land use changes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Lands are allocated on greenfield sites,
                including locations where extension to existing settlements may
                be necessary to meet the balance of housing growth as identified
                in the regional development strategy. Land is allocated for
                housing in the development plan in phases. The emphasis in the
                first phase is on the development of land in the existing urban
                limits, which will ensure that priority is given to brownfield
                sites in the allocation of land for urban housing growth.</p>

                people to use brownfield sites. Does the Minister agree that the
                best incentive to encourage people to do that is to veto
                greenfield sites?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is the fascinating dimension of
                planning: the tensions all around. Ms Lewsley would prefer
                developers to be encouraged to use brownfield sites only,
                whereas others want to use greenfield sites as well. Planning
                depends on striking a balance between conflicting and competing
                demands: urban and rural; and sustaining the environment while
                providing for economic growth. Many and varied tensions must be
                resolved, and, although I welcome Ms Lewsley’s suggestion that
                there may be other options, my solution to urban capacity
                studies, windfall land and greenfield sites focuses my mind on
                brownfield sites.</p>

                out of date? Does he, therefore, accept that it is urgent that

                my answer will be brief. Dr McCrea, the Chairperson of the
                Environment Committee, is correct. Many of the plans are out of
                date, so new plans need to be drafted quickly. If anyone objects
                to a plan, it goes to a public inquiry, and, as always in
                planning, many people object. However, I agree with Dr McCrea’s

                from the Department and the three waste management partnerships.
                The forum was established to assist with the implementation of
                the waste management strategy, which was published in March
                2000. Recently, it has focused on finalising the partnership’s
                waste management plans and funding.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Recycling is a significant element in the
                three final draft plans that were submitted to the Department at
                the end of June 2002. The allocations to councils under last
                year’s waste management grant scheme were largely spent on the
                infrastructure needed to support those recycling targets. A
                similar pattern of expenditure is expected this year. Officials
                and I have met with individual councils and groups of councils
                about a range of waste management issues. Waste management is a
                standing item on the agenda of my quarterly meetings with the
                Northern Ireland Local Government Association. My Department and
                I value such close contact with councils, because it is vital to
                the successful implementation of the waste management strategy.</p>

                about how far the process has moved. We are all part of the
                waste problem; therefore, we must all be part of the solution.
                We must be aware of the contribution that we can make. Resources
                have been spent on public awareness, and £1·5 million is
                available for that over three years. Surveys on our Wake up to
                Waste campaign showed that there was 30% more use of waste
                disposal and recycling units in certain district council areas,
                for example. Other statistics show that people are more aware of
                the need to deal with waste. Therefore we are confident, to a
                certain extent, of a heightened awareness of the problem of
                waste. It is now for this Administration, working with the three
                partnership councils that are legally responsible for waste
                disposal, to develop plans that will bring us to the point of
                reducing, reusing and recycling waste.</p>

                indifferent market. Has the Minister researched whether proper
                recycling markets can be established, on a wider basis than this
                region, which would make it possible to meet the requirements of
                the Directive?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I appreciate Mr Gibson’s question, as he
                deals with the nub of the issue — the regional basis of waste
                disposal and recycling. He mentioned also the possibility of
                carrying out research in other regions. I have considered other
                areas and found that two traits arise throughout Europe and the
                rest of the world. The first is that it takes up to 10 years to
                get to the required standard, and the second important point is
                that there is a three-way split in waste disposal, the first two
                of which account for 30% each — recycling and landfill. The
                remainder is a gap that is filled, even in the most
                environmentally friendly countries, by what is called waste to
                energy; thermal; or that encapsulating word
                &quot;incineration&quot;. Dr McDonnell found his visit to an
                incineration plant in Copenhagen very informative.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are problems to be solved, and we must
                bite the bullet. The volume of our waste is much too high and
                must be dealt with. Compared with an average of 30% of waste
                going into a hole in the ground in Europe, 95% of our waste
                follows that route. We have a long way to go, and we must be
                realistic about the matter.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the issue of sustainable markets, £1·4
                million out of that £7·4 million is allocated to providing
                such markets for recycled goods. I have considered the issue
                throughout Europe and further afield, to Japan, to find out how
                the most developed and environmentally friendly countries deal
                with waste. We have a long way to go to reach that standard.</p>

                wind farms across the Province? Our renowned landscape will be
                spoiled. Will the Minister undertake to explore and, perhaps,
                seed-fund other forms of renewable energy, especially from

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is another fascinating question about
                renewable energy. Northern Ireland is a region of the United
                Kingdom, which is the fourth richest economy in the world, and
                therefore much energy is needed. The question is how we provide
                the energy, whether it is renewable energy, or fossil fuel,
                which adds to carbon dioxide emissions. Those are fundamental
                questions that need to be asked. Mrs Carson mentioned
                consultation on wind farms. If a windmill is made of two or more
                turbines connected to a wind farm, or if a windmill has only one
                turbine, but is in excess of 15 metres high, an environmental
                statement must be made requiring consultation. Mrs Carson’s
                question fundamentally concerned the forms of renewable energy.
                That is a fascinating question that is easy to ask, but
                difficult to answer.</p>

                If there is to be a preponderance of wind farms in areas such as
                Fermanagh, principally because of the lack of areas of
                outstanding natural beauty (AONB) status, and because companies
                carry out very limited consultation with local people, the
                Minister will find that, although we are all for green energy,
                there will be difficulties in the coming years in locating green
                energy generators in the right places. Lack of AONB status could
                mean that the tourism value of places such as Fermanagh will be

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I assure Mr McHugh that the tourism dimension
                is very important, although it is not within my remit. The
                tourist industry in Northern Ireland makes up a small proportion
                of the gross domestic product (GDP) compared with Scotland. If
                we could raise that to the same level as in Scotland, the
                industry would be much enhanced. This raises the matter of wind
                farms on the north coast. The wind turbines can be seen on the
                horizon on the Glens of Antrim as one travels up the M2 to the
                Antrim coast. With regard to sustainable development, a balance
                must be found between sustaining the economy and protecting the
                environment. The protection of the environment is an essential,

                powers before making recourse to section 115. For example, the

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Together with the Planning Service, my
                Department’s Environment and Heritage Service has reviewed the
                effectiveness of the arrangements for consulting on planning
                applications. The review identified weaknesses in the
                consultation process, most of which were attributable to
                resource pressures in the Environment and Heritage Service. It
                also identified some areas where improvements could be made
                quickly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To address the pressure, a bid for additional
                resources was made in the spending review 2002. The proposed
                allocations to my Department in the draft Budget do not suggest
                that it will be possible to meet the resource pressures.
                However, I will not be able to come to a definitive conclusion
                until the Budget is finalised later in the year.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Environment and Heritage Service and the
                Planning Service are introducing early improvements that are not
                dependent on new resources being obtained.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will the Minister specifically examine the
                number of planning applications in the Carrickfergus town centre
                area, where the Environment and Heritage Service has engaged
                consultants to work on its behalf? When the developers get the
                problems identified by consultants out of the way and they are
                about to progress, they suddenly find a new set of problems.
                That has resulted in some applications being in the system since
                around 1999.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Nesbitt:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, I have one general point. There are
                approximately 3,400 applications a year. Some of those involve
                the built heritage and some involve the natural heritage, so
                there are in total 5,236 consultations. There are not many staff
                to deal with those, the same problem that applied to a previous
                question.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am conscious of 4 Governors Place in
                Carrickfergus. That is a rather complex planning application
                because it involves demolition, retention of listed buildings
                and some apartments. The Environment and Heritage Service
                consulted a second time on that. I understand that the planners
                will meet the architect to see if we can reach a best outcome.
                That meeting is forthcoming. However, I stress that there are
                always tensions in planning that must be resolved.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee for Health, Social Services and
                Public Safety is examining the Protection of Children and
                Vulnerable Adults Bill. It is a significant piece of legislation
                and runs to over 50 clauses. The Committee warmly welcomes the
                Bill, which contains important provisions to enhance the
                protection of children and vulnerable adults. The Bill breaks
                new ground, and it is important that the Committee be able to
                devote sufficient time to scrutiny of its provisions, and to
                discussion of the impact it will have on organisations working
                with children.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Related issues include whistle-blowing and
                the making of disqualification orders for persons deemed to be a
                risk to children. In order to be satisfied that the Bill can
                fully deliver on its intent and provide safeguards for
                vulnerable young adults, the Committee asks that the Committee
                Stage of the Bill be extended to Friday 22 November 2002.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members of the Committee for Health, Social
                Services and Public Safety had differing views on the motion:
                some were for and against it; some were for and against the
                Regulations. My Colleague, Iris Robinson, Committee members from
                the Ulster Unionist Party and I have made our concerns clear.
                The Fire Services (Appointments and Promotion) (Amendment)
                Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2002 were brought before the
                Committee in July, just before recess, and several members
                raised concerns at its motive, particularly at this time.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Concerns were raised about the equivalent
                experience and qualifications required, article 39 of the
                European Community Treaty, and the need to maintain the morale
                of firefighters. Concerns were raised by the Fire Brigades Union
                about the poor consultation on the Regulations put before the
                Committee. Some Committee members, including myself, asked if
                this was a political move by the Minister of Health, Social
                Services and Public Safety.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Regulations provide for equivalent
                &quot;experience&quot; and &quot;qualifications&quot;. Members
                are aware of the many tragic incidents that have taken place in
                Northern Ireland over the past 30 years and more. One thing that
                has held Northern Ireland together is the experience and
                dedication of our firefighters across the board — regardless
                of religion. We had, and still have, conscientious, eager and
                professional firefighters.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are questions about the definition of
                equivalent &quot;experience&quot; and
                &quot;qualifications&quot;: there is no clear definition in the
                Regulations. The legal teams of the world will tell us that it
                is not important to include a clear definition. However, the
                Fire Brigades Union, my Colleagues and I believe that this is
                important.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department of Health, Social Services and
                Public Safety is throwing the responsibility for determining
                equivalent experience and qualifications to the Fire Authority
                for Northern Ireland selection panel. The Fire Authority has
                expressed several concerns about that — and I am sure, Madam
                Deputy Speaker, that you will have noticed those in the press
                recently. The responsibility should not be left to the Fire
                Authority: there should be a clear definition of the equivalent
                experience and qualifications required in the Regulations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members may ask what the equivalent
                experience and qualifications are. We were told that Her Majesty’s
                Inspectorate would be able to provide guidance, but that will
                not be the case. Her Majesty’s Inspectorate will not be able
                to provide guidance to the panel as stated by the Department in
                its letter to the members of the Committee for Health, Social
                Services and Public Safety. The Fire Authority for Northern
                Ireland has been advised of this, and I would like that
                clarified today.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No other profession in the country would
                permit outside entry at its highest level. It is like asking a
                road engineer to become head of brain surgery at the Royal
                Victoria Hospital: it is complete nonsense. Northern Ireland
                must have someone who is able for the job. In Northern Ireland
                there are men and women from each side of the community who
                would be capable of doing the job.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Article 39 of the European Community Treaty
                brings in the issue of the Good Friday Agreement. The post of
                Chief Fire Officer was previously designated as a public service
                post, so why is that not the case now? It is a public service
                post in other brigades in the United Kingdom, including London.
                Departmental officials told the Committee that the situation in
                Northern Ireland had changed since the Good Friday Agreement,
                and that therefore this exception was no longer justified. That
                is a joke, because we have seen how the Belfast Agreement has
                delivered anarchy, not just over the past couple of days in the
                Building but throughout the community. Article 39 must remain
                for security reasons.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Over the six years since the signing of the
                agreement, the level of violence has increased dramatically.
                There are more bomb attacks than ever, blast bombs have been
                fired at firefighters, there are daily attacks on firefighters,
                there is regular terrorist targeting and training, there was the
                incident in Colombia with FARC, and there are many other issues.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chief Fire Officer must remain in close
                contact with the Chief Constable and the General Officer
                Commanding in talks on many sensitive security matters. It is a
                delicate post. It is a crime to throw away the article and open
                the gate to anyone outside the UK. A person from Northern
                Ireland would be best for the post, given the security problems
                and the trouble on the streets.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is ironic that the Regulation has not been
                introduced anywhere else in the UK. Departmental officials told
                the Committee that other Departments in the UK are examining
                this, but that is all they are doing. This is a political move
                by the Sinn Féin/IRA Minister.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Firefighters’ morale is low as a result of
                attacks on them across the country. Career development and
                progression is greatly promoted in the Fire Service in Northern
                Ireland. Many male and female firefighters have worked through
                the ranks to senior positions, hoping that some day they will
                gain further promotion, but, if the Regulation is enacted, it
                will send out a message from the Department that no firefighters
                in Northern Ireland are capable of doing the job.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">People have said that it does not stop anyone
                in Northern Ireland from applying for the position, but the fact
                that the Minister is trying to move the Regulation to open up
                the position of Chief Fire Officer to anyone outside the UK is a
                clear political sign. It is also a sign that she thinks no one
                in Northern Ireland is capable of filling the position.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Paisley Jnr:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does the Member appreciate that it is
                important to employ someone who is capable of interacting
                directly with the Chief Constable in this role? The Member has
                already identified that, but the Minister does not interact with
                the Chief Constable except for guldering at his officers on the
                steps of Stormont. It would be useful to have someone who could
                interact appropriately with the Chief Fire Officer, especially
                in the event of a strike. Vehicles have been set aside for the
                police to do the job if that happens. It is, therefore,
                essential to have the right people interacting with the police
                at the right time.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Berry:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wholeheartedly agree. The way the Minister
                shouted at members of the Police Service of Northern Ireland on
                Friday was a disgrace. The Health Minister’s attitude was
                despicable, and she showed her true colours in the way she acted
                against the forces of the law.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree wholeheartedly that the Chief Fire
                Officer of Northern Ireland must be able to deal directly with
                the Chief Constable. It is clear that the Minister of Health,
                Social Services and Public Safety does not take the opportunity
                to do that. Given the current possibility of a strike, we need
                someone who can interact closely with the Chief Constable and
                the General Officer Commanding. Therefore, I fully understand Mr
                Paisley Jnr’s remarks.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Concern was raised by the Fire Brigades
                Union. When the issue came to the Committee’s attention, I
                spoke to representatives of the union, and I was astonished to
                learn that they knew nothing about the Regulation. Members might
                ask why the union needed to know about the Regulation. The
                bottom line is that the Fire Brigades Union, which represents
                95% of all firefighters in Northern Ireland, has the right to
                know about any changes. The decent thing to do would be to let
                them know that the senior post of Chief Fire Officer was open
                for appointment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When the Regulation and the Department’s
                two amendments appeared, I asked the officials whether the Fire
                Brigades Union had been consulted; it had not. It was consulted
                after the Regulation was drafted in the middle of July. However,
                its representatives first found out about the Regulation when I
                approached them. I find it grossly insulting that the Minister
                and her Department did not consult the union sooner rather than
                later.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must ask whether the Regulation is a
                political move. I have no doubt that the smokescreen of the
                Minister, her Department and others will be to say that they
                have received legal advice, and that retaining the existing
                qualifications required for Chief Fire Officer could have legal
                implications. The Committee received weak legal advice. The
                advice, which was consistent with that given to the Department,
                was that</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;the retention of the existing
                qualification requirements for the Chief fire officer probably
                cannot be justified, particularly in light of a relaxation of
                nationality requirements for public service posts&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This does not make it clear that retaining
                the existing qualifications would be illegal. The word
                &quot;probably&quot; cannot be justified. As far as I am
                concerned, the legal argument is flawed; it is a smokescreen
                raised by the Department and the Minister. The Minister’s
                ultimate goal is political. This is a political move against the
                UK Fire Service, but she is going through the back door. Other
                members of the Committee and I do not buy it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department keeps telling us that it is
                examining it, and that other Departments are examining it.
                Nowhere else in the United Kingdom has this taken place; only in
                Northern Ireland. We must zoom in to see the real problem, which
                is that we have a Sinn Féin/IRA Minister in the Department of
                Health, Social Services and Public Safety who is prepared to
                promote such issues for purely political reasons. She is
                prepared to forget about the morale of the firefighters and
                everything else in order to push this Regulation through for
                political reasons.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are people in Northern Ireland and in
                the Northern Ireland Fire Service who are capable of filling
                that senior position, no matter what religion they are. We have
                had people capable of this position in the past, and if it were
                opened up again, we would have capable candidates today.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am concerned that disciplinary action was
                taken against the two acting Chief Fire Officers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Is it a move to discredit the two gentlemen
                already in post? I should like the Department to clarify that
                today, for it stinks right through the whole system. There could
                be political moves on the part of the Minister to push this
                through.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I trust that the whole House will back us,
                and our motion, today. I also hope that it has listened clearly
                to the Fire Brigades Union, which represents 95% of firefighters
                in Northern Ireland. If we say that we are ignoring their views
                and do not agree with them, their morale will be very much
                affected.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many men and women have enjoyed career
                development and progression through the Northern Ireland Fire
                Service. Are they to be told that they might not have the
                opportunity because the Minister intends to open the floodgates
                and let anyone across the world apply for the position? In the
                Northern Ireland Fire Service we have men and women capable of
                taking on that position.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Today the Department must throw away the
                Regulations and forget about the flaws and the legalities of the
                whole thing; that is a smokescreen. The Minister and her
                Department must look to the Northern Ireland Fire Service for
                the position of Chief Fire Officer. We have the men and women
                who are capable of it.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Committee for Health,
                Social Services and Public Safety (Dr Hendron):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Like Mr Berry, I have nothing but the most
                profound respect for all the firefighters in Northern Ireland.
                Having been on the front line in West Belfast all down the
                years, I have seen their courage and their actions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I should like to take this opportunity to
                explain the Committee’s support for this Statutory Rule. As Mr
                Berry explained, the Committee’s decision was not unanimous;
                it was carried by a majority of six to two. Nonetheless, I am
                confident that the decision was well-informed, balanced and took
                full account of the issues raised.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee’s duty was to scrutinise the
                Statutory Rule and establish whether it was sound regarding its
                intent. The Committee has delegated responsibility for its
                technical scrutiny to the Examiner of Statutory Rules, whose
                report I shall return to later. The aim of this Statutory Rule
                is to widen the pool of qualified potential applicants for the
                post of Chief Fire Officer for Northern Ireland beyond the
                United Kingdom in order to attract the strongest possible field
                of candidates. That is based — in my view, quite rightly —
                on the promotion of equality and is consistent with the freedom
                of movement of workers across the European Community. As the
                substantive post of Chief Fire Officer has been vacant for some
                time, it is important that this legislation be progressed as
                soon as possible.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the light of concerns raised by the Fire
                Brigades Union, the Health Committee spent a considerable time
                considering the proposed legislation. It took evidence from
                departmental officials and representatives from the Fire
                Brigades Union. The union representatives voiced concern that
                the Fire Authority for Northern Ireland had not consulted it on
                the proposal.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although the Department says that
                consultation took place, it appears that that was only when the
                proposal for the Statutory Rule had reached an advanced stage.
                That is regrettable and is not consistent with open and
                transparent government. I trust that lessons will be learnt. Had
                the Fire Brigades Union been consulted from the outset, the
                Department might have had more success in convincing its
                leadership of the merits of the proposed change and allayed
                fears about any possible dilution of qualification standards in
                respect of the post of Chief Fire Officer.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Turning to the Statutory Rule, I wish to deal
                first with the legal implications of retaining the existing
                qualification requirements for Chief Fire Officer. The Health
                Committee sought the advice of the Assembly’s legal services
                regarding the Regulation’s aims. The advice, which was
                consistent with that given to the Department, was that</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;the retention of the existing
                qualification requirements for Chief Fire Officer probably
                cannot be justified, particularly in light of a relaxation of
                nationality requirements for public service posts.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The current Regulations could be seen as
                discriminating against those who are not UK nationals by
                unnecessarily reserving posts to that group.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Treaty on European Union 1997 provides
                for the free movement of workers without discrimination on the
                grounds of nationality. While Governments may classify certain
                public services as exempt from the freedom of movement
                legislation due to their &quot;state sensitive&quot; nature, I
                understand that the Department does not consider such an
                exclusion to be justified with respect to the post of Chief Fire
                Officer. That took account of the fact that few of the
                equivalent posts in Great Britain have such an exemption. It
                also took account of the situation in Northern Ireland following
                the Good Friday Agreement. I am not aware of any counter legal
                arguments having been made in support of the existing
                arrangements. The Minister may wish to confirm that I have
                interpreted the Department’s views correctly on both of those
                matters.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In its evidence to the Committee for Health,
                Social Services and Public Safety, the Fire Brigades Union
                underlined the importance of ensuring that the Chief Fire
                Officer has the ability and necessary training to do the job
                properly and effectively. Clearly, the Chief Fire Officer must
                command the respect of the entire firefighting force if there is
                not to be a serious loss of morale among members. To that end, I
                want to address the concerns raised by the Fire Brigades Union
                with regard to the proposed legislative changes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The union voiced concern that the proposals
                would, in effect, introduce a two-tier system and undermine the
                existing arrangements whereby senior officers aspiring to the
                highest positions of command must have completed the highly
                respected brigade command course. As a consequence of those
                concerns, the Committee wrote to the Department to seek
                clarification on what was meant by extending eligibility for the
                post to potential candidates who &quot;possess equivalent
                qualifications&quot; to a person who had completed the brigade
                command course. The Department took account of the concerns
                raised, and it amended the draft Statutory Rule to include the
                requirement for non-UK nationals to have &quot;experience&quot;
                and &quot;qualifications&quot; that are equivalent to those that
                are already in place in the Northern Ireland Fire Service. The
                Department has advised that judgements on the equivalence of
                qualifications and experience would rest with the Fire Authority
                on the advice of Her Majesty’s Inspector of Fire Services.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Committee members had concerns that the word
                &quot;equivalent&quot;, for the purposes of experience and
                qualifications, was not defined. I understand that the
                Department’s legal services have confirmed that it would not
                be advisable to prescribe in law the equivalence of
                qualifications and experience in respect of the requirements for
                the post, as that would result in the need for future sporadic
                amendments to the legislation. The Committee has no reason to
                doubt the integrity of the Fire Authority, relying on the
                professionalism and expertise of Her Majesty’s Inspector of
                Fire Services, to rigorously apply the new arrangements fairly.
                I believe that that will ensure that there is no dilution of the
                high standards that are currently required for the post of Chief
                Fire Officer.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I disagree with the argument made by some
                that the proposed legislation is, in some way, a slight on the
                capabilities of local senior fire officers. The high calibre of
                Northern Ireland’s fire officers is beyond dispute. Their
                selfless bravery and professionalism, which I referred to
                earlier, particularly in protecting lives and property during
                the 30 years of the troubles, is unquestionable. While the
                legislation serves to widen the pool of potential quality
                candidates, it does not in any way preclude any candidates from
                Northern Ireland or Great Britain from applying for, or being
                successful in, the competition. Of course, any unsuccessful
                candidate would have the facility to appeal to the Equality
                Commission if they felt that they had been unfairly treated. I
                am confident of the ability of local senior officers to
                demonstrate their qualification for the job in any such
                competition.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In his technical scrutiny of the Regulations,
                the Examiner of Statutory Rules made three comments. First,
                there was a breach of the 21-day rule, and the Department was
                remiss in not following established practice in laying
                Regulations. Secondly, it would have been more logical to insert
                regulation 4(1)(a) after regulation 4(2), and, thirdly, it would
                have been better to have expressly stated in the Regulations
                that it was for the Fire Authority to decide what experience and
                qualifications were equivalent to those set out in regulation
                4(1)(a).</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee will consider the Examiner of
                Statutory Rules’ report at its next meeting. However, the
                examiner has confirmed that his comments are relatively minor
                points that do not invalidate the Regulations. He has brought
                his comments to the Department’s attention and has suggested
                that it may wish to bring forward an amendment in due course to
                tidy up the Regulations. The Committee will make its views known
                to the Minister on how this Statutory Rule has been handled.
                Although there are lessons to be learned for the future, they do
                not invalidate the rationale of the Regulations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On behalf of the Health, Social Services and
                Public Safety Committee, I urge Members to support this
                progressive piece of legislation. It is consistent with the
                principle of freedom of movement for workers within the European
                Community and aims to ensure that the Northern Ireland Fire
                Service has the best possible pool of potential quality
                applicants for the post of Chief Fire Officer.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr J Kelly:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.
                In proposing the motion, Assembly Member Berry talked about
                politicisation and mentioned the Minister and Sinn Féin/IRA,
                yet the entire thrust of his address was to politicise the Fire
                Service in this part of Ireland. The motion is not about the
                competence of the Fire Service. As other Members have said, no
                one has in any way attempted to criticise, diminish or belittle
                the Fire Service; neither is the amendment an attempt to prevent
                internal promotions within the North of Ireland Fire Service.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The amendment does not propose that no one
                from within the North of Ireland Fire Service can become Chief
                Fire Officer. It is about equality of opportunity. As Joe
                Hendron said, it is about casting the net wider so that those
                from America, Germany, France, Italy or the other part of
                Ireland can apply for that job. All the amendment does is extend
                that notion of equality. It does not in any way disbar, disallow
                or prevent promotion from within the North of Ireland Fire
                Service.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Earlier today we were discussing leaked
                information, yet Mr Berry has been leaking information from the

                in July — not in September or October, but in July. It was
                legitimate of me to raise the issue. It was during consultation.
                As a Health Committee member, I asked members of the Fire
                Brigades Union whether they were aware of the Regulations, which
                they were not. Where is the crime in that? Does the Member not

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have spoken to firemen about what they are
                about. We have explained to the Fire Brigades Union the content,
                impact and import of the amendment. The entire objective of the
                motion seems to be to prohibit and confine; to create a closed
                shop in the North of Ireland Fire Service where no one outside
                the North of Ireland Fire Service ought to be promoted to Chief
                Fire Officer. That cannot be right — there is no openness,
                transparency or accountability in any sense of the word.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.45 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In opposing the motion, the Department is
                clear in its use of words. The amendment allows a person to

                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;has acquired experience and

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">to the original requirements. That fits in
                with what the Fire Service has said. There may be merit in
                ensuring that the Regulations to ensure such equivalence are
                comprehensive and robust. However, there is nothing in the
                wording of the amendment that could be objected to by anyone
                concerned with equality of opportunity and ensuring that the
                best person for the job gets the job, irrespective of where he
                comes from. I oppose the motion.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support Mr Berry’s prayer of annulment. I
                agree with him, even if only in this matter. Can Members listen
                to what I have to say before they comment? We have recently
                spoken in the House about attacks on firemen and women by
                mindless thugs on our streets. Most of us have supported the
                firefighters’ battle to achieve a new wage structure to
                replace the existing 25-year-old one. The firefighters regard
                the proposed appointment and promotion Regulations as yet
                another attack on them. Those Regulations are not being
                considered for the other 57 of the 58 fire brigades in the
                United Kingdom. The existing Regulations are currently protected
                by the Treaty of Rome. However, it is argued that they must be
                altered here to achieve equality in accordance with the
                so-called needs of Northern Ireland. Such a change is not
                necessary at this stage and would also be extremely dangerous
                because it would open up senior positions to people in the
                European community who might not necessarily have the practical
                experience and who may have some communication shortcomings. In
                the heat of an emergency, a split-second delay could prove
                fatal. I hope that people understand my practical concerns.</p>

                firefighting was recently appointed. Add possible communication
                problems to that and there could be trouble.</p>

                like it or not. Firefighters in Northern Ireland regard the
                proposal as an insult because they think they are being treated
                differently from other firefighters in the UK. They fear that it
                would de-professionalise their service and open it up to
                non-experienced personnel, thus placing them at even greater
                risk than they already are.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I said, I am making practical comments at
                this stage. No one in this Chamber can be in any doubt that I
                and my party have always supported the equality legislation.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our support is not selective. We support
                equality legislation. However, because something is, in general,
                desirable and right, it does not mean that every application of
                it has been desirable or right. We have complained about the
                process of the equality legislation — there have been many
                delays. All of a sudden, however, this idea turns up. It should
                be considered, but only on a UK-wide basis. At this stage no
                change should be made that would be to the detriment of any
                firefighter.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The proposed change is not for good,
                practical reasons. Such changes should only be made when the
                equality legislation for the whole of the UK is examined. That
                should be the case until Northern Ireland is put into the South.
                I support the motion.</p>

                in the debate and the time that we have made available, I ask
                the remaining Members to limit their contributions to five

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the prayer of annulment motion
                brought by my Colleague on the Committee for Health, Social
                Services and Public Safety, Mr Berry. The position of Chief Fire
                Officer in Northern Ireland is a crucial post and, as some
                Members intimated earlier, the person in post must interact with
                the Chief Constable and the General Officer Commanding.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Morale among our firefighters is very low,
                following their high-profile campaign for better pay and a
                greater recognition of their role in society. Meanwhile,
                frequent mindless attacks on them continue across the Province.
                Firefighters take their lead from their superiors, so it is
                important that those who represent them, the face of
                firefighters, have their utmost respect and support. As the Fire
                Brigades Union representatives informed the Committee,
                firefighters may live or die on vital command and control
                decisions taken by senior officers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I oppose discrimination, wherever it is found
                and from whatever source it emanates. The person most suitable
                — the best-trained, the most qualified and the one most likely
                to do the job best — should always get the job. That is why I
                so deplore the discrimination that exists in policing. Young men
                and women can fail to become police officers, even though they
                know that they were better candidates than others who were
                chosen. That often means rejection from a career that the
                unsuccessful applicant has always had an ambition to pursue,
                perhaps even following in the footsteps of other family members.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not want to see discrimination in the
                Fire Service. I want the Chief Fire Officer to be the best
                person for the job. For that to be the case, he or she will
                require an intimate knowledge of Northern Ireland. As a result
                of our tragic history, heading an organisation such as the
                Northern Ireland Fire Brigade requires a familiarity with the
                Province’s geography and the cultural issues whose
                significance remains throughout our society. It is not as if we
                have a limited pool of potential candidates from whom to choose.
                Under current legislation, our Chief Fire Officer could be
                appointed from officers throughout the 59 UK fire brigades who
                have completed the brigade command course at Fire Service
                college. Does it not seem peculiar that the Sinn Féin Minister
                now wishes to change the legislation to allow for applications
                from outside the United Kingdom? It has been claimed that to
                maintain the current legislation would be unlawful. However,
                other legal advice rubbishes that supposition.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Why are the other 58 fire brigades in Great
                Britain not seeking amendments to their legislation? Is it any
                wonder that firefighters’ leaders fear that it is not about
                ability or equality of opportunity, but purely a political
                decision by a Minister pursuing an all-Ireland agenda.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Fire Brigades Union also fears that
                political factors were behind the recent controversies
                surrounding the Fire Authority. Is it just coincidence that the
                only two Northern Ireland Fire Brigade officers who are in a
                position to apply for the Chief Fire Officer post have recently
                been made subject to disciplinary investigations?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the Irish Republic, a two-tier entry
                system means that senior officers can possess little experience
                in command and control issues for large-scale incidents such as
                bomb scenes. For example, the chief fire officer in Wexford
                graduated in civil engineering in 1998 and worked as a building
                control officer for a consultancy firm until she was appointed
                assistant chief fire officer for Mayo.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Firefighters in Northern Ireland support the
                integrated personal development system promoted in the UK Fire
                Service, and, especially now, when pay and conditions are under
                discussion, it would be ridiculous for firefighters to do
                anything that might weaken their links with colleagues in Great
                Britain. As such, the appointment of a chief officer from
                outside the UK would run counter to the integrated personal
                development system. Firefighters wish to pursue that pathway of
                career progression and development, not to introduce a two-tier
                system. I support the motion.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am quite sure that the prayer of annulment
                was not inspired in heaven; it is more likely that it was
                enunciated in less hallowed places, among people who have a
                vested interest in ensuring the retention of restrictive work
                practices. Why else would anyone want to limit the potential
                pool of applicants for the post of Chief Fire Officer? I cannot
                think of another reason.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am sure that Mr Berry will reassure the
                House that his intervention has not been influenced by anyone in
                the Northern Ireland Fire Brigade who may be a potential
                applicant to the vacant post. I raise that issue, not as an
                allegation of impropriety, but to enable Mr Berry to go on the
                record with a crystal clear assurance that he has had no contact
                with anyone who may benefit from the annulment of the
                Regulations, which enable — <i>[Interruption].</p>

                honestly in the House that no one, including the acting Chief
                Fire Officers, has consulted me about the issue. I have had
                discussions about the positions with the Fire Brigades Union
                but, I stress, never with an acting Chief Fire Officer.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dallat:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I raised the issue to give Mr Berry the
                opportunity to go on record and state that he has not been
                influenced in any way and because I know that, in the past, he
                has tabled leading questions relating to the Fire Service, which
                I felt at the time were inspired by personal contact. However, I
                have no proof.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are serious issues relating to the
                future development and reform of the Fire Service, and, although
                there has been a tendency to put all the blame on the
                beleaguered Fire Authority, there are real concerns about the
                ability of some people in the Fire Brigade’s management team.
                I say that because many of the recommendations made by the
                Public Accounts Committee have not been implemented and, in some
                cases, have been obstructed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In such circumstances, I suggest that a new
                broom is needed to clean out everything that is wrong in the
                Fire Service. However, in saying that, I do not take away from
                the sterling work of firefighters in the past 30 years. I do not
                want anyone to confuse the two issues.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To reimpose restrictive practices would not
                be in the interest of genuine reform, but would be construed as
                either politically motivated to prevent applications from the
                Republic or a clumsy attempt to enhance the prospects of
                existing personnel. Of course, such practice is contrary to the
                ethos of the EU, of which we are a member.</p>

                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I shall conclude, because I know that you are
                anxious, Madam Deputy Speaker, that speeches be short. Do we
                potentially tell a firefighter or a fire chief who served in New
                York on 11 September and who wanted to apply for a job in the
                North that they are unqualified? I should think not. Mr Berry,
                in his single transferable speech, told the House that his
                little prayer was not inspired by the angels but by other
                factors. However, those factors have nothing to do with
                improving the Fire Service and more to do with retaining the
                closed shop.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Shannon:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion that my Colleague Mr
                Berry moved and that was ably spoken to by another Colleague,
                Mrs Robinson.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I must put on record my concern about the
                Minister’s decision to consider this matter. In common with
                many others, I have no doubt that that decision is purely
                politically motivated. Members have said that they wish to
                ensure that there is equal opportunity of employment. That is
                true; however, if we follow the procedures and changes that the
                Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety has
                proposed, that equality will not follow. For example, an officer
                in the Irish Army who transfers into the Irish Fire Service, and
                who may be insufficiently qualified to hold that position, can
                then apply for a position in the Northern Ireland Fire Brigade.
                That is wrong; in order to obtain a post in Northern Ireland
                people here must be qualified, have abilities, have passed exams
                and have done all that is necessary. For someone down there to
                get in through the back door is unfair and must be opposed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The issue has been discussed in many
                councils, and my own, Ards Borough Council, has put on record
                its opposition to the proposed changes. Many other councils have
                done likewise, and, as a result, the momentum against the
                proposals has grown across the Province.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister’s proposals discriminate
                directly against those in Northern Ireland who wish to become
                Chief Fire Officer. As long as that continues, she and her
                Department stand condemned over fair play and fair employment.
                It is only fair that the same rules apply to everyone who must
                go through our selection procedure.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The changes also attack the firefighters’
                morale. My Colleagues have mentioned that attack on their
                morale. It is clear that many firefighters feel let down and
                undermined and that the proposed change in legislation tramples
                on their motivation and role.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If this were happening in any other sphere of
                employment, cries about fair play, fair employment and
                discrimination would be heard from unions and elected
                representatives. Yet that is what we face in this instance. It
                is ridiculous that the Minister will be allowed to make changes
                and manipulate employment guidelines to suit a political agenda.
                Let us look at the issue and give the job to the best candidate.
                Let us ensure that everyone has the same opportunity to apply
                for that job, and let us not allow the Minister and her
                Department to ride roughshod over the feelings of Members, those
                in the Fire Brigades Union and all those who wish to apply for
                the job but who are unable to do so.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support my Colleague’s motion, and I ask
                Members to support him. We cannot allow manipulation to occur
                for political motivations in the Chamber. It is political
                engineering, which is unacceptable and cannot be supported.</p>

                Fire Officer by opening up the post to a wide range of
                applicants in Europe and further afield. The Regulations will
                also ensure that the high standard of experience and
                qualifications required for the post are maintained. The draft
                Regulations, which I circulated for consultation in July, sought
                to achieve that by calling for candidates to have qualifications
                equivalent to those currently required.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In response to concerns expressed by the Fire
                Brigades Union, however, the Regulations now before the Assembly
                also requires candidates to have equivalent firefighting
                experience before they can be accepted for interview. Therefore
                the Regulations include a new clause that allows candidates from
                anywhere in the world, with equivalent qualifications and
                experience, to apply.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important to note the nature of
                equivalence. The word &quot;equivalent&quot; means equal in
                value; having the same meaning or result; tantamount to or
                corresponding. Any applicant who does not have the necessary
                experience and qualifications will not be called to interview.
                Critics of the clause continue to claim that it will, somehow,
                dilute the stringent standards that exist. How can that be the
                case, if candidates are expected to have the same qualifications
                and fire service experience? To suggest that an engineer or a
                building inspector without these qualifications and senior level
                firefighting experience could be appointed as a result of the
                legislation is simply nonsense. They would not even be
                interviewed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The example of the appointment of a female
                Chief Fire Officer in Wexford is quoted again and again and was
                mentioned in the House today. It is used so often to argue
                against the Regulations that it must call into question the
                critics’ other arguments against the Regulations. Is it
                concern over standards that motivates them, or is it fear that a
                woman could apply, and be accepted for, such a post?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important for Members to understand
                that the Regulations does not affect, in any way, applications
                from serving members in brigades in GB or here, provided they
                have the appropriate qualifications and experience. All it does
                is extend the field to other suitable candidates in exactly the
                same way as the field is extended for all the other important
                jobs Members may see advertised in newspapers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Apart from the sensible and practical reasons
                for endorsing the Regulations, there are also compelling reasons
                to do with equality. Under European legislation, Governments are
                required to facilitate the free movement of workers in the
                European Union. That means that the existing legislation
                discriminates against qualified candidates from the rest of
                Europe and elsewhere. Such indirect discrimination leaves the
                appointment process open to legal challenge. I have been advised
                that any such challenges would be successful. It has been
                mistakenly reported that the post of Chief Fire Officer is
                automatically exempted from the requirement to be open to other
                EU citizens. This is not the case. Such an exemption cannot be
                justified here. It is worth noting that it does not apply to the
                post of Chief Constable of the PSNI. The Chief Fire Officer’s
                post, under article 39(4) of the EEC Treaty, was previously
                designated as a public service post, which meant that non-UK
                nationals were prevented from applying for it. On the basis of
                legal advice, the Department no longer considers that the post
                justifies a public service exemption.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Few fire brigades in GB attract this
                exemption, and the situation here, following the Good Friday
                Agreement, does not justify the exemption. Unless it was held
                that there were good reasons for not allowing European nationals
                from outside GB and here to apply for public posts, this public
                service exemption, which blocks such nationals from applying,
                could be judged by the courts to amount to discrimination.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In answer to Paul Berry’s argument that the
                person holding this post will need to interact with the Chief
                Constable of the PSNI, I must point out that the exemption does
                not apply to the Chief Constable.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The views of members of the Fire Brigades
                Union were sought and received during consultation, and the
                original proposed Regulations were amended to specify that
                equivalent qualifications and experience would be required,
                consistent with some of the concerns that they raised. During
                the consultation, the Committee found out about certain matters
                before the Fire Brigades Union, because it consistently sought
                and received early sight of departmental proposals.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to the proposed Regulations, the
                Department wrote to the Committee for Health, Social Services
                and Public Safety on 1 July. That was followed by formal
                consultation on 5 July, with a range of organisations including
                the Fire Brigades Union, the Retained Firefighters Union, the
                Fire Authority and district councils. The Fire Brigades Union
                responded to the consultation letter of 5 July on 20 August.
                Following receipt of the response, the proposals were amended in
                line with some of the concerns that it expressed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Questions have been raised about the morale
                of firefighters here, and the suggestion has been made that that
                could be affected by the proposed Regulations. It is a nonsense
                to suggest that someone from elsewhere, without relevant
                firefighting experience, would be eligible for the post. To
                suggest that the Regulations allows amateurs to apply is, by
                definition, an insult to existing firefighters. Equivalent
                qualifications and experience are required. Morale could be
                damaged to a far greater extent by the suggestion that people
                here would be able to compete only if no one else were allowed
                onto the field.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Regulations in no way reflect on the
                suitability of potential candidates for this post — here or
                elsewhere. There have been made because of practical, legal and
                equality issues. Under these Regulations, qualified officers in
                the Fire Brigade remain eligible to apply, as can suitably
                qualified officers from fire brigades in Great Britain.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We decided not to wait until such changes had
                been made elsewhere, because we all recognise the importance of
                this post being filled substantively, as a matter of urgency.
                The post is about to be advertised, and therefore we cannot wait
                for changes to be made elsewhere before we act. Were we to do
                so, our legal advice is that we would be open to legal
                challenge.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have listened with intent to several
                Members who spoke during the debate. I listened to the
                Chairperson of the Health Committee, Joe Hendron, who said that
                it is important that we widen the pool. As far as I am
                concerned, our pool is wide enough at present. We have capable
                men and women in Northern Ireland. Dr Hendron’s Colleague John
                Dallat can shake his head at me, but I believe that we have the
                men and women in Northern Ireland who are able to carry out the
                position of Chief Fire Officer, even if Dr Hendron disagrees.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree wholeheartedly with the Chairperson
                of the Health Committee that the post must be filled. I call on
                the Department to get its finger out, get rid of these
                Regulations and appoint a Chief Fire Officer to Northern

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Democratic Unionist Party is fit enough
                to deal with those people.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have heard much about the legal
                implications. Let us consider the wording. The legal advisers
                returned to the Department and said that the word
                &quot;probably&quot; cannot be justified. If that is the legal
                advice, that person should get the sack. That is not clear
                guidance for us as a Committee.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have also heard people say that this
                annulment will discriminate against people across the world, in
                places such as Germany. Anyone who says that we are going to
                discriminate is a hypocrite. These Regulations are
                discriminating against the Northern Ireland firefighters who
                have gone through the ranks — people who have developed their
                career and progressed through the Fire Service for 30 years. If
                the Regulations were to go ahead, those people would be clearly
                discriminated against. The Minister’s attempt to have those
                enacted is once again a political move.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We then had the words of John Kelly — what
                a courageous man. He said that he would question the motives
                behind the motion. He said that the motion’s object was
                political. Who is political today? The Minister of Health and Mr
                red-faced John Kelly. He went on to talk about leaked documents.
                Sinn Féin/IRA’s spokespersons are the last people who should
                be talking about leaked documents in the Assembly today, given
                the circumstances of Friday past.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We move on to the issue of equivalency,
                qualifications and the firefighters’ morale. That is being
                basically laughed off. Forget about the morale of the
                firefighters, even though the Fire Brigades Union has consulted
                with us all and made it known that it is against these
                Regulations because they basically say to the men and women of
                the Northern Ireland Fire Service, no matter what their
                religion, that there is no one capable within its ranks.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank Eileen Bell and Iris Robinson. Iris
                Robinson said that the Chief Fire Officer must be aware of the
                geography and culture of Northern Ireland. We are aware that the
                Minister of Health will not be in close consultation with the
                Chief Constable and the General Officer Commanding (GOC) for her
                own political reasons. Over the past 30 years, we have been
                aware of Sinn Féin/IRA’s view of the police. It has been in
                close contact with the police, because it has pointed the gun at
                them and has murdered many police officers across the streets of
                Northern Ireland. It is clear that it is not going to consult
                closely with them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But we need a Chief Fire Officer who is
                prepared, capable and aware of the geography of Northern
                Ireland. While the Minister will not consult with the Chief
                Constable of Northern Ireland, especially after all her
                screaming in the corridors of this Building on Friday, we need a
                man or woman capable of taking on this position.</p>

                worth listening to was her disgraceful comment that we are
                trying to discriminate against women. While the Minister for
                Health, who is a woman, has done a bad job in the Department of
                Health, Social Services and Public Safety, that does not mean
                that any other woman who applies to be the Chief Fire Officer
                would fail. It is clear that the Minister of Health has failed
                in her Department, and I trust that she will also fail today. I
                trust that the annulment will be accepted.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, Madam Deputy Speaker. In
                a previous debate a savage attack was launched on me and on what
                I was doing when the Minister of Agriculture and Rural
                Development was speaking. I make no apology in the House to
                anybody when I am representing those who have been bereaved,
                shot and maimed by the IRA. I was with the Minister of<br>
                State with responsibility for security, on her invitation; she
                brought the meeting forward so that I might make an issue of
                those who have suffered so tragically in recent days in the
                constituency that I represent. To be told that that is a stunt
                is an insult to the memory of the people who have suffered.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Order. I am aware that the Member was
                interested in making a personal statement, but I advise him that
                he must seek permission from the Speaker to do so. That personal
                statement may or may not be made following the Speaker’s
                decision tomorrow morning.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Further to that point of order, Madam Deputy
                Speaker. Given the comment made by the Minister of Agriculture
                and the representations made by Dr Paisley, will you offer the
                Minister the opportunity to withdraw her comments?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This issue was discussed in the debate when
                the remarks were made, and the request was made for a personal
                statement. I have given Mr Paisley the opportunity to write to
                the Speaker so that his request can be considered. Both Members
                were given the opportunity to explain themselves during the
                debate, and I will leave it at that.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a great deal of concern about
                maternity services in the Belfast area. I want to detail the
                times that women have been promised a centralised maternity
                hospital in Belfast. In 1996, ‘Seeking Balance’, which
                became known as the McKenna Report, was published, and that was
                followed in 1997 by the Donaldson Report.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the minutes of a meeting of the Eastern
                Health and Social Services Board on 15 April 1999, Mr William
                McKee, chief executive of the Royal Victoria Hospital, said that
                he had been invited to draw up a business case in spring 1998
                for a new hospital costing approximately £19 million. Then in
                1999 — when there were maternity services at the Jubilee
                Maternity Hospital and the Royal Maternity Hospital — a
                consultation document was published, and on 27 January 2000 the
                Minister, making an announcement about the interim arrangements,
                said that people should be reassured that it would not be the
                final move.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On 27 January 2000, the Minister said:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;My firm intention is to have the new
                hospital in place in five to six years’ time.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In June 2001, the findings of a review group
                on acute hospitals were published. In November 2001, a
                specification for a new centralised maternity hospital was
                issued. In June 2002, ‘Developing Better Services’ was
                produced. It was the outcome of the review group’s findings on
                acute hospitals. A footnote on chapter 4 states:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;A new Centralised Maternity Service
                will be sited on either the Royal Group or the Belfast City
                Hospital site. Maternity services at the Mater Hospital should
                directly link to this Service.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">By June 2002, the Committee for Health,
                Social Services and Public Safety was informed that the
                specifications for the Royal Jubilee Maternity Hospital would be
                produced and then subjected to a 12-week consultation. From 1996
                to June 2002, there have been consultation documents, requests
                for specifications and references in documents that reviewed
                maternity services in Northern Ireland, but we are still
                awaiting the outcome of the consultation. On and on it has gone,
                and the morale of those awaiting the outcome has been at such a
                level that some serious questions need to be asked. There is no
                mention in the draft Programme for Government of the new
                centralised maternity hospital in Belfast.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The physical inadequacies of the Jubilee
                Maternity Hospital and the Royal Maternity Hospital were
                highlighted as far back as 1996. The Jubilee Maternity Hospital
                has now gone, and there has been a merger between it and the
                Royal Maternity Hospital, but, undoubtedly, the physical
                inadequacies remain. Mr McKee, the chief executive of the Royal
                Group of Hospitals, pointed out at the time, when accepting a
                refurbishment cost of £1·8 million, that it would only be a
                temporary measure as he wanted a new centralised hospital.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In 1997, the Donaldson Report stated that the
                ultimate goal was to develop a new unified hospital with a
                regional perinatal centre. It stated that plans should be drawn
                up without delay, and an unambiguous timescale should be
                established for their implementation. Instead of that new build,
                two old hospitals have been combined into one hospital, and
                there have been two costly judicial reviews.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the review of acute services, comments
                were made about what might happen to the maternity services in
                Lagan Valley Hospital and Downpatrick Maternity Hospital. In
                Downpatrick and Lagan Valley there are 1,556 births; in the
                Mater Infirmorum Hospital there are 1,059 births; and in the
                Royal and Jubilee Maternity Hospital there are 4,712 births.
                Therefore, there are potentially about 7,327 births — and
                there could be multiple births among those figures. That means
                that many people will be affected by this decision.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What would a women-centred service look like?
                Women should be asked what they want, and their levels of
                satisfaction with the current service should be tested. Does the
                service, as it stands, have the support of women who use it? Is
                it producing good clinical outcomes for mothers and babies?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In 1996, the cost in the reports was
                predicted to be between £10 million and £15 million. In 2002,
                the cost is estimated at an exorbitant £204 million, following
                an economic appraisal, which was carried out two years ago. Is
                there any commitment to provide resources for a new centralised
                maternity hospital, given the costs that have been highlighted
                in the appraisal, because, search as I may, I cannot find them?
                Yet we remain with questions on the safety of a small and rather
                old maternity hospital, which continues to be refurbished. I
                understand that the refurbishment is continuing with the
                installation of a pipe system for lab specimens.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For the majority of mothers, giving birth
                should be a normal experience that takes place without the need
                for complex medical treatment for either the mother or the
                child. It should be recognised that maternity services should be
                centred on women, who should be considered to be partners in the
                decision-making process. They should be offered fully informed
                choices about the type of care that they will receive, and every
                effort should be made to accommodate the choices that they make.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the review of acute hospitals’
                proposals for midwife-led units. However, as I understand it,
                only one pilot unit will be created between the Downe and Lagan
                Valley Hospitals. That has implications for the new centralised
                maternity hospital. I understand that some women have the choice
                of case-led and midwife-led care, but we are left with a
                question about what we will do about over 7,000 births in the
                near future.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Midwives’ morale is low. Some of the staff
                of the Jubilee Hospital chose not to move to what is known as
                the Royal Jubilee Maternity Hospital, so the complement of
                midwives and neonatal specialists is down. Often the neonatal
                units are under so much pressure that they must find space for
                mothers and babies in other hospitals, and sometimes the mothers
                who are moved out must be moved back again. That raises serious
                questions about the care that they receive.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The number of mothers electing to give birth
                in the Royal Jubilee Maternity Hospital is decreasing. Those
                women are going elsewhere. In January 2001 six consultants in
                obstetrics and gynaecology wrote to me and to the Minister. That
                letter, which demonstrates their morale, said:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;In the interests of open and
                accountable government we call on the Health Committee to
                initiate an urgent enquiry into the Department of Health’s
                handling of the maternity issue. We call on the Minister to
                urgently tackle the issue of maternity and gynaecological
                services in Belfast and beyond and to initiate a fair, open and
                just consultation process.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although that letter was written in January
                2001, they are still waiting for an outcome.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is great concern about all the
                services. When will the Minister decide on, and confirm funding
                for, a new centralised maternity hospital, given the promises
                that she made as long ago as 2000? Will she give priority to the
                provision of centralised maternity and gynaecological services
                in Belfast in the final Programme for Government, given that it
                was not even mentioned in the draft programme? How can Members
                support the Minister’s securing early funding and a commitment
                to a fast-track project timetable?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have waited for more than six years for
                that project. A decision is to be made after the 12-week period
                of consultation, which will follow the submission of two
                specifications from the Belfast City and Royal Hospitals, which
                were promised at the start of the summer. I initiated this
                debate on the Adjournment because I was led to believe that
                consultation would begin at the start of this parliamentary
                session, but we are still waiting. It is extremely important,
                therefore, to know when the consultation document will be
                prepared to enable the project to begin.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What has the Minister done to secure funding
                — funding for this mainstream capital project does not seem to
                be mentioned in the Budget? Has the Minister visited the Royal
                Jubilee Maternity Hospital, and is she aware of the current
                conditions there? I understand that recent steam and sewerage
                problems on the site have given much cause for concern.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.45 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have raised the issue of hygiene standards
                in the House before; the serious problems with the steam and
                sewerage systems on that site, which we know is old, are
                obviously dangerous.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">How will the Minister ensure that the views
                of women who are using obstetric and gynaecological services are
                heard? When I say &quot;a women-centred service&quot;, I mean
                that both for maternity and gynaecological services. We know the
                links that must be made with oncology, particularly in relation
                to urology. Those are women’s complaints, so any service must
                address them together rather than separately.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Has relevant UK evidence-based research on
                the location of maternity and gynaecological services, and the
                links between them, been taken into consideration? We are more
                than aware of links made with paediatric services. However, I
                continue to emphasise that, if we are to have a women-centred
                hospital like there are elsewhere in the United Kingdom, we must
                constantly prioritise the interaction between gynaecological
                services, which are lifelong, and those for maternity.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, how will the Minister ensure that
                gynaecological services are given appropriate consideration in
                the current consultation? I say that because, when I first
                entered the House as a Member for South Belfast, I had high
                hopes that it would not be long before we found ourselves with a
                new, purpose-built hospital. It now looks like the Assembly is
                going down, but even had it lasted to March or April 2003, I
                would have left office without any purpose-built, centralised
                maternity hospital having been secured. I made that a priority
                when I was elected, and I sincerely hope that, as I go around
                the doors, I shall be able to tell my constituents that it has
                not been lost for ever.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Birnie:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am grateful to Ms McWilliams for giving us
                an opportunity to consider this important matter. In fact, it is
                at least the third time in the life of the Assembly that the
                issue has been addressed. As Ms McWilliams rightly said, there
                is a long history to how we got to where we are now — the
                McKenna Report, the Donaldson Report and, more recently, the
                judicial review.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In a sense, we must start from where we are
                rather than where we might ideally wish to be. At the time of
                the earlier debate on the choice between the Royal Victoria
                Hospital and the Jubilee Maternity Hospital sites, a fear was
                expressed that a merger of the two units, especially at a single
                location at the Royal Victoria Hospital, would lead to a
                &quot;shoehorning&quot; into one inadequate building. As Ms
                McWilliams has pointed out, there is some evidence that that has
                become the case. The worrying aspect, as Ms McWilliams also
                said, is that what we were told would be an interim solution
                seems to be becoming an unsatisfactory medium-term or even
                relatively permanent solution, to the detriment of the
                well-being of mothers, mothers-to-be and their babies.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In their previous existences, both the Royal
                Victoria Hospital’s maternity unit and the Jubilee Maternity
                Hospital seemed to have a distinct ethos of care, especially in
                the style of treatment during delivery. One point that I should
                like to raise is that, in the management of the single combined
                unit, there should be an attempt to take what is best from the
                ethos of both sides of the merger. Admittedly, that will be a
                difficult task, but I hope that it will at least be attempted in
                order to maximise choice for mothers-to-be. Perhaps preserving,
                maintaining and improving choice should be an underlying theme
                in this debate. Of course, that is subject to the two other main
                considerations — cost and coverage for emergency cases. Much
                uncertainty has been generated by the current situation, and
                some of the ill effects were well evidenced in Prof McWilliams’s
                speech. Finally, I urge the Minister to end that uncertainty and
                to secure ring-fenced funding for this care and treatment.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr McDonnell:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am pleased to take part in the debate. I
                agree with the last two Members that we must act urgently to
                ensure that better maternity services are available for Belfast,
                and south Belfast in particular. The question of maternity
                services has been unresolved for far too long. Other Members
                have outlined its various phases, events, reviews and inquiries.
                The longer the debate continues, the longer the Health Service
                provision for women suffers. It is far below what is acceptable.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was glad that Ms McWilliams introduced the
                issue of women’s health in general. It is not just a matter of
                maternity services; it covers many complex issues, which, along
                with maternity services, must be placed at the top of the
                Assembly’s health agenda. Full gynaecological services must be
                maintained to a high standard, and they must be built,
                maintained and developed on the Belfast City Hospital site.
                Gynaecological services need considerable investment. Much of
                that investment must be made in parallel with the new cancer
                centre at Belfast City Hospital, because much gynaecological ill
                health is associated with cancer risks and scares.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">New life — the pregnant woman, the unborn
                baby and the newborn child on its mother’s knee — stirs an
                emotional response in most of us. However, many women incur
                disease or injury as a consequence of maternity and
                childbearing,. Because we were concerned by the publicity over
                certain issues of women’s health, a few years ago my partners
                and I carried out a survey of about 200 women between 45 and 55
                who were not seeking medical attention. Of the 200, 199 required
                attention but were not seeking it. Many of those women’s
                problems arose either directly or indirectly as a result of
                childbirth. Consequently, many of those women were severely
                embarrassed, if not severely handicapped.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is not enough to discuss childbirth; the
                Assembly must make women’s health a higher priority. As a GP,
                I have found that many middle-aged women between 45 and 55 look
                after everybody but themselves — their children, their
                grandchildren, their husbands and, often, elderly parents. Their
                own priorities and health are not served.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that the Minister responds to my plea.
                It is essential that we resolve the debate about maternity
                services and attempt to ensure that services are not only
                maintained but improved in a brand new hospital designed to meet
                the needs of all mothers. Shoehorning the Jubilee into the Royal
                Hospital was perhaps efficient and cost-effective, but it was
                certainly not as effective as regards patient satisfaction as it
                should have been. There is an overload. The building cannot cope
                because its facilities are inadequate most of the time. We
                should remember that not all babies are born to schedule. There
                may be a large number of births one week and a smaller number
                the next. The hospital could cope if the number remained level,
                but in some weeks there are more births than others.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Choice is necessary and important. Cost may
                be an issue, but the quality of care, including the surrounding
                social care, is equally important. It is not just an issue of
                the mother and her unborn child; extended families must also be
                considered and accommodated.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Every child has the right to be born in
                circumstances that provide the best possible start to life. The
                debate between the Jubilee and the Royal Maternity and the
                opposing claims and counter-claims drew the focus on the rivalry
                between the two institutions before their amalgamation. It
                became a political football, and the focus of the debate was
                switched from where it should have been — building the new
                hospital. The new hospital should have been half-built by now
                and well on its way to being established.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The old Jubilee site was user-friendly and
                accommodating. Many are worried that, since the move, the Royal
                has dominated maternity services. Traditionally, the Royal was
                seen as less user-friendly and perhaps more clinical. I hope
                that that will change. Any new hospital should be extremely
                user-friendly, not just for the mother and the child but for the
                extended family.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unfortunately, many will see the debate about
                the new maternity hospital as one institution’s ambitions of
                empire building. Although the debate was not absolutely
                conclusive, the argument that the maternity hospital had to be
                based close to the children’s hospital appears to have won.
                Extended gynaecological services, and women’s health services
                generally, should perhaps be located close to the new cancer
                centre at the City Hospital in the long term. They are not a
                thousand miles apart, but that proximity is nevertheless
                important for the plethora of gynaecological needs that relate
                to cancer pathology rather than maternity provision.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Madam Deputy Speaker, in welcoming the
                opportunity to take part in this discussion today, I would
                commend Monica McWilliams for securing this timely Adjournment
                debate on an issue of such importance.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Due to the political and legal wrangling
                which previously surrounded the debate on the location of
                maternity services in Belfast, nearly three years later we are
                no nearer to a decision. The fact that the report, which will be
                made available this month, will then be put out for a further
                12-week consultation process once again delays the making of a
                final decision. I cannot understand how such an important
                subject has been allowed to fall so far behind schedule.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This debate has been ongoing for a number of
                years, and the length of time which the Department of Health has
                taken in producing this report has, in fact, further damaged the
                delivery of maternity services in Belfast, thus posing further
                delays on the building of a state-of-the-art maternity unit
                which would provide many benefits to expectant mothers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I trust that this consultation process will
                be used far more effectively than it was previously, when the
                most important people in the debate — mothers — were not
                adequately consulted. It is important that all parties concerned
                are afforded the opportunity to take part in the consultation
                process and to have their views made known. The primary concern
                in the debate is that any decision which is made will be of
                benefit to those requiring the use of maternity services and
                that women will receive the best possible maternity services.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">6.00 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The process has been dogged by delay after
                delay after delay. Unfortunately, the Department, which will be
                making its report available later this month, has allowed the
                process to fall further behind schedule. This delay is further
                damaging the Health Service, which is already at breaking point
                and is lurching from one crisis to another. Since maternity
                services were located to the Royal Hospitals, it has become
                clear that it is not adequately equipped to take on the extra
                responsibility which came with this change in location.
                Maternity wards at the Royal Victoria Hospital are under severe
                pressure and are severely overcrowded, meaning that many new or
                expectant mothers are not receiving one-to-one personal care
                from midwives.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Staffing levels are also under tremendous
                pressure and morale is at an all-time low, which accounts for
                the increase in the numbers leaving the profession. We cannot
                afford to get this decision wrong. Modern maternity services
                require modern maternity facilities and unfortunately the Royal
                Hospitals are currently not in a position to offer that standard
                of service.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The decision which is made regarding the
                location of maternity services in Belfast must not be
                politically motivated and must be based on what is best for the
                people who will access these services. Any decision which is
                reached must take into account the views which are received
                during the consultation process. These opinions cannot and must
                not be ignored. That consultation process will take up much time
                and money, money that would be better spent being pumped into
                our health system, which is at breaking point.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.
                I do not want to rehash the unseemly political wrangle that
                occurred during the debate about services for the Royal Victoria
                Hospital and Belfast City Hospital, which led to a judicial
                review after the Minister had made her decision.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The underlying theme of the debate should be
                care for the mother and the child. It should focus on care of
                pregnant women who are at the stage when they must go to
                hospital and the need to ensure that proper services are
                provided for them wherever they are taken. There is no doubt
                that all of Belfast needs adequate maternity services. Moreover,
                services in the rest of the North of Ireland are inadequate. A
                new state-of-the-art facility is needed in Belfast, but I
                understand the Minister’s caution, given the possibility of
                another judicial review.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must examine maternity services throughout
                the Six Counties. Rural areas deserve a first-class service as
                much as any other area. When that debate took place three years
                ago, rural residents were angry that two major hospitals that
                stood cheek by jowl were engaged in a controversial argument
                over where the maternity services should be placed, while west
                of the Bann and other areas had no adequate maternity service. I
                welcome the introduction of the two pilot stand-alone
                midwifery-led units in Downpatrick and west of the Bann, which
                will give women more choice. I urge the Minister to instigate a
                review of those pilot units as soon as possible.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was not aware that a decision had been
                taken on where the midwifery-led unit for the east of the
                Province is to be situated. I know that it was to be a choice
                between Lagan Valley and Downpatrick. Perhaps the Member knows
                something that we do not.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am aware that people in rural areas may
                have asked those questions about the Royal and Jubilee Maternity
                Hospitals. However, I emphasise that it is the regional centre
                and, at that time, there were more than 6,000 births. Women from
                rural areas were, therefore, dependent on the decision regarding
                the location of the new centralised maternity hospital because,
                in the long run, many of them would have to use it.</p>

                might have put Downpatrick into my mind.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">East of Belfast and west of the Bann, I was
                urging the Minister to provide women with greater choice, and
                the two pilot stand-alone midwifery-led units will do that and
                get away from the controversy between the Royal Victoria
                Hospital and Belfast City Hospital. I urge the Minister to
                instigate a review of those pilot units as soon as possible to
                enable the establishment of as many midwifery-led units as are
                needed. It is an excellent idea which should be pursued. People
                west of the Bann — and I must be parochial — are very much

                maternity services in Belfast has been an important issue. There
                have been significant changes in the delivery of maternity
                services in Belfast in recent years, and few issues have proved
                so controversial or generated so much interest and passionate
                debate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Today’s debate has, once again,
                demonstrated our shared agreement that women, mothers and babies
                deserve the best possible services. I appreciate that there were
                genuine and strongly held differences of opinion with regard to
                the best configuration and delivery of maternity services. It is
                my task to determine the arrangements that best deliver modern,
                safe and effective services which cover Belfast and beyond. I am
                committed to bringing this issue to a conclusion that ensures
                that we have the best and most sustainable maternity services
                for women, mothers and babies in years to come.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During the debate, Members said that services
                at the Jubilee and Royal Maternity Hospitals were amalgamated at
                the Royal Maternity Hospital in May 2002. That was intended only
                as an interim measure and, at that time, was the only practical
                option available.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I recognise Members’ concerns that the
                current building is old and ill equipped to deliver a quality
                maternity service for the twenty-first century, which is why I
                am seeking to reach a decision on the future service
                arrangements. Recognising that the current facility has
                deficiencies, I fully endorse Members’ comments on the
                commitment, and it is vital that we ensure that the new facility
                is brought forward to the benefit of all. I also pay tribute to
                the dedication of the staff of the hospitals and all the staff
                of the Royal Jubilee Maternity Hospital are to be commended for
                delivering a high-quality service in sometimes less than ideal
                circumstances. I fully accept the need to resolve the issue.
                Staff deserve a modern working environment, and mothers and
                babies deserve the best possible service.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members referred to the various delays since
                1996 in bringing the issue to a successful resolution. Monica
                McWilliams, in particular, referred to my statement of January
                2000, in which I said:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;It is my firm intention to have the new
                hospital in place in five to six years’ time&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also said:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;This issue has been on the table since
                1996. This long period of uncertainty has not been good for
                maternity services, either locally or regionally. It has not
                been good for staff, who have seen earlier decisions come and
                go, and it most certainly has not been good for
                mothers-to-be.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At that time, my decision was overturned,
                which, of course, impacted on the timing of the project.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In respect of the forthcoming consultation
                and the process that I have re-established, I have been
                determined from the outset to ensure that the process is open,
                thorough and inclusive. This has taken some time. However, if we
                are finally to move towards a new hospital, I need hardly remind
                Members of the importance of getting the process right. We can
                ill afford another round of delay, occasioned by a further legal
                challenge.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The current process is built around a
                specification for the new maternity unit. When I announced
                details of it in June 2001, I stated:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Following a period of public
                consultation the specification will be formally issued to the
                Belfast City Hospital and Royal Group of Hospitals Trusts, and
                each will be invited to submit proposals for developing the
                maternity unit on their respective sites.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At that time, I also confirmed that the
                trusts’ proposals would form the basis of a second
                consultation process, which has the advantage of being open and
                transparent.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Importantly, it also gives ownership of the
                options to the two trusts and facilitates an open and free
                discussion of the issues. I could have initiated a less complex
                process, which would have allowed me to arrive at a decision
                much earlier. However, I determined that it was much more
                important that the approach was sufficiently robust to address
                the concerns of all parties, to provide for a final decision
                demonstrably based on the facts, and that such a process should
                address some of the questions that Members asked today about the
                involvement of those who wish to make use of the service.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the light of the responses to the initial
                consultation process, the specification had to be amended,
                primarily to enable the trusts to consider the option of
                centralising gynaecology services alongside, or as part of, the
                centralised maternity hospital. In the light of that additional
                option, it was necessary to extend the time frame for the
                development of the proposals. Officials did, however, make it
                clear to the Committee that they expected the document to be
                available by the end of September 2002. I can confirm that the
                consultation document is being printed and will be issued within
                the next two weeks.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">6.15 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That document is extensive. It incorporates
                the trust’s proposals as well as the health estates’
                professional assessment of the existing Royal Jubilee Maternity
                Service. Both trusts have sought to demonstrate the particular
                advantages that their respective sites can offer.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The inability of the neonatal unit to accept
                admissions is an infrequent occurrence, but it has happened
                three or four times in the past two and a half years. Indeed, it
                occurred in the Royal Maternity Hospital and in the Jubilee
                Maternity Hospital prior to the amalgamation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms McWilliams asked whether I had visited the
                Royal Jubilee Maternity Service recently. I visited that unit to
                observe its operation, but in recent weeks senior officials from
                my Department have visited the hospital on three occasions. I am
                being kept fully informed of the state of the services there.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the summer there was an incident in which
                a sewer in the hospital became blocked, but relevant experts
                addressed the problem immediately. Unfortunately, the contractor
                worsened the problem briefly before it was resolved rapidly.
                That is not a repetitive problem. The steam problem was caused
                by a broken bedpan washer and was repaired immediately. Such
                incidents can and do occur in any such facility.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An economic appraisal suggested that a new
                hospital would cost £204 million. The likely cost of such a
                hospital is expected to be between £30 million and £40 million
                at today’s prices. It is unclear from where that figure of
                £204 million comes; it could possibly represent the present net
                value of a time stream of services over an extended period.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In line with normal practice, funding for a
                new facility is not determined until the final business case has
                been agreed, and this is still some way off. I cannot seek to
                commission a new building before I have reached a formal
                decision about its necessity. The accepted rules about public
                sector investment require that my Department consider a range of
                options. Those include a refurbishment option, which will be
                included in the consultation document; however, in this case, I
                am certain that this is not a viable way forward. As I have
                said, the health estates have taken that forward. I will examine
                the best route to secure funding once I have reached a decision.
                My previous decision on the matter was overturned, so I must
                make a new one.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have deliberately chosen to follow an open
                and transparent approach to developing and consulting on
                proposals that will ensure that mothers are adequately
                consulted. Interest groups and patients’ representatives have
                been involved at each stage. I look forward to mothers and
                families being involved fully in the forthcoming consultation
                process, and I encourage them to play a full role. As I said, I
                shall issue the document for public consultation within the next
                two weeks. I am committed to reaching a final decision as soon
                as is practicable. However, Members know that there are certain
                question marks over how that will proceed in the present
                circumstances.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have made no decisions about the merits of
                either site or the need for linkages to particular services. I
                aim to make the information available so that a considered and
                informed debate on this important issue can take place. As I
                have stated previously, mothers and babies deserve, and have the
                right to expect, the best possible maternity services. That must
                be our primary concern.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The debate today has flagged up some
                important issues that I hope will be picked up on more fully in
                the forthcoming consultation. I listened carefully to Committee
                members’ views and look forward to their further advice as the
                consultation proceeds. I am delighted that, as a result of the
                matter being raised by Ms McWilliams, we have been able to
                consider it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I encourage Members to consider the
                consultation document carefully and to reserve judgement on the
                location of the maternity hospital until they have had a chance
                to consider and digest the proposals presented by the trust.</p>
