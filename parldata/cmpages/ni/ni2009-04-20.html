      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The Assembly met at 12.00 noon (Mr Speaker in the  Chair).</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Members observed two minutes&rsquo; silence.</p>
      <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="1"></a>Ministerial Statement</p>
      <p class="H4StageHeading">Cross-Sector Advisory Forum</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I have received notice from the Office of the First Minister and deputy First  Minister (OFMDFM) that the First Minister wishes to make a statement regarding  the cross-sector advisory forum.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister (Mr P Robinson)</strong>: I wish to make a statement on the establishment  of the cross-sector advisory forum, which is another stage in the Executive&rsquo;s  efforts to limit the impact of the global economic downturn.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The terms of reference of the forum have been placed in the  Assembly Library, and a full list of its participants is attached to the  statement that has been provided to Members.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Though the impact and scale of the global economic downturn  was foreseen by very few economists or Governments across the world just  eighteen months ago, through our prioritisation of the economy in the Budget  and the Programme for Government, we in the Executive have positioned ourselves  well to seek to deal with the present difficulties. Furthermore, last December,  we announced an additional series of measures and actions to help alleviate  hardship and assist the economy.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">This statement is but a further demonstration of our  determination to take whatever actions are open to us to combat the economic  difficulties. It is also a recognition that no single group of people has all  the answers, but, by harnessing the wisdom and knowledge of those most affected  by the current economic situation, we can navigate our way through the present  difficulties.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Members will be aware that, as the current economic crisis  unfolded through the summer and into the winter months of 2008, the deputy  First Minister and I held a series of meetings with banks, energy companies,  energy regulators, the voluntary and community sector, trade unions and  business leaders. Our aim was to understand the local impact of the developing  credit crunch and the escalation in basic commodity prices, such as food, oil  and other energy sources. Then, as now, our overall aim was to do all that we  can to mitigate the worst effects of the economic downturn on the people and  businesses of Northern    Ireland.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">That goal is a massive but inescapable challenge. We have  already had some success, which I attribute to a combination of factors. First,  we have a devolved Administration who are fully focused on meeting local needs  and solving local problems. We have an Executive who can and have used local  resources and talents to bring real benefits to local people. Secondly, we have  been able to manage our public expenditure to bring real financial relief to  local people; for example, through the measures that we already introduced on  water charges and domestic rates. Thirdly, we have listened to local people.  The information, advice and ideas that the deputy First Minister and I have  been able to gather from our meetings with local groups and people have been  instrumental in allowing the Executive to craft our response to the crisis.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">However, we believe that we must go further. To develop and  build on that dialogue, we established an economic task force under the title  of the cross-sector advisory forum. As Members will be aware, the first meeting  of the forum was held in the Long Gallery at Stormont on 6 April 2009. At that  inaugural meeting, the agenda was quite open. Our main aims were to introduce  members; reach a shared understanding of our terms of reference; gather views  on the enduring problems of the economic downturn; identify key strategies and  actions for addressing those problems; and map out our forward work programme  and work streams.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The main business of the first meeting was to hear members&rsquo;  views. A wide range of issues and proposals were discussed, and we will make  the agreed minutes of the group publicly available. I can confirm that there  was a general welcome to the formation of the group and a consensus that it  will provide a useful vehicle through which to map out our best response to the  current economic difficulties.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Perhaps understandably, there was also some caution and  concern that the forum should not simply turn into a talking shop. Let us make  it clear: the deputy First Minister and I are determined that that should not  be allowed to happen. We are interested in tangible outcomes, not merely words.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The forum comprises 30 members and has a current complement  of five Ministers. To ensure that the future work programme is manageable and  grounded in practical considerations, it was agreed that it would be useful to  establish subgroups to take forward distinctive strands of work. The following  seven broad areas have been identified: infrastructure, planning and  procurement; skills, training and education; hardship, poverty, debt and  energy; jobs, innovation, tourism, manufacturing and employment; agriculture;  banking, finance and lending; and housing and property. However, we are also  keen to avoid duplication of other work, particularly that of the Economic  Development Forum (EDF), and we are considering how best to take forward the  work of the subgroups.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We intend to convene the next meeting of the full forum  before the summer recess. However, before that, the subgroups will have met and  agreed their individual terms of reference and the key issues that they intend  to explore within the scope of their remits.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The cross-sector advisory forum represents a great  opportunity to join up government, business, utilities, banks and community groups  in the common cause of helping the people and businesses of Northern Ireland  to come through the present economic turmoil. From here on, it is my firm  intention that we will talk less about crisis and much more about recovery.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There was consensus at the first meeting of the forum about  the need to bring forward practical measures to reinforce our social-welfare  response to support people who are dealing with unemployment, debt and  cost-of-living pressures. However, beyond that, we also need a clear resolve to  grasp opportunities to support and sustain our indigenous talents and skills,  which will be essential in allowing us to maximise and grow a diverse, vibrant  and prosperous economy in the future. The forum discussion sent out a very  clear signal that we need to prepare for the future by continuing to invest in  infrastructure, training and skills. We need to support indigenous industry and  business; we need to make the most of the advantages that we have in our  natural and built environment; and we need to be agile and seize opportunities  for tourism and retail that flow from the weakness of sterling.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We have encouraged the forum to challenge us, and I am  confident that it has and will continue to do so. The group will provide a  useful platform on which the various sectoral interests can talk, not only to  government but to each other. It is our hope that the forum will become an  effective vehicle for improving communication between the various interests on  which our economy is built.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As the scale of the global economic challenge emerged, we  did all that we could to ensure that we did not talk ourselves into a  depression by talking down the economy and dampening business confidence, while  always remaining realistic. This is now the time to recognise that Northern Ireland  will emerge from the current economic problems and get back to growth and  prosperity. The establishment of the cross-sector advisory forum underscores  our conviction that we are not helpless in the face of the economic challenges  before us. It will not only be a critical friend to challenge us in what we are  doing or failing to do but will work constructively with government to bring  forward proposals for remedial actions. It will allow us to test that we are  not only doing things right but are doing the right things to bring forward  economic recovery.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As we navigate our way out of the present economic  difficulties and chart our course for the future, we will, of course, keep the  Assembly and the Committee informed of the work of the forum. I believe that  its creation is a clear recognition of the value that we place on working  together in partnership with stakeholders so that we can use devolution to help  the entire community.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName">The Chairperson of the Committee for the Office of the  First Minister and deputy First Minister (Mr <strong>Kennedy)</strong>: I welcome the First Minister&rsquo;s statement. What role, if  any, do the First Minister and deputy First Minister envisage for the proper  scrutiny of the cross-sector advisory forum, and will the First Minister give  an undertaking that my Committee will have a role in respect of the work of the  forum?</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I will now speak on a party political basis as a  representative of the Ulster Unionist Party. The First Minister outlined the  Executive members currently on the cross-sector advisory forum. It appears that  the Ministers who attend the forum are members of the two largest parties in  the Executive. Does the First Minister accept that it is important and  desirable to ensure that the forum includes representatives from all the  parties that form the Executive and not just the two largest parties?</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, given that the Chancellor has indicated that he  will be looking for additional efficiency savings of up to &pound;10 billion &mdash; that  would have big implications for devolved Administrations, including Northern Ireland  &mdash; has the First Minister any sense yet of whether it will or should be  necessary for the current Programme for Government to be adjusted accordingly?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: I thank the Chairman for his interest in the work of the  cross-sector advisory forum. The minutes of the forum meeting will be made  available to the Committee, and it can judge for itself what role it might wish  to have in interrogating the deputy First Minister and me or any of the other  Ministers. We will be happy to keep the Committee informed of the work of the  forum and its subgroups.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member referred to the forum&rsquo;s current membership. At  the last Executive meeting, the deputy First Minister and I made it clear to  our Executive colleagues that we wanted them all to participate in the work of  the forum. During the forum&rsquo;s first meeting, it became fairly clear that the  Minister responsible for skills would play an important part in the further  considerations of the forum. However, during that meeting, there was a growing  belief that the way to move forward is to create subgroups that can deal with  various sectoral interests and bring reports to the whole forum. Again, that  will give each Minister a role to play in relation to the various interests that  exist, which might include skills and training issues, agriculture issues, or  other departmental matters.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">12.15 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Chancellor will make a statement on Wednesday. Until he  makes that statement and until we have assessed it by reading the small print,  it is difficult for anybody to know exactly what impact it will have on Northern Ireland.  However, if the Prime Minister intends to go back on his word that we will  receive a CSR settlement that is entirely ours and will allow us, as a  fledgling devolved Administration, to plan ahead for three years, or if he goes  back on his indication that any savings that are made by this devolved  Administration will stay here and he decides, based on the Barnett formula, to  draw money away from Northern Ireland, we will be required to look at the  Budget, and there will be Budget consequences. If, as the whispers from the  Treasury suggest, about &pound;150 million will come out of the Northern Ireland  Budget, that will have an impact on spending.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Moutray</strong>:  I thank the First Minister for his statement. Does the First Minister care to  comment on the SDLP&rsquo;s proposals for saving money?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: I welcome the fact that the SDLP has taken an interest in  efficiencies and matters relating to the Budget. It has always had the  opportunity to bring forward proposals in the Executive, as it is part of the  four-party mandatory coalition. The fact that the SDLP brought its proposals to  the public&rsquo;s attention, as opposed to bringing them to the Executive, might  indicate the mindset in that party &mdash; one might even think that there was an  election in the offing.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is important that all parties, not only the SDLP, look  at how we can best use the resources that are available to us. To be frank,  having looked at the SDLP&rsquo;s proposals, I see that a significant number of the  better ones are proposals that my party has made in the past, proposals that  have been considered by the Executive or proposals for capital spend that have  been outlined already &mdash; in the Varney report, for instance.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Some of the SDLP&rsquo;s proposals are inaccurate and some are  grossly exaggerated, but at least the SDLP is looking at efficiencies and  recognising that, given that we have a finite Budget, choices must be made. The  important feature of the SDLP&rsquo;s proposals is that that party recognised for the  first time something that has been shown fairly consistently in Executive  meetings, which is that it is not simply a case of telling people what one  would like to spend money on and outlining what additional funds could be used  in various areas. The SDLP&rsquo;s paper is significant in that it identified that,  if more money is to be spent in some areas in order to inflate the economy, the  resources for that must be found elsewhere. The whole House needs to start  examining its priorities.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Incidentally, contrary to what is said in the SDLP&rsquo;s statement,  the SDLP did not vote against the Budget &mdash; the House accepted, and is tied to,  the Budget unanimously. The Budget settlement is based on the priority in the  Programme for Government to focus on the economy. Rightly and at the right  time, we decided that, front and centre, the economy is our number one  priority.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh r&aacute;iteas an Aire.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the First Minister for his statement and welcome  the Executive&rsquo;s efforts to mitigate the worst effects of the economic downturn,  particularly on local businesses. Procurement rules do not seem to be  sufficiently friendly to local small and medium-sized enterprises. Could one of  the subgroups look specifically at how to free up and create opportunities for  local businesses to succeed in the tendering and procurement race?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: That can neatly be dealt with by the subgroup concerned with  jobs, employment and other similar issues. There will obviously be constraints  on the number of people whom we can have on the cross-sector advisory forum.  That number is currently 30, but a considerable number of other groups believe  that it would be useful if they, too, had membership.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The subgroups are a good way for those additional people to  be used in their sectoral interests. I am sure that, if there are sectoral  interests in respect of small firms, the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment will be very happy to incorporate those into the terms of reference  of the group that deals with employment issues, as, indeed, I am sure, will the  Minister for Employment and Learning, who has a particular responsibility for  skills and training issues.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  I welcome the First Minister&rsquo;s statement, although I must correct him: he said  that all parties voted for the Budget, when, at one stage, he accused the SDLP  of almost bringing the House down by not supporting the Budget. Therefore,  there are some inaccuracies in his comments.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In December, the First Minister and the deputy First  Minister said that they would bring forward some proposals. However, we now  have proposals for further meetings rather than for actions, which is very  disappointing. During their recent visit to Brussels, did they reach any agreement on a  relaxation of the state-aid rules as a possible way of helping the business  community? Will there be relaxation on any of the manoeuvres or help that may  be given?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: First, let me clear up the issue of the Budget. I have a copy of  the Hansard report of the Budget debate, which I am happy to share with the  SDLP if its own records are not complete. I introduced the Budget to the  Assembly on 11 February 2008, and it is stated that the question was put and  agreed to and that it was resolved with cross-community support that the Budget  Bill be passed without any division. The SDLP should know the difference  between the Programme for Government and the Budget; it voted against the  Programme for Government, but it voted for the Budget.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It would have been very surprising if we had come out of  the first meeting of the cross-sector advisory forum with the answers to our  economic ills. I do not believe that anyone who was there expected actions to flow  from the group&rsquo;s first get-together. In order for the deputy First Minister and  me to make recommendations to colleagues and to ensure that those feed through  the system, the subgroups have to give much consideration to issues, make  proposals and recommendations and tender advice. There has not been action as a  direct result of our first meeting other than to work out our work plan, but  that will hardly have surprised anyone.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The deputy First Minister and I visited Brussels recently. We raised the matter of  state aid in relation to specific projects whereby the Department of Enterprise,  Trade and Investment (DETI) has been faced with state-aid issues, and we will  continue to do that. During our visit, we were encouraged by the very keen  interest that President Barroso and other commissioners have taken in Northern Ireland.  Indeed, they were willing to put forward a task force to make recommendations  on how best we might equip ourselves to compete for European funding, rather  than continuing as a region that automatically receives such funding.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  It is important that Members keep their questions related to the statement as  far as possible; we have drifted slightly.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>: I  hope that Mr Speaker accepts that there must be clarity about the issues that  have been raised. The Budget resolution, which is the key vote on how the money  is to be disbursed, was opposed by a number of Members. The Budget Bill was not  opposed, because that would have prevented the money from being drawn down.  That clarification must be made for the record.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">With respect to the cross-sector advisory forum, we welcome  the statement that the First Minister has made. No one disagrees with his  assertion that promoting the economy should be at the front and centre of what the  Executive do and of the Programme for Government and the Budget. However, once  more, the devil is in the detail. Surely, in the changed context that we are  now in, the how and the what of prioritisation must be reassessed. I want to  know whether the Executive have had any discussion with the members of the  forum with regard to whether the Programme for Government needs to be  revisited. In the debate in the public domain, many senior businesspeople argue  that it does, not to remove the economy from the top spot but to look at how  economic progress can be achieved.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: It is necessary for me to go back and try again. Members use  terms without thinking exactly what they mean. The Programme for Government  already has the economy of Northern    Ireland as its top priority. There is no  need to change the priorities in the Programme for Government. From time to  time, there will be a need to finesse the Budget. When I was Finance Minister,  I indicated during the Budget debate that we were quite happy to do that.  Indeed, we do it four times a year in the monitoring rounds. In particular,  last December, we recognised that we had to hold a special monitoring round to  deal with the crisis. The Finance Minister is working on the statement that he  will make in relation to the next monitoring round. From time to time the  Budget will be redefined, as necessary. However, to do that, we must free up  funding to make allocations. Such funding can come only from two sources:  underspend within Departments on capital or resources or reprioritisation by  the Executive.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Is there any Member who believes that there should be a  reduction in the Department that his or her Minister heads? Not a single hand  has gone up. Faced with that, there is a &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption]. </span>There  is only one problem: the Alliance Party has no Minister.<span class="Italic"> [Laughter].</span></p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We cannot spend money that we have not got. Each Member  must take a hard decision, but they cannot say that money must come out of  Government Departments that their Ministers are not a part of. The situation  requires the Government as a whole to deal with the issues, and it requires  money to be freed up from all Government Departments.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Spratt</strong>:  The First Minister said that he was keen to avoid duplication of work with  other forums that are already working in these areas. Will he indicate how such  duplication will be avoided?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: The particular purpose of the cross-sector advisory forum is to  deal with the economic crisis that we face. The forum, therefore, has a lifespan  sufficient to deal with the duration of the crisis. Its remit is to deal with  the crisis itself. It is not a committee for the long haul. It is not intended  to take over the role of any other committee, advisory group or body. It has a  specific purpose and time reference. On that basis, everyone recognises that  their participation is based on that principle.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">12.30 pm</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr M McLaughlin</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Could I welcome today&rsquo;s statement by  the First Minister and deputy First Minister, could I also, on behalf of my  party, very strongly endorse the comment contained within the statement that we  are not helpless in the face of the economic challenges.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">My question is, how will the cross-sector advisory group&rsquo;s  work be taken forward? We know for how long the group will exist, but how often  does the Minister envisage that it will meet?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: I agree entirely with the Chairperson of the Committee for  Finance and Personnel &mdash; we are not helpless, and we must start, from this moment  on, I think, to talk about recovery rather than crisis.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I have listened to some economists, some of whom are  employed by banks, and they would depress Job if they were allowed to get on  with it. It is vital that we start talking our economy up and recognise the  great benefits that we have in Northern Ireland &mdash; even in a downturn, we have a  low-cost economy in comparison with those of most other European countries.  That should give us an advantage in getting out there and selling Northern Ireland  to the business community.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">At the meeting, a decision was made &mdash; I think by consensus  &mdash; that the work of the cross-sector advisory forum should be taken forward  through subgroups. The seven subgroups that I outlined in my statement will  meet, will largely work up their own remits, and will bring forward  recommendations to the parent body, if I may call it that. I think that more  useful work on certain matters can be done in a sectoral format; for example,  issues that relate to a particular subject matter can be dealt with, rather  than through the very wide spread of matters that are discussed at the  cross-sector advisory forum. The forum will get reports from each of those  subgroups, and we hope that between now and the beginning of the summer, the  subgroups will have met and they will have been able to report back to the  forum.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr I McCrea</strong>:  I welcome the First Minister&rsquo;s statement, as well as his previous comments on  the need for recovery to bring us out of the current economic downturn. I  welcome his commitment to that.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Chairperson of the Committee for the Office of the  First Minister and deputy First Minister has just left; however, he asked about  the implications of the UK Government&rsquo;s Budget. Can the First Minister give us  an indication of his feelings about the Conservative Party&rsquo;s proposals and what  impact those would have on spending in Northern Ireland?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: The Conservatives have been quite open in saying that they do not  believe that the Labour Government are taxing enough or cutting back on public  expenditure enough. The answer is fairly clear and is on the public record:  more tax and less public expenditure. That would mean shaving off a number of  the programmes that exist, a reduction in the Health Service, and a reduction  in our educational facilities. Those are the Tory Party&rsquo;s proposals and, of  course, those of its colleagues in this House.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  The First Minister highlighted in his statement a number of issues on which the  forum wants to see movement and progress; for example, investment in  infrastructure, training and skills, and support for local indigenous industry  and businesses. All those are good intentions. However, can the First Minister  outline when it will be practical to see any delivery of those issues on the  ground?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: I am not sure when the next questions for oral answer for the  Minister for Employment and Learning will be. However, I am sure that the  Member will want to ask his colleague when there will be action on the ground  in the area of skills and training. I seem to have more confidence in the  Minister than does the Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone. I believe that  the Minister is working hard, and he is actively bringing forward proposals to the  Executive to deal with those issues. All Ministers are focused on dealing with  the departmental responsibilities that they have in the context of the economic  downturn. I have every confidence that the Minister for Employment and Learning  will not let Mr Elliott down.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>: I  also welcome the statement and the creation of the advisory forum; I regret  only that it was not established sooner. I note the First Minister&rsquo;s reference  to many discussions with the banks, energy companies, energy regulators, the  voluntary and community sector, trade unions and business leaders, and their  formalisation in the advisory forum. I welcome what he said about meaningful  discussions leading to action as a result of the meetings of the advisory  forum.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Does the First Minister see the striving for consensus  leading to action that will carry through into the political arena? I welcome  his positive comments about the SDLP proposals. More broadly, will he assure  the Assembly that he will take a positive and constructive approach and spirit  to all the political parties&rsquo; intellectual energies in addressing what he  referred to as the current crisis and to the longer-term task of the Assembly  to revitalise the economy?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: It is worth pointing out that the cross-sector advisory forum was  set up as a result of the discussions about which Mr O&rsquo;Loan spoke. A number of  people whom we met said that it would be valuable to have such a group during  the crisis. We took that on board and responded directly to it.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr O&rsquo;Loan spoke about using the political intellect of  other parties. The SDLP is an Executive party. Although some of its Members  seem to forget that from time to time, no doubt, the Minister for Social  Development reminds her party that it is represented on the Executive. At all  times, the SDLP can bring proposals to, and assist, the Executive.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The deputy First Minister shares my views about wider  consultation with political parties. When, as First Minister and deputy First  Minister, we faced the challenge of the murders that were carried out by  dissident republicans, we had a difficult decision to take on whether we should  be in Northern Ireland or whether we should go to the United States to continue  our business there. On that occasion, we held a meeting of the party leaders.  The party leaders gave us full support; they were positive and wanted to ensure  that we had a united front at such a time of crisis.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The deputy First Minister agrees that those kinds of  meetings are valuable. Perhaps we can continue those meetings as we face  another crisis &mdash; the financial crisis &mdash; and something useful can come out of  them. It is not part of my make-up to want to disagree or to have people  disagree with me. I want to find a wider consensus on how we move forward, if  that can be found.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Proposals are put before the Executive at meeting after  meeting after meeting, and the greater the consensus that we can get on those  proposals, the better. If unanimity can be achieved when the proposals come to  the House, Northern Ireland  will be seen as being stronger in the wider community.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Anderson</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat. I welcome the First Minister&rsquo;s statement. How were members  of the advisory forum chosen? Despite what the First Minister said about  constraints on the number of members on the forum, will he and the deputy First  Minister consider the inclusion of representatives from the social economy, not  only in the sectoral format but in the plenary format? They would make a  valuable contribution to such a forum.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: Members were chosen by their own organisations, with the  exception of four members, two of whom were recommended by the deputy First  Minister and two of whom were recommended by me.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I do not have a hard-and-fast view on the size of the  membership; it is only the consideration of dealing with large groups that  places a constraint on its size. One of the subgroups that we have set up deals  with issues of hardship, debt and community issues. There is no reason why  OFMDFM cannot agree that any group that has an interest in those issues should  be on the subgroup without necessarily being a member of the broader forum.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">However, there is a strong third sector in the forum, with  representatives from community organisations and credit unions. Throughout the  meeting, they spoke so strongly that it became clear that a subgroup had to be  set up to deal with those general issues.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  The First Minister&rsquo;s statement referred to the prioritisation of the economy in  the Budget and the Programme for Government. Will the First Minister tell the  House what he thinks about proposals that some Members have made to  re-prioritise and rewrite both documents because of the black hole that they  believe exists in public finances?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: I do not know anyone who has an IQ that strays into double  figures who would suggest that a Programme for Government that prioritises the  economy should be changed. The Executive have taken the correct decision. It is  clear that that decision is the correct course along which to continue. The  Budget &mdash; just like that of any other Government, anywhere in the world &mdash; can be  changed as time goes on and as, on the one hand, pressures occur, and, on the  other hand, there is underspend. That is what happens.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is abundantly clear that there is no black hole in  public finances. We managed to get through the previous financial year despite  being told then that there was a black hole. When people talk about a &ldquo;black  hole&rdquo;, they are referring to pressures. All Governments face pressures. For  example, the Executive will face considerable pressure if, on Wednesday 22  April 2009, the Chancellor takes a decision that will impact on Northern  Ireland to the extent that I have outlined already. That does not mean that  there is a black hole; it means that we must take decisions to deal with  additional pressure.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Undoubtedly, the Minister of Finance and Personnel will  come to the House and make a proposal on how to deal with that pressure. There is,  however, no hole in our spending plans. When I was Minister of Finance and  Personnel, I used to point out repeatedly that the level of underspend in  Departments is always considerable, so much so that the Ulster Unionist Member  who talked about a black hole is the same person who told us that we should  increase our overcommitment in the Budget. Therefore, he wanted us to have more  expenditure than we had revenue to pay for at a time when we had to try to  reduce our overcommitment. Am I not glad that I did not listen to that voice at  that time and that we continued to reduce our overcommitment? Otherwise, we  would have been in a perilous position at present.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I thank the First Minister for his statement and his positive responses. He  said that we must not talk ourselves into a depression. Some Members in the  Chamber are already of that mind. He also mentioned marking up the positives  with practical and sustainable measures to help. Will he set out specifically  the steps that the Executive have already taken to deal with the economic  crisis?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: It would take me quite a long time to do that in any detail. The  House will be well aware that not only did the Executive put the economy at the  centre of our priorities, but that since our first Budget, we have taken  decisions to reduce household bills with regard to the amount of money that  people must pay towards their regional rate. We froze the regional rate, not  for one or two years, but for all three years of the Budget. We kept, in real  terms &mdash; as inflation then was &mdash; the level of the business regional rate; we  capped the industrial rate, and we were even prepared to take on Europe to ensure that.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In the wider economy, we brought forward proposals in the  December monitoring round for a winter fuel payment to be made to people who  are in greatest difficulty. Proposals were made for farming. We attempted to  increase the amount of funding that is available for capital spend; last year,  &pound;1&middot;4 billion was made available, and we expect that figure to increase during  the current financial year. That gives an incentive to the construction  industry, which, in my view, has been hit hardest by the economic downturn.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We took a decision to not proceed with water charging,  which is something that would have hit everyone&rsquo;s pockets, including those of  the most vulnerable in our community. The Executive also proposed to reduce &mdash;  and eventually phase out &mdash; prescription costs. Moreover, DETI introduced a  range of proposals on debt advisory services, and so on, all of which were  designed to help during the economic crisis.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">12.45 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I could outline a list three times that length &mdash; if I am  encouraged to do so, I have it here. However, everybody knows that the  Executive have been on the ball. That is not a party-political comment; all  Ministers are striving, in their Departments, to make best use of available  resources in order to assist during the economic downturn.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: I  thank the First Minister for his statement. Indigenous businesses and,  particularly, foreign direct investment (FDI) have a role to play during the  economic recovery. Will the First Minister outline the potential for foreign  investment in Northern    Ireland during our present economic  difficulties?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: In times of economic hardship, companies often withdraw to their  base. Those that want to expand often do so in their home territory rather than  outside it. However, during our recent trip to the United States, the deputy First  Minister and I were pleased that Universal Studios proposes to use the Paint  Hall in the Titanic Quarter to make a film. Another investment in Northern Ireland  will be announced soon, and there is considerable hope of a significant jobs  announcement before too long.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, even in the context of the perceived economic  doom and gloom, people are bringing business to Northern Ireland. The cost of  establishing business in the key areas of financial services, business  services, IT and the creative industries is much cheaper in Northern Ireland  than in other European capitals. That gives us an edge, and those high-value  jobs are precisely what the economy needs, because they assist and boost our  gross value added (GVA) and GDP. Those jobs are earmarked for growth in the  economy. Even if we must endure a difficult period, we are developing the  skills to do such jobs, and will be well placed, during the full recovery, to  take advantage of it.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I believe that we met our job-creation targets for the  financial year that has just ended. However, it will become increasingly  difficult to do so again. We must accept that Invest Northern Ireland and DETI  have a difficult job ahead of them, and the House should do everything it can  to make Northern Ireland a more attractive place to come to, rather than  playing things down and bemoaning the achievements that have been made.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  thank the First Minister for his statement. Although there is a consensus in  society that the Executive were right to prioritise the economy in the  Programme for Government, does the First Minister recognise the range of views  &mdash; including those of the business sector and economists &mdash; on the different ways  to prioritise the economy? How will he respond if the forum requests that the  Programme for Government be revised?</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">For example, in light of the First Minister&rsquo;s comment that  foreign direct investment is not as viable as before, do resources need to be  moved from selective financial assistance towards skills, particularly because  we cannot always compete on low costs in the future? Furthermore, although I  appreciate that the First Minister finds economists to be depressing, why are  they not represented on the forum? Several skilled economists from the banks  and universities could contribute. Although they might highlight some difficult  truths, we sometimes need to hear those harsh realities.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: All economists are not saying the same thing &mdash; they never do. One  chooses an economist and receives the desired view.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member makes a valuable point about whether it is  beneficial to have an economist, or economists, on the forum or giving advice  to it. Of course, there are a number of economists within the officialdom of  the Executive; we are not bereft of their advice.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I recognise that there are different ways to prioritise the  economy within the general scope of growing the economy. That does not change  the Programme for Government; it changes the actions that might be taken by  Departments or on Budget spend. However, if one takes even the SDLP proposal &mdash;  its Members will forgive me for mentioning it because they, at least, have a  proposal to be discussed &mdash; even at its fullest, if one were to believe it as  they have outlined it, that proposal would only mean a 1% change in the overall  Budget for Northern Ireland. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.] </span>I think  there is some double-accounting on the part of the SDLP, which it needs to take  into consideration.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There are valuable elements in the SDLP&rsquo;s overall proposal,  but many of them are already taken into account by Government.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Most Government business has to continue. Every Department  has fixed costs, about which it can do nothing. Therefore, what can be changed  is very much on the periphery and is very much down to the drive and  determination of Ministers in those areas. Although the Member said that there  will be difficulties with foreign direct investment at present, that should not  reduce our ambition to bring FDI to Northern Ireland. It should not  reduce the enthusiasm of Invest Northern Ireland to go out and sell the  Province as a place for people to come to. Far from reducing spend in those  areas, we have to continue to pay the necessary price to ensure that Northern Ireland  is before business leaders. The benefits of the decisions that they might make  today, or tomorrow, may not be realised in Northern Ireland for years to come.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In relation to the Budget, we are happy to consider  proposals. The economic crisis that we are facing is a standing item on the  agenda of every Executive meeting. Therefore, any proposal brought forward by  any Minister at any Executive meeting can be considered in relation to a  re-prioritisation of spend.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  This morning, I note that one party has moved away from suggesting that the  economy should not be a number one priority. I trust that other parties will  join them. Do any of those who sit on the cross-sectoral group advise that the  economy should not be the first priority?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: It would be ludicrous for any of them to suggest, in the middle  of an economic downturn, that we should do anything other than focus on the  economy &mdash; it is essential that we do so. It is worth pointing out that this  Assembly has a Budget to spend that is greater than that of any Assembly  before. Not only were there natural increases, but two packages of funding  supplemented the Budget &mdash; the last of which was to the value of &pound;900 million.  That is a massive boost, and one that would certainly not be offered today were  one to go to the Chancellor.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The additional funding that is available has assisted us in  the circumstances in which we are placed. We would not have been able to deal  with issues such as water charging otherwise. If there are people in this House  who believe that we need more money for public expenditure, and that we should  increase rates and introduce water charging, let them stand up and say so.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is no good people whinging in the background, saying  that we need more money for this purpose or that purpose, unless they can  identify where they will get the funding from. That is why I welcomed the  SDLP&rsquo;s proposal. For the first time, in my view, the SDLP stopped simply asking  for more money for this, that and the other, and identified the need to find  those funds from elsewhere. I do not agree that all the money referred to in  that proposal is available to be used for funding, but there is some measure of  benefit in that debate taking place, and all the political parties putting  forward their proposals. Let us see where that takes us.</p>
      <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="2"></a>Ministerial Statement</p>
      <p class="H4StageHeading">Social Security Agency &mdash; &nbsp;Strategic Business Review</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I have received notice from the Minister for Social Development that she wishes  to make a statement on the Social Security Agency&rsquo;s strategic business review.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development (Ms Ritchie)</strong>: In the debate on social security offices  on 9 March 2009, when the Social Security Agency&rsquo;s strategic business review  proposals were out for public consultation, I undertook to return to the House  quickly on the matter. I want Members to see that I have listened to their  concerns and actively sought to address them. I also said on several occasions  that I had serious concerns of my own. I am pleased to say that I am now in a  position to outline the actions that I am minded to take in order to address  the key concerns that were raised during the public consultation&rsquo;s first phase.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">First, however, I wish to reiterate what I said previously  about the strategic business review proposals. Despite being relatively modest  in ambition in comparison with what has already been done in Great Britain,  the review has been the subject of much misinformed commentary over the past  few months. Whatever else Members may have heard, the review&rsquo;s proposals are  designed to modernise and safeguard service delivery in order to benefit  customers in the local office network. That is the straightforward and simple  objective. It is about improving the service for people who rely on the Social  Security Agency for support, not about cutting jobs. Indeed, only recently, I  set about recruiting 150 additional staff, and if we need more, we shall  recruit more.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Let me restate the facts: there will be no loss of front  line services for any local office or town; no offices will close; and no staff  will lose their jobs. I have said, however, that the agency cannot stand still.  Change is essential in order to ensure the viability of the local office  network in providing a quality service.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I will now deal with the concerns that have been raised,  the first of which involves staff. Despite the fact that the proposals are  focused on the service provided to customers and the fact that reasonable  travel provisions are already enshrined in many staff members&rsquo; employment  contracts, Members highlighted to me a range of potential impacts on staff who  will have to travel to new work locations. Members will recall that I made it  clear that I would not accept solutions that would result in large numbers of  staff &mdash; some on low pay, some with caring responsibilities &mdash; having to move  lengthy distances to a new place of work. That remains the case.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I am aware that the prospect of relocation is a cause of  great concern for some staff. Therefore, in the next phase of consultation, I  will propose a range of measures that will go a long way to addressing staff concerns.  In addition to those that are already proposed, there will be two new processing  centres in Lurgan and Ballymena. That measure should deal with any staff  concerns in those areas. I am still evaluating the best arrangements for the  centres in Strabane and Kilkeel. Substantial retraining of staff will take  place, thus enabling many employees to remain in their current location and  handle other work. That will mean that many staff, previously earmarked to move  to a new location under the original Social Security Agency proposals, will no  longer have to move.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">For those who will still be expected to move, the Social  Security Agency will link smaller offices with specific processing centres in  order to limit travelling distances.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">That clustering is aimed at ensuring, where possible, that  staff who need to move have a choice of processing locations. It will depend  on, for example, their home address and which office they are nearest to.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">1.00 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In the minority of cases in which staff will be required to  change location, I have issued a directive that travel distance will be  minimised. That will apply in all but the most exceptional cases. Therefore,  fears about people being required to travel long distances to their work &mdash; for  example, from Enniskillen to Derry &mdash; no longer  have any foundation whatsoever.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In addition, I propose to put a mechanism in place whereby  the personal circumstances of all individual staff can be considered before any  final decisions are taken on work locations. My officials will engage with  NIPSA on the arrangements to be adopted, and there will be time for everyone concerned  to find the best solutions at local level.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">All in all, those are important measures that address the  concerns of staff, and I hope that Members will support them. The net result is  that the vast majority of staff will now remain in their current town of  employment, whereas under the original proposals, the majority of local office  staff would have been required to change location.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I now address the specific concerns that Members raised  with respect to the impact of the change on customers &mdash; let us not forget about  the people who the agency and its staff are actually there to serve. Most of the  concerns about customers related to the introduction of enhanced telephony  arrangements for calls to the local office network.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I am pleased to inform the House that the first phase of  consultation has identified only limited section 75 impacts, and those will be  addressed thoroughly through the revised proposals. As I have always said, the  new telephone and appointments arrangements will be in addition to the face-to-face  options that exist today. Customers who need or prefer, for whatever reason,  not to use the telephone will still be able to call into their local office as  they have always done. The choice is theirs. However, overall customer  accessibility will be improved greatly by enhanced telephony and appointments  services.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I assure Members that customers who call into any local  office will not then be directed to a telephone. However, the agency&rsquo;s local  office network already receives two million calls every year from customers, so  people will no doubt welcome an improvement in that service. Some Members have  argued that the changes are untried and untested; however, they already operate  successfully in other parts of the agency. Members who have called on me to  abandon the entire strategic business review would, it seems, have me throw out  the baby with the bath water.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Many Members also raised concerns with me that the  proposals were not aligned to the Bain Review or would have an adverse impact  on local councils. They are wrong. The Bain Review endorses an approach to  public-sector jobs that favours dispersal to a number of key hub locations to  ensure critical mass of staff. I have also looked at the new council structures  that are set out under the review of public administration (RPA), which sees  the current 26-district-council model replaced by an 11-council model. The  changes that I outlined today ensure that the strategic business review  proposals are future-proofed in every way. Each of the nominated first-tier  locations will have a processing centre, and so will every one of the 11 RPA  council areas.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I am not aware of any other public-sector organisation that  has demonstrated such a strong fit with the Executive&rsquo;s strategic decisions,  and I look forward to seeing others follow that lead.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The next concern is around the timing of any changes &mdash; an  important consideration in the context of the economic downturn. I am only too  aware of the changed economic circumstances that now prevail. I recognise the  need to ensure that the Social Security Agency continues to provide a good  service to an ever-growing number of customers in these difficult times.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I have previously said that I would not accept  disproportionate organisational disruption at this time, and that remains the  case. Therefore, I intend to proceed gradually; before committing to changes  across the North, I need to be satisfied that those changes will deliver the  service improvement that we all want to see.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">First, I intend to pilot the proposed changes in the  agency&rsquo;s north district, to come into effect in April 2010, coinciding with the  completion of the major new jobs and benefits office that is due to open in  Ballymena. That will allow all of the proposed changes to be carefully tested  and evaluated in a controlled manner, with any lessons learned being applied to  any further rollout. That means that informed decisions can be made on the  detail of the proposed changes to other districts. I recognise that this is a  complex issue, and it is important to get it right.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The strategic business review will end after the consultation  in respect of the equality impact assessment and my revised proposals. Change  will be taken forward as part of a new initiative called customer first, which,  as its name suggests, will place the customer at the heart of our work to  improve the delivery of benefits at a local level.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Although much of the consultation debate to date has  focused on the concerns of staff &mdash; concerns that I have now clearly addressed &mdash;  I will ensure that the new initiative puts the needs of the customer to the  fore. I hope that the proposals that I have outlined will gain the support of  the majority of Members in the House.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As Minister, I have listened carefully to the public  consultation and to the points that have been raised in the House, and I will  continue to listen. My officials are currently finalising the details around  the actions that I have set out, and will shortly publish that detail in the  equality impact assessment document for further consultation. I have directed  my officials to make arrangements to brief members of the Social Development  Committee on the detail of my proposals, and to commence further consultation  with agency staff and their trade union representatives.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The measures that I have outlined positively address the  main concerns raised in public consultation. They represent very substantial  change from the original Social Security Agency proposals, while ensuring that  we can still maintain and improve the quality of service provided by the  agency.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I ask those who have insisted that I abandon the strategic  business review in its entirety to think again. We are a Government, and it is  our job to do what is best for our people while remaining sensitive to the  impacts of our decisions. If devolution is to make a difference, we must not  keep avoiding difficult or challenging decisions. We must not buckle or panic  just because we may be subjected to vigorous lobbying by vested interests. We  must listen, but we must also act.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">At a time when much of the private sector, and indeed the  voluntary and community sectors, is hanging on, trying to survive, we have a  duty to make sure that the public sector continues to improve its performance.  That is what I am advancing today, and I commend the proposals to the House.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Social Development (Mr Simpson)</strong>: The Social Development  Committee considered the strategic business review of the Social Security  Agency in November 2008 and again in January 2009.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In order to inform its understanding, the Committee heard  evidence from NIPSA, and it visited a jobs and benefits office and the Belfast benefit delivery  centre. As the House is aware, the Committee has voiced considerable concerns  about the strategic business review and the impact that it will have on  customers and staff. The Committee will, therefore, consider the Minister&rsquo;s  revised &mdash; and, I think, welcome &mdash; proposals on limiting relocation distances  for staff, the addition of new processing centres, and extended pilot schemes  that are based around the Ballymena jobs and benefits office.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Is the Minister in a position to be able to indicate to the  House what impact her revised proposals will have on the relocation of  back-office staff? What percentage of such staff will be subject to relocation,  and can she give some details about limits on relocation distances?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I thank the Chairperson of the Committee for Social  Development for his comments and question.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">At all times during this process, I was very concerned  about the distances that staff would have to travel, and I articulated those  concerns on the Floor of this House and in other places.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Each member of staff in job processing who has to be  relocated will have their case evaluated and assessed fully by senior Social  Security Agency staff, and their particular concerns will be taken on board.  Within their cluster of Social Security Agency or jobs and benefits offices,  they will be able to select or elect the office nearest to them in which they  wish to work.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Another important consideration is that, as well as  announcing two further processing centres, I indicated that there will be  substantial staff retraining, enabling many to stay in their current locations  and to be able to handle other work. That will mean that many staff who were  designated previously for a new location under the Social Security Agency  proposals will no longer have to move. That will be a substantial increase on  the previous number, as I advised the Member earlier this morning.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brady</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. The Minister has touched on this  particular point in her answers to Mr Simpson. She talked about substantial  staff retraining, which will enable many to stay in their current location and  to be able to handle other work. Can the Minister give some indication as to  what that other work might be? For example, Newry has been designated to deal  with income support, so I am just wondering what that other work is.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In addition, could the Minister confirm that the pilot  scheme in the south district that was supposed to start in October 2009 has  been put back until 2010? It appears that the north district &mdash; and Ballymena in  particular &mdash; will be the location for the pilot scheme. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: The pilot scheme will be run in the north region, and  its time limit has not yet been determined. However, its outworkings will be  used to determine future arrangements. It is also worth pointing out that about  80% of staff will not be moving at all and that the vast majority of the other  20% will be moving fewer than 15 additional miles in any one direction.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">1.15 pm</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Armstrong</strong>:  I thank the Minister for her statement, and I welcome her commitment to keep  the situation under review. However, given rising levels of unemployment, will  the Minister commit to securing more front line services to benefits agencies  across Northern Ireland?  Has the Minister deployed the 150 additional staff to the areas of greatest  need? There have been many job losses in Mid Ulster.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I thank Mr Armstrong for his question. As I have stated  on various occasions in the House, we set about recruiting 150 additional staff  in response to the economic downturn. An assessment was carried out of where  the need lay for additional staff, taking into account the greatest levels of  signing on and of benefit uptake, as one equates with the other. As I pointed  out earlier, if we need more staff as a result of greater job losses in the  wider private sector, we will recruit more staff.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  I thank the Minister for her statement. She said that she listened to many  people, but, obviously, she did not listen to everyone. I am not a member of  the Committee for Social Development, but, as I understand it, the Committee  asked the Minister to hold fire with the business review, pending the outcome  of the economic downturn that we are experiencing, which is resulting in so  many more unfortunate people having to sign on. The Minister has not listened  to the Committee, nor has she listened to other people who spoke about holding  fire. That said, I welcome her statement that there will be no forced travel  for the majority of staff &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I encourage the Member to come to his question.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  I am doing my best. It is important that there is no forced use of the  telephone, because, as I said, many more people are now going into benefits  offices. It is easy for the Minister to say it in the House, but will she give  an assurance that people will have access to face-to-face discussions when they  go into benefits offices? Some people will be going to benefits offices for the  first time who do not want to be there, but they have to be there and they need  to be able to talk to people face to face to get through the process.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I think that Members sometimes do not listen to what we  say in the House. For the benefit of Mr McCarthy and other Members, I will say  again that there will be a full opportunity for front line services and for  potential claimants and existing claimants to have face-to-face contact with an  employee of the Social Security Agency.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Telephony and appointments services are additional, but I  remind Members that the appointments system is very beneficial. I do not want  claimants who have difficulties having to go into a social security office or a  jobs and benefits office and join a long queue. It does not happen in doctors&rsquo;  surgeries, in solicitors&rsquo; offices, or in other places where people procure  professional services. It may happen in other offices, but it will not happen  in the Social Security Agency. Both types of services will be available to  potential claimants. We all know that they suffer from a great deal of stress,  they are in receipt of low incomes, and they need to provide for their loved  ones, their children and their families. I have a great deal of concern for  those people.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Craig</strong>: I  thank the Minister for her statement and welcome her announcement about trying  to look after staff who do not want to move from their existing positions. Will  she outline what will happen if an individual&rsquo;s personal circumstances prevent  them from moving from their job location?</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">More importantly, I see that the Department will be  carrying out a pilot scheme in the agency&rsquo;s north district. For how long will  that pilot scheme take place, and can it be over a protracted period, allowing  all of the issues to be ironed out before Province-wide implementation takes  place?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I thank Mr Craig for his question, and I will answer  the second part first. The pilot scheme will be operational from April 2010 in  the north district, and no time limit has been set for how long it will run.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As regards Mr Craig&rsquo;s original question: in my statement,  and in my answer to Mr Simpson, I have said that I fully understand and  acknowledge staff concerns on travel and the personal circumstances that many  staff &mdash; particularly women &mdash; are faced with in relation to being in receipt of  low income and having caring responsibilities. Each member of staff will have  an opportunity to meet with a senior member of staff and have their particular  circumstances fully evaluated and assessed. Furthermore, if staff are in a  cluster arrangement, they will be able to elect, or select, the location  nearest to them where they can work. Moreover, the Department is providing  training and retraining for staff in certain benefit disciplines, which will  ensure that many who were supposed to have had to travel &mdash; or leave their  original locations &mdash; will now remain there, as retraining will be provided on  the spot.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I also thank the Minister for her  statement. In her statement, the Minister said:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;we must not buckle or panic just because we may be  subjected to vigorous lobbying by vested interests.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Does the Minister agree that those vested interests include  staff, who are concerned about whether they will have a job at the end of the  process, and the trade unions, who seriously dispute her Department&rsquo;s assertion  that job losses will not be a part of the process? Will the Minister tell the  House whether any jobs will go as part of the strategic business review? Her  Department is proactively recruiting in respect of hundreds of outstanding  vacancies across the agency. Will the Minister tell the House whether those  vacancies will disappear as a result of this process?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: Again, I have to question whether Members are  listening: but, of course, Mr McCann entered in the middle of my statement &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  Mr McCann does not listen <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I reiterate for the benefit of Mr McCann and Members  that there will be no job losses and no office closures. The Department will  continue to provide the services it has provided up to now. That is because our  primary, and most important, concern is the delivery of services to our current  and future customers.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  The Minister has answered only one part of my question. I also asked about the  current vacancies and whether her Department is proactively &mdash;<span class="Italic"> [Interruption.]</span></p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. As I have said in the House continually, I am not going to sit in  judgement on whether a Minister answers, or does not answer, a question.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Paisley Jnr</strong>:  I hope that I have more luck than the previous Member. I thank the Minister for  her statement today. As the Minister knows from discussions we have had and  debates in the House, a decision to close any social security office in the  Province would be regarded very dimly in any constituency in which it occurs.  Indeed, in my own constituency it would be viewed as being against the spirit  of the Bain Report, if not against the letter of the law. Furthermore, it would  be viewed as gross bad faith, not only by local employees, but by the  Minister&rsquo;s constituency party there, and I am sure she would accept that.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Minister put some flesh on the bones of her  statement in which she has indicated that two new processing centres will be  opened &mdash; one in Lurgan, and one in Ballymena in my own constituency? Will the  Minister indicate how many new jobs will actually be located in my constituency  and how many of them will be on a part-time and full-time basis?</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As the Minister already indicated in other answers, the  creation of part-time jobs is very beneficial for women employees, in  particular, in the Civil Service. The creation of full-time jobs would help to  address the imbalance in that workforce where, believe it or not, the most  discriminated section in the community as regards Civil Service jobs at that  level are Protestant male workers. How does the Minister intend to address that  imbalance with this employment opportunity?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I thank Mr Paisley Jnr for his statement.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Department assessed and evaluated responses to the  consultation process, which informed the possible outcome of the equality  impact assessment. As a result of the economic downturn, we decided to recruit  150 additional Social Security Agency staff across the Northern Ireland  network to reflect the areas of most acute need. If more staff are required,  they will be recruited in offices in which there is a particular need, because  the most important priority is to ensure, and maintain, the delivery of a  first-class service to those most in need.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">If the Member permits, I will write to him in respect of  the actual numbers.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>:  The Minister is aware from the consultation of concern about the relocation of  jobs from offices in Larne, Carrickfergus and Newtownabbey.  She mentioned clustering &mdash; will the Minister outline in more detail how that  will affect existing employees in Larne, Carrickfergus and Newtownabbey  who, potentially, face moving? Will those jobs move gradually, or ultimately  migrate, to Ballymena?</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I am also interested in the answer to the previous question  because in my East Antrim constituency, which has some of the lowest levels of  Civil Service employment, there is great concern that jobs are migrating to Belfast or Ballymena.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: Mr Beggs referred to Newtownabbey,  which is not part of the north region. No decisions will be taken in respect of  Newtownabbey until we determine the outcome of  the pilot exercise in the north area.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>:  What about Larne and Carrickfergus?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I was not aware that Larne and Carrickfergus were part  of the Member&rsquo;s question. However, if they were, Larne and Carrickfergus are  also part of the greater Belfast  area, and they will be considered further down the line. No decision will be  taken about them until the outcome of the pilot is known, the assessment is  determined and the benefits, if any, are evaluated.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  I thank the Minister for her statement, which represents good news for staff  and customers. In fact, it is like a belated Easter egg for all of us in the  Chamber.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Paisley Jnr</strong>:  It is sent in the spirit of recovery.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  Oh, right. However, I was surprised by Mr McCann&rsquo;s reaction. He reminded me of  a spoilt child who received his Easter egg, but did not like the colour of its  wrapping paper.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In any event, this is the difference between direct rule  and devolution. Remember that this strategic business plan was conceived under  direct rule, is being delivered in devolution and has been changed  substantially, which is to be welcomed. Will the Minister reassure the House  and the public &mdash; amid wild speculation and rumours of up to 500 job losses &mdash;  that jobs will not be lost but increased?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Paisley Jnr</strong>:  She was not listening &mdash; get out the Q-tips.<span class="Italic"> [Laughter.]</span></p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">1.30 pm</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I agree with Mr Maginness. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span> I have to say that I did not get an Easter egg, but that is neither here nor  there. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There was indeed talk of job losses, much of which was  ill-informed. Some of it was ill-intentioned and scaremongering. No loss of  employment will result from the strategic business review. No jobs will be  lost, and no offices will close. The review was never about job reductions: it  was always about service improvement. The strategic business review affects  only the local office network, which makes up about one quarter of the SSA  workforce. It is all about improving services for the people who use them.  Therefore, we are not planning any redundancies or job losses as a result of  the strategic business review. However, the agency will, of course, have to  meet overall efficiency targets that are set by the Executive.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gardiner</strong>:  I thank the Minister for her statement. Can she guarantee that her proposals  will be in operation by 2011, when the 26 councils will be reduced to 11?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: There have been some very interesting questions today.  As part of my response to the economic downturn and reflecting its pernicious  impact, I decided that the proposals &mdash; it must be remembered that they are still  proposals &mdash; will be piloted in the north district, which, by and large, covers  the northern part of Northern    Ireland.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">No date has been given for the length of time that that  pilot scheme will run, so it could take some considerable time. However, we want  to assess the benefits of that pilot scheme to evaluate whether it should be  rolled out across the rest of Northern    Ireland. I cannot guarantee that the  proposals will be implemented in time for the rest of the review of public  administration, but I can tell the Member that there will be a processing  centre in every one of the new council areas and probably more than one in  some.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Ramsey</strong>:  I welcome the statement from the Minister, particularly the key &ldquo;customer  first&rdquo; theme. That important theme ran through representations that I received  from staff representatives in my Foyle constituency, particularly in relation  to the Foyle office and services in the west and the south-west. I am sure that  the Minister&rsquo;s reassuring and constructive statement will be well received  there.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Minister reiterate that members of staff will not  be expected to drive long distances between Omagh, Enniskillen and Derry, as that would have a detrimental impact on caring  duties, the environment and congestion? Will she assure us that the location of  centralised services will be taken into account in relation to future trends in  benefit entitlements, so that staff in one location will not be made redundant  while the number of staff in another location is being significantly increased?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I thank Mr Ramsey for his question. He asked about  travel arrangements. On several occasions, I expressed my particular concern  that staff should not be required to travel long distances to a new place of work.  I know that Pat Ramsey was very concerned about that matter, particularly as it  may affect people in Derry and in the west.  His concerns are well understood, and I am pleased to tell him that I listened  to the very strong case that he made. I assure him that no member of staff will  be required to travel distances such as the distance from Enniskillen to Derry,  Derry to Omagh, or vice versa. I think that  Members will realise that I have listened to all concerns and have addressed  them with a measure of generosity.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Pat Ramsey also raised the issue of redundancies and  staff losses. There will not be any redundancies or staff losses. I also assure  the House that those who need face-to-face service at a local social security  office will continue to receive it in the future.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Many of the jobs are in and many more will be amalgamated  into benefits offices, so I will continue to work in close partnership with the  Minister for Employment and Learning to deliver the best possible service and  outcomes for customers, who include some of the most disadvantaged and deprived  people in Northern Ireland.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>:  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s answer on customers. She has dealt with that matter  very well. How useful was the public consultation exercise in helping the Minister  to modify the previous proposals for social security arrangements?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: The public consultation exercise was useful, because it  reflected and confirmed my concerns about aspects of the original proposals,  particularly on staff relocation and upheaval. Furthermore, it has allowed me  to focus on those matters and to devise appropriate solutions.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Mrs Bradley will be aware that some Members wanted me to  abandon the entire public consultation exercise, even when we were halfway  through it. Those Members may not have wanted me to take on board what the  public were saying. I hope that they now realise that it was absolutely right  to allow the people to have their say, because what they said has been clearly  reflected in the revised proposals.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>:  We are hearing about improvements to services and about a strategic vision for  the implementation of the Bain Report&rsquo;s recommendations for the location of  public-sector jobs. Moreover, the Minister is sensitive to the genuine concerns  that staff expressed. I welcome Ballymena&rsquo;s designation as a processing centre,  and I encourage everyone in the northern district to co-operate in the pilot  scheme. What effect does the Minister envisage this series of proposals having  on morale in the service?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I hope that the proposals will significantly enhance  staff morale. I make no secret of the fact that I have met many members of  staff throughout the Social Security Agency network. I listened to their concerns,  and, in order to reflect the needs of staff members, particularly those who  were concerned about having to travel long distances, the impact of the  economic downturn, the need for retraining and the heavy workloads with which  they must deal as a consequence of that training, I have substantially changed  the proposals that were originally prescribed under the strategic business  review. I hope that my proposals will go a considerable way to enhancing staff  morale and that all members of staff will support and endorse them.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The bottom line is that devolution is making a difference,  and I gave an undertaking to listen to staff and customer concerns. Remember  that there are two players about whom we must be concerned in this  relationship: we must ensure that members of staff enjoy the best possible  circumstances in which to work and that existing, and potential, customers have  easy access to the best possible service, given that they are especially  beleaguered at this time.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  I, too, welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement, particularly the news that a new  processing centre will be based in Lurgan. Will the Minister be reviewing  telephone call-handling arrangements, because sometimes it takes a long time  for customers to get through? If there is to be increased telephone usage,  customers&rsquo; waiting times must be minimised by ensuring that enough members of  staff are on hand to deal with the call-handling element of the business.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I take on board Mrs Kelly&rsquo;s comments. It is hoped that  we will have sufficient staff to deal with all areas of the business,  particularly those in which customers are feeling the greatest pinch. That is  important.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The telephony service and the appointment system are  additional provisions to the existing front line service, which will continue.  Much misinformation has been flapping around about the telephony service, and,  considering some of the quarters from which that misinformation is coming, it  is, perhaps, ill-intentioned. However, the enhanced telephony service and  appointment system will be additional to the existing options. Therefore, I  assure my colleague Mrs Kelly that it will still be possible for people to go  into a social security office without an appointment and be seen by a member of  staff. She can take comfort and confidence from the fact that staff who are  dealing with the employment support allowance are receiving many telephone  calls &mdash; more calls, in fact, than was projected and anticipated. As a  consequence of that, I was able to recruit more staff and invest more staff  resources in that area to deal with that heavy and enhanced workload.  Everything will be addressed in the most appropriate and sensitive manner.</p>
      <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="3"></a>Private Members&rsquo; Business</p>
      <p class="H4StageHeading">Childcare Strategy</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Business Committee has agreed to allow up to one hour and 30 minutes for  the debate. The proposer of the motion will have 10 minutes in which to propose  and 10 minutes to make a winding-up speech. All other Members who are called to  speak will have five minutes. One amendment has been selected and published on  the Marshalled List. The proposer of the amendment will have 10 minutes in  which to propose and five minutes to make a winding-up speech.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms J McCann</strong>:  I beg to move</p>
      <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly expresses its concern at the lack of  availability of affordable, quality childcare; and calls on the Executive to  implement a coherent and properly resourced childcare strategy.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I welcome the  opportunity to move the motion. Sinn F&eacute;in will support the amendment, because  its insertion will not change the thrust of the motion.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Childcare is an important issue for everyone in society,  particularly for families. Ireland  still trails other EU countries in the accessibility and affordability of  childcare. There is a lack of flexible and age-appropriate childcare provision  here. Despite the fact that the ministerial subcommittee on children and young  people prioritised childcare, the numbers of day-care nursery places and places  with registered childminders have fallen since 2002.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Although some Departments have funded childcare provision,  a major deficit remains. Currently, there is only one place per 6&middot;4 children  under the age of four, and there are fewer than 40,000 registered childcare  places for the 310,000 children under 12 years of age. Therefore, spaces for older  children &mdash; particularly those over 10 years of age &mdash; and children with  disabilities are still limited.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The provision of flexible, quality and affordable childcare  that meets the needs of all children and parents is the responsibility of a  number of Departments, which is why we tabled the motion. A cross-departmental  approach to the issue, through the Executive, is essential to ensure that a  properly resourced childcare strategy is developed and implemented. Such a  strategy would have a crucial role to play in ensuring that flexible,  high-quality, affordable and accessible childcare provision exists for all  families who wish, or need, to avail themselves of it.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Childcare is a critical issue for women&rsquo;s equality, and the  lack of adequate childcare places in the North of Ireland is a major barrier  for women who wish to return to education or employment. Women are still viewed  as the main carers in society, and that remains the case with caring for  children. Better childcare provision will enable more women to access  education, training and paid employment, which would help the economy and  provide women with better choices in all aspects of their life.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">That choice is also important for women who choose to stay  at home with their children, because they must also have access to home-based  and group support services. The role and contribution of the people who offer  those services needs to be recognised, as does the role of parents who choose  to stay at home with their children.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Better childcare provision clearly has a central role to  play in helping to reduce child poverty, given that a lack of access to  affordable childcare is one of the most significant barriers to securing  employment for people from low-income families or families who are living in  poverty. Improving childcare provision would also enable parents who rely on  benefits, for instance, to progress to better employment and, therefore, get  out of the poverty trap.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">1.45 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Recent legislation on welfare reform will see the benefit  that is provided to parents &mdash; including lone parents &mdash; change to jobseeker&rsquo;s  allowance when their child turns 12 years old. However, the absence of a  statutory duty on local authorities here to service the demand for childcare  facilities means that it will be difficult for parents to have access to  childcare facilities while they are at work, and that is a particular problem  for women.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Childcare costs in Ireland  are among the highest in Europe, and parents  here receive the lowest subsidies towards meeting those costs. Some European  countries subsidise childcare costs by up to 75%, whereas, in the North of  Ireland, the figure is still only 25%.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The tax credit system that allows relatives to become  childminders is also important. In 2002, a significant shortfall in childcare  places in the North of Ireland was reported, and almost two thirds of  unemployed mothers said that a lack of adequate childcare deterred them from  seeking work or constrained them in their choice of job.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The lack of local community-based childcare places has had  an impact on families living in rural communities and low-income families in  particular, because public transport might not be available to bring children  to and from cr&egrave;ches and childminders. Therefore, some such families will be  unable to access those facilities.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">A recent review by a rural childcare group recommended a  number of specific targets aimed at improving childcare provision in rural  areas. It is important that those targets are included in any strategy. It is  also important that parents can choose between different types of childcare  provision, because some people prefer cr&egrave;che facilities or after-school groups  while others prefer childminders.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It was reported that a 20% increase in the number of  childminders would be needed if the current demand were to be met &mdash; that was  reported in 2002. Unfortunately, there has actually been a decrease in the  number of childminders rather than an increase, which has resulted in many  parents having to employ relatives to care for their children. Unfortunately, as  I pointed out earlier, relatives who act as childminders do not have access to  the childcare element of the tax credit system. That is a further financial  burden for people who need childcare facilities, because they have to pay for  it out of their own pockets instead of being able to claim for it through the  tax credit system.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">A change to that system would result in more people seeing  childcare as a clearly defined career that could be developed and coming  forward to become registered childminders. It would ensure also that quality  services are provided for children &mdash; a suitably qualified workforce is always  essential for that.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In England,  a transformation fund is available that provides people working in childcare  with opportunities, so that a more professional early-years workforce can be  established. I hope that implementing such a fund here is something that will  be considered.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Differing needs exist&cedil; but they are all central to any  strategy on childcare provision. As I said, children with disabilities have  particular needs, as do lone parents or groups of people who are socially  excluded. Childcare provision needs to be flexible and reflect the differing  needs of parents, including those who do shift work or work at weekends.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There is a lack of information on what kinds of childcare  facilities are available. Some women&rsquo;s organisations believe that it would be  extremely helpful for some sort of directory to be developed providing details  on the types of facilities available and the localities in which they are  based.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As I said in my opening remarks, although some Departments  fund childcare spaces, more needs to be done. I hope that the Assembly will  support the motion, which calls on the Executive to implement a coherent and  properly resourced childcare strategy. Such a strategy will ensure the  availability of affordable, quality and flexible childcare provision for  children and parents who need it. Go raibh maith agat</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Purvis</strong>: I  beg to move the following amendment: After the first &ldquo;childcare&rdquo; insert</p>
      <p class="Q3Motion">&ldquo;and the lack of provision for people who require flexible  arrangements to allow them to avail of working opportunities in the evenings,  overnight and at weekends, particularly in the current economic climate&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I thank Ms McCann for clarifying that the amendment is an  insertion to the motion and that none of the original motion will be deleted  should the amendment be made. I thank also those who tabled the motion &mdash; it is  an excellent motion as it relates to an important topic and is very timely.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">From the outset of the debate, we need to be honest about  the state of childcare services in Northern Ireland. The problems that  we face are fundamental. Not only is our childcare provision &ldquo;woefully  inadequate&rdquo;, according to a report on an inquiry into child poverty that was  published by the Committee for the Office of the First Minister and deputy  First Minister, but, as Ms McCann outlined, the number of childcare places is  actually falling.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Additionally, we appear to have no leadership on the issue.  There is some dispute as to who has responsibility for this complex but  critical area, and neither decision nor strategy is coming forward. That is the  situation, despite the stated commitment to an anti-poverty agenda. We need a  cross-departmental strategy.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In the meantime, we are struggling with outdated views on  who needs childcare, why they need it, and what types of services are needed.  My amendment addresses directly one area of our childcare provision that needs  immediate attention: flexibility. The childcare services that are on offer here  are designed largely to accommodate a nine-to-five working day. However, the  traditional Monday-to-Friday eight-hour day is long gone, and for many families  it never really existed. Parents are working evenings and weekends and often  through the night. Many parents have to respond quickly to unforeseen  developments at work or to unscheduled shift changes, and they need to make  last-minute arrangements to care for their children. Even those who work  regular hours often struggle to find adequate care for children during the  school holidays. The lack of flexible childcare and the expense of childcare to  cover unsocial hours &mdash; for those who can find it &mdash; are serious problems for  parents who are struggling to respond to the demands of the current work  environment and to the needs of their families.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In addition to flexibility, there are other serious gaps in  our childcare services. If we were looking for a road map on this issue, we  would find that the Shankill Women&rsquo;s Centre delivered one. Three years ago, the  centre gathered together local women for a series of workshops to discuss  education, employment, health and childcare. Even though childcare was a  separate topic in those discussions, it dominated every other issue. The women  of the Shankill area felt that there was no point in talking about  opportunities in employment, training, education or health if childcare were  not addressed first.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I have no doubt that the situation is the same in other  areas such as the Falls, Whiterock and Ballymacarrett that are struggling with  high levels of deprivation. The women of the Shankill called for five standards  in childcare to be met. Childcare had to be affordable, of a high quality,  flexible, accessible, and appropriate to need and age.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In 1999, the Department of Health determined that a family  with two children that is on an average income could pay out as much as one  third of that income on childcare when the children were under five years of  age. Even with the Labour Government&rsquo;s new financial support for those  families, childcare takes a significant bite out of the monthly budget.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The absence of affordable childcare is one of the most  significant barriers to employment, education and training for households that  are struggling financially. Many parents who would be inclined to move into  paid work are not doing so because the combination of lower wages and higher  childcare costs in Northern    Ireland means that it does not make  financial sense. It also means that, too often, families have to select  childcare based on what they can afford, rather than on the environment in  which they know that their child would thrive.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Research has shown that the quality of childcare services  can vary significantly and that cost is not always connected directly to  quality. People do not always get a better service for a higher price. Even  though minding children &mdash; especially small children &mdash; is undoubtedly the  hardest and most important work that there is, the wages in that field tend to  be low, and the job, as a profession, is undervalued.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We need national standards for childcare and a  transformation fund that will allow childcare workers to enhance and increase  their professional skills and move along a clearly defined and well-rewarded  career path. Such a fund could also allow childcare providers to upgrade their  physical environment, programmes and services.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As has been noted, any need for childcare facilities  outside the hours of 7.30 am to 6.00 pm is considered irregular. It is  difficult to find adequate childcare outside those hours, and, if people can  find it, they will pay a premium for it. We need to increase financial support  for parents who work outside those hours. That would allow them to afford that  care, and it would create incentives for nurseries and childminders to be  available during what are seen as unsocial hours.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There have been proposals to amend the tax credits system  to allow parents to claim childcare credits for a family member, particularly  grandparents, to mind their children. That would provide immediate flexibility  for a number of families, provide a small income for grandparents living on  increasingly inadequate pensions, and ideally, offer a caring and familiar  environment for children. However, we need to see that proposal materialise.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Childcare services need to be local, and parents need to be  able to get to them easily. I challenge any Member who has not already done so  to take on the Olympic sport of trying to get on and off a bus in the rain with  a toddler, an infant, a pram, and the shopping. If parents cannot get to services  easily and if it takes too long to get there, the value of the services quickly  diminishes.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">A number of women&rsquo;s centres and community centres offer  excellent childcare services for their surrounding areas, despite struggling  with uncertainties with funding. We need to offer those programmes assured  long-term funding and introduce capital grants for the development of childcare  facilities in areas where there is a demonstrated need.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There is very little childcare provision in Northern Ireland  for disabled children. In addition, older children are being left out: there  are few age-appropriate services for children between eight and 14. That may  reach crisis point in a few years if it is not addressed, when welfare reforms  move lone parents from income support to jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance. The stated goal  of those reforms is to move more lone parents into paid employment and move  children out of poverty. However, if childcare is not dealt with, instead of  helping those parents to move on and up, we will simply pull away a safety net,  and there is a real risk that we will make their situation worse rather than  better. The Childcare Act 2006 requires local authorities in England and Wales  to meet the new demands for childcare that will be created by welfare reforms,  and the Executive need to take immediate action to ensure that the same happens  in Northern Ireland.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The gaps in childcare provision that the women of the  Shankill identified are real barriers to parents, especially to women,  re-entering the workforce. It is not only employment that is hampered by  insufficient childcare services. All the programmes that Ministers have proudly  outlined in the Chamber over the past few weeks to improve education, skills  training, health and well-being and community services will be undersubscribed  by parents of young children &mdash; by women in particular &mdash; if the need for  affordable childcare is not addressed.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We have marginalised childcare because we have failed to  appreciate its full impact on our society and our economy. We have approached  it as an optional policy issue, mistakenly assuming that it is about  accommodating the wishes of women who choose to be in paid employment rather  than stay at home with their children. However, for the majority of families in  need of childcare it is not a matter of choice. Those parents need quality,  accessible, affordable childcare, not because they would like to work but  because they have to work. For many households with two wage earners, the  second income makes all the difference. At best, it generates some flexibility  in their finances, but for many families the second wage quite simply keeps  them out of financial dire straits or even poverty.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">For lone parents, the lack of affordable childcare is the  primary barrier to employment. There are nearly 92,000 lone parents in Northern Ireland,  caring for 150,000 children. Eighty-seven per cent of those families are headed  by a mother, and 60% of lone parents are in debt. We need to stop treating  childcare and the quality and accessibility of childcare services as though  they were luxuries to accommodate a lifestyle option. They are matters of  necessity and, in many cases, survival.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Let us also continue to dismantle the myths that childcare  is a women&rsquo;s issue or that every family has a granny who is ready and able to  step in and mind children while their parents are at work. Those are outdated  and misguided perspectives that create hurdles to delivering quality childcare.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The dearth of appropriate childcare seriously inhibits  skills development, further education, innovation and entrepreneurship by and  for women. We are in a recession in which people are carrying vast amounts of  personal debt, and impeding the ability of parents, particularly women, to  maximise their earnings will only slow our recovery. Insufficient childcare  support is inhibiting business growth and innovation, and we are fighting for  economic recovery with one hand tied behind our back.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">My amendment is meant to help to expand the picture of  childcare &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I ask the Member to bring her remarks to a close.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Purvis</strong>: &mdash;  and I hope that my colleagues in the Chamber can support it and that we can  work with the Executive to deliver the proposals.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  I speak on behalf of the Ulster Unionist Party; my colleagues and I are happy  to support both the motion and the amendment. Childcare is a matter that every  parent has to deal with at some stage. Yet, no matter how desperate their need  for childcare, they will always be most concerned that the childcare is good  and that they are leaving their children with people who are properly trained  and in an environment that is safe and secure.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is vital that in seeking to improve its affordability  and accessibility, we do not lose sight of the need for childcare to be  exemplary. I am glad that the motion makes that point.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">2.00 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The quality of childcare increased in the first six years  after the publication in 1999 of &lsquo;Children First &mdash; A Policy Statement&rsquo;, but we  must ensure that standards do not slip. The motion&rsquo;s call for the Executive to  provide a childcare strategy is depressingly familiar. The motion&rsquo;s origins lie  in last summer&rsquo;s OFMDFM report on child poverty. That report followed the 2005  review of &lsquo;Children First&rsquo;, which claimed to represent the beginnings of a  strategy when it was first published in 1999. Unfortunately, such a strategy  has still not been published.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In the report, the Committee for the Office of the First  Minister and deputy First Minister called on the Department to increase the  level of good-quality, affordable childcare; to improve the level of  appropriate, affordable childcare for children who are less able; to improve  access to affordable childcare in rural areas; to reduce the length of time  that it takes to become registered as a childminder; to reverse the decline in  registered childminders that some parts of Northern Ireland are experiencing;  and to enhance the training and development of staff who work in early-years settings.  All those areas are definite priorities as we look at childcare, and if  implemented, they will go a long way to solving many of our society&rsquo;s varied  problems.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Childcare can play a large role in early-years development.  Adequate early-years provision improves the academic attainment of children in  schooling. Affordable childcare, therefore, plays a vital role in allowing  parents &mdash; particularly single parents &mdash; to get back into work if they wish to  do so. It also helps by reducing spend on benefits and by adding to the  economy&rsquo;s productivity. Adequate childcare provision is a necessity for a  society that wishes to be as productive and as driven by equality of  opportunity as it possibly can be.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As we have done with so many other issues, we have  consulted and reported on the issue of childcare almost to death over the past  10 years. The motion and the amendment are reasonable, and what is called for  is badly needed. However, it is not a new call for action, because we have  known for the past decade that action is needed. The issue highlights that  devolution is best for Northern Ireland  and can work for the people of Northern    Ireland. It puts local Ministers, who have the  necessary time and resources, in charge of the matter.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee&rsquo;s view, and my own, is that the time for  studies, reports and consultations is over. That has been done, and endless  pages of analysis and policy already exist. It is now well beyond the time for  the Executive not to be doing what they were elected to do, and what they  promised to do. They must make a difference for the people of Northern Ireland  by providing adequate and proper childcare.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I support the motion and thank the Members who brought it to the Chamber. I  shall focus on the introduction to the Northern Ireland Childminding  Association&rsquo;s (NICMA) briefing paper, &lsquo;Childminder Start-Up Package&rsquo;, which  states:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The right for families to have access to affordable,  quality childcare is fundamental to Northern Ireland&rsquo;s future economic  prosperity, to tackling child poverty, and to achieving the best possible  outcomes for all children.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">I wholeheartedly agree with that statement, as I am  sure do many other Members.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Long gone are the days when the majority of families could  get by on one wage, with many mums staying at home to look after the children.  Most working mothers in the Province do so out of necessity rather than desire.  In most families, both partners must work in order to pay the mortgage.  Maternity leave entitles mothers to a few months&rsquo; pay, but what happens after  that? The bills do not take a break simply because a mother has had a child.  Indeed, as the proud grandfather of a beautiful baby girl, I know that the  bills increase, and I am not just referring to the Northern Ireland football kit that  we bought for her when she was born.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Whor daes this lae maist mithers? Haein tae gaun bak tae  wark is tha ansur. Whau dae ye lae yeer wane wi? Thee ser sum femelies, whuch  er extended, an fowk caun rely oan freens tae mien the wane.

Tha proablim is that ther is  a&rsquo; shoartage o&rsquo; regestered chileminders an this lack is gittin wor.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Where does that leave most mothers? They have to go back to  work, but with whom do they leave their children? Some families are extended,  and mothers can rely on relations to mind their children. That is a real  blessing; however, a large number of families do not have that option.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The next best option is to pay for a registered childminder  to take care of children for you. Whether by using home care, state-provided  nursery schools or play centres, one must make sure that one&rsquo;s child is safe.  Parents must have peace of mind when they leave their children. The problem is  the shortage of registered childminders in Northern Ireland, and that shortage  is getting worse.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Registered childminding is by far the most popular and  affordable form of full-time childcare in Northern Ireland; it accounts for  some 76% of the full-time places and 44% of all childcare places. There was a  90% drop in the supply of places with registered childminders in the three  years to March 2006.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">NICMA has told me of its proposals for helping to solve the  problem of day care for children. They are constructive, and entail the  Executive funding an innovative childminder start-up package. That is a  positive way to address these issues. The package includes childminder start-up  grants to encourage more individuals to choose childminding and to go through  the registration process. The grants will help with the cost of setting up and  registering as a childminding business. They will be of particular benefit in  areas of social deprivation in which childminding provision is low. Individuals  in such areas find the start-up costs associated with becoming a childminder &mdash;  such as buying equipment and insurance &mdash; particularly difficult to meet.  Another constructive suggestion is for the provision of one-to-one mentoring support  for individuals as they go through the registration process. NICMA has also  suggested the provision of a personal adviser to support new recruits. Those  are good and important suggestions.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In the survey of parents and childcare in Northern Ireland,  it was shown that there was a clear shortfall in the provision of childcare  places, particularly in rural areas and in eastern parts of the Province &mdash; and,  indeed, in the area that I represent; it would be wrong of me not to mention  that in the Chamber today. A 20% expansion in the number of childminders is  needed to meet the demand. There has been a significant increase in the use of  unregistered childminders, which increases the potential risk to children. The  proposal requires only &pound;300,000 annually for an initial period of three years.  It would enable the roll-out of the childminders&rsquo; start-up package across Northern Ireland,  with priority given to the areas most in need of childminding provision.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Something must be done. I ask the Minister to consider seriously  and as a matter of urgency the implementation here of schemes that have been  implemented on the mainland. They have done it there, and it has been successful.  Let us see whether we can do the same here.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Will the Member bring his remarks to a close?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  If we are to reach our full economic potential, we must ensure that all those  able to work are doing so, and childminding is important in that.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Bradley</strong>:  I support the motion and the amendment.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Childcare is important from the perspective of child,  parent and service provider. It is a tool essential to bringing us all out of  this economic downturn. We are experiencing a great shift in attitudes: there  is now an acceptance that equality plays a part in all aspects of life,  including childcare. Any provision must be child-centred and suitable for the  needs of the workforce during this difficult economic period. A flexible and equality-driven  service must be the core of any strategy, and such strategies must be open,  transparent and contributed to by all Ministers. In the delivery of such a  service, there must be a strong interdepartmental element.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The cost of childcare is too great for many families. We  need affordable provision that encourages parents to get back to work and  dispels the belief that it is not worth working because one will only work to  pay for one&rsquo;s childcare. If we get more people back to work, we stand a better  chance of stimulating the economy by increasing the disposable income of  working parents, rather than increasing the number of those dependent on  benefits.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The fiasco of the working tax credit, and all the  controversy that goes with that, is really off-putting for many people who are  considering going back to work, together with the fact that the childcare  element of it is not available if the carer is a relative. That is the case for  many people in Northern    Ireland, where, for example, many  grandparents provide childcare. The lack of places is high on the complaints  list, as is the need for a more flexible service to fit the needs of the  flexi-worker.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is essential that the Assembly take on board the need  for investment in childcare provision if we are to see a return on the economy  and the rebirth of a more flexible and more accessible childcare system that is  open and available to all. We must speculate to accumulate in this particular  instance. It is only through utilising that attitude that there will be any  valuable change for our constituents and their families. The lack of funding in  early-years and special-needs childcare is a real problem, and one that will  continue to rear its head until properly dealt with. I hope that the Minister  of Education will take that problem on board and consider it accordingly.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The choice element is vital if parents are to have peace of  mind when they place their child in a cr&egrave;che or childcare environment. The  upshot is that we should reap the benefits in the long term and get the chance  to provide care for primary-school children who, according to many studies, are  not really receiving age-appropriate childcare at the minute. If we can provide  age-appropriate after-school care, we may &mdash; and I stress &ldquo;may&rdquo; &mdash; see a shift in  the attitudes of our pre-teenagers and, in the long run, may even see a more  respectful generation.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I think that it is obvious from today&rsquo;s debate and the  various contributions that childcare requires a properly considered strategy  with interdepartmental contributions. Such a strategy should develop a  healthier economy and a more stable and happier family environment and have the  interests of the child at its heart. Childcare must be local, quality, flexible  and accessible. That is what we need to provide, and it is up to the Executive  to provide it. Constituents who are the parents of disabled children or  children with special needs are blindsided when it comes to childcare and,  often, can only access some respite care but not permanent childcare.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I request that all Ministers take heed of what has been  said today and act accordingly. The scoping exercise being carried out by the  First Minister and the deputy First Minister needs to be delivered and needs to  be delivered soon. I support the motion and the amendment.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>: I  thank the Members who tabled the debate for bringing the issue before the  House. The issue of accessible and affordable childcare is something that we  need to concentrate on. I support the motion, which calls for a coherent and,  perhaps most importantly, properly resourced strategy. I also support the  amendment, which highlights the need for such a strategy to take into account  irregular and flexible working hours. People do not always work nine-to-five or  family friendly hours, and that has to be taken into account when we try to  provide a strategy. If people do indeed want to be able to work, they have to  have the flexibility to take the employment that is on offer.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">During the OFMDFM Committee&rsquo;s study of child poverty, it  was stated time and time again by contributors and witnesses, and highlighted  in the research, that the best way to alleviate poverty and to break cycles of  deprivation is to increase access to employment. Although the benefits system  has been, and continues to be, amended to try to mitigate poverty and alleviate  its worst effects, if significant step changes are to be achieved in people&rsquo;s  living experience, increasing stable employment is the only option. Certainly,  it is key to improving outcomes. However, it was just as frequently recognised  that the lack of affordable and flexible childcare was a major limiting factor  affecting access to training in preparation for work, access to employment, and  people&rsquo;s flexibility within employment.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Research carried out by the Equality Commission &mdash; I think  in 2003 &mdash; was brought before the Committee. It suggested that 67% of women  stated the lack of affordable childcare as a factor in preventing them from  taking up paid employment. Not only that, it showed that over 25% of mothers  were constrained in the hours that they could work due to childcare, and a  further 20% were limited in the jobs that they could take. It is not just about  getting a job; it is about getting equal access to well-paid, stable  employment, and to promotion opportunities once in employment.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">That has an impact on the family and on the individuals  whose personal aspirations can be frustrated and thwarted. It also has  implications for the wider economy, because people have skills and talents that  cannot be fully harnessed by the economy due to that constraining factor.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">2.15 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Indeed, we were told that the current provision was  woefully inadequate, and that where it existed, it was sparse and often  expensive. The Committee took that point on board in its discussions. However,  that was not the only problem. There has been a lack of strategic direction  coming from the Executive in what is a key aspect of the Programme for  Government&rsquo;s pledge to support the economy.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In 1999, the &lsquo;Children First&rsquo; childcare strategy first  emerged. It was reviewed in 2005 and a final report was published. We are now  in another review situation, but an active strategy encompassing the preschool  and school-age aspects of childcare is not in place.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In 2007, the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development  (DARD) considered rural issues specifically. Undoubtedly, there are rural  aspects to childcare, but it is not purely a rural issue. The problem of being  able to gain access to childcare can be exacerbated by geographical factors,  but the issue is much wider. Also, it is unclear as to how those  recommendations are feeding into the process of producing a strategic overview  for the entire Executive.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">People in multiple deprivations and with other family factors  are further disadvantaged when accessing childcare, and that was shown in much  of the research. Also, people from a low-income background, those who work part  time, those who work outside traditional work patterns, and families in which  one or more family member has a disability, find access to childcare incredibly  difficult. If the family member with a disability happens to be a child, it can  be more difficult still. Legally, they have the right to access, but often a  parent is required to be present in the childcare facility. That, in itself,  prevents that parent from seeking employment.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Clear lines of responsibility are lacking, and that must be  addressed. The Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety  (DHSSPS), the Department of Education and the Department for Employment and  Learning (DEL) were involved originally; DARD and OFMDFM also have some input.  However, there is no clarity regarding the lines of responsibility for  school-age childcare, and that was highlighted repeatedly during the study  undertaken by the Committee for the Office of the First Minister and deputy  First Minister. Both Departments came to the Committee a week apart and said  that it was not their problem. The matter must be clarified and pressed home  with those Departments.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I suspect that the debate will raise little that is not  already known and acknowledged. However, a measure of its usefulness will be in  the appropriateness of the Executive&rsquo;s response.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Spratt</strong>:  We debate this important matter in the context of falling levels of childcare  provision in Northern    Ireland. Between 2002 and 2007, the overall  number of day-care places fell by 1%, and places with registered childminders  are down by 17% since 2002. That is deeply worrying and it is, without doubt,  an important matter that must be addressed in the Province.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Quality affordable childcare is essential in allowing the  development of a modern workforce. Women, including mothers, are a key element  of the workforce, and as a Province, we must utilise all our resources, including  human resources, to reinvigorate the economy. However, there is currently a  huge barrier preventing that from happening. Sixty-seven per cent of women  refer to the lack of affordable quality childcare as the main barrier to  entering employment. That is no fault of theirs: it is the failure of the  system. That must be addressed, and barriers to employment must be removed.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>:  Will the Member accept that since the decision was taken to end the Executive  programme fund for children, a gap has materialised that no Department, or  Departments collectively, co-ordinated by OFMDFM, have filled? The extended  schools programme is only partially funded, and that other stream of funding  has ended. Will the Member accept that a considerable period has elapsed since  that decision was taken and that, as yet, the gap has not been addressed by the  Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member will have a minute added to his time.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Spratt</strong>:  It is a cross-departmental issue. Some Departments have washed their hands of  it, and I will touch upon a particular example of that, which has occurred in  my own constituency.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Members who tabled the motion are seeking to tackle the  problem through an Executive-led strategy. By doing so, they are seeking, what  I believe to be, the responsibility of their party colleague, the Minister of  Education. Although there is no doubt that if the necessary investment were  made in that key provision, children&rsquo;s learning skills would improve, unsurprisingly,  all that has come from the responsible Minister has been another failure to act  in children&rsquo;s best interests.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Let me provide a brief example of such a failure. Let me  take Members to the Sandy Row area of my constituency, where the Kids Into Training  and Education project &mdash; the KITE project, as it is known &mdash; has suffered at the  hands of the Minister of Education. That fantastic project, which, every week,  serves hundreds of kids in one of the most deprived areas of Belfast, has been refused funding by the  Department of Education. I must say that I concur with the sentiments of local  pastor Paul Burns who said that the Minister, like Pontius Pilate, has washed  her hands of the whole affair. Not only has the Minister refused to help those  kids, but, in doing so, she is barring local mothers who depend on KITE  childcare from going out to work. Despite that, the Minister claims that the  issue is nothing to do with her Department.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Thanks to money from the Office of the First Minister and  deputy First Minister, which was allocated through the Department of Health,  the project is now being funded for a period of time through PlayBoard.  Fortunately, those bodies recognise the importance of such a project in my  constituency. It is time that the Department of Education and, indeed, all  Departments consider the importance of projects and the vital work that they do  in those communities, particularly in areas such as Sandy Row.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Present in the Chamber today are mothers who, without  childcare, could not do the work of an Assembly Member and public  representative. More must be done to give women such as those mothers in Sandy  Row freedom to enter the workforce and realise their potential. As individuals,  they will benefit, their family units will welcome the extra income, and  everyone will benefit from the contribution that women make to Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  growing economy.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">My party and I support the motion and the amendment.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Beidh m&eacute; ag labhairt ar son an r&uacute;in  agus an leasaithe.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The motion concerns economics: it is about the economics of  our society. I will quote from the statement provided earlier by the First  Minister on behalf of himself and the deputy First Minister:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;This statement is but a further demonstration of our  determination to take whatever actions are open to us to combat the economic  difficulties&hellip;by harnessing the wisdom and knowledge of those most affected by  the current economic situation, we can navigate our way through the present  difficulties.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">If the Executive are able to manage a properly funded and  resourced childcare facility in the North, it will go a great way towards  helping us to navigate our way out of our current economic difficulties,  because the people most affected by the downturn &mdash; those who live in socially  deprived areas &mdash; are those who find it most difficult to find childcare  facilities. As the statistics and reports that have already been mentioned, and  which I will not repeat, demonstrate, there is a requirement for greater  investment in childcare facilities.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Indeed, in the statement that she made prior to the debate,  the Minister for Social Development outlined her proposals for the  reconfiguration of social security offices. One of the deepest concerns among the  agency&rsquo;s workers, particularly those who are female, is that if they are forced  to travel long distances to work, or their rotas are changed and they are  unable to access childcare facilities, they may have to leave their jobs.  Therefore, the issue affects a wide range of people in both our workforce and  our potential workforce.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There is a deficit in rural childcare facilities, and that  has a wide effect. I know many parents in rural areas who drive past their  local rural primary school into the town and then go to work. They send their  children to urban primary schools because they have more chance of accessing  childcare facilities after school hours there than they do in the rural  community. That means that rural schools are affected, and that has a knock-on  effect across society.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Workers in childcare professions must be both looked after  and paid adequately. As Dawn Purvis said, there must be a professional element  to their training and to the achievement of professional qualifications to  ensure that the profession, which provides a vital service to society, is  cherished.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">At this stage of the debate, many points have been  rehearsed, and I do not intend to repeat them. I support the motion and the  amendment. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  As Question Time commences at 2.30 pm, I suggest that the House take its ease  until that time. The debate will continue after Question Time, when Mr Moutray  will be the next Member to speak.</p>

      <p class="H3SectionHeading">Office Of The First Minister And Deputy First  Minister</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Question 1 has been withdrawn.</p>
      <p class="H5StageHeading">Discrimination/Inequalities: Section 75</p>
      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">2. <strong>Mr  Butler </strong>asked the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister  what assessment it has made of the effectiveness of the Equality Commission in  addressing discrimination and inequalities among section 75 categories.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO2467/09>(AQO 2467/09)</a></p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister (Mr P Robinson)</strong>: I was wondering, Mr Deputy Speaker, how you were  going to be referee and striker at the same time with question 1.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As the funding Department for the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland,  the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister (OFMDFM) is  accountable for the commission&rsquo;s business activities and resourcing  arrangements. In that context, the deputy First Minister and I approve the  commission&rsquo;s three-year corporate plan. Our Department must also approve the  commission&rsquo;s annual business plan. It also carries out reviews every five years  or so, with the next review scheduled for 2009-2010.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The commission reports to OFMDFM quarterly on its  performance on progress made towards achieving the aims, objectives and targets  contained in its annual business plan. In turn, OFMDFM officials consider the  contents of those quarterly reports and request further details where  appropriate. Our officials also meet bimonthly with commission staff to discuss  various issues, including the outworking of the business and corporate plans.  Formal meetings at senior management level take place quarterly.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">For the financial year 2007-08, the commission set 23  targets of progress: 18 of those were met, two were partly met, and three were  unmet.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Butler</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Ba mhaith liom f&aacute;ilte a chur roimh  fhreagra an Aire.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the First Minister for his reply. The question  relates to the effectiveness of section 75. Local government is an area of  particular concern. There are two approaches to section 75: a complainant can  go to a local authority &mdash; or whatever offending body &mdash; and lodge a section 75  complaint; or the Equality Commission can generate its own review of section  75. Is the First Minister concerned by the fact that during the years of the  Equality Commission&rsquo;s existence, it has not generated a single section 75  complaint against any local authority and that it is left up to individuals?  That is a weakness.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: I am not sure that I recall any successful legal action relating  to section 75. Part of the commission&rsquo;s work is to give advice and assistance  so that organisations do not fall foul of section 75 requirements. Schedule 9  to the Northern Ireland Act 1998 requires the Equality Commission to keep the  effectiveness of the duties imposed by section 75 under review.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Equality Commission is not appointed by the deputy  First Minister and me; it is appointed by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.  Given that the Secretary of State has section 75 responsibilities, he should  keep account of the effectiveness of the organisation that he appoints. For our  part, we have a pay and rations requirement for our Department and the  commission. We can approve or not approve the commission&rsquo;s corporate and  business plans, but we are limited because we do not appoint the organisation  in the first instance.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P J Bradley</strong>:  What is the First Minister&rsquo;s assessment of the Equality Commission&rsquo;s role,  particularly in relation to age discrimination?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: I was going to try to get through this question and still be  ministerial. My views on the Equality Commission are fairly well known. It is  always difficult for a body that is not itself representative to carry out its  role. The duties of the Equality Commission are set down in law; if it is  believed that breaches of the requirements of section 75 have occurred, people  can have redress through the courts. As I said before &mdash; though it is not always  the only indicator of whether there have been breaches of section 75 &mdash; there  have not, in my view, been any successful legal actions with regard to section  75 requirements.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCausland</strong>:  I thank the First Minister for his answers. There is a statutory obligation on  the Equality Commission to be reflective of the community in Northern Ireland.  What is the First Minister&rsquo;s assessment of the Equality Commission&rsquo;s record in  that regard, given that it has, in my view, failed in its obligations towards  the unionist and Protestant community in the appointment of commissioners and  in its record as an employer?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: I can go along that road for 50% of the way. The other 50% has to  take the form of a stricture on the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland,  because it is he who appoints the members of the Equality Commission, rather  than the commission itself. It is not a representative body, and one situation  flows from the other. If a body is not representative, its staff get out of  kilter and there is a cold-house feeling, which has a rolling impact. It looks  dreadfully bad if the Equality Commission has to put its own requirements to  the test. Some 30% of its staff is Protestant, which is clearly not reflective  of the community. Urgent action is required, and simply placing an  advertisement here and there is not enough. The Equality Commission is required  to show equality in its own staffing arrangements and in the commission itself.</p>
      <p class="H5StageHeading">Domestic Violence: Children&rsquo;s Strategy</p>
      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">3. <strong>Mr Poots </strong>asked the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister what  assessment it has made of the impact of domestic violence in the context of  delivering the children&rsquo;s strategy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO2468/09>(AQO  2468/09)</a></p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: The 10-year strategy for children and young people aims to  deliver improved outcomes across six main areas. We recognise the potential  impact that violence in the home may have on achieving the high-level outcomes  of being healthy and living in safety and with stability. However, the strategy  does not repeat or replicate actions that emerge from other cross-cutting  strategies.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Through implementation of the strategy for children and  young people, we will work to ensure that the rights and needs of children and  young people in Northern Ireland are properly addressed in emerging action  plans under cross-cutting strategies such as the tackling violence at home  strategy, which has been published by the Department of Health, Social Services  and Public Safety, and which addresses domestic violence and abuse. The  Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety (DHSSPS) chairs the inter-ministerial  group on domestic and sexual violence, which was established to ensure the  involvement of key service providers and voluntary and statutory partners in  this area. The junior Ministers represent OFMDFM on that group because of the  potential impact of domestic violence on children.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In addition, an inter-agency regional steering group, led  by DHSSPS and the NIO, was established to examine the issues around prevention,  protection and justice, support, and training and development for  practitioners. Senior officials from OFMDFM&rsquo;s gender and sexual orientation  equality unit are represented on that forum. That strategic group feeds into  the inter-ministerial group, working together on all the issues that are  associated with domestic violence, sexual violence and abuse.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: I  thank the First Minister for his response. Does he agree that the former SDLP  Member for Lagan Valley  and current Northern Ireland  Commissioner for Children and Young People would be better advancing children&rsquo;s  interests in the home and with regard to domestic violence, rather than  pursuing parents who care about their children?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: Everyone knows that resources are extremely limited and that the  best use must be made of them. It is clear that the court case to which the  Member alluded &mdash; and the appeal against that judgement &mdash; cost a considerable  amount out of a budget that would otherwise have been available for other child  support services.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Everyone can make their own judgement on whether that was  good value for money. Both cases were lost; therefore, there was no positive  outcome for the Children&rsquo;s Commissioner.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gardiner</strong>:  Has the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister considered  asking the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety to consider  the overall mental-health implications of incidents of domestic violence on  women?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: The Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety leads  the group that deals with those issues; therefore, it would be more appropriate  to put any questions about the details of that to him. The responsibility of  the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister is determined by two  factors &mdash; the first is whether an issue relates to equality and the second is  whether it relates to children. The Department of Health, Social Services and  Public Safety has responsibility for dealing with issues that relate to  domestic violence.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms J McCann</strong>:  Given that OFMDFM has responsibility for the elimination of gender-based  violence, and given that some people who experience such violence have no  recourse to public funds, will the Office of the First Minister and deputy  First Minister consider initiating a special fund for those families that have  no access to public funds, so that they can access support services?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: I am quite happy to look at that issue in more detail. Such  people might have access to legal aid and legal support in other circumstances.  The deputy First Minister and I are happy to look at the issue in the first  instance, to see how extensive it is and whether it can be dealt with under  existing systems.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>:  What additional resources has OFMDFM provided for the children&rsquo;s strategy? Does  that Department intend to again bring into force a package of measures for  children and young people?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: It is a mistake to think that the measures relating to children  and young people were funded entirely by OFMDFM &mdash; a range of Departments has  responsibility for the issues involved. The principle of removing the duplication  of services &mdash; which is important because administering the duplicated services  incurred a cost and so used up funds &mdash; and allowing Departments to take the  lead responsibility in the areas involved has meant that money that would  otherwise have been tied up in administration in OFMDFM is going to the  Departments</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Those issues are a priority for OFMDFM, because of the  Department&rsquo;s cross-cutting nature. However, every Department, by its nature,  has some responsibility for those matters, whether it is the Department of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety or the Department of Education, and  Ministers must ensure that that those issues are prioritised in their  Departments.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I know that this is the first Question Time since before the  recess, but I remind Members who want to ask a supplementary question that they  need to rise in their places to get my attention.</p>
      <p class="H5StageHeading">Climate Change and Sustainable Development</p>
      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">4. <strong>Mr  Gallagher </strong>asked the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister when  it will publish the strategy on climate change and sustainable development.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO2469/09>(AQO 2469/09)</a></p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: Following an earlier written response to him, the Member will be  aware that we have initiated a review of the first sustainable development strategy  that was produced by the previous Administration. Our objective is to produce a  new high-level strategy that will align more effectively with the Executive&rsquo;s  Programme for Government.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We have the first draft of the new strategy, which we are  continuing to study. In the near future, we hope to be in a position to  circulate a draft of the new strategy document to stakeholders in Government  and to the Committee for the Office of the First Minister and deputy First  Minister, before initiating a wider public consultation. Naturally, the new  strategy will take climate change into account, within the broader principle of  living within environmental limits. However, responsibility for climate change  policy lies within the remit of the Department of the Environment (DOE) and is  subject to a decision by the Executive.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  I thank the First Minister for his answer. I received a written response to my  question on the matter in February 2009. Given the increasing importance that  many Governments around the world, particularly those in London  and Dublin,  give to the development of low carbon technologies and other efficiencies, does  the First Minister feel that the longer we wait for a sustainable development  strategy, the greater our economic disadvantage will be?</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">2.45 pm</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: I do not accept that, because we are not without a strategy. The  existing strategy &mdash; that is, the 2006 strategy &mdash; will remain in place until it  is replaced by the updated strategy, which will take account of our Programme  for Government policies and targets. We are upgrading the policy, but the  strategy is in place already, and we are working to it.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I believe that all parties in the House are particularly  committed &mdash; as are the Executive &mdash; to the reduction of carbon emissions. We  have set ourselves targets on that in our Programme for Government. The public  service agreements are being advanced by various Departments, and a range of  Departments is doing a lot of work to meet the Programme for Government  targets.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr T Clarke</strong>:  Will the First Minister tell us whether the lack of a published strategy means  that Northern Ireland  is operating in a void when it comes to sustainable development?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: That is not the case. I could list what all the Departments are doing  on sustainable development. The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment in  particular has been proactive in the work that it is doing on a wide range of  areas. The Department of Finance and Personnel, the Department of the  Environment &mdash; obviously &mdash; and the Department of Agriculture and Rural  Development all have a role to play. They all continue to pursue the  requirements of the Programme for Government.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The strategy, which I hope will be available fairly soon,  will update that which was left by the previous Administration and will take  into account the targets and requirements of our Programme for Government.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>:  Has the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister considered how  the Programme for Government&rsquo;s commitment to reducing our impact on climate  change is being affected adversely by views that the Minister of the  Environment has expressed? What latitude does a Minister have to express views  that will detract from those objectives and that will detract ultimately from  any strategy that may be agreed? Has the First Minister had discussions with  the Minister of the Environment about the matter?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: Let us be clear: the Programme for Government was approved by  this Assembly and supported by the Executive. It is, therefore, the policy of  the Executive and this Assembly. The views to which the Member refers are  academic views that were expressed by the Minister about how climate change  comes about. There is no question in the Minister&rsquo;s mind as to whether there is  climate change; the question is whether it is man-made.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I think that the scientific evidence is on the side of  those of us who believe that man is having an impact on the climate, and that,  therefore, there is a necessity on the part of the Executive to deal with those  issues. Even if it were not so, I have to say that the possibility that it were  should be enough to alert any responsible Executive to take whatever measures  they can.</p>
      <p class="H5StageHeading">Special Economic Taskforce</p>
      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">5. <strong>Mr  McElduff </strong>asked the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister  whether the special economic taskforce will take proper account of the  infrastructure needs of Tyrone, Fermanagh and other areas west of the River  Bann.&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO2470/09>(AQO 2470/09)</a></p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: The Programme for Government and the investment strategy set out  clearly that promoting a regional balance and addressing existing regional  disparities is a key objective for the Executive. That is crucial if we are to  promote and facilitate economic growth and social progress across Northern Ireland.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Members will be aware that the deputy First Minister and I  have set up a task force called the cross-sector advisory forum to allow us to  continue dialogue with key stakeholder groups and to tap into the well of local  economic &mdash; and other &mdash; talent in Northern Ireland. The forum, which is chaired  jointly by the deputy First Minister and me, has 30 members. It has been  established to address particular issues and to make recommendations for  addressing the problems that are arising from the current economic crisis.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The terms of reference and details of the membership of the  group have been placed in the Assembly Library for information. The first  meeting of the forum took place on 6 April 2009. The infrastructure development  of areas west of the Bann, and, indeed, of all parts of Northern Ireland, is considered in the  investment strategy for Northern    Ireland. Naturally, the forum&rsquo;s remit will  take account of the impact that the economic crisis is having across Northern Ireland.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  T&aacute; m&eacute; bu&iacute;och den Aire as a fhreagra.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I am grateful to the First Minister for his answer. The  importance of the infrastructure to our economy is implicit in the question. I  want to highlight the fact that businesses west of the Bann face additional  hurdles, including poor broadband access in many communities and a generally  poor roads infrastructure.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Will the First Minister and deputy First Minister encourage  the forum to take a special look at the economic needs of businesses west of  the Bann?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: The deputy First Minister, who represents a constituency west of  the Bann, is unlikely to allow the concerns of the region to go unheard. As for  infrastructure: Northern Ireland  was in advance of any other country in Europe  with regard to broadband access capability. That is now being upgraded, and,  happily, will be coming into the north-west of the Province, and there should,  therefore, be considerable advantage from that.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As far as roads are concerned: I assure the Member that,  during my time as a roads Minister &mdash; which, admittedly, was some years ago &mdash; I  used to get accused of spending too much money west of the Bann, and most of  the road improvements and &#8213; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span> <span class="Italic">[Laughter.] </span>Oh, yes: if anyone looks, they will see that  more money was spent west of the Bann during that period than was spent east of  the Bann. However, I very much doubt whether the current roads Minister is  discriminating against the west of the Bann on those issues.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We want the whole of Northern Ireland to enjoy  prosperity. The goal of the Executive is to ensure that the benefits of  devolution filter down to not just every strata of society, but to every  location in Northern Ireland, and it is in the interests of us all to ensure  that the communities west of the Bann have all the advantages of devolution.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Ramsey</strong>:  Does the First Minister agree that in order to respond to the current crisis in  the economy across Northern    Ireland, it would be better to carry out an  urgent review of the Programme for Government and the Budget rather than  waiting several months for the outcome of a set review?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: That question covers territory that I covered in my statement  earlier today. I again say that I cannot see any logic in anyone suggesting that  we should change our Programme for Government, given that it has, as its  priority, the growth of our economy, which is precisely what anyone would do if  they were starting with a blank piece of paper today.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Of course, the Budget will change from time to time, and  there will be priorities that each party &#8213; and, indeed, each Minister in the  Executive &#8213; may well want to put forward. We are open to proposals as to where  reductions can be made in spending so that increases can be made in other  areas. I do point out to the Member, however, that there has been a higher  spend on capital projects in Northern    Ireland during the past year than there has  ever been, and we are planning to do even better in the next 12 months.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>:  I listened with interest to the exchanges about the roads system west of the  Bann. I went down to have a look at it myself on Friday, and was mightily  impressed &#8213; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Yes, right down as far as Enniskillen, Tommy.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Has the First Minister considered the disproportionate  impact of the recession on the East Antrim constituency, especially since 10%  of employment comes from the relatively safe public-sector sources, compared  with the UK constituency  average of 20%, and the Belfast  average of 53%? What steps does he intend to take to address that inequality east  of the Bann, and, specifically, in East Antrim?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: I can recall that when I was Finance Minister, the Member for  West Tyrone always used to tell me that because of the number of people working  in the public sector in the Omagh area, there was a necessity for more  public-sector jobs to go to that area. Actually, on a travel-to-work basis,  there were more people working in public-sector jobs in his constituency than  anywhere else in Northern Ireland,  including in Belfast,  per head of population of economically active people. The worst of the whole of  Northern Ireland  was that general Larne catchment area. My argument had consistently been that  that was an area where we should start looking if we are displacing jobs from  the centre of Belfast.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">However, much has to do with infrastructure, and the Larne  area has a very important facility with the ferry, which is a very important  means of communication with mainland Britain, and it is vital that the roads to  and from the port are improved.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I am sure that the Member is as glad as I am that the  Government of the Republic   of Ireland are still  committing themselves to giving funding for the road improvement, which will  help that area&rsquo;s economy.</p>
      <p class="H5StageHeading">Climate Change</p>
      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">6. <strong>Mr Ford </strong>asked  the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister to report on  cross-departmental Executive policy in relation to climate change.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO2471/09>(AQO 2471/09)</a></p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: During the recent debate on the Act on CO2 advertising campaign,  the Member for South Antrim Mr Ford rightly stated:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;If we are going to deal seriously with climate  change, it must be looked at by the entire Executive.&rdquo; &mdash; <span class="Italic"><span style="font-style:normal; ">[Official Report, Vol 39,  No 5, p214, col 2].</span></span></p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member will know that the Programme for Government  already provides an expression of the Executive&rsquo;s intention in that regard. In  that document, we stated clearly and unequivocally that we are aware of global  and local threats to our natural and built environment, and that it is clear  that climate change is a serious problem facing the world. That position has  not changed. Our Programme for Government has put in place commitments, actions  and targets, which all Departments support, to tackle the problem of climate  change.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>:  When Ministers give their responses, I am flattered when they quote the Members  who asked them questions. I had hoped that the First Minister&rsquo;s response would  have had slightly more on policy and less on aspirations. Nevertheless, given  that he has told Mr Beggs that any responsible Executive would take whatever  measures they could on climate change, and given the range of responsibilities  across different Departments, will he explain how he can deal with the fact  that the DOE Minister has a policy of doing the absolute minimum that is  required by law?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First Minister</strong>:  DETI recently provided funding to extend the work of the Department of Energy  and Climate Change on low-carbon solutions for households and communities to Northern Ireland.  Work is due to start this year on a renewable heat strategy, and a submission on  the subject will issue shortly to the Minister.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Energy used for heat accounts for around 50% of carbon  emissions in the UK.  It is vital to tackle that in order to help to constrain climate change. Invest  Northern Ireland funds the Carbon Trust&rsquo;s activities in Northern Ireland, and  the sum for those activities will be &pound;13&middot;4 million for 2008-2011.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Invest Northern    Ireland is developing a renewables strategy,  and a position paper is scheduled for June 2009. Four substantial  energy-from-waste projects were approved in 2008, with support totalling  approximately &pound;13 million. DETI continues to provide funding for Action  Renewables to provide free technical advice to households and communities on  renewable-energy technologies, and it offers a signposting service to the  low-carbon building programme.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">From July 2006 to March 2008, DETI provided &pound;10&middot;8 million  in funding for the Reconnect programme to allow householders to install  micro-renewable technologies. That resulted in the displacement of 54&middot;4 MW of  fossil-fuel-generated electricity and heat, which resulted in a CO2 saving of  21,074 tons per annum. A reduced VAT rate of 5% is available for small-scale  renewable technologies and for technologies that generate electricity. I could  go on, because I have a list of about six pages, but Members might lose  patience with me somewhere along the line.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I will now address the remarks made about the Department of  the Environment. It is progressing work on adapting to the unavoidable effects  of climate change. The Department has set up the Northern Ireland climate change  impacts partnership (NICCIP) with businesses, non-governmental organisations,  the voluntary sector and Government representatives to improve understanding.  The DOE continues to work with Whitehall and  other devolved Administrations in the UK  to inform public policy in Northern    Ireland. It would be very hard to assess why  there would be a detriment to one advert&rsquo;s having been stopped by a Minister  who did not want to run a national UK advert here because he felt that such  matters should be decided by the devolved Administration.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Spratt</strong>:  Will the First Minister confirm that his position on climate change is  consistent with that in the Programme for Government?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: It would not have been included in the Programme for Government  had it not been consistent with the position that my Executive colleagues and I  hold. Indeed, the position as outlined in the Programme for Government flows  directly from the DUP&rsquo;s election manifesto of 2007, to which all Members of the  party are obliged to keep and uphold.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The DUP has supported climate-change legislation at Westminster and has  called for year-on-year targets to reduce carbon emissions. It has been  suggested that there is no consensus on the scientific evidence; I do not care  too much whether there is consensus or not. However, I do believe that it is  appropriate for the Executive to take action and prepare for any eventuality.</p>

      <p class="H4StageHeading">Bus Stops/Timetables</p>
      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">1. <strong>Mr McKay </strong>asked the Minister for Regional Development what action has been taken to  provide bus stops and bus timetables in rural areas since he came to office. <a name=AQO2486/09>(AQO 2486/09)</a></p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development (Mr Murphy)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann  Comhairle. The provision of bus stops is an operational matter for Translink.  However, I have been informed that in the past five years, 306 bus shelters  have been erected in rural areas through a contract with Adshel. In addition,  Translink has continued to improve facilities for passengers by providing  timetable information, improving signage where required and making repairs to  existing bus stops.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McKay</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for his response  and the work that his Department has carried out to date. Indeed, recently  there has been a great increase in the number of bus stops, of bus stop signage  and timetables in rural areas of north Antrim.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Minister tell the House what his Department&rsquo;s  policy is in relation to the provision of bus shelters? Furthermore, what  percentage of bus stops have shelters?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: My Department&rsquo;s Roads Service entered into a 15-year  contract with the bus shelter provider Adshel in 2001 to provide approximately  1,500 bus shelters across the North. The provision and maintenance of those  shelters is funded by Adshel through advertising revenue at no cost to the  Department. All councils, with the exception of Fermanagh District Council,  have signed up to that contract, which restricts them from providing  advertising shelters from any other source. All councils, in addition to  Translink, are permitted to provide additional non-advertising bus shelters at  their own expense.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">When my Department receives a request for a bus shelter, it  consults Translink to ensure that there is either sufficient usage or potential  for future public-transport growth at the proposed stop. That ensures that the  best use is made of the limited resources available.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Since Translink does not maintain central records on the  number of locations of bus stops, it is not possible to provide the percentage  information requested by the Member.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Burns</strong>:  Although bus stops and shelters are very important and play a vital role, bus  transport itself and the lack of transport in rural areas are key factors. I  call on the Minister to provide more transport in rural areas.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: I am not sure that the Member actually asked a  question; however, my Department is striving to provide more transport in rural  areas. Not only is Translink required to fund loss-making services in rural  areas, it also provides rural community transport across the North.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">If the Member wants more transport, I will be happy to hear  him in Budget debates argue that the Department for Regional Development (DRD)  rather than the Department for Social Development (DSD) should receive more  money.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  Since a review of Translink&rsquo;s passenger charter is due in the next few years,  will the Minister examine the need for buses to stick to their timetables not  just at the beginning and end of journeys but also at the stops in between, as  is the case at present? Does he agree that such a change could improve  reliability, particularly in rural areas?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: A central aim in departmental policy is to get more  people to use public transport. As the representative of a rural area, I am  conscious of the provision of public transport in rural areas and of the need  to improve public transport continuously to achieve our aim of getting people  out of their cars and into public transport. Therefore anything that can be  done to improve that would certainly be examined.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As the Member said, Translink&rsquo;s passenger charter is up for  review. If mechanisms come forward during that review to improve service,  particularly in rural areas, I would be happy to examine them.</p>
      <p class="H5StageHeading">Water Charges</p>
      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">2. <strong>Mr  Elliott </strong>asked the Minister for Regional Development for his assessment of  the impact on his budget of the deferral of water charges to 2011.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO2487/09>(AQO 2487/09)</a></p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: On 20 November 2008, the Executive unanimously  decided that there would be no household water and sewage payments in  2009-2010. As that was a collective decision, the Executive must decide how  that cost will be met, and the June monitoring round will provide an  opportunity to do that.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As part of the recent strategic stocktake, DRD identified  that some &pound;200 million of additional funding would be required for 2009-2010.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Executive have not yet made a decision about the  funding of water and sewerage services in 2010-11 and beyond.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his answer. Does he accept that he will implement  water charges in the very near future? If so, how does he propose to do that?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: As I outlined in my initial answer, that is a  position for the Executive to take. When Members were first elected, the  Executive decided to defer water charges for a year and to set up an  independent panel, which brought forward a series of recommendations. We have  yet to take decisions on all those recommendations, after which there will be a  period of consultation.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Executive decided to defer water charges further until  2010. Therefore, the Executive must decide how to meet the cost of that,  because there is a very real cost to the provision of water and sewerage  services. In that year alone, I estimate that cost to be in the region of &pound;200  million.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Would that it were in my gift to decide how the Executive  will find &pound;200 million for the necessary investment in water and sewerage, but  I am afraid that it is not. It is in the gift of the entire Executive, which is  why it is an Executive decision. If there were to be any change beyond 2010-11,  the Executive must pay for that by finding the money across Departments and  services or by other means.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Given the Minister&rsquo;s answer to the  Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone Mr Elliott, will he confirm how much more  domestic customers would have paid if water charges had not been deferred?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: The average cost was some &pound;200 per household. However,  those calculations were based on what would have been paid last year and the  previous year.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Water charges had been proposed during direct rule, and  their deferral has had an impact on households, because they have not yet had  to meet those bills. It has also had an impact on the Executive, which have had  to find the money to pay for that service. We are investing about &pound;1 million a  day in necessary improvements to the water and sewerage infrastructure, which  had not received proper investment for at least 20 years. We are playing  catch-up and making substantial investments.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Households undoubtedly made financial savings as a result  of the Executive&rsquo;s decision. The Executive had to find the money to meet those  costs and must soon decide how to meet the future cost of water and sewerage  services.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dallat</strong>:  In an attempt to be positive, may I ask the Minister to look into his crystal  ball and suggest that the appointment of a new chief executive to Northern  Ireland Water shortly will replace the floods of burst pipes &mdash; and the  associated shambles &mdash; with new rainbows of hope for the future? On reflection,  will he assure Members that there will be no separate water charges?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: I look forward to the appointment of the chief  executive. The Member knows from his time on the Committee for Regional  Development that the current chairman has been acting as chief executive and,  in my view, has done a very good job.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As I said in response to the previous question, in the past  two decades, there was no investment in the water and sewerage infrastructure.  Consequently, we have a substandard system in which more than &pound;1 million a day  is being invested in improvements. During the time that it will take to improve  that system, leaks and other issues will, inevitably, arise. However, we are  making a substantial investment.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Executive must decide whether people will be billed at  all for water and sewerage services. Having covered the cost of that over the  past two years, the Executive must decide how to proceed in the future. All  other decisions will flow from that.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  am grateful for the Minister&rsquo;s confirmation that the Executive deferred water  charges before knowing how that decision would be funded.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Does the Minister believe that the Executive&rsquo;s approach to  water charges helps or hinders Northern    Ireland&rsquo;s efforts to avoid the efficiency  savings that the Chancellor is set to implement on Wednesday 22 April? In the  event that the Chancellor requests at least &pound;450 million in cuts to the Northern Ireland  block grant, does the Minister feel that the decision to forgo water charges  for two years is sustainable?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: The Executive knew that, if the cost of water were  not to be collected from households, the only other place from which that cost  could be met was from the Executive &mdash; they would have to dip into the Budget in  order to pay for that. That was quite obvious &mdash; there is no other third party  or fairy godmother to pay for all that or to improve the infrastructure to the  required standard.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Regardless of what the Treasury decides, we have our block  grant. Ahead of the return of devolution, we strongly argued about the sort of  investment that was needed here &mdash; particularly in relation to water, sewerage  and a range of other issues &mdash; to sustain the return of devolved Government. We  will continue to argue that case.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I do not think that we will make our decision based on how  we think that the Treasury may feel about us or may regard the decisions that are  taken. We have to assert our independence. Although the Treasury is responsible  for allocating the block grant, we have some dignity in being able to make our  own decisions. Were we to find that we are not able to make decisions on how we  spend the money that is allocated to us, that would present a very significant  challenge for the Executive and, perhaps, for this institution as a whole.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I look forward to hearing what the Treasury has to say, but  I certainly know that I will continue to argue for independence in our  decision-making.</p>
      <p class="H5StageHeading">Water Supply Difficulties: Ards Peninsula</p>
      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">3. <strong>Mr  Shannon </strong>asked the Minister for Regional Development whether he is aware of  water-supply difficulties in the Ards Peninsula in the past few weeks,  particularly the recent incident that left many homes without water for four to  five days; and to outline the reasons for these disruptions and what action he  is taking to ensure that this problem is fully resolved.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO2488/09>(AQO 2488/09)</a></p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: I have been advised by Northern Ireland Water that  the disruption to water supplies in the Ards Peninsula  that occurred on Saturday 21 March 2009 was caused by a major defect in the mid  Ards trunk water main, which supplies service reservoirs in the area. Problems  with air in the water-main network hindered the prompt recovery of the system.  Nevertheless, the supply was restored to the majority of customers on Monday 23  March 2009 and to the remaining customers on Tuesday 24 March 2009.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Northern Ireland Water (NIW) is currently undertaking a review  of the incident together with any other associated problems with the  water-distribution system in the area. In view of the frequency of the  interruptions to the supply, NIW is investigating the possibility of  implementing further infrastructure improvements to improve the continuity of  water supply. I asked the acting chief executive of NIW to write to the Member  when the outcome of the review is known. I express my regret and sympathy to  the people who were affected by the disruption. It is my sincere hope that that  will be the last of the problems that they encounter.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  On behalf of the people of the Ards   Peninsula, I accept the  Minister&rsquo;s apology. It was absolutely chaotic that farmers were unable to use water  to feed their cattle and sheep; that young mothers were unable to put water in  milk for their newborn babies; that elderly people were unable to make a cup of  tea; that people were unable to flush their toilets; and that they were unable  to wash, shower or wash their clothes. In the middle of all that, there was no  system whatsoever for the distribution of bottled water.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">When the taps were turned on afterwards, the water in this  bottle is the water that came out. It is not vodka, and it is not  lemon-flavoured.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I remind Mr Shannon that Members are not permitted to use visual  aids. The Member should ask a question.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  Will the Minister assure the people of the Ards Peninsula  that a system will be put in place to address the continual breakages, and that  there will be a back-up plan that will be better organised? Will he also assure  us that, in future, there will be no 50% supply of water to the houses in the Ards Peninsula,  which we have endured since Christmas?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: I accept what the Member is saying about the  difficulties that the breakdown in supply caused to the people of the Ards Peninsula.  As with any major incident that occurs, NIW carries out a review of the  effectiveness of its response. There are obviously issues regarding its  response as well as the breakdown. Any lessons that are learned should be put  to good use to ensure that subsequent responses are improved upon.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">NIW accepts that there is an ongoing problem and that major  work may be required to ensure that a disruption does not occur again. A review  is being carried out, and NIW will be in touch with the Member and any other  elected representatives in the area to inform them of the outcome.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  I will show this picture to the Minister.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Visual aids are not permitted.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  That is water that should be going through people&rsquo;s taps, and Alderman Shannon  outlined the problem. That water was on the road. Indeed, it occurred on a  dozen roads on the Ards   Peninsula. Alderman  Shannon said that the situation cannot be allowed to continue any longer. The  system must be repaired. Northern Ireland Water acknowledges that there is a  big problem, but it needs funding to improve the system so that that does not  happen again. Not only do we have to speak on behalf of the residents, but we  have to speak on behalf of businesses.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member must ask a question.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">3.15 pm</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  We are trying to encourage tourism &mdash; we have caravan parks and all sorts of  things &mdash; so we must ensure that funding is in place &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Minister, do you wish to reply to that answer? <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: Sometimes, that is a very attractive proposition. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span> Again, as I said to the previous Member who  spoke, I deeply regret what happened, and I know that NIW is looking carefully  at that, what action is required, and what action is required of it by way of  response.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member said that NIW requires money for investment, but  it already has a substantial capital budget. Of course, the company is  undertaking a significant catch-up exercise due to underinvestment over a  number of decades. Nonetheless, a substantial capital budget is available. NIW  must identify areas in which breakdowns are commonplace, and those areas must  then be given priority treatment. As I said, there is an ongoing review, and  Members will be informed of its outcomes and of the actions that will be  undertaken as a result.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Cree</strong>: I  am sorry, Mr Deputy Speaker, but I do not have any props. The Minister will be  aware of the recent water-quality scare in the greater Belfast area. Is he content that correct  procedures were adopted? Should that sort of thing happen again, will the  Minister guarantee that customer safety will be balanced against customer  convenience?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: Although customer convenience is important, customer  safety is always the number one priority. With respect to the event to which  the Member referred, an analysis was carried out on routine samples taken from  the Dunore Point water treatment works over the weekend of 11 and 12 April and  a potential quality issue was identified. It takes approximately 24 hours to  analyse samples.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Early on Tuesday 14 April, when the results suggested that  there might be a problem with water quality, NI Water, in consultation with a  consultant in communicable disease control, issued a precautionary boil-water  notice. The notice was issued through the press, media and Internet, and homes  that could potentially have been affected in the greater Belfast area and in Antrim and Down were  alerted.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Subsequent water samples, which were tested by NIW at an  independent laboratory later on Tuesday, all returned satisfactory results, and  that confirmed that the water supply was safe to drink. In consultation with  the health authorities late on Tuesday evening, the boil-water notice was  lifted. NIW staff worked through the night to remedy the problem.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Nevertheless, I have asked officials in the Drinking Water  Inspectorate to investigate why the initial analytical results were incorrect  and to identify what steps can be taken to ensure that the risk of a  reoccurrence is minimised. I sympathise with all those who were affected, and I  regret any disruption or inconvenience that the incident caused. However, I am  sure that everyone agrees that when there is even a minimal risk to the health  and well-being of the public, it is sensible to take precautions, such as  issuing a temporary boil-water notice.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I refer Members to page 85 in the Assembly Companion, which refers  to the use of visual aids. No visual aids are allowed in the Chamber.</p>
      <p class="H5StageHeading">Millennium Way, Lurgan</p>
      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">4. <strong>Mr  Moutray </strong>asked the Minister for Regional Development what priority he has  given to the completion of Millennium    Way in Lurgan.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO2489/09>(AQO  2489/09)</a></p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: As the Member may recall, in response to a previous  written question, I advised that the Malcolm    Road to Gilford    Road extension of the Millennium Way in Lurgan is one of a  number of proposed highway improvement schemes that were identified in the  &lsquo;Sub-Regional Transport Plan 2015&rsquo;. The &lsquo;Investment Delivery Plan for Roads&rsquo;  identifies funds totalling &pound;109 million over the next 10 years for those  improvements and for those in the &lsquo;Belfast  Metropolitan Transport Plan 2015&rsquo;.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">However, the funding profile in the investment strategy  does not accommodate those improvement schemes until the middle-to-late part of  the 10-year period. Work is still to be concluded on a prioritised, non-strategic  major improvement programme. Therefore, at this stage, I am not in a position  to give an indication of the priority that will be afforded to the scheme.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Moutray</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his answer, however, given that properties in Lurgan were  vested decades ago to allow for the construction of the Malcolm Road to Gilford Road link, it is disappointing  that nothing has happened. The link is vital for that part of the town, because  it will help to alleviate traffic congestion in the town centre. Given that  Lurgan has suffered economically over the past number of years, I ask the  Minister to instruct his Department to prioritise that badly-needed scheme.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: I understand what the Member said. I have been to Lurgan  to meet business people, and we discussed that key route.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I will be talking to representatives of Craigavon Borough  Council later this evening, and I am sure that the same issue will arise at  that meeting. Millennium Way will have to compete for priority &mdash; as will many  other road schemes in many other towns. The final prioritisation has not been  done, and I will bear in mind the Member&rsquo;s comments.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We informed business people in Lurgan that any potential  developer contributions would have a significant impact on the scheme. We will  keep an open mind on that in the future. Any information relating to developer  interest that emanates from the area will be taken into consideration as well.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  I note the Minister&rsquo;s comments about developers, but I do not think that such  interest is realistic in the current economic downturn. Not only is there a  long-finger approach to Millennium    Way, but is it not the case that there is a &pound;50  million shortfall in the southern division&rsquo;s budget? Given that the Minister  has met the business leaders &mdash; and considering that Millennium Way will not be completed in  the foreseeable future &mdash; will he ask his departmental officials to look at  other measures that might alleviate traffic congestion?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: All Departments balance their budgets as best they  can and prioritise according to greatest need. Therefore, there is no question  of a project being long-fingered merely for the sake of it. People want to see  the development of projects in every town in the North that I visit, and we try  to prioritise as many of them as we can.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I met people from Lurgan Forward, and they suggested a  range of traffic alleviation measures. Roads Service had further discussions  with them on those measures, and perhaps we will receive more information on  that issue this evening when we talk to councillors from Craigavon Borough  Council. However, I know that Roads Service will be willing to look at any  measures that will help the flow of traffic in and around Lurgan.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gardiner</strong>:  The Minister will be aware of Millennium    Way in Lurgan and its successful contribution to  the town, but it is not yet completed. I urge the Minister to put speed on that  and to try to ensure that it is completed as soon as possible.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">What discussions has the Minister had with the Minister of  the Environment, Sammy Wilson, in relation to planning policy statement 5 (PPS  5) and the completion of projects in the Banbridge area and other such towns?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: As I mentioned in my response to a previous question,  I am aware of the importance of Millennium    Way. I know that it is unfinished, and I  appreciate the priority that the locals want to see applied to its completion.  I have not had any discussion with the Department of the Environment (DOE)  Minister about Banbridge and PPS 5.</p>
      <p class="H5StageHeading">Fly-Posting</p>
      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">5. <strong>Mr Lunn </strong>asked  the Minister for Regional Development for an update on his policy in relation  to fly-posting.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO2490/09>(AQO 2490/09)</a></p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: The responsibility for regulating the display of  advertisements, including fly-posting, falls to the Department of the Environment.  However, inappropriate outdoor advertising has the potential to impact  significantly on road safety and the environment. Under the Roads (Northern Ireland)  Order 1993, my Department&rsquo;s Roads Service has the power to remove unlawful  advertising signs from within the curtilage of the public road.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The implementation of that policy, together with successful  prosecutions, has resulted in a reduction in the number of unlawful advertising  signs being erected within the public road boundaries, especially in the Belfast area.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Roads Service regularly removes fly-posters from its  traffic signals, street lighting and cabinets. Although district councils have  no statutory duty to remove such posters, they have the power of removal. I  understand that some councils have requested that that statutory duty be included  in the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Act, the enactment of which is  programmed for 2011.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lunn</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his answer. He will be aware of the public perception  that Roads Service is inclined to prosecute easy targets and to ignore the more  difficult cases. A church that is advertising a car boot sale is liable to get  fined before something more sinister is addressed. The Minister mentioned the  Roads (Northern Ireland)  Order 1993. Does the Minister agree that, in the future, the removal of  fly-posters should be the responsibility of the district councils, to which he  referred?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: I do not agree with the suggestion that Roads Service  targets easy prey. It is unlikely that sinister advertising will have a name  attached to it or that the name of the individual who has responsibility for  its display will be included. Not only are people putting up directional signs,  but they are putting up signs that are advertising their businesses or  promotions.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">That is not the purpose of road signage. It is supposed to  be to assist someone to find a place on the last step of his or her journey; it  is not intended to replace other directional information. People are now  putting signs up that advertise events, their business or some kind of  promotion. When such signs impinge on road safety, Roads Service has a  responsibility to take them down and fine those involved.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I recently met some MLAs, and we discussed the issue with  particular reference to rural businesses. I accept that there is a need to  discuss the policy and to talk to business organisations. The proliferation of business  signs sometimes becomes unsightly, especially in the countryside &mdash; I am more  familiar with the border area &mdash; and it has a detrimental impact on our ability  to present this place as a green land that is attractive to tourists.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There is an opportunity, and perhaps an obligation, to  address the issue. I have undertaken to talk to Roads Service about that and to  talk to business organisations about trying to manage the issue better. That  way, we should not end up fining some of the charitable people who want to  provide some useful and charitable service or event and we can deal in some way  with the increasing proliferation of signs along the roads.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  I am grateful to the Minister for his reply. Has he formed any view as to  whether he is minded to heed the representations made by those in local  government who seek greater powers over fly-posting?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: My general approach to that issue is to transfer to  local government as many powers as is sensible. Obviously, the discussions  about the review of public administration (RPA) have not concluded. I know that  during Holy Week, in the lead up to Easter, there were further discussions  about the detail of the powers that will transfer, and those discussions have  yet to be concluded. As I said, my general approach has been to be supportive  if local councils feel that they want to exercise certain powers, and if it makes  sense for those powers to transferred. I do not see any reason to stand in the  way of that.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Ramsey</strong>:  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s comments on the issue. It is a hugely important matter  that affects many towns, cities and rural areas. Fly-posting is a blight on  many communities.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The implementation of effective legislation is necessary,  and that should be done in conjunction with the Department of the Environment.  The only way to deal with the serial offenders that we are talking about &mdash; the  nightclub owners and others who consistently abuse the law &mdash; is to take them to  court and fine them. That would act as a deterrent.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: I accept what the Member says. There is an increasing  number of signs, and they become unsightly and are damaging to the environment.  They also damage our ability to promote ourselves. However, during what are  difficult economic times, we have to strike a balance when going after  businesses, fining people and taking the signs down. There are also resource  implications for Roads Service when its workers actually go out and take the  signs down and then have to chase up businesses to fine them per sign.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There is a need for a discussion about the issue, because  businesses obviously have a need to provide some sort of directional signage.  Some of them do that, particularly in rural areas. However, there is a  difference between that and advertising. At one stage, protocols were agreed.  That was certainly the case with estate agents, who probably use signs more  than any other businesses, particularly on Roads Service equipment. Those  protocols had some effect, but that seems to have drifted. It is time for  another discussion with business organisations &mdash; both rural and urban &mdash; about  signage and what we can do about it.</p>
      <p class="H5StageHeading">Regional Transportation Strategy</p>
      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">6. <strong>Mr Ford </strong>asked  the Minister for Regional Development for an update on the proposed review of  the regional transportation strategy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO2491/09>(AQO  2491/09)</a></p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: My Department has started to review the regional  transportation strategy and aims to issue a draft document for consultation in  July. It is anticipated that the review will be completed by 2010 in order to  help inform the next comprehensive spending review. As the review impacts on a  number of Departments, I have circulated a paper to the Executive. I intend, if  that paper is endorsed, to then make a statement to the Assembly.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  thank the Minister for providing the news that the review is under way. Can he  give us any indication as to the likely balance of expenditure between roads  and public transport? There are clearly needs for road improvements in many  rural areas. However, in recent years we have seen much money spent on roads in  greater Belfast,  which has added to the commuter problem rather than diminishing it.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">3.30 pm</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: There is a need for road spend in rural areas, but  there is also a need for strategic corridors connecting towns and cities, which  is part of the major road spending programme that is under way. The Member will  be aware that the majority of our public transport uses the roads; therefore,  it is not a clear case of one versus the other. Spending on the roads improves  public transport services. For example, the creation of quality bus corridors  and park-and-ride facilities allows buses and other modes of public transport  more space to move about in urban areas, which improves those services.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Having said that, I should say that, when the major routes  are completed &mdash; work on most of them is either under way, or there are plans  being advanced for their completion &mdash; the debate will shift towards the issue  of the contribution to and the reduction of emissions. I have started that  shift internally in the Department. The debate will then move on to the issue  of greater investment in public transport.</p>
      <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="6"></a>Culture, Arts And Leisure</p>
      <p class="H4StageHeading">Regional   Art Gallery</p>
      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">1. <strong>Mr  Gallagher </strong>asked the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure what plans he has  to invest in a regional art gallery.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO2506/09>(AQO  2506/09)</a></p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure (Mr Campbell)</strong>: My Department supports, in  principle, a regional art gallery. I am aware that the absence of a national  gallery is viewed by many as a significant gap in Northern Ireland&rsquo;s cultural  infrastructure. However, the necessary funding for such a facility has not been  secured under investmest strategy for Northern Ireland II. Before any decision  can be made in that regard, considerable preliminary work is required,  including the development of a feasibility study to identify, consider and cost  possible options. A business case will also have to be progressed through the  approval process.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In the development of any future plans, the Department will  work in partnership with National    Museums Northern Ireland  and the Arts Council of Northern Ireland.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  There is significant potential for increasing tourism and for boosting  confidence among our own artists. I understand what the Minister says about  funding; however, given that this is a time when those who are interested in  property should be thinking seriously about it, can the Minister give us any  idea about the cost implications of an original arts centre?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: I thank the Member for his question. The short  answer is yes. However, I hesitate to give the Member the figure for providing  such a gallery, as it represents a significant investment and has been  estimated at anywhere between &pound;30 million and &pound;70 million. A national gallery  is a strategic objective of the Arts Council and is specified as such in its  five-year strategic plan.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">From looking at the examples of other nation states and  regions, we have seen the benefits that a national or regional gallery can  bring in relation not only to tourism, as the Member rightly identified, but  also job creation. In considering which locality to invest in, inward investors  would view as an asset a national gallery of some significance, whether that is  of Guggenheim or Tate proportions or something similar. We need to think along  those lines. However, as I said in my initial response, we need to develop the  business case. The Arts Council has identified the need for such a gallery; the  task of obtaining the resources to establish it will fall to me or to my  successor.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Given the competing pressures in  his Department and the calls for funding that it faces &mdash; for example, for the  development of community arts or funding for sports facilities &mdash; how much  priority does the Minister allocate to the establishment of a regional arts  gallery?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: As I said earlier, the provision of a national  gallery is a strategic objective of the Arts Council. If the Arts Council tells  me, as Minister, that that is at the upper end of its priorities and it wants  to see provision made for that from whatever budgetary allocations that I can  obtain, it is my job to respond to that. However, speaking on a personal level  and on a level of departmental responsibility, we must seek to achieve that  objective in the shorter term, rather than in the longer term.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Having said that and returning to my original answer, I  should say that funding for any objective for which there is currently no  provision but which could require anything between &pound;30 million and &pound;70 million  is going to be difficult to obtain. However, &ldquo;difficult to obtain&rdquo; is not a  reason for not proceeding. It is an objective and a priority, and I intend to  pursue it as such.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  In the context of the creation of major exhibition space, does the Minister  have any concerns about the obvious threat to the Titanic project that is posed  by a similarly themed project based in Southampton?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: I do not have any concerns about competing  projects. The Titanic project is a particular priority; it is being pursued,  and I trust that it will be seen through to its logical conclusion. It will be  of significant benefit, not only to Belfast, but  to the whole of Northern Ireland.  Any other projects of similar scale and size or which seek to cater to similar  demographic groups should, I imagine, seek support as and where they can. I do  not draw the conclusion that the Member is, perhaps, inviting me to draw, which  is that one project should be developed at the expense of the other.</p>
      <p class="H5StageHeading">Library Authority</p>
      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">2. <strong>Mr  Shannon </strong>asked the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure whether the  establishment of the Northern Ireland Library Authority has proceeded as  planned.&nbsp; <a name=AQO2507/09>(AQO 2507/09)</a></p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: The Northern Ireland library authority  assumed responsibility for the public library service on 1 April 2009, as  planned. The chief executive is in place, senior staff positions have been  filled, new finance and IT systems have been set up, and staff have transferred  to the new authority. Work has begun on the procedures and programme for the  library authority board.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">This is a significant new era for a valuable public  service, which, henceforth, will be known as Libraries NI. I look forward to a  fruitful relationship with the library authority as we work together to develop  the service to the public and to ensure its continuing relevance in these  changing times.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  It is very important that the new library service in the Province relates to  all communities. Many people are asking &mdash; it is important that the Minister  responds to this question today &mdash; how the library service will make itself  relevant to the whole of the Province and, specifically, to the areas that have  libraries.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: I thank the Member for a very relevant question  about an authority that has been established for only the past three weeks. It  is important that the service that Libraries NI will deliver has local relevance  and importance. Its organisational structure provides for senior staff at  director and business-managerial level to be located in the areas that they  serve. Board meetings will be held throughout Northern Ireland in order to  provide opportunities for board members to visit different local libraries and  to meet staff and users. In addition, in order to ensure that the library  service takes account of local needs, it will establish four pilot local  engagement groups, which will bring together representatives of other  organisations &mdash; statutory, community and voluntary &mdash; including the local  council in each area. In due course, the library authority will also play an  active part in the community planning process.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  I am glad that I caught your eye, Mr Deputy Speaker. I am grateful to the  Minister for his earlier answers. Has he any concerns or does he see any  disadvantages arising from the separation of education and library governance  when it comes to keeping educationally relevant book collections, considering  that schoolchildren are major library users? If so, how does he intend to  address such concerns?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: The chief executive, chairperson and other  members of the Libraries NI board would be content to meet MLAs or any public  representatives who have concerns such as those outlined by the honourable  Member. My understanding is that the new authority does not have any concerns  about access to the libraries as they are envisaged.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I recommend that the honourable Member and, indeed,  everyone visit their local library. Some of the new libraries are fantastic  resources and provide access to excellent services, not just for schoolchildren  but for the wider community. I have visited a number of the new libraries, including  Bangor library,  where I launched the new authority on 2 April. I recommend that MLAs and the  wider public avail themselves of the services that libraries provide. I also  recommend that MLAs hold discussions with members of the Libraries NI board if  they have any concerns that there may be a contradiction or problem. I do not  envisage any problems, and no such issues have been raised with me prior to  today.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>:  How will the Minister ensure that there is a connection between the library authority  and schools? School libraries were always supplied by libraries in the main  library service; how will the Minister ensure that that relationship remains  for the benefit of children?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: I thank the Member for her question. I  understand that the authority is already doing that. Indeed, we had a live  video link-up with a school in the Western Board area at the authority&rsquo;s  official launch on 2 April, and a number of primary-school children took part.  The new board, its officers and members are acutely aware of the need to ensure  that schools are an integral part of the library service. They realise that a  first-class service must be provided to children of school age as well as to  adults.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Question 3 has been withdrawn.</p>
      <p class="H5StageHeading">Community Development Through the Arts</p>
      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">4. <strong>Mr A  Maskey </strong>asked the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure what support the  Arts Council provides to organisations not previously engaged with the arts to  encourage community development through arts.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO2509/09>(AQO  2509/09)</a></p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: The Arts Council recognises the important  contribution that the arts can make to community development. That is  demonstrated by the support and funding that the Arts Council provides for a  number of community-focused arts programmes including Re-imaging Communities,  the small grants programme and Start Up. The Arts Council actively seeks to  target and engage with new audiences and to increase participation in the arts;  that is a central theme of its five-year strategy.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Arts Council has provided &pound;2&middot;71 million of funding  between 2004-05 and 2008-09 through the Awards For All programme. Through that  programme, the Arts Council has directly sought to increase community-based  arts activities and improve access to the arts among the most disadvantaged  communities. The programme has recently been re-launched as the small grants  programme, and &pound;500,000 will be made available in 2009-10.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Re-imaging Communities programme was launched in 2006, and  &pound;3&middot;8 million has been made available through it to date. That programme aims to  help people to feel part of the community in which they live by using art as a  vehicle to enhance the physical and natural environment and remove displays of  sectarian aggression and intimidation. Last December, an evaluation of the  programme found that only 18% of organisations that had received funding had  previous experience of arts-related work.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Arts Council administered the &pound;100,000 Start Up  programme in 2007-08. That programme sought to provide support to organisations  that had not previously availed themselves of Arts Council funding. The Arts  Council has allocated a further &pound;50,000 in the current year for a similar  seed-funding programme to encourage community groups to initiate arts  programmes.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maskey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for that  pretty comprehensive response. Can he provide information on any specific  methodology that the Arts Council might use to address areas of social need,  for example?</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">3.45 pm</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: I refer the Member to the Arts Council, which  has responsibility for that matter. In my response to the Member, I made the  relevant point that we found that the current Re-imaging Communities programme  ascertained only three months ago that fewer than a fifth of the organisations that  had received funding stated that they had previous experience in arts-related  work. By and large, a lot of that programme work is done in areas of  socio-economic deprivation. However, only 18% of the communities that had  availed themselves of the funding indicated that they had previous experience  in that type of work. That is an indication of the type of success that has  been attained.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Through the Arts Council, we must try to ensure that there  is improved access to and delivery of the programmes in the local communities  so that they can move away from the manifestations of violence that exist in  some working-class areas. Thankfully, those communities want to work themselves  away from those. We need to support them, and the Arts Council is not averse to  ensuring that that is the case.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Spratt</strong>:  The Minister provided statistics on the Arts Council and funding. Will he  reiterate how much funding will be made available during 2009-2010 to encourage  community development through the arts?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: It is important that we ensure that people  understand the extent of the efforts that are being made to ensure that  community development through the arts is a success. The Re-imaging Communities  programme has a budget of &pound;600,000 for 2009-10, and &pound;500,000 will be made  available through the Arts Council&rsquo;s small grants programme. The Arts Council  will make a further &pound;50,000 available through a seed-funding programme that encourages  community groups to initiate arts programmes.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Those amounts may seem reasonably small, but we can judge  their success in the communities that have availed themselves of them by  looking at how they have helped to transform those areas. Previously, even up  to two or three years ago, there would have been manifestations of violence,  murder and intimidation on gable walls, but much of that has been replaced by murals  and arts programmes that manifest the background, history and culture of the  communities but without the violence. That is a mark of the success of those  programmes. I have given details of the amounts of money that go into them, and  I hope to replicate them year on year to ensure greater success in the future.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Ba mhaith liom a fhiafra&iacute; den  Aire an n-aonta&iacute;onn s&eacute; liom go n-imr&iacute;onn na heala&iacute;ona tionchar an-l&aacute;idir &mdash; agus  dea-thionchar &mdash; ar dhaoine de gach aois a bh&iacute;onn p&aacute;irteach iontu; agus go  n-imr&iacute;onn na daoine sin f&eacute;in dea-thionchar ar na pobail ina bhfuil siad ina  gc&oacute;na&iacute; iontu? An n-aonta&iacute;onn an tAire liom, mar sin, gur fi&uacute; agus gur ceart  tuilleadh infheist&iacute;ochta a chur isteach in eala&iacute;ona pobail?</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Does the Minister agree that, from the point of view of  personal development, the arts provide a powerful and positive influence on  those in the community who participate in them? Those people in turn exercise a  positive influence in their own communities, and in some cases that leads to a  flowering of those communities. Does the Minister agree that community arts  warrant being an even higher investment priority?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: Yes.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Question 5 has been withdrawn.</p>
      <p class="H5StageHeading">Violence at Sports Grounds</p>
      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">6. <strong>Mr  McCarthy </strong>asked the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure how his Department  monitors violence at sports grounds.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO2511/09>(AQO  2511/09)</a></p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: The Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure is  not responsible for monitoring violence at sports grounds. Violence involving  spectators is a reserved matter and is the responsibility of the Northern  Ireland Office. Violence involving players at sports grounds is a disciplinary  issue for clubs and sports governing bodies.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his reply. Does he agree that the delay in the  introduction of the Football (Offences) Act 1991 is hindering games taking  place &mdash; regardless of the venue &mdash; without violence being perpetrated against  anyone?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: I am cognisant of the issues that surround the  Member&rsquo;s question. It is only a few months since we saw evidence of violence in  a Northern Ireland sport stadium on what was, it has to be said, a very rare  occasion. However, when violence does occur, it can be serious. To that end, my  officials have had meetings with NIO officials, and, recently, I met Mr Paul  Goggins MP, the NIO Minister with responsibility for that issue. I am content  that he appreciates the need for progress, and I am in correspondence with him.  I trust that we will shortly be in a position to make even speedier progress in  order to get a satisfactory resolution so that firm and effective action can be  taken against those who perpetrate such activities.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCartney</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Ba mhaith liom mo bhu&iacute;ochas a  thabhairt don Aire as an fhreagra sin.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the Minister for his answer. Will he have  discussions with football and other sports bodies about earlier kick-offs to  offset any potential for violence outside sports stadiums?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: In other parts of the UK, for matches that rate highly  for potential difficulties, earlier kick-offs have ensured that problems have  been minimised if not eliminated. We all know what we are talking about: less  time during the day for alcohol to be consumed. The more time that there is to  consume alcohol before a major game, the greater the chance of difficulties,  problems and, on a few very rare occasions, violence. Therefore, the earlier  the kick-off, the more likely it is that people will be prevented from doing  that. Those are issues that the governing bodies must resolve, because they  decide the kick-off times. That is usually done in conjunction with the police,  particularly for higher-profile games. I hope that that will continue and,  where earlier kick-offs are required, I suggest that they be availed of.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  The Minister told us that violence at sports grounds is not his responsibility.  However, does he accept that well-designed stadiums and venues play a  significant role in health and safety? Given that his Department will be  involved in the refurbishment of many leading sports venues, has he issued any  guidance on that matter to the appropriate authorities?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: The Member raises two separate issues. First,  there is the issue of a statutory provision to deal with those who engage in  activities that all of us would regard as illegal and violent; that is the  responsibility of the NIO. Secondly, there is the issue of the responsibility  for stadia provision. We have to ensure not only that, where possible, we have  the safety and comfort of spectators uppermost in our minds but that those  stadia &mdash; where large numbers of people are involved &mdash; are constructed in such a  way as to make it exceptionally difficult for anyone to engage in illegal  activity. We are examining that issue, and I hope to be able to make some  progress on safety at sports stadia in the not too distant future.</p>
      <p class="H5StageHeading">Ulster  Scots: Underfunding</p>
      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">7. <strong>Mr  Moutray </strong>asked the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure to detail the total  level of underfunding of Ulster Scots compared with Irish, over the past 10 years.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO2512/09>(AQO 2512/09)</a></p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: Since the inception of the North/South Language  Body in 2000, the amount of funding provided to the Ulster-Scots Agency and  Foras na Gaeilge by my Department has been based on approved actions in the  agencies&rsquo; business plans together with associated staffing costs. Since 2000,  approximately &pound;44 million has been allocated to Irish language projects and  initiatives, and &pound;16 million has been allocated to Ulster-Scots projects and  initiatives. That includes funding to Ulster-Scots organisations and projects,  such as the Ulster-Scots Agency and the Ulster-Scots academy implementation  group.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Funding for Irish-language projects refers to Foras na  Gaeilge, Colmcille, the Irish-language broadcast fund and the Gaeltacht  Quarter. The figures do not include funding that is available from departmental  mainstream programmes for projects that may have an Irish or Ulster-Scots  language or cultural dimension that cannot be separated from the primary  funding objective.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Moutray</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his response. Does he see parity of funding as being  critically important to the development of Ulster-Scots heritage, culture and  language?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: I am grateful for the Member&rsquo;s posing a  supplementary question that allows me to develop the theme of funding in the  two instances. I outlined the funding that had been made over the past eight  years, which indicated a disproportionate investment in Ulster Scots of only  &pound;16 million, while &pound;44 million was spent on the Irish language. However, in the  past three years the funding allocation from my Department for Ulster Scots has  almost doubled from &pound;1&middot;5 million to &pound;2&middot;9 million. In the same period, the  funding allocation from my Department to Irish has increased from &pound;6&middot;4 million  to &pound;6&middot;8 million, an increase of 6%. There is some considerable way to go to get  the parity that is required.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In other contexts, members of some political parties talk  about the long term. I assure them and the honourable Member that I am in this  for the long term and that the imbalance will be rectified. The disparity is  not sustainable, and it cannot be defended, argued for or renegotiated. We are  working to eliminate the disparity, and we have made significant progress. I  intend to continue, and I hope that I will have the support of all honourable  Members for eliminating that disadvantage.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brolly</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Given the relatively higher status  of the Irish language under the European Charter for Regional or Minority  Languages and the obviously greater level of participation and interest in the  Irish language here, the Minister is incorrect in describing the relative  amounts of funding as an imbalance. In fact, Sinn F&eacute;in contends that, because  of that status and level of participation and interest, funding to the Irish  language is not proportionate.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: I thank the Member for his supplementary  question. However, I am afraid that all that the question does is attempt to  defend the indefensible. That cannot be done. The status of Irish and Ulster  Scots is clear. Under the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages,  the Irish language is in category 3, and Ulster Scots is in category 2. My aim  and objective is to ensure that Ulster Scots attains the same level that the  Irish language has. It could well be argued by Ulster-Scots groups &mdash; I hope  that it is &mdash; that, in order to attain that status, they need additional  funding, not less funding.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">4.00 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that the honourable Member and those who believe in  and support his view re-examine their position on the matter, just as they have  had to re-examine their position in other contexts. To discriminate against  Ulster Scots is indefensible and will not be tolerated by my Department. I  intend to ensure that parity is achieved. I hope and expect that I will get  support for that parity from all honourable Members.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>:  Does the Minister not agree that although Irish and Ulster Scots each has a  valid place, each has quite a distinct profile as regards its use and historic  body of literature, and that, therefore, simple equation of the number and  types of projects is simply not a sound policy?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: It never ceases to amaze me that whenever  nationalists put forward arguments for equality in different contexts, they  simply demand it and dismiss as irrelevant all subject matter that attempts to  explain why inequality exists. When the tables are turned, however, and  inequality is absolutely apparent, even to a blind man on a galloping horse,  they attempt to say that it is a different matter. It is not different.  Equality will be obtained and achieved. If people do not like that, it is their  tough luck.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: That concludes questions to the Minister. I ask Mr Shannon to  remove the exhibition, as it is no longer required.</p>
      <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="7"></a>Private Notice Question</p>
      <p class="H4StageHeading">Job Losses in Manufacturing Industry</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>My Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Speaker has received a private notice question, in accordance  with Standing Order 20, to the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment. I advise  the House that, generally, when dealing with a private notice question, only  the Member who tabled the question and the Chairperson or Deputy Chairperson of  the relevant Committee is called. However, given the issue&rsquo;s importance, the  Speaker has agreed that each party will be given the opportunity to ask a  supplementary question.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText"><span class="BoldText">Mr Attwood</span> asked the Minister  of Enterprise, Trade and Investment to provide an update on the loss of jobs at  Visteon, Shorts/Bombardier, FG Wilson, Nortel and other companies; and on what  steps are being taken by her Department to protect the rights of workers and  the manufacturing base in Northern Ireland respectively.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Enterprise, Trade and Investment (Mrs Foster)</strong>: From the outset, I want to  reiterate that the job losses that have been announced during the past few  weeks by Bombardier, Nortel, FG Wilson and, of course, Visteon are a matter of  great regret. My thoughts remain with the employees and families who are  affected.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Coming so close together, those announcements underline the  impact of the global recession on Northern Ireland and illustrate how  much market conditions have worsened during the past few months. I met  Bombardier to hear and understand at first hand the reasons behind its  redundancies. I am due to have a further meeting with the company&rsquo;s senior  management at the beginning of next week.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Invest NI is currently engaging with FG Wilson in respect  of significant training and R&amp;D initiatives which offer opportunities to  redeploy and retrain skilled labour as an alternative to redundancies. The  company is also developing a comprehensive training plan for Invest Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  consideration, the focus of which will be on enhancing FG Wilson&rsquo;s skill base  to ensure that its products and processes remain amongst the most competitive  in the world.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In the case of Visteon, trade union officials from Unite  continue to discuss the current situation with the corporation. I have had  useful meetings with trade union representatives since the closure &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. The Minister has the Floor. Members must resume their  seats. I am sorry to interrupt your remarks, Minister.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: I have had useful meetings with trade union representatives  since the closure of the factory was announced.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In respect of Nortel Networks, Invest NI continues to meet  and communicate regularly with both the company&rsquo;s administrators and its  management. Speculation continues that Nortel may be able to attract interest  in the sale of its core wireless-equipment business to other major blue-chip  companies. We are also, therefore, working to ensure that we can promote fully  the Monkstown campus&rsquo;s capabilities to take advantage of any new foreign direct  investment (FDI) opportunities that may arise.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Unfortunately, in the majority of those cases, redundancies  have been a necessary evil and have been made in order to protect the long-term  interests and employment potential of major local operations, with Visteon,  obviously, being the one to which that does not apply.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The employment rights of workers who have been made  redundant by their employers are set out in the Employment Rights (Northern Ireland)  Order 1996, which is, as Members will be aware, the responsibility of the  Department for Employment and Learning (DEL).</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">If those workers feel that their rights have been breached  in the execution of those redundancies, they can avail themselves of the  services of their trade union, employee legal representatives or the Labour  Relations Agency and seek the appropriate advice and guidance that could,  ultimately, lead to redress through an industrial tribunal. The interpretation  and application of employment law is, ultimately, the role of the chairmen of  the industrial tribunals and fair-employment tribunals, who are members of the  independent judiciary appointed by the Lord Chief Justice.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is important that we continue to protect our  manufacturing business base and ensure that when market conditions improve, Northern Ireland  businesses are well placed to capitalise rapidly. Collaboration is a necessity,  and I am working closely with my colleague the Minister for Employment and  Learning to identify, as a matter of urgency, any new policies and schemes that  could be introduced within the powers and resources that are available to the  Executive. That work focuses on the provision of practical support and advice  as well as implementing training and reskilling programmes and assistance.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As Members may be aware, I recently announced the  establishment of a manufacturing advisory group as a subgroup of the Economic  Development Forum (EDF). Trade unions suggested that idea to me recently, and  it has received broad support from other members of the EDF. I can announce  today that Mark Nodder, managing director of Wrightbus, has agreed to chair  that subgroup, and work is currently under way to develop the terms of  reference and agree membership. Those arrangements should be in place in the  very near future, and I expect the first meeting to be held shortly.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">On an international scale, the Government continue to take  action to bring stability to the financial markets on which all businesses  depend. We are in constant dialogue with business about how to alleviate the  current difficulties. However, people must realise that there is no easy fix  and that the measures will take time to have an effect.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  I thank the Minister for her presence this afternoon, and I acknowledge that,  during the recent difficult weeks, she has been available in person and by  phone. Given that Ford and its subsidiary Visteon have benefited from millions  of pounds of grant aid over many years for operations in Northern Ireland,  does she consider it unacceptable for Visteon to get up, go, and close its  doors? It is a slap in the face for the company&rsquo;s workers, who, during many  difficult years, always turned up to work for Ford in this part of the North.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, is she concerned that the actions of Visteon  and Ford, in denying their obligations to workers and by setting up subsidiary  companies, could become a model for other international companies that operate  in Northern Ireland  and which might do likewise in the future? Finally, what contact has the  Minister, and other levels of Government, had with Ford in America in order to ensure that Ford and Visteon  honour their obligations to the 200-odd workers in west Belfast?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: I thank the Member for his supplementary question. I had useful  meetings with SDLP and Sinn F&eacute;in delegations about the issues that the Member  mentioned. I heard, at first hand, how hurt the workers felt about their  treatment by the management of Visteon, which, rather than announce the news  themselves, left that task to the administrators. I empathise with the workers&rsquo;  feelings. However, we must now consider ways to help those people.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I have made several attempts to speak to Ford in Europe &mdash; I forget the gentleman&rsquo;s name &mdash; but have,  unfortunately, been unable to connect with him. I will continue to try to  contact him about issues that are within my remit. I encouraged trade union  representatives to continue to seek legal advice and to continue to work with  their unions. Furthermore, I urged them to look to their contract, which they  showed to me, particularly the element that said that their conditions would  mirror those of their Ford counterparts &mdash; I think that that was the term that  was used. I understand that Unite continues to engage with Visteon and Ford,  and Government will continue to monitor the situation and do what we can.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Enterprise,  Trade and Investment (Mr Durkan)</strong>: I thank the Minister for the details that  she has outlined in answer to the question. The Committee for Enterprise, Trade and Investment recognises  that these are serious difficulties for any Minister to have to confront at the  rate at which events have unfolded in recent times.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Minister indicate whether she is content with the  degree of economic intelligence available to her and her Department in advance  of some developments, and whether she is looking at ways of improving the  advance warning that the Department might have? What other interventions are  she and her Department looking at in trying to ensure more effective support  for firms and workforces that face such situations? Is she considering  relaxations of specific EU state-aid rules in order to allow us to help in ways  that have been ruled out in the past and to restore some of the supports that  were available in the past?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: I thank the Chairman for the points he has made. In relation to  the first of those issues, I am satisfied with the economic intelligence  available insofar as it goes. However, some of the companies involved &mdash; I am  thinking of Bombardier in particular &mdash; are quoted on stock exchanges, and we do  not have the information as quickly as we would like, but we understand why  that is so. The information is provided to my Department as quickly as it  possibly can in the circumstances. To be fair to all of the companies &mdash; Nortel,  Bombardier and the other company &mdash; they have all been in constant contact with  my Department, and are working with us. They are trying to find ways of  reskilling their people as an alternative to redundancies.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I had a useful meeting with the Minister for Employment and  Learning last week, and we are looking at ways to refocus on the provision of  practical support for those people who find themselves in difficulties, and for  those companies that are economically viable in the medium to long term, but  are facing short-term difficulties. Those are the companies with which we need  to work, in order to find ways in which to keep those people on board in the  short term. The Minister for Employment and Learning and I hope to make an  announcement in relation to those issues in the near future.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  I join with the Minister and others in expressing my concern at the job losses,  particularly those at Bombardier Shorts, which most directly affect my  constituency and constituents. Does the Minister agree with me that those job  losses underscore the importance of the CSeries project? Given the importance  of the manufacturing sector to the Northern Ireland economy despite these job  losses, can the Minister confirm that she, her Department, the Executive and  Invest Northern Ireland remain committed to the manufacturing sector in  Northern Ireland, and will she outline how that commitment is manifested?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: In relation to Bombardier, the CSeries project is on schedule.  My Department and I are working closely with the company to make sure that that  new, highly technological development that is taking place here in Belfast goes ahead. There  was some confusion in some of the media reports of the Bombardier job losses  that they were in some way linked to the CSeries project; they are not. The  jobs that will be lost at Bombardier are as a result of the current global  recession, and Bombardier has revised its current aircraft production rates  downwards. That has nothing to do with the development of the CSeries; in fact,  the CSeries development shows that the company is looking to the future. It is  providing a new aircraft that will be fit for purpose for the latter half of  the twenty-first century. We should take that as a sign that the company is  here, and is here to stay.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Indeed, FG Wilson confirmed today in a statement that it  remains absolutely committed to its plants in Northern Ireland, and refuted any  allegations to the contrary. Those companies are here in Northern Ireland, and want to stay in Northern Ireland,  because they know the value of the workforce and the skills base here.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">However, those companies are facing a short-term downturn.  The Government must find ways to help them, which is why I am having talks with  the Minister for Employment and Learning, in the hope that we can bring forward  a package to help the manufacturing sector in particular, which, as we know,  lost 2% of its base in just one week. That was a huge hit, and we must provide  a rapid response that will help the manufacturing sector.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">4.15 pm</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Maskey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat. We hear that the administrators are trying to take action  against the Visteon workers to remove them from the site. Perhaps the  Minister&rsquo;s Department could look at clawing back some of the money that Invest  NI gave to Visteon over the years. We should send out a clear message of  support for the workers in the Ford Visteon plant in west Belfast in the hope  that the administrators will call off their attempt to remove them. Dialogue is  the only way forward in this case, and Sinn F&eacute;in urges that.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Gerry Adams MP, along with other colleagues and the  Minister, met the Visteon employees to discuss the situation at the plant. That  situation is a massive blow to west Belfast  and other areas. However, it is easier to sustain existing jobs than to create  new ones. On that basis, what is the Minister&rsquo;s Department doing to sustain  existing jobs and create new jobs? Go raibh maith agat.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Enterprise,  Trade and Investment</strong>: I hear what the Member says about the administrators  at Visteon, and I agree that dialogue is the way to sort out those  difficulties. He referred to clawback: Invest NI provided Visteon with  financial assistance in 2003 for the development of a fuel rail, and of that  offer, &pound;97,210 was paid. In that instance, the letter of offer contained  clauses to protect our investment, and clawback will be invoked if we feel that  there is a need for it. Having looked at the situation briefly, it appears that  that will be the case.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As regards what the Department is doing to sustain jobs, I  hope that the Member understands that my talks with the Minister for Employment  and Learning are based on practical issues, and on supporting economically  viable firms that may not be able to sustain jobs in the short term. I hope  that we will able to do something about that in the short term.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We will continue to look for new jobs and new foreign  direct investment (FDI). I met Invest NI international staff this morning in Belfast and I told them  that this is a good place in which to do business because of our skills levels  and our people. We still need investment from abroad, and there is a need to go  out and sell Northern    Ireland as a place to invest in. Although I  totally agree with the Member about sustaining jobs, there is also a need to  look for new FDI.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>:  I thank the Minister for her replies up to now. She will recall that I have  spoken to her and written to her, and to Sir Reg Empey, expressing my concerns  about looming job losses. Unfortunately, we are now dealing with real job  losses. Retraining and upskilling will work in some instances, but the approach  of some employers has been less than helpful, and we heard about examples of  that from other Members. What can the Minister and the Executive do to continue  to pursue management to ensure not only that they respond to the positive moves  that she is making through the Executive, but to value the work, skill and  loyalty that has been put in over the years by existing workforces?</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We must retain those workforces; we must ensure that firms  survive the economic downturn and that the workforce is there to give the Northern Ireland  economy the lift that it is going to need at some point in the future. Will the  Minister assure the House that those issues are being considered and will be  addressed?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Enterprise,  Trade and Investment</strong>: I thank the Member for his question. He is absolutely  right; there is only so much that Government can do. I hope that Sir Reg Empey  and I will be able to offer packages in the near future, but employers must  play their part and, as part of those packages, offer retraining and reskilling  to their staff.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">That is a big commitment for them. However, indigenous  employers in particular have told me that they want to retain their staff.  William Wright of Wrightbus said that the redundancies that he announced some  time ago were the first that he had ever had to make. That is a big wrench for  someone of his standing.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We will certainly work with employers. We will tell them  that they have a responsibility to the community &mdash; as I said, most of them take  that responsibility seriously &mdash; and that we want them to work with the  Executive so that we can keep people in their jobs in the short term. By doing  so, those firms will be ready when the upturn comes, in the medium to long  term. In fact, this represents an opportunity for employers to provide their  staff with new skills and training, and we hope that they will see it as such.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Neeson</strong>: I  thank the Minister for her reply, and I acknowledge her efforts in dealing with  the problems that have arisen. As the Minister knows, many of the people whom  the job losses have affected live in east Antrim. I, therefore, have a personal  interest in what is happening.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">First, is the Minister satisfied with all the work that  Invest NI is doing to deal with the problem? Secondly, can more be done to  assist research and development, the creation of new products and the  development of further overseas markets?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: I am glad that the Member mentioned a number of issues. He is  absolutely right: we need to raise a number of issues with those firms. That is  exactly what we are doing with companies such as FG Wilson. Invest NI has  engaged with FG Wilson on training and on new research and development  initiatives, and to help it to find new markets for its goods. That is the type  of work that we are doing with those companies.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">FG Wilson is considering a number of offers of R&amp;D  support, and we hope that we will have several R&amp;D projects with the  company in the near future. That demonstrates FG Wilson&rsquo;s willingness to do  work in Northern Ireland and  its commitment to Northern    Ireland, which it spoke about in the press  today. I have no doubt that it wants to keep its staff in place, as do the  other companies, apart from Visteon. Bombardier Shorts and Nortel are here for  the long term, and we want to work with them to ensure that they can stay for  the long term.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Purvis</strong>: I  thank the Minister for her answers so far. I also thank her for her focus on  securing and developing the manufacturing base in Northern Ireland. More than 2,000  job losses have been announced in the past month, the majority of which are from  companies in my constituency, including Bombardier Shorts and Hughes  Christensen.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">First, what use is being made of the EU globalisation fund  to reskill and retrain those people who face redundancy? Secondly, apart from  clawback, will the Minister clarify what lessons can be learned about the  investment money that Invest NI gave to firms for research and development?  Products that are researched and developed in Northern Ireland should also be  produced here, and not moved out by companies, a point to which other Members  referred.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: The latter issue is a difficult one, because it is only when a  company moves research and development to another country that one realises  that is what exactly it was planning to do. However, we will continue to apply  due-diligence tests to the amount of money that we give to those companies in  order to ensure that they remain in Northern Ireland.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Concerns have been raised with me about the use of research  and development money in Visteon, and the fact that that money went to South Africa to  develop a product that is now being used there. Obviously, that is of great  concern to us, and we will pursue clawback, if that is the procedure that we  need to use.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We have looked into whether we can avail ourselves of the  EU globalisation fund. Unfortunately, however, the scale of the job losses in Northern Ireland  is not huge in European terms.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Such job losses are not considered huge in European terms:  that would entail the loss of tens of thousands as opposed to thousands of  jobs. We have looked at the EU globalisation adjustment fund, but I am afraid  that it does not appear that we can avail of it. That is not to say that we  will not continue to engage with Europe.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Earlier, the Chairperson of the Committee for Enterprise, Trade and  Investment said that we should consider relaxing some state-aid rules. We are  doing that, and I apologise for not responding to that earlier. We are engaging  with Europe and are looking at ways in which  we can be more creative with our schemes, and we hope to be able to say  something about that in the near future.</p>

      <p class="H4StageHeading">Childcare Strategy</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Debate resumed on amendment to motion:</p>
      <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly expresses its concern at the lack of  availability of affordable, quality childcare; and calls on the Executive to  implement a coherent and properly resourced childcare strategy. <span class="Italic">[Ms J McCann]</span></p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic"><span class="Italic">Which amendment was:</span></p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">After the first &ldquo;childcare&rdquo; insert</p>
      <p class="Q3Motion">&ldquo;and the lack of provision for people who require flexible  arrangements to allow them to avail of working opportunities in the evenings,  overnight and at weekends, particularly in the current economic climate&rdquo; <span class="Italic">[Ms Purvis]</span></p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Moutray</strong>:  I welcome the opportunity to take part in the debate today. Childcare is a  pertinent issue that requires due attention from the Executive and from the  Assembly as a whole. It is important that we reflect on the Programme for  Government and that the Executive placed our economy at the heart of it.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The lack of affordable quality childcare will continue to  hamper economic growth and prosperity. If we do not address the issue, we will  widen the gap for parents, particularly women, who seek to return to education  or employment. Although such a strategy will cost the taxpayer a considerable  amount initially in the provision of affordable childcare, the cost will be  clawed back, as the provision of childcare will enable parents to return to  work or education.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">My constituency of Upper Bann, particularly my home town of  Lurgan, has  been economically deprived for some years. Better childcare funding would  improve Lurgan&rsquo;s economy, as it would encourage parents back into employment  and learning. Childcare services not only benefit children by improving their  lives and social skills, they generate economic benefits by supporting parents  in moving to work, education and training.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Childcare is an essential part of today&rsquo;s society, whether  it takes the form of childminders, out-of-school nursery clubs, day nurseries  or playschools. However, it needs direction. It is important that the House  recognise that childcare services are needed not only for young children but  for those of school age. We continue to promote lifelong learning and endeavour  to reduce unemployment, particularly in the current climate; therefore, a high  standard of local childcare facilities is essential.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Employers for Childcare charity said that no one  Department is accountable for the provision of funding; that reinforces the  need for the Executive to adopt a multi-faceted approach. Like my colleagues, I  call on the Minister of Education to address the issue and the need for  childcare beyond pre school places. The Education Minister has a key role to  play, and she has shied away from this issue for too long. She has not given  priority to early-years learning, and I call on her to act on this debate and  to prioritise the matter.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It would be remiss of me not to mention that, as the  Northern Ireland Childminding Association said:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Childminding provides care and learning for children  aged between 0 &ndash; 14 years.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is important that we do not fall into the trap of  thinking that childminding stops at four or five when a child starts school.  Childcare is often needed for after-school hours to meet the work patterns of  parents in this very different society. That is an important factor that needs  to be addressed in the strategy.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Many valid points were raised in the Chamber today, and it  has been demonstrated that there is a need for better and more childcare  provision across the Province. There is a need for a strategic, coherent,  long-term, cross-departmental solution. I support the motion.</p>
      <p class="B3SpeakerinChair">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr Dallat] in the Chair)</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">4.30 pm</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  I give a warm welcome to the motion and the amendment. Unfortunately, I and  many in this Chamber have listened for many years to the issues surrounding  quality affordable childcare. We have heard much in this Assembly about the  economy being at the heart of the Programme of Government, and, although it may  not be totally obvious, the economy is at the heart of this motion and the  debate on it.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The provision of childcare is something that we need to  develop and that needs to be progressed as part of the Programme for Government.  Any investments in childcare will be repaid in the form of economic and social  development. Such investment should, therefore, be included with the economy as  a top priority for the Executive. That would help to progress not only the  economy but affordable quality childcare, and vice versa. The two work very  much in tandem.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Work must be available for those who want and/or need it,  and those who want to work must be brought back into a working environment.  That would be a start in achieving equality and getting more parents back to  work, and I must put on record that I am pleased that some employers now have  much more flexible working arrangements. Unfortunately, that is not the case  with all employers, but a lot of employers now provide a flexibility in working  arrangements that is vital for many parents.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Once parents find work, the next issue that they face is of  finding quality, affordable childcare. I know that it has been mentioned, but,  coming from the rural community of Fermanagh and South Tyrone, I must touch on  the rural aspect of the childcare issue. The issue is particularly acute in  rural areas, as they have a dispersed population, less-developed  infrastructure, a lack of public transport and a reliance on using cars. That  means that limited and isolated childcare provision can have a particularly  devastating impact on the families, individuals and children living in those  areas.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the Minister of Agriculture and Rural  Development&rsquo;s rural development programme and the establishment of the rural  childcare programme as part of her Department&rsquo;s anti-poverty strategy. However,  there is still a real need for improvement in that area, and a joined-up  approach between Departments is vital. I believe that it was Mr O&rsquo;Dowd who  earlier explained some of the importance of that. There are areas in which, if  Departments worked together, the situation could very easily be improved. For  example, in the area of education, it may be possible to improve transport to  schools or the transport that is available for children who need to go to  childcare facilities, perhaps directly from school.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I want to ensure that Members are aware that childcare is  not simply about a place for parents to leave their children when they go to  work. That is important, but childcare is about much more. The early years are  a vital and essential time for the development of children, particularly those  aged from 0 to six years and even older. That is why the quality of childcare  is absolutely vital.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We in the Assembly have waited far too long for an early  years strategy. For many months, we have heard that such a strategy is coming  and is soon going to happen. I was told quite recently that it is now imminent.  I truly hope that it is imminent, and that it comes forward sooner rather than later.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  The Member referred to quality childcare. Does the Member agree that childcare  is about much more than child-minding; that it is, in fact, one of the basic  building blocks in the education system; and that those involved in childcare should  have the best qualifications available? Does the Member further agree that a  transformation fund, similar to that operating in England, is an appropriate  way to enhance the expertise of those involved in the childcare workforce here?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  I thank Mr Bradley for those comments. Of course, I agree with his sentiments,  which are very close to my heart. Obviously, child-minding is an essential part  of childcare, but it is also about child development, and it is in that respect  that I hope that the early years strategy will resolve at least some of the  issues that have been debated today.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I also hope that the strategy will not sit on a shelf  gathering dust for years without being progressed and implemented. We heard  earlier about all the consultation documents. The issue has been consulted to  death, and what we want is action. We want affordable, quality childcare for  parents who need it.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In England  and Wales,  the decision has been taken that, where there are gaps in the market, local  government should be responsible for plugging the hole and providing adequate,  quality, affordable childcare. We need to think seriously about the possibility  of replicating such provision, tailored to our own needs in Northern Ireland,  and, failing that, the Government need to develop a strategy to intervene in  the failed market. Many charities and other non-profit organisations would be  capable of stepping into the breach if they were resourced more fully and  appropriately by the Executive and by councils.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: I  declare an interest as a member of Horizon Sure Start in Carrickfergus and  Larne. I, too, support the motion and the amendment.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As other Members have said, there have been many childcare  strategy documents over the years. In 1999, there was the Department of  Health&rsquo;s review of Children First, and, in 2007, the Committee for the Office  of the First Minister and deputy First Minister raised the issue in its  investigation into child poverty.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The key words in today&rsquo;s motion are that it is now time to:</p>
      <p class="Q1Quote">&ldquo;implement a coherent and properly resourced childcare  strategy.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">It is not just about producing a fancy document; it  is time to actually deliver something. In fact, it is past time. There have  been too many theoretical documents; it is now time to do something on the  ground.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As I said in an earlier intervention, there was a funding  mechanism in place, and that was the Executive programme fund for children.  However, our former Finance Minister &mdash; who is now First Minister &mdash; decided to  bring that to an end in order to improve efficiency and effectiveness. Members  are aware of the gaps that have been left in their constituencies, because the  reality is that the funding mechanism that has replaced it has not been  working. Supposedly, Departments were to pick up the projects and continue to  fund them, but, clearly, that has not been successful.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I suspect that that is the case because children&rsquo;s issues  and childcare issues are cross-cutting in nature, and they do not affect only  one Department. Therefore, when Departments prioritise their funding, childcare  issues do not come top of the list. Therefore, funding applications have not  been as successful as they would otherwise have been if there had been a  mechanism in place to prioritise the overall benefits to several Departments.  Other Members have also mentioned that issue.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I wish to specifically mention a Skool&rsquo;s Out project in my  constituency. A relatively small amount of seed money has enabled that project  to provide a successful breakfast club and after-school club. It has been  living piecemeal. However, in an area of need, it has delivered one of the  objectives of the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister:  improved community relations. The project is based in an area that has had a  troubled past, yet the children, parents and the management committee come from  a cross-community background, and it has contributed to greatly improved  community relations in the area.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In respect of community regeneration, that area suffered  from houses having to be knocked down because of antisocial elements and other  difficulties. Therefore, the project is actually contributing to regeneration  in the area &mdash; a DSD function.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">A major benefit of such clubs is the educational output of  homework clubs that assist children in educational attainment. After tabling a  question on that matter, it appears to me that that is a key responsibility of  the Department of Education. However, equally, our junior Ministers are  responsible for children and young people&rsquo;s issues. Either way, the Executive  are responsible, and we do not wish to push the problem from pillar to post. We  need a resolution.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There is also a health impact in respect of providing good  childcare, and the education that comes with it. Therefore, there is a role for  the Department of Health.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">At a recent Investing for Health conference in Northern Ireland, the Chief Medical Officer for Scotland  indicated the importance of investment in those early years to remove health  inequalities. Therefore, a major impact can come from investing in our young  people.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I support the comments made earlier by Dominic Bradley  about how important it is to invest in the young. I also remind Members of  Professor James Heckman, Nobel laureate economist, who is working with  organisations in Northern Ireland,  and whose essential message is that we should invest in the young because it  makes economic sense.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Clearly, we need to create a method of joining up the dots;  we must not have separate Departments passing the buck. The junior Ministers  are ultimately responsible for these issues, and the Office of the First and  deputy First Minister, if it does not like the children and young people&rsquo;s  fund, must invent something that works similarly. If they wish to rebrand that  fund &mdash; if that makes them happy &mdash; I do not mind. However, we require a  mechanism that ensures that the funding that children need will flow, meaning  that parents will be able to return to work knowing that their children are  safe and are being educated.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I call Mr Alex Attwood. I remind the Member that the time for  debating the motion is almost up. I would prefer that he not give way to any  other Members.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I advised my colleague Mr Bradley of that very  point before I rose to speak.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I also welcome the motion. A strategy on childcare will be  outlined in the near future, and one of the standards against which I will  judge any such strategy is the very sensible but moderately costed proposals of  the Northern Ireland Childminding Association. Over a year ago, that  organisation outlined proposals, which would cost only &pound;300,000 a year over a  three-year period, to address the lack of child-minding places across the  North. Indeed, the SDLP recently tabled a motion in the Business Office that urged  the Executive and individual Ministers to implement NICMA&rsquo;s proposals. We must  judge forthcoming proposals against that standard.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I say that because, in Northern Ireland, child-minding  places account for 76% of full-time day care and 44% of all childcare. NICMA,  which is well placed to give good advice, has recommended that the Executive  make an intervention of &pound;300,000 a year over three years to begin to undo the  evidence of the last three years and make more child-minding places available.  That sensible and moderate intervention should be implemented.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">If that recommendation were taken up, it would mean two  things. First, it would introduce grants in the North similar to those that  exist in the Republic   of Ireland of perhaps as  little as &pound;600 or &pound;700. Those grants would enable people to take up  child-caring duties, attain administrative experience, buy equipment and  acquire the insurance necessary to keep children in their home. It would also  provide for mentoring on an individual basis for new childminders.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The consequences of that &mdash; this would be music to Mr  Elliott&rsquo;s ears, were he present in the Chamber &mdash; would address the needs of  areas of the North where child-minding is in the most acute need. That would  address the needs of areas of Derry such as Creggan,  Brandywell and the Bogside. That would address the needs of areas of south and  east Belfast such as Blackstaff, the Mount and  Shaftesbury, and it would address the needs of areas of County Fermanagh,  including Belleek, Garrison, Newtownbutler and Rosslea. The moderately priced  intervention proposed by NICMA would create jobs, opportunities for women to  get back into work and new child-minding places in the areas of most acute  need. I suggest to the Assembly that it is against that moderately priced proposal  that we should judge the Executive&rsquo;s proposals, if and when they come to pass.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">4.45 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, we should do something in our own gift about  childcare. All Members employ staff, and, without going into issues about those  staff, we do not get childcare support provision for staff in our individual  offices. Members of the permanent secretariat in the Assembly and Assembly  Members get support, but our office staff, who provide a service to our  communities and constituents, do not, through the Assembly provisions, get any  support for child-minding. I have many issues with the Assembly Commission, but  it should take this matter forward with urgency.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Having said all of that, I must declare an interest. As  some Members may know, 20 days ago my wife gave birth to our second child,  Anna; and the issue of childcare support and child-minding will be acute for me  within the next year.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Everybody knows about the baby by now. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The junior  Minister (Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister) (Mr G Kelly)</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle and congratulations &mdash; for the  childminding, that is.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I am pleased to respond to the motion and on the important  issue of childcare. The Programme for Government commits us to ensure access to  affordable, quality childcare, improve educational outcomes for the most  disadvantaged and work towards the elimination of child poverty. The important  contribution that adequate and affordable childcare can make to reducing  poverty was also highlighted in the recent report on child poverty by the  OFMDFM Committee.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As junior Ministers with responsibility for children and  young people, Jeffrey Donaldson and I are tasked with driving forward the  strategy for children and young people. The strategy&rsquo;s aim is to ensure that  all children and young people fulfil their potential, and evidence suggests  that childcare is a key element in achieving that objective.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The gender equality strategy also recognises the role of  childcare in actively promoting an inclusive society and in achieving equal  value for paid work and equitable participation in unpaid work. The Beijing &ldquo;Platform for  Action&rdquo; identified the lack of appropriate and affordable childcare as a factor  preventing women from achieving their full potential, and the Equality  Commission&rsquo;s statement of key inequalities reached the same conclusion. There  are many good reasons for wanting to improve the quality, affordability and  accessibility of childcare, and there is a strategic importance in improving  gender equality, advancing the social welfare agenda, improving the life  chances of children, reducing child poverty and improving the economic  prospects of the whole community.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Notwithstanding the current economic downturn, there has  been a long-term trend for more women and parents to enter the workforce. As a  result, childcare has become an increasingly important public policy issue.  Access to good childcare is key to achieving a range of Government objectives.  It enables parents, particularly lone parents, most of whom are women and who  are in a group at highest risk of poverty and social exclusion, to move into  work, training, education, or, if they so wish, to increase their working  hours.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">High-quality childcare provision, which every Member has  mentioned, can have a positive impact on children&rsquo;s educational and health  outcomes and can enhance development and skills. It affords options for  children, parents and families to help lift individuals and families out of  poverty and social isolation.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">For employers, supporting parents to balance work and  childcare responsibilities can improve staff morale and retention; improve  returns on training; and reduce staff turnover and absenteeism. It can also  enhance an organisation&rsquo;s financial performance, productivity and ability to  adapt. For society, it supports increased employment and social cohesion &mdash;  something that a number of Members have mentioned.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Local and international research shows that quality  childcare forms the basis of better outcomes for children and the economy.  However, research also shows that the best outcomes come from a delivery system  that is coherent, organised and strategic. As other Members have said, the  system that we have at the moment could, at best, be described as fragmented.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The future prosperity of our economy depends on investment  in key areas. Childcare is one such area. We already lag behind some of our  Scandinavian neighbours in the approach to delivering childcare, and we must  discover what we can learn from those countries that are recognised as Europe&rsquo;s &ldquo;best in class&rdquo;. However, we do not lag behind  only Scandinavia. As a number of Members  mentioned, we also lag behind provision in Britain and the South of Ireland in  many respects.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Many Departments play a direct or supportive role in the  provision of childcare: the Department of Health, Social Services and Public  Safety in relation to registration and inspection; the Department of Education in  relation to extended schools and early-years education; the Department for  Employment and Learning in relation to childcare for those who are engaged in  training; the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment in relation to  creating job opportunities; and the Department for Social Development in  relation to funding for women&rsquo;s centres.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Policy must be responsive to demographic, social and  economic changes. However, the challenges are substantial. We need to ask some  hard policy and operational questions. How, for example, can we devise a system  that incorporates high-quality registration and inspection regimes with  childcare-workforce planning? How can we respond to the local circumstances of  areas with diverse needs or to the needs of families with pre-school children  or post-primary children in urban or rural areas? That was something that our  rural colleagues also raised.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">From the labour force survey, we know that over 230,000  parents who work have children who are under 12 years of age. In that figure,  144,000 parents have children who are under six years of age, but there are  fewer than 50,000 registered childcare places. Research sources as diverse as  the labour force survey, the millennium cohort study and the Northern Ireland  Childminding Association all paint a similar picture. Parents want and need  quality childcare that fits with their working lives and supports their  children&rsquo;s educational, social and emotional development.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, we must consider how to best provide childcare  services that meet quality standards, are affordable, do not create  disincentives to taking up employment, and fit in with the diverse family  structures and working patterns of a modern economy. They must be sufficiently  flexible to accommodate the working patterns and unique circumstances  associated with the current economic downturn, including those seeking to enter  or re-enter the labour market. That is easier said than done.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The constraints are very real and include legal issues and  considerations as well as the fragmentation of policy responsibility. However,  those constraints should not be allowed to divert us from making improvements,  because there is an additional imperative beyond the educational and economic  benefits of childcare. There are wider benefits to aim for, including the  general well-being of our children and their parents.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I strongly believe that robust research evidence is the  fundamental basis for good decision-making in government. I am glad to be able  to tell the Assembly that the next meeting of the ministerial subcommittee on  children and young people will discuss a paper that considers the options for  the future of childcare here. Although I cannot pre-empt the outcome of those meetings,  the issues include whether and how to reshape the childcare vision, strengthen  local capacity to provide childcare services, and maximise the synergies among  the statutory, voluntary and community sectors, as well as the important role  of the private sector and employers in the provision of childcare. Those are  issues that Ministers will have to consider how best to address. Several  Members raised the issue of disabled children. I assure them that the paper on  childcare provision will address the particular needs of those children.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">What I have said thus far has described the potential value  of childcare, along with the constraints and the imperatives that demand future  improvements. That is not a task for government alone. The views and opinions  of key stakeholders need to be obtained to ensure a participative approach to  secure development and delivery.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Children and young people need to be directly involved in  designing the process. As junior Ministers with responsibility for children and  young people, we will continue to ensure that they have the opportunities to be  heard and to make their views known on issues that affect them. We established  and chaired the ministerial subcommittee on children and young people with the  support of all the Ministers in the Executive, the NIO and the Court Service.  It is a cross-cutting issue, so all Departments are represented so that they  can discuss who has the responsibility or cross-responsibility for childcare  services. Departmental attendance is very important.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The subcommittee also provides us with a mechanism for  ensuring that cross-cutting children&rsquo;s issues are kept high on the agenda and  are tackled with a joined-up approach. Childcare by itself is not a panacea for  the eradication of child poverty or the revival of future economic success. It  is but one important strand among many. We need to keep focused on a joined-up  approach, one that provides leadership and strategic vision, if we are to  improve on the current situation. That means putting childcare higher up the  policy agenda.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I look forward to reporting back to the Assembly on the  outcome of the work that the ministerial subcommittee on children is doing in  this important area. Indeed, that subcommittee will meet shortly.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Members stipulated five points about the strategy. It  should be: coherent; flexible; not limited to nine-to-five hours; of good  quality; and, as our rural colleagues continually &mdash; and rightly &mdash; remind us,  cognisant of the extra pressures that people in rural areas face. With respect  to the implementation of the strategy, two Members &mdash; Jim Shannon and Alex  Attwood &mdash; mentioned NICMA. We are aware of that matter, and it will be  included. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Purvis</strong>: I  welcome the support from all sides of the House for the motion and the  amendment. As I said, the amendment is intended to expand on the motion in  order to reflect the reality of the type of childcare that is needed to address  child poverty and to help our economy across the board.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I thank all Members who spoke; all-party support for  quality, affordable, accessible and flexible childcare that is age- and  need-appropriate &mdash; in other words, it is geared towards early-years children,  children with disabilities and school-age children &mdash; is not in doubt. It is  somewhat disappointing that the media seem to be uninterested in a fundamental  social policy issue such as this that affects our economy and those living in  abject poverty and that also unites this House.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As several Members said, including Mr Moutray and Mr  Elliott, childcare facilities are not places for people to dump their child  while they work a shift. They play an important role in a child&rsquo;s development,  especially during his or her early years. We know how crucial the early years  are in educational achievement and, therefore, in future employment and earning  opportunities. In these tight economic times in particular, we must be creative  so that people can be helped to make the most of any earning and training  opportunities.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We heard from all sides of the House about how a fully  funded childcare strategy could help our economy. In order to ensure that such  a strategy delivers for parents and carers alike, it must include good-quality  options that are accessible, affordable and flexible. I welcome the junior  Minister&rsquo;s announcement of further consideration of the matter through the ministerial  subcommittee, and I urge it to bring forward a strategy as soon as possible. As  Ms Naomi Long said, there is nothing new in the debate, and its outcome will be  measured by the response to it.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I shall finish by congratulating Mr and Mrs Attwood on the  birth of Anna and Mr Jim Shannon on the birth of his granddaughter.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Anderson</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. &Eacute;ir&iacute;m le taca&iacute;ocht a thabhairt don  r&uacute;n.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I support the motion and the amendment. I, too, welcome the  support of all those Members who spoke.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">For women in particular, the lack of suitable, flexible and  affordable childcare is one of the most significant barriers to their  participation in the labour market. Many Members made that point. Although  childcare is a parental issue, as my colleague Jennifer McCann said, more often  than not, responsibility for it falls to mothers. Childcare is very much an  equality issue; it is about social and economic equality, because those who are  on low incomes &mdash; the working poor &mdash; and those who live in areas of high  deprivation have the greatest difficulty in accessing affordable childcare.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As Jennifer McCann, John O&rsquo;Dowd and Tom Elliott stated,  childcare is also about rural equality. The rural childcare stakeholder group&rsquo;s  report, which the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development commissioned in  2008, acknowledged the difficult circumstances that women and families face  when attempting to find affordable, accessible childcare in rural areas.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As Stephen Moutray said, be in no doubt that the lack of  affordable childcare is a massive problem for countless families across the  North of Ireland. That reality is borne out by the evidence that Members gave.  For instance, in June 2008, there were 92 day-nursery places here for each  1,000 children aged nought to four.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In England,  however, there were more than double that number. My colleague Jennifer McCann  also reminded Members that childcare is subsidised by 75% in some countries in Europe, compared with a mere 25% here.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">5.00 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">A survey undertaken by the Equality Commission in 2003,  which MLA Naomi Long mentioned, found that almost one quarter of employed  mothers were constrained in the hours that they worked by childcare problems. A  further 20% stated that they were constrained in their choice of job by  childcare needs. The working-age economic activity rate for women without  dependent children is 73%, and the corresponding rate for women who have three  or more dependent children is 45%. Some 67% of women cited the lack of affordable,  quality childcare as the main barrier to their seeking employment. Therefore,  the lack of childcare is not only failing our children, but, by creating  another barrier to employment, it is failing our prospects of economic growth.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Tom Elliott spoke about the need to relate childcare with  the economy, and Members should bear that in mind. Despite that, Children in NI  pointed out that as far back as 2002, it was estimated that childcare  provisions needed to be increased by 20% to meet the demand. However, as Jimmy  Spratt said, we are debating this issue at a time when the number of childcare  places is falling steadily, rather than increasing. Jimmy Spratt and John  O&rsquo;Dowd called for more childcare provision, as did many other Members.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Unless action is taken now, affordable childcare will  continue to become increasingly unattainable for the vast majority of children  here. Alex Attwood told us about his daughter, and he said that he had a vested  interest in childcare provision. Jim Shannon does not want his beautiful  grandchild growing up without her mother having access to childcare provision. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Shannon does not want his grandchild&rsquo;s mother to have  inadequate childcare provision. In Ulster Scots, he said that the wane needed  to be minded in a safe place, which is something with which all Members will  agree. T&aacute; s&eacute; an-t&aacute;bhachtach go mb&iacute;onn p&aacute;ist&iacute; in &aacute;it at&aacute; sl&aacute;n d&oacute;ibh.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Proper support and resources should be put in place for the  Women&rsquo;s Centre and the many voluntary organisations that provide childcare in  our communities. Mary Bradley talked about the fiasco around working tax credit  and called on all the Ministers &mdash; and I noted that it was all the Ministers &mdash;  not only to take heed of what was being said in the Chamber, but to act  responsively and to address the issue.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Action needs to be taken to develop childminding  recruitment and retention strategies to ensure that parents have sufficient  choice and affordability. We must support those parents, mainly mothers, who  choose to stay at home to care for their children in the early years, by  providing access to appropriate home-based and group support services. The only  way that we can achieve that &mdash; and the only way that we can achieve the level  of childcare provision that is required in the North of Ireland &mdash; is through  the kind of coherent and properly resourced strategy that the motion and the  amendment call for.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We cannot pre-empt the outcome of the ministerial subcommittee  discussion on childcare, but we hope that it will address the issues that have  been raised in the Chamber today and take account of the recommendations of the  child poverty inquiry. Dawn Purvis quoted from the OFMDFM report on child  poverty, and all the members of the Committee for the Office of the First  Minister and deputy First Minister agreed that the provisions were woefully  inadequate.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Danny Kennedy and Naomi Long stated that the findings of  the report need to be dealt with sooner rather than later, and I recommend that  the ministerial subcommittee consider the OFMDFM Committee&rsquo;s report on child  poverty and the recommendations that dealt with childcare. The Executive must  take ownership if the ministerial subcommittee report is to have any kind of  impact. It must be implemented on a genuine cross-departmental basis.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Despite some comments in the Chamber today, I am mindful  that the nought-to-six-year-old strategy is being developed by the Department  of Education. I am also mindful that the Minister of Education, along with  OFMDFM, will be represented at the World Forum on Early Care and Education,  which will be held in Belfast  this year. That forum will have representatives from more than 70 countries,  and more than 1,000 people will be in attendance. Therefore, work on the issue  is being rolled out by Ministers through their departmental remits.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">From my experience through the Committee for the Office of  the First Minister and deputy First Minister&rsquo;s inquiry into child poverty, I  know that the lack of affordable childcare is a huge issue for a massive number  of families and stakeholders. There is a need for a cross-departmental  approach, as opposed to its being the responsibility of just one Minister.  Stephen Moutray and Roy Beggs said that it was cross-cutting in nature. We need  to acknowledge that and take into account that it is the responsibility of many  Ministers and the Executive in their totality.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the fact that childcare provision has been made a  priority by the ministerial subcommittee on children and young people. What we  need to see is those priorities being turned into effective action with real  and meaningful change. That was reflected in many of the comments made in the  Chamber today.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We look forward to hearing from the junior Minister when he  reports to the Assembly on the outcome of the ministerial subcommittee&rsquo;s  discussions and to hear specifically how many Departments were represented and  what kind of commitment each of the Ministers or their representatives gave at  those meetings.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I support the motion and the amendment. Go raibh m&iacute;le maith  agat.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText"><span class="Italic">Question,</span> That the amendment be  made, <span class="Italic">put and agreed to.</span></p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Main Question, as amended, put and agreed to.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">That this Assembly expresses its concern at the lack  of availability of affordable, quality childcare; and the lack of provision for  people who require flexible arrangements to allow them to avail of working  opportunities in the evenings, overnight and at weekends, particularly in the  current economic climate; and calls on the Executive to implement a coherent  and properly resourced childcare strategy.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. During the debate on world autism  awareness day, which was held on 31 March 2009, Mr Savage made a remark that  could be construed as meaning that Members benefited financially from their  work with the charity Autism Northern Ireland. Members of the all-party  group on autism, and Autism Northern Ireland itself, expressed extreme  concern to me as chairman of the all-party group about the import of those  remarks. Therefore, I ask that the Speaker examine those remarks and rule  whether there are grounds for asking the Member to withdraw them.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member may know that that was not a point of order. However, I  will refer his remarks to the Speaker.</p>

      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Business Committee has agreed to allow up to one hour and 30  minutes for the debate. The proposer of the motion will have 10 minutes in  which to propose and 10 minutes in which to make a winding-up speech. All other  Members who are called to speak will have five minutes. One amendment has been  selected and published on the Marshalled List. The proposer of the amendment  will have 10 minutes in which to propose and five minutes in which to make a  winding-up speech.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs I Robinson</strong>:  I beg to move</p>
      <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly calls on the Minister of Health, Social  Services and Public Safety to reject plans to cut 722 nursing posts, given his  pledge to the Assembly to make efficiencies rather than cuts, and to re-direct  resources towards front line patient services.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The amendment seems to ignore the fact that the efficiency  targets are demanded by the Treasury and are non-negotiable, even if we wish to  make special dispensations. Efficiency savings are supposed to be about doing things  better, not about getting rid of key facilities. Waste, bureaucracy and poor  performance have to be tackled.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Unfortunately, the Minister&rsquo;s response to the need to meet  efficiency targets has been to punish the community by enforcing stringent cuts  on front line services and attempting to palm the blame off on other people.  Recent events have shown that Mr McGimpsey&rsquo;s smoke and mirrors routine of  trying to claim credit for all that is good about his Department&rsquo;s performance,  while trying to blame everyone else for controversial or unpopular decisions,  has run its course. It is of no further use, and the Minister stands before us  exposed as lacking the imagination or determination to deliver, in a real and  meaningful way, on the efficiency agenda. The Health Minister can no longer  have his cake and eat it.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">A Department that spends millions of pounds on travel  expenses should not be threatening to put older people out of their homes; a  Department that wastes millions of pounds on bonuses and artwork should not be  threatening more than 700 nurses with the axe; and a Department whose postage  costs &pound;7 million is not beyond efficiency savings.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I saw a recent press release from a Member making  disparaging comments about our call for efficiencies in that area. That is  exactly the sort of closed-mindedness that I am talking about. If we do not  start looking for efficiencies in this bloated bureaucracy, it will inevitably  lead to the cuts in front line services that the Minister has put forward.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister hailed the budgetary allocation awarded to his  Department as a great success. Members will remember that debate, because prior  to that the Minister had washed his hands of accepting the Budget allocations  in the first round. He made great play over not having his fingerprints on the  allocation in the first round.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">On 22 January 2008, when the final Budget had been agreed  by all the Ministers of the four parties, Mr McGimpsey said in a press  statement:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The final budget allocation is a good news story for  the Health Service. &hellip; in light of the financial circumstances facing the  Executive, I believe it is the best outcome possible.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">He puffed out his chest and claimed that he had  done a great job. Indeed, his party colleagues slapped him on the back for his  claim to have gained extra money. That being the case, they cannot now adopt  the position claiming that health should be immune from the need for  efficiencies, or that more than 700 nurses need to be axed because of spending  plans forced on the Minister by malevolent outsiders. Either the Minister got a  good deal or he did not. He cannot have it both ways.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Recent history has shown that Mr McGimpsey has undergone a  remarkable, rapid transformation from the Bevanite, cradle-to-the-grave,  Minister &mdash; and every other clich&eacute; he has deployed to describe himself &mdash; to the  Minister for cuts. Gone is the man who welcomed the president of the Irish  Congress of Trade Unions to his party conference; to be replaced by axe-man  McGimpsey, cutting away at our front line health services.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">On 2 May 2008, he said &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs I Robinson</strong>:  No, I will not.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">On 2 May 2008, he said:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;To start to make cuts is not what people voted us in  to do&rdquo;.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Just a couple of months ago, on 2 February, he was  adamant:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;No cuts will be made to front line services.&rdquo; &mdash; <span class="Italic"><span style="font-style:normal; ">[Offical  Report, Vol 37, No 3, p154, col 1].</span></span></p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">How did we get to this point? We are here because the  Minister is trapped in headline-chasing mode, which is doing the people whom he  should be working for a disservice.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The sole determining factor in whether an issue becomes &ldquo;top  priority&rdquo; for the Health Minister appears to be whether he is speaking to a  group of people with an interest in the subject, or whether it is receiving  specific media attention at the time. For example, take eating disorders. The  DUP, in common with other parties in the House, consistently states that there  is a need to improve the care available for people who suffer from eating  disorders such as anorexia and bulimia. We all exhorted the Minister to do more  to help those who were suffering owing to a lack of provision, but we were  repeatedly given the brush-off.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">5.15 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The only thing that managed to elicit a response from the  Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety on that issue was his  overriding desire to avoid negative publicity. Only when the BBC started to ask  questions did the Minister announce the creation of a tiny unit. The Minister,  speaking on the radio, suggested at one point that we could have one dedicated  bed in each trust area. How on earth would that contribute to the development  of an effective state-of-the-art service? It would not even touch on the  problem.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We have seen that pattern from Mr McGimpsey before. He is,  of course, perfectly happy to claim the credit for initiatives, such as free  prescriptions, yet he tries to blame other people for his decision to axe 700  nursing posts and to close residential homes for the elderly as part of his  programme of cuts &mdash; a programme that the House, including Members from his own  party, has rejected.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Since he became Minister, Michael McGimpsey has stated in  his press utterances that no fewer than five subjects are his top priority:  suicide prevention; healthier lifestyles; improving access to mental-health  care; high-quality health facilities; and health provision in the south-west. That  is government by press release, lacking in strategic vision, or capacity &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Spratt</strong>:  He does not like other people doing that.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. All remarks must be made through the Chair.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs I Robinson</strong>:  &mdash; for new or fresh thinking.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McGimpsey, it seems, is more interested in chasing  headlines and in building up his media profile than in tackling the serious  issues in our Health Service. Instead of describing an issue as a top priority  every time the media ask questions &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. There appears to be a problem. I wish to make it clear to  everybody that remarks must be made through the Chair.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs I Robinson</strong>:  I will repeat the last part, because it is important. Mr McGimpsey, it seems,  is more interested in chasing headlines and in building up his own media  profile than in tackling the serious issues in our Health Service. Instead of  describing an issue as a top priority every time the media ask questions, Mr  McGimpsey would do better to spend his time devising serious policies that are  designed to improve all healthcare fields in Northern Ireland.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is an off-the-cuff suggestion, but if the Minister would  like to sit with me in an accident and emergency facility, in any hospital in  Northern Ireland, on any given day or evening, I would be happy to sit with him  and let him observe exactly what sort of crisis our Health Service is in. A  reduction in the number of nurses and professionals on the floor of those  A&amp;E units does not bear thinking about &mdash; A&amp;E units can barely manage as  it is.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I throw down that challenge to the Minister: any day or  night, at any time, I will sit with him in the accident and emergency unit of  his choice, in order to let him see what pressures our Health Service front  line staff are under. I support the motion.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Before I call Mr McCallister to speak, I repeat that all remarks  will be made through the Chair, and I insist that the debate be conducted in  that manner.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I beg to move the following amendment: Leave out all after &ldquo;Safety&rdquo; and insert</p>
      <p class="Q3Motion">&ldquo;to review proposals from health and social care trusts to  reduce nursing posts, including requesting from the Executive that the  Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety is exempt from the  comprehensive spending review efficiency savings process thereby devoting more  resources towards front line patient services.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">This debate is essentially about the DUP&rsquo;s political  priorities. Some people in the DUP would rather play politics with our Health  Service than maintain a consistent or credible position that has the best  interests of the Health Service and the people of Northern Ireland at its heart.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Since the draft Budget was debated in late 2007, the proposer  of the motion and some of her colleagues have done nothing but attack the  Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety on every possible  occasion, not with the interests of the Health Service in mind, but in an  attempt to discredit a Minister who is, despite their sniping, actually  delivering.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  As the record will show, that is much to the DUP&rsquo;s shame.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There is a significant gap between the size of the health  budget in Northern Ireland  and that in England.  Even the DUP made that clear in 2005 when its manifesto called for a 20% rise  in health spending. However, the DUP did not deliver anywhere near that level  of increase when it got into a position of power. At the end of the current CSR  period, that gap will be somewhere in the region of &pound;600 million, but despite  that huge gap, the DUP is silent on the issue.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Indeed, the proposals in the previous Finance Minister&rsquo;s  original Budget would have made the situation even worse. Thankfully, the  Health Minister, along with thousands of people who work in the Health Service,  fought for, and won, extra resources, despite the aggressive opposition to that  from Mrs Robinson and some of her colleagues.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  Due to the extra money that was secured, the Health Minister has been able to  announce a series of new measures, such as initiatives to deal with cervical  cancer and provide breast screening and extra cardiac operations, to name but a  few. Ultimately, that money will save lives, yet some people in the DUP oppose  the Minister getting a single penny extra; they really should be ashamed of  themselves.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As everyone knows, the DUP wholeheartedly &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Easton</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  No one in the DUP ever gives way to me.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Easton</strong>: I  promise that I will.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  Can you believe a DUP promise? <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As everyone knows, the DUP wholeheartedly supported  efficiency savings. In case some on the DUP Benches have forgotten, every  single DUP Assembly Member marched through the lobby in support of efficiency  savings. The DUP&rsquo;s pathetic attempt to now distance itself from any  efficiency-saving proposals smacks of crass political hypocrisy.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  The DUP not only supported efficiency savings, it advocated reform. In the  &lsquo;News Letter&rsquo; on 28 November 2007, Mrs Robinson stated:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;In order to continue defending almost half the budget  being directed to just one sector with any credibility, we must be able to  point to radical reform and modernisation.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Once again, the DUP&rsquo;s glowing sentiments appear to  be at odds with the record of what it actually did.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Some in the DUP have opposed the Minister when he has  attempted to meet the Executive&rsquo;s targets. When he introduced radical reforms  and modernisation programmes, there was DUP opposition that was led by Mrs  Robinson, who sniped from the sidelines and opposed the most progressive parts  of the Health and Social Care (Reform) Bill when it was proceeding through the  House.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I must question whether some people in the DUP are serious  about health and ask whether, when bringing pointless motions to the Floor of  the House, they really have the welfare of the people of Northern Ireland  at heart. We hear nothing in such motions about Peter  Robinson emphasising the importance of efficiency savings; nor do we hear  anything about efficiency savings in DUP-led Departments or about the waste of  resources that is, in many instances, emanating from those Departments.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  Perhaps even worse than that is the DUP&rsquo;s opposition to Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  new Public Health Agency. That is a radical initiative that the rest of the UK and Europe  is watching with interest; however, what did our heroes in the DUP do about it?  They predictably, but no less disgracefully, opposed the new agency in both the  Committee and the House. Where was Mrs Robinson&rsquo;s call for radical form?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  Briefly.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  I suspect that the Member is in support of the amendment. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span> Does he recall that when the health budget was uplifted to in excess of 50% of  the overall Budget for running Northern    Ireland, the Minister categorically stated  that he was very happy and content and that he had fought a good fight to  obtain a budget of that size? Will Mr McCallister take that into account in his  comments?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I am more than happy to comment on that, because it touches on what Mrs  Robinson said earlier. The Minister was stating the fact that it was a better  settlement than that which the DUP wanted him to be given. Indeed, for months,  the DUP campaigned against a single penny extra being given to the Minister of  Health and his Department.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">When the DUP was in opposition, before devolution, it  wanted a 20% increase and was critical of increases as small as 9%. However,  when it reached a position where it could do something about the funding of the  National Health Service in Northern    Ireland, it dramatically failed to do  anything. The Minister and Members on this side of the House agreed that the  uplift was very welcome, in comparison with what every DUP Member wanted the  Health Service to be run on. That is my simple answer.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Members also had to sit through the spectacle of the DUP  attempting to defend smoking advertisements at points of sale. Those  advertisements predominantly affect children and have the potential to place a  great financial burden on the Health Service in Northern Ireland. The Ulster  Unionist Party will not be lectured by a party whose record on health has been  completely discredited.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The proposal to reduce the number of nursing posts is  simply a proposal. Many of the trusts&rsquo; proposals have just arrived on the  Minister&rsquo;s desk, and no final decisions have been taken. My party fully  understands the concerns expressed on this issue. The Minister will examine  those proposals closely before taking any final decisions. I was grateful to  the Minister for his recent decisions regarding Skeagh House and Slieve Roe  House.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">However, if the amendment were passed today and agreed by  the Executive, that would mean that such a proposal would not have to be  implemented in the current CSR period, which will allow proper time for real  change to take place. If the DUP is serious about what it says, it will have no  problem in supporting the amendment. If it does not want efficiency savings and  does not deal with the consequences of what it has proposed and agreed to, it  must reverse its position.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Let me be clear: Ulster Unionist Party Members are not  against efficiency savings. We believe in an efficient and effective Health  Service, but we have concerns about the size and pace of some of the changes  that are required in such a short period. Having listened to those on the front  line, including UNISON and the RCN, we know that our amendment has the support  of front line health workers.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">If Members support the amendment, they will charge the  Minister with reviewing the proposals and making a case for exemption in the  current CSR period. I appeal to all Members to listen to our health workers and  to support the amendment, thus allowing proper time for real and meaningful  change. After all, when it comes to health, we are dealing with individuals&rsquo;  lives.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs O&rsquo;Neill</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I support the motion, which is  closely linked to the motion tabled by the Committee for Health, Social Services  and Public Safety and debated in February, which called on the Minister to  ensure that efficiency savings did not impact on front line services. In that  debate, all the arguments were well rehearsed about the impact that proposals  would have on front line services, particularly in relation to job losses,  closure of residential homes and lack of domiciliary care. The Minister was  left in no doubt about Members&rsquo; concerns.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Today&rsquo;s motion focuses on the loss of nursing posts based  on the trusts&rsquo; current best estimate, which is that 722 nursing posts will be  lost. In a briefing paper supplied by the Royal College of Nursing, it is clear  that the RCN supports the reform and modernisation of health and social care  services. However, it is also clear that much work remains to be done by the  trusts to build the confidence of the public and the healthcare workforce in  the new health and social care services. The manner in which the trusts have  progressed the proposals and consulted has been fragmented and confused to say  the least.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In Committee, we examined how the savings are to be made  and how they are likely to impact on front line services. We received evidence  from a combined delegation of trade unions, who told the Committee that there  was a severe lack of information for its members. We raised that issue with the  Minister and with the trusts. In fact, in a previous debate in the House, the  Minister recognised that that was a problem and told us that it would be  rectified. However, that has obviously not happened, because we are debating  the issue again.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In its briefing paper, the RCN states that it is still not  aware of the details on the loss of nursing posts and where they will occur,  and it has absolutely no idea of a time frame. That is totally unacceptable,  and I call on the Minister for clarity on those matters.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">5.30 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The UUP&rsquo;s amendment is, I believe, an attempt to protect  its Minister. The UUP fails to recognise that the CSR proposals are a British  Treasury-driven initiative. We are not masters of our own economic destiny. If  Members had voted for the motion that was tabled by my party colleague Mitchel  McLaughlin, which called for more fiscal autonomy for the Assembly, perhaps we  would be in a different situation.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs O&rsquo;Neill</strong>:  No, I have only a short time left.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Health Department has a unique arrangement with DFP,  which allows it first call on money made available at each monitoring round. We  all welcome that. To go down the route of making the Health Department exempt  from the CSR process sounds great, idyllic and the best thing to do. However,  that would have a knock-on effect on other Departments. All Ministers struggle  to meet the CSR demands and all Ministers have targets to meet. We all need to  realise where we are. The amendment would have an impact on the other  Departments. Where would we take the money from? Should we take it from social  housing or from education? We would have to take it from another public  service. That would be a hard decision, and one that the Executive would have  to make.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We need Michael McGimpsey, the Minister of Health, to step  up and do the job that he has been appointed to do. In an earlier debate in  February on efficiency savings in the Health Service, he made it clear that he  has the final say in all those matters. The trust proposals come to the  Minister for his approval, and he said:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;If formal consultations do not produce a clear  position, cuts will simply not get through.&rdquo; &mdash; <span class="Italic"><span style="font-style:normal; ">[Official Report, Vol 37,  No 6, p316, col 1].</span></span></p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">On that basis, I urge the Minister to examine in detail the  proposals that are being put forward by the trusts, and to reject any measures  that will result in cuts in nursing posts, as that would have a direct impact  on front line services. I support the motion.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Hanna</strong>:  The SDLP is sympathetic to the spirit of the amendment, but it believes that no  Department can be totally exempt from efficiency savings. However, there should  be no cuts to front line services. I have sympathy with the Minister in trying  to balance a budget for such a demand-driven service, but I believe that the proposers  of the motion are engaged in a bit of a cynical exercise. Rather than  point-scoring, I would like to have heard some proposals for savings from the  Chairperson of the Health Committee that would ensure that there will be no  reduction in nursing posts, which is what the motion is about. Have the  proposers of the motion asked their colleague the Minister of Finance and  Personnel whether he has reviewed his comprehensive spending review policy with  regard to the impact on employment and services? Indeed, do they have any  suggestions for saving resources?</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There is a fundamental contradiction between the loss of  nursing jobs and the stated aim of the comprehensive spending review to free up  resources to reinforce front line services. Speaking as someone who was a nurse  for all too many years, there is nothing more front line than a nurse at the  bedside of a desperately ill patient, or a nurse in the community who is an  essential member of a primary care team.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I recognise that the reform and modernisation of health and  social services is a never-ending and ongoing challenge. We support the  Minister&rsquo;s intent and his commitment towards an ever-greater focus on positive  public-health promotion. It is not just about treating the consequences of ill  health, it is about appropriate care in the community.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We recognise that the comprehensive spending review  efficiency targets have been imposed on the Health Minister in an arbitrary  fashion. The SDLP also recognises that given that the health budget accounts  for almost half of Executive spending, there must be greater efficiency and  enhanced productivity in the Health Service.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The trusts must put in place robust workforce development  plans to ensure that registered nurses are adequately trained for the new  service delivery that is expected of them. The planned cuts and redeployment of  staff will have significant training and professional regulatory implications.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Nurses cannot be treated like pieces on a chessboard: a  nurse cannot be taken out of an acute ward and shifted into community nursing  without appropriate training, induction and support, or into mental-health  nursing without statutory post-registration induction, education and support. Adjustments  will certainly be required in the clinical mix among doctors, registered  nurses, allied health professionals and care assistants. However, the  casualization of nursing skills, which occurred so disastrously in the Thatcher  era, cannot be repeated. So much was lost, and we are still trying to regain  that ground.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Royal College of Nursing has produced credible evidence  to show that the critical role of the ward sister and other nurse managers is  being undermined by the proposals. In some hospitals, ward managers are being  asked to work across too many wards and too many locations. When that happens,  the role of nursing ward managers as clinical leaders and patient advocates is  undermined.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There is a continuing reduction of specialist nursing posts  and a tendency to place inappropriate and unpaid leadership responsibilities on  band 5 and 6 registered nurses, particularly on night duty staff. Senior  nursing posts should be created in every acute hospital, which might convince  nurses that their concerns are being listened to.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">All changes must, of course, keep section 75 in mind. Any  changes must be implemented with equality, integrity and probity, and, at all  times, they must put patients&rsquo; interests first. The bottom line is that there  should be absolutely no reduction in front line services and in nursing posts,  as has been stated in the motion.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  The Alliance Party members will not, and cannot, support policies initiated by  the Executive or the Minister to cut the number of front line nursing staff.  Despite repeated denials by the Health Minister, that will be the end result.  We will support the motion and oppose the amendment, because we do not believe  that cutting front line positions is necessary to attain the efficiency-saving  targets as outlined.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister was correct when he said that his baseline  budget was inadequate. We agreed with that, but he is wrong to try to suggest  that cuts in front line provision are necessary to operate within that budget.  By playing politics with front line staffing positions, the Minister is only  harming the case that he made for a higher budget, which we supported at the  time. We appeal to the Minister and the Executive to halt the process and to  stop immediately the loss of over 700 nursing jobs throughout Northern Ireland.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Any person who has been in hospital for any reason must  have seen at first hand that all the nursing staff are completely overworked,  almost to the point of exhaustion. The Health Service needs more qualified  nurses to carry out the duties that they are expected to perform in the  interests of the patients whom they serve.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Of course the Alliance Party wants efficiencies and savings  to be made across all health provisions and in all Departments.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  Tell us. Where are they?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  Listen. Give us a chance.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We accept the many advances in the administration of health  techniques in almost every aspect. We also acknowledge the increase in demands  on the Health Service; again, that is despite all the preventative measures  that have been taken and despite people&rsquo;s having been educated to look after  their own health. Where there is demand, in our opinion, it is incumbent on  Government to provide &mdash; as our own Health Minister has said repeatedly &mdash; a  world-class Health Service. That cannot be achieved by reducing the number of  nursing staff by over 700.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In preparation for the debate, I expect that all Members  will have had the opportunity to read the comments of the Royal College of  Nursing for Northern Ireland,  which has been mentioned already. It has made many comments, among which is  that nurses are at the front line in delivering care to patients and that the  reduction of their number by 700 will have a disastrous effect on their  professional ability to deliver the first-class service to which we all aspire.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The reduction of 700 nursing posts cannot be delivered by  voluntary retirements or by what is called &ldquo;natural wastage&rdquo;. The consultation  process was confused and fragmented. The RCN, as the authority for the nursing  profession in Northern    Ireland, must be listened to and worked with  in order to ensure that bad decisions are avoided before it is too late.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  No, I am racing on here.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Recently, increased costs to the Health Service have been  revealed &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span> Listen, chaps.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  Listen up.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. Some Members appear to have forgotten my earlier  pronouncement that all remarks must be made through the Chair. Continue, Mr  McCarthy.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  Recently, the vastly increased cost to the Health Service of hefty compensation  claims due to medical negligence has been revealed. How does that occur? If that  is the case at present, what could it be in the future when the number of  nursing staff is reduced by around 720? That places even more responsibility on  fewer staff. Is that not a recipe for even more mistakes and more compensation  claims to be made?</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">What about the extra cost to the Health Service of having  to rely more on agency staff? The director of the RCN said recently on that  issue that you cannot get much more front line than a nurse and that the  college is greatly concerned about the impact that the reduction in nursing  posts will have on patient care.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Buchanan</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  No. Nurses want to provide good care to patients.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member must draw his remarks to a close.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  Did a Member want me to give way? <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">My party is concerned that the loss of those 700 jobs will  have a detrimental effect on care throughout the community.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Buchanan</strong>:  In rising to support the motion, I make it clear from the outset that my party  will neither give credence to nor support the amendment. It is one of the most  ludicrous and ill-thought-out amendments that I have ever seen brought to the  Floor of the House. It contradicts everything that the Minister has said  previously.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Of course, that is nothing new from a party for which  &ldquo;delivery&rdquo; is not a word in its vocabulary. To suggest, as the amendment does,  that the Minister should review health trusts&rsquo; proposals to reduce nursing  posts rather than reject totally plans to cut 722 nursing jobs, as is demanded  by my party&rsquo;s motion, beggars belief. The Assembly now has clear evidence that  that party speaks with a forked tongue: it sings from two entirely different  hymn sheets.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I remind the Minister and his party that he has, on several  occasions, given his pledge, both to the Health Committee and on the Floor of  the House, that efficiency savings in his Department would not affect front  line services. On 10 February 2009, the Minister reiterated his position in the  House when he said:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Let me make it clear &mdash; efficiency savings are not  cuts. That is why, when I became Minister, I considered, and threw out, what  had been proposed under direct rule&rdquo;. &mdash; <span class="Italic"><span style="font-style:normal; ">[Official Report, Vol 37,  No 6, p315, col 2].</span></span></p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">5.45 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">If the Minister is true to his word, he will have no  alternative but to reject outright any plans to cut 722 nursing posts. The  message from nursing staff in hospitals across Northern Ireland is crystal clear &mdash;  they are already overstretched and under pressure. All Members will agree that  nurses provide front line services to patients at bedsides or in the community.  Therefore, the suggestion of reviewing the trusts&rsquo; proposals to reduce those  front line staff flies in the face of any previous commitments or promises that  the Minister gave to the House.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Easton</strong>:  The Minister also said:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The final budget allocation is a good news story for  the Health Service.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The Ulster Unionist Party says that it does not  have enough money, yet, at the time, the Minister announced that he was happy  with the Budget. Is that not a contradiction?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Buchanan</strong>:  I thank the Member for his input; there is ambiguity in the Ulster Unionist  Party&rsquo;s stance. The Minister must come clean and outline his true position on  those issues to the House.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The second part of the amendment calls for the Department  of Health, Social Services and Public Safety to be exempt from the  comprehensive spending review efficiency-savings process thereby devoting more  resources towards front line patient services. I remind the Minister and  Members from the Ulster Unionist Party that the comprehensive spending review  was not plucked out of thin air or dreamed up by a member of the Executive. It  was handed down by the Treasury as a mechanism to reduce over-bureaucracy in  Departments in order to enable them to operate more efficiently, enhance  productivity and free up resources for reinvestment into front line services.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs I Robinson</strong>:  I thank the Member for giving way. As the Member will be aware, despite the  fact that the comprehensive spending review was Treasury orientated, the  Executive agreed that if the Department of Health realised &mdash; or bettered &mdash; the  3% savings, it would retain those extra moneys. No other Department received  such benefits.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Buchanan</strong>:  The Member is correct; no other Department was afforded that benefit. The  Minister said that the additional funding will:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;save lives and transform the lives of thousands  more.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">He said that without those efficiencies the  Department would be unable to deliver all the new service developments around  cancer, mental-health and learning disabilities, because the efficiencies are  paying for those developments.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">On the one hand, the Minister says that the efficiencies  will pay for those new services; on the other, his party says that the Health  Department should not be part of the comprehensive spending review. One part of  the party does not know what the other part is doing. Moreover, it should be  noted that other Departments must rebid for any efficiencies from the pot. As  the honourable Member Mrs Robinson said, the efficiencies in the Health  Department return directly to that Department to be reinvested in front line  services.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member must draw his remarks to a close.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Buchanan</strong>:  I support the motion.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs McGill</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I welcome the debate. My party  colleague Michelle O&rsquo;Neill outlined our position on the motion and the  amendment. The debate raises the profile of nurses&rsquo; significance in society and  highlights how Members value their work.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">However, there is some ambiguity about the figure of 722  jobs. It would be valuable if there were some clarity about where that number  came from in the first instance, and whether those 722 posts will disappear  completely.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister has said on occasion that these are not cuts.  Other Members have referred to that. I am prepared to accept that what the  Minister has said is the truth &mdash; that these are not cuts; they are changes to  front line services. However, the point is that we need to know whether the  changes to the front line services will enhance the service, or will change it  in such a way that patient safety and health would be adversely affected. I am  prepared to accept what the Minister has said, but there is ambiguity, and we  need some clarity on that.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In the briefing from the RCN, which has already been  mentioned, reference is made to the Minister&rsquo;s comments of October 2008. The  briefing states that the RCN generally supports the direction of travel of the modernisation.  We all do. Perhaps I should not generalise in that way, but many of us accept  the modernisation. As the spokesperson for the RCN said on another occasion, we  are not against change for the sake of being against change, but we do need to  establish exactly what the effect will be, whether these truly are efficiency  savings, and exactly what the situation will be in the ward.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The RCN briefing made the point that there are issues  related to training. If a nurse, for example, has to shift from one particular  area of work to another, when and how will that training take place? I spoke  with a representative of the Western Health and Social Care Trust this morning,  and raised that issue. I am not sure that the way in which that will happen &mdash;  moving from one area of work to another &mdash; has been sorted out. There has to be  some type of time frame for that. I would welcome clarification on that from  the Minister.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">My understanding is that 350 nursing posts are under  consideration in the Western Trust area. That was mentioned at a meeting of the  Health Committee when Mr Easton raised the issue with Elaine Way. The issue of reinvestment was  raised, which will involve 216 posts in the Western Trust, leaving 134 posts  unfilled. I am keen to know where those 134 posts will go. I understand from a  report produced by the Regulation and Quality Improvement Authority (RQIA) in  relation to clostridium difficile and nursing shortages in the Northern Health  and Social Care Trust that there is a direct link between nursing shortages and  infection. I would welcome some clarity about those 134 posts. Will we notice  that gap in the Western Trust? My reading of the issue is that that has not  been managed in a uniform manner across the trusts. When I spoke to the  representative of the Western Trust today, I got some reassurance on how it was  being managed. We in the west will be keen to follow that up.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Before finishing, a LeasCheann Comhairle, I want to state,  as have other Members, that we value the work that nurses do. We do not want to  put them under extra pressure. There is not enough money for everything. The  Minister himself has said &mdash; and I could not agree more &mdash; that there have been  years of underfunding here. As the Minister said, that is unacceptable. The  difference between here and England  amounts to &pound;600 million &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs McGill</strong>:  I welcome today&rsquo;s debate. Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  Here we go again with the Ulster Unionists. If one had taken out the references  to the DUP from Mr McCallister&rsquo;s speech, it would have been reduced in content  by around one third. He made the usual cry of give us more money and we can do  the job. He should not take on the job of rocket scientist, because anyone  could claim that if they were given more money, they could do a better job.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We want to see the Minister do a good job with the money  that he has, and cutting 722 nursing jobs does not represent doing a good job.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">My wife is a nurse, so I should declare an interest. It is  not that the proposed cuts will have a personal consequence for me, but they  will have a consequence for the thousands of people who benefit from the  service that Health Service nurses provide.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McGimpsey has yet to challenge the Appleby Report. I  want to hear today whether he will say that the Appleby Report is not fit for  purpose. Professor John Appleby said that Health Service productivity in Northern Ireland was 17&middot;4% less than that in the  rest of the UK.  As a consequence of that, it was determined that &pound;280 million of savings were  there to be made. If the Ulster Unionists are going to challenge that, and say  that the Appleby Report is not up to scratch and that they want to take it  apart piece by piece, I want to hear them do that. They have not done that to  date.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: I  am happy to give way. Let us hear what the Member has to say about the Appleby  Report.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  Will the Member also accept that one of the key elements of the Appleby Report  was to do with public health, and the need to engage the population and urge  them to look after their health better by tackling drinking, obesity and all  those problems that lead to huge health inequalities? However, that lot voted  against the Appleby Report in the Committee for Health, Social Services and  Public Safety and in the Chamber.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  And smoking.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  Smoking as well. The DUP supported that. If we are to debate the Appleby  Report, let us debate it all.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: It  appears that Mr McCallister&rsquo;s answer to all this is to create another quango  that will cost more taxpayers&rsquo; money. Over the past 10 years, although the  health budget has doubled, we have seen administration and management costs  rise by 33%. The money has gone not to the front line but to administration.  That is where Mr McGimpsey must start looking, because that is what efficiency  savings are about. They are not about cutting nursing jobs or services for  senior citizens &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  Yes, in a minute.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is about tackling the difficult issue of administration  and management costs. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I will give way to Mr Kennedy now.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order, please. Let us restore order in the Chamber. I am keen that  everyone be present for the vote, but one or two Members&rsquo; participation in it  is looking a bit dodgy. I ask all Members to make their remarks through the  Chair.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  I thank the Member for giving way. At least we now have clarity on the DUP&rsquo;s  position. Apparently it wants to protect the 722 nursing jobs. It is doubtful  whether the party is under pressure to do so, but the DUP effectively wants to  sack hundreds of Health Service employees. Will the Member confirm that that is  his party&rsquo;s position?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: I  thank Mr Kennedy for his intervention. That is why I like to give way to the  Ulster Unionist Party. He does not want to do away with administrative  positions, which are of no help to people in the front line, but he wants to  sack the nurses. Let us get that message out. This is what the deputy leader of  the Ulster Unionist Party is saying today: sack the nurses and keep the  pen-pushers in their jobs. That may be the price that the Ulster Unionist Party  is prepared to pay, but it is not the price that the DUP is prepared to pay,  nor is it the price that Members from the other parties are prepared to pay.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Over the period in question, Mr McGimpsey&rsquo;s Department will  get a 3&middot;8% increase each year. The Health Service is not being cut; it is  receiving increases above inflation whether Mr McGimpsey likes it or not. The  efficiency savings that should be made would be ploughed back into the Health  Service.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  Yes; I always welcome the opportunity to give way to Basil McCrea.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Does the Member agree with the statement that Mrs Iris Robinson made in the  House of Commons, in which she described the direct rule health budget increase  of 9% as insufficient? Does he agree with her when he says that Northern Ireland  has suffered years of underinvestment? Does he agree with her when she says  that to get up to the same funding levels as England, we need a 20% increase?  Does he agree with those statements? Will he support our Minister in getting  more money for our people and our Health Service?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  Basil McCrea called me &ldquo;Mr Angry&rdquo; earlier, but he does anger even better. We  must tackle issues such as bed blocking and those consultants who use hospital  facilities to operate semi-private services in the Health Service.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We do not need to be endangering the lives of expectant  mothers by closing maternity units such as the one in Basil McCrea&rsquo;s Lagan Valley  constituency. I put it on the record today that the Royal  Victoria Hospital,  Antrim Area  Hospital and Craigavon Area   Hospital are not fit to  cope with additional births.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">6.00 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">If Mr McGimpsey proceeds with his plan, he will be putting  the lives of expectant mothers and their children at risk as a consequence. We  need to tackle those issues. Mr McGimpsey is pleased to tell the public that he  can provide more money for Herceptin, free prescriptions and IVF. I am happy  with all of those decisions &mdash; however, I am not happy if they are taken on the  back of sacking nurses and doing away with 722 nursing posts. The Ulster  Unionist Party may be proud of that, but I am wholly opposed to it. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. The Deputy Speaker is allowed to be heard. The business on  the Order Paper has not been disposed of by 6.00 pm. In accordance with  Standing Order 10(3), I will allow business to continue until 7.00 pm or until  business is completed. Again, I hope that all Members will still be here for  that.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gardiner</strong>:  Political distrust is a very unpleasant commodity. The political distrust that  lies behind a whole string of DUP motions in the Assembly is clear for the  entire electorate to see. For the DUP Finance Minister to impose 3% efficiency  savings on the Health Service here and then for Mrs Robinson, the DUP  Chairperson of the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety, to  lead a series of debates criticising the Health Minister when he tries to  implement those efficiency savings is a deeply cynical thing to do.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">This is playing political games with difficult decisions  that affect people&rsquo;s lives and only demonstrates the failure of partnership  Government, rather than the efficient discharge of the scrutiny function rightly  placed with the Assembly Committees. Bringing endless political point-scoring  debates to the Floor of the Assembly &mdash; with the name of Chairperson of the  Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety appended to them &mdash;  fatally undermines the partnership that should exist between the Committee and  the Minister; a partnership that is designed to procure the best results for  patients and users of the Health Service.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Unfortunately, such petty political point-scoring is what  we in the other parties have come to expect from the so-called lead party of  Government. To the ordinary voter, of whom I am one, it simply looks like a  political set-up or game &mdash; cut the Minister&rsquo;s money and then criticise him  every time he tries to make efficiencies.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Frankly, the scale of the problems that face us in the  Budget, public spending, job protection and creation are so great that this  kind of political distrust that the DUP indulges in is deeply damaging to the  whole process and credibility of government here. It is about as far away from  statesmanship, and giving real and responsible leadership, as one can get. This  is coming from a party that is playing politics when real leadership is needed,  a party that has failed to recognise what even the dogs in the street know &mdash;  that there is a hole in the Executive&rsquo;s finances that the DUP Finance Minister  has failed to deal with for the past seven months.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">That is why I strongly support the amendment that my  honourable friend John McCallister proposed today. It reflects the realities of  the situation in the Health Service, and not the &lsquo;Through the Looking-Glass&rsquo;  events that the Chairperson of the Committee for Health, Social Services and  Public Safety presented.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There have been years of underfunding in health and social  care, and there is already a &pound;600 million funding gap between Northern Ireland and England. We need almost &pound;300  million per annum to make our services match those delivered in England and  another &pound;300 million to match the investment that those services will receive  this year and next.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs I Robinson</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gardiner</strong>:  No, thank you.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Instead, the reality is that the DUP, using its voting  strength in the Executive, has imposed savings on the Health Minister of &pound;700  million over three years. That masks the total failure of the DUP, when it  entered Government through its close partnership with Sinn F&eacute;in, to negotiate a  peace dividend from the United Kingdom Government. The DUP said that it would  not enter Government without such funding, but it did. It was only because the  Health Minister fought for extra funding that he was able to secure a  significant increase in available resources over the comprehensive spending  review period.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Without that extra funding, there would have been no  development of services such as the introduction of bowel-cancer screening,  which will save up to 70 lives a year; an additional 700 heart operations and  procedures each year; the introduction of the human papilloma virus (HPV)  vaccination against cervical cancer, which kills around 40 women each year;  remote monitoring for up to 5,000 patients, and an addition of 200 units in  respect of community &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member must draw his remarks to a close.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gardiner</strong>:  Let the DUP proposers of today&rsquo;s original motion tell that to the electorate.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gardiner</strong>:  I support the motion. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span> Correction: I  support the amendment.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  I acknowledge the commitment and professionalism of our nursing staff across Northern Ireland.  They are, as I have said, true professionals. They are the people who make sure  that patients are treated with care, compassion and dignity, whether in their  home, in a community setting, in primary care, or in hospital, as is often the  case.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is a disgrace that we are now in a situation whereby  more than 700 nursing posts are to be lost. Whether the UUP wants to blame the  DUP, or the DUP wants to blame the UUP, this matter is so serious that it needs  to be sorted out between the Health Minister and the Finance Minister, because  they both have a responsibility from which they cannot escape.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Despite the fact that nurses are such a key group of  workers, we know that when these proposals were taken forward by the trusts,  there was very little real, meaningful and true consultation with the nurses on  the ground. That has only added to the frustration that many of them currently  feel.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Western Health and Social Care Trust, as Claire McGill  has mentioned, will lose more than 130 posts, and we have been told by the  health authorities &mdash; at a number of different levels &mdash; that that will be taken  care of through natural wastage. We are asked to believe that it will be all  right. The reality is that I have had nurses come to me in recent months &mdash; well-trained,  highly-qualified nurses, some of them at intensive-care level, and many of them  young &mdash; who have had notification in writing that their contracts are coming to  an end. They do not know what the future holds for them.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Instead of cutting nursing jobs, we should be challenged by  the task of finding some alternative means of employing them, if it comes to  that. I agree with the Chairperson of the Health Committee that there are areas  of need. She referred to eating disorders, and I agree that the level of care  for people with eating disorders across Northern Ireland is appalling.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">With regard to mental health, the situation is perhaps  slightly better, but there is a great deal of room for improvement.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">If some of those nurses are now to leave our hospitals,  there must be appropriate and well-resourced training so that they can move  into other settings, because, at the end of the day, they are the people who  will take the pressure off the Health Service &#8213; the primary-care and  secondary-care sectors in particular &#8213; and will, with appropriate treatment,  screen out many patients before they get to other levels. Therefore, we need  more resources if the worst comes to the worst here with regard to working in  hospitals.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We have arrived at this point because some Members voted  for the Budget, which contained the comprehensive spending review measures;  unfortunately, we are now living with the consequences. I notice that the  Deputy Chairperson of the Health Committee described the efficiency savings as  British-inspired. Yes, it is a Gordon Brown initiative and in that sense it is  British-inspired, but it is here because that British-inspired initiative was  voted through by Sinn F&eacute;in. Therefore it is time that we all look at the Budget  afresh.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety (Mr McGimpsey)</strong>: I am grateful for  the opportunity to respond to this debate, not least because it once again  highlights the major challenges faced in delivering millions of pounds in  efficiency savings.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As I have said many times, all Northern Ireland Departments  must achieve &pound;790 million of efficiency savings by March 2011; for my  Department, that equates to some &pound;344 million by 2010-11. That is &pound;700 million  over three years, which is a huge task.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Members are aware of trusts&rsquo; proposals &#8213; and I emphasise  that they are proposals &#8213; to achieve the necessary efficiency savings:  proposals that have been the subject of considerable public concern. The motion  calls on me to reject plans to cut more than 700 nursing posts; it suggests  that those proposals are cuts and not efficiencies.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In our drive towards changing the way in which health and  social-care services are provided, nurses will play a vital role in delivering  more care in the community: that is what the population wants. I am committed  to investing in the front line, but we need to realise that the front line is  moving into the community. I have demonstrated that by providing extra funding  for the management of chronic diseases, reform of mental-health and  learning-disability services, and more community services for our growing  elderly population.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, I welcome this debate on the vital contribution  of the nursing profession. However, how sad it is once again to witness  attempts by some in the DUP to use the debate as yet another political  point-scoring exercise &#8213; that, in spite of the fact that the decision to make  efficiency savings was made by the Executive and all parties, including the  DUP.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I have to ask: is that selective memory loss or just an  unwillingness to wake up and face the stark reality that achieving efficiency  savings is a major and difficult task for the Health Service. It is hypocrisy  of the highest order for the same people who are asking for efficiency savings  to criticise me when I try to make them. Such actions highlight yet again how  some are prepared to play politics with the Health Service at any cost.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Let us be absolutely clear: a DUP Finance Minister proposed  the efficiency-savings process, and the DUP enthusiastically supported it at  the Executive and in the Assembly: the comprehensive spending review process  has the fingerprints of the DUP all over it.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I am confident that the direction of change for services  for older people, for mental-health care, for hospital services and for health  and social care is change for the better. However, I have concerns about the  speed and scale of that change.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Just look at the responses to the public consultations on  the trusts&rsquo; proposals that generated such widespread political debate, media  coverage and campaigns. The huge response to those proposals stands in stark  contrast to the eerie silence on proposals from other Departments, and it  reflects how valued and essential health and social care services are to the  public. I have always said that health and social care services must be more  efficient and effective in how we use our limited resources. Today, patients  access services of the highest quality more quickly than ever.</p>

      <p class="B3BodyText">Health continues to lead the way in the reform demanded  under the review of public administration (RPA). The RPA will result in a  reduction of almost 1,700 managerial and administrative staff, and it has  already seen the number of senior executives fall from 180 to 65. In total, the  RPA will bring about &pound;53 million in savings every year.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Although it has taken some time for Members to waken up to  the impact of achieving &pound;700 million in savings, I am delighted that the penny  has finally dropped. I only wish that their concerns had been raised when I was  battling to secure extra moneys for vital services as part of the Budget  settlement. Let me remind the Assembly what was said at that time: the  Chairperson of the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety  insisted that I should accept the Budget as originally proposed. She was so  committed to the cause that she even got herself thrown out of the House over  it. Indeed, she even claimed that, in a bid to save money, the Mater Hospital  should shut, and the new hospital for Downpatrick should be mothballed. At a  time of economic recession, can anyone explain to me why I would want to get  rid of 1,300 jobs in the Mater   Hospital, including  almost 600 nursing posts?</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In addition, Mrs Robinson&rsquo;s colleagues said that it was  outrageous for me to request more resources over and above the draft Budget,  and they claimed that there was a significant element of farce about my battle  to increase funding for health. Let me tell the DUP that there is no farce in  putting patients first and ensuring that more money is devoted to health. The  DUP&rsquo;s inherent failure to recognise that the demand for health services is  rising and urgent investment is required is the only farce around.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">When will some Members on the DUP Benches waken up to the  fact that their Minister controls the purse strings? Instead of scaremongering  and sniping from the sidelines, why do they not talk to their Minister about  getting more money for the Health Service? Have any of them even raised it with  their Minister of Finance and Personnel? No, they have not.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome calls to exempt the Health Service from  efficiency savings. We have to provide 3% efficiency savings on the block  grant, but there is no law that says that it has to be by Department. The  Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety has the largest share  of the Budget, but it also has the greatest need. Our population is continuing  to grow, we have an increasingly elderly population, and expectations for  improvements in health and social care are rising. That means that we need to  make the most of our limited funds, and we are doing that.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Trusts already have proposals to deliver &pound;140 million of  savings a year from increased productivity, including reductions in  absenteeism, reduced energy costs and agency spend. That is in addition to the  &pound;53 million already being achieved through reduced management costs under the  RPA. To think that we are ignoring such potential savings is naive in the  extreme.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The motion is about the reduction in the number of nursing  posts. Health and social care is delivered by people, and almost two thirds of  our spend is on staff costs. It is also naive to assume that efficiency savings  of that magnitude can be achieved by simply tinkering with the system. People  who make such claims need to live in the real world. We cannot achieve  efficiencies of that scale without their having an impact on how our staff  deliver services to meet ever-changing needs. However, over the past 12 months,  I have worked closely with trade unions, the Royal Colleges and trust  management to minimise the impact on staff. That is because nursing is  fundamental to high-quality healthcare.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Nurses deliver care across all settings and to all  patients. Shifting our focus from providing care in the acute sector to  providing it to people in their own communities means that there will be fewer  staff delivering hospital services. It also involves nurses bringing their  skills and expertise to treat and care for people in their own homes</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I am determined to protect the welfare of staff who serve  with commitment and professionalism, and that is why I have made it clear that  I do not expect compulsory redundancies. I am also committed to maintaining the  number of nursing students, and I have invested an extra &pound;2&middot;2 million to  providing support to students in the clinical areas. I have addressed shortages  of midwives by increasing the number of midwifery students and making more  resources available to increase capacity.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">However, the debate should not simply be about the number  of nurses. Indeed, and instead, our focus should be on what is required to  deliver an effective service and what is required to deliver safe and  good-quality care. If we are reducing our reliance on hospital beds and are making  better use of support staff and focusing on preventative care, we must be  prepared to adjust the workforce numbers to match the work that is required.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Appleby Report made it clear that there was real scope  to deliver hospital services that improve the quality of care and allow us to  target resources to those most in need. My Department is ensuring that that  happens, and that is largely what we are talking about now. In fact, all of the  Appleby recommendations are under way or have been implemented. However, Professor  Appleby also considered that Northern    Ireland required uplifts of 4&middot;3% each year  in the funding of health and social care in order to meet increasing levels of  needs, rather than the 1&middot;2% that was granted by the Executive &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: It  was 3.8%.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Service and Public Safety</strong>: No; the 3.8% refers to the  National Health Service in England  &mdash; you were referring to the wrong Health Service, Mr Poots. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Professor Appleby therefore recommended that there must be  some way around the implications of the Barnett formula in relation to health  and social care if the assessed funding requirement was to be delivered. How  unfortunate that that was the only recommendation from the Appleby Report that  has been ignored. The uplift that was provided to health and social care was  only around one quarter of what Professor Appleby recommended as necessary.  Therefore, some Members from the DUP must go out and quote from the Appleby Report,  so that they will ensure that that recommendation is implemented. The one  recommendation from the Appleby Report that is not being implemented is the financial  one; that is, the one that I have just talked about.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I must ask why it has taken so long for some Members to  grasp the fact that the Health Service needs enough money to meet the  ever-growing demands of the public. I make no apologies for fighting hard and  against considerable opposition in attempting to secure extra funding as part  of the Budget settlement &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs I Robinson</strong>:  Will the Minister give way?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Service and Public Safety</strong>: That extra money ensured that I  was able to introduce essential service developments such as bowel cancer  screening and an extension to breast screening programmes, to name but a few of  those developments that will transform, and save, lives.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is true that described the final Budget settlement as  being as good as it could get at that time; however, I also said that it is  still not enough, and I will continue to fight for more.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">At a time of recession, when so many people are struggling  with financial pressures and unemployment is rising, the demands on our Health  Service will increase. Now is the time for investment. Without adequate  funding, how else can we address the years of historic underfunding of our  health and social care systems? How else can we begin to close the &pound;600 million  funding gap between Northern Ireland  and England?  How else can we ensure that people in Northern   Ireland have the same access to health-care as is the  case in the rest of the UK?</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Let me make it absolutely clear: I am not arguing that the  Health Service should not be attempting to make efficiency savings. Rather,  given that the needs of my Department are so much greater, I ask why we are  being asked to do so much in such a short period of time. We simply cannot give  anymore; there is no slack in the system. Indeed, Dr William McCrea recently  sent me a letter in relation to this matter, in which he asked me to apprise  him of the extent of the proposed cuts. Furthermore, he expressed his support  for the views of his constituents in asking that the National Health Service be  exempt from the Executive&rsquo;s comprehensive spending review. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span> That is a letter from a sincere individual who is not playing politics. The  date on the letter is 30 March 2009.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Why do the sick and needy have to pay for years of  underfunding of our Health Service? After all, when it comes to health, we are  dealing with people&rsquo;s lives. It is time for everyone to face up to their responsibilities.  It is not as if I have not warned everyone of the difficulties that the Health  Service faces in trying to make those efficiency savings.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Yes; in respect of our capacity, we are managing at the  moment. However, we are at our limit. If we are to continue to protect the  quality of care that is provided, we cannot give any more &mdash; we must get real.  The debate is not just about numbers of nurses; it is about the healthcare of  our current population and that of future generations. I would like more time  to deliver those changes, but I do not have it.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As Minister, I am determined to do the right thing, to  reform and to modernise in order to deliver the services that people need.  Those are the criteria against which I will consider these proposals. I will  also consider the remarks made by Members today.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Mr Poots referred to his family connections in the nursing profession. He knows  that I also have family connections, because they nurse together. He knows that  my partner&rsquo;s sister is a nurse and that my brother-in-law is a nurse. He knows  that we on these Benches hold the nursing profession in the highest possible  honour.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Poots also knows &mdash; because others have spoken about the  stress that nurses find themselves under in the National Health Service &mdash; the  amount of work and responsibility that falls to them, which is why I fully  support the Minister&rsquo;s quest for additional resources to look after the  heroines and heroes in our Health Service who need it most. Let no one be in  any doubt that we in the Ulster Unionist Party absolutely and fundamentally  support the nursing profession.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I congratulate the DUP on its ability to play clever politics, to be sleekit,  to take something and to turn it round, and to use the motion in order to play  on people&rsquo;s fears. I acknowledge the DUP&rsquo;s ability to pour poison and invective  on those who are standing up and fighting for the people of Northern Ireland  and for the Health Service, as the Minister is expected to.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I also admire the DUP&rsquo;s ability to rewrite history. I  admire the fact that somebody said &mdash; and I am happy to take an intervention, if  anybody wants to tell me where this text came from:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Northern Ireland  has suffered from relative underfunding for decades&hellip;more than 20% extra  spending per capita on health care is required to achieve the same level of  service as in England.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Who said that? The DUP manifesto in 2005 did.</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The Health Service in Northern   Ireland has suffered from long-term under-funding  relative to the rest of the UK.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Who said that? The DUP manifesto in 2007 did.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In March 2005, describing the direct rule health budget  increase of 9% as insufficient, who said the following?</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The extra money does not allow for any new service development.  Proposed allocations will not even allow trusts to stand still. In fact they  are being forced to withdraw services.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  Iris Robinson.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Iris Robinson; that is correct. Now, the DUP is turning round and saying, &ldquo;by  the way, live within your means.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">That is rank hypocrisy. In fact, it is not just hypocrisy;  it is duplicitous double-talk from a party that is duping the people of Northern Ireland.  When it comes to health, I look at the DUP&rsquo;s partners in crime on the Sinn F&eacute;in  Benches, and I must say that, while I acknowledge its right to be in  Government, I despair of that party&rsquo;s ability. This idea about &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">For the benefit of all Members, including those who have  recently arrived in the Chamber, I asked that all remarks be made through the  Chair. I intend to see out the debate in that way.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">6.30 pm</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I give way to Mrs Iris Robinson.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs I Robinson</strong>:  I thank the Member for giving way. First, the speech that you quoted was from  me. I was arguing in the House of Commons &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>A Member</strong>:  Through the Chair.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs I Robinson</strong>:  Pardon?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I think that a Member was suggesting that you speak through the  Chair, Mrs Robinson.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs I Robinson</strong>:  I am sorry &mdash; I will try. I was speaking in the House of Commons. Of course, one  makes the case when fighting in the House of Commons when one does not have an  Administration in Northern    Ireland. That is what my speech was about.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">On the subject of manifestos, I remind the honourable  gentleman that it was his party that said that it would not enter into  government with Sinn F&eacute;in/IRA unless and until guns were handed in. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There is a difference: we got the guns. If we are talking  about manifesto promises, that party is the biggest hypocrite.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I thank Mrs Iris Robinson for her excellent intervention. It demonstrated  duplicity, doubletalk and rewriting of history, among all the other invective.  Sinn F&eacute;in keeps saying that it will increase taxes, but who will pay those  taxes?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs O&rsquo;Neill</strong>:  Who said that?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  OK, perhaps Sinn Fein does not want to increase taxes. However, that party  demands fiscal responsibility, so if it wants more money for the Health  Service, it will have to fight for it.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I listened to the Alliance Party come out with more  motherhood and apple pie and promises of how it would make cuts. However, not  one example was given. All I hear is political immaturity. It is time for  people to get &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is not often that I cannot command the Floor, but the  Alliance Party is doing its best to prevent me from doing so. When it comes to  the issue, we, as 108 MLAs, will collectively have to start making tough  decisions. It is absolutely appropriate that when cuts of 3% across the board  must be made, there will have to be change. Members need to recognise that.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I conclude by rejecting the terrible position that the DUP  has taken.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member should draw his remarks to a close.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I commend the Minister of Health for fighting for all the people of Northern Ireland,  and for fighting, as he should do, for our Health Service.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Easton</strong>:  The House will consider little of more importance than the subject that is  under discussion. The Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety  would do well to listen. Trusts&rsquo; potential loss of 722 nursing posts will, if  not reversed, mark a seismic mistake of ministerial folly.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Our National Health Service is world-renowned for its  expertise. Many in the House, me included, can testify to its surgical and  medical expertise. At the core of the service stands the distinguished  profession of nursing, which is a vocation. Many of our nurses have  distinguished themselves by the care that they give. They deserve to be treated  fairly, and they deserve the respect that is due to them. We all know that many  nurses &mdash; including my sister, who is a nurse in Lagan Valley   Hospital &mdash; go above and  beyond the call of duty in their commitment to their patients. I am at a loss  to fathom how 722 nursing posts can be axed without a critical negative impact  on front line services.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Northern    Ireland director of the highly respected  Royal College of Nursing has already informed us that, if 722 posts are cut,  patient care will be damaged and further strain will be placed on an already  pressurised workforce. Proposals to cut the number of nursing-ward or team  managers, to force them to work across multiple locations and to downgrade  their roles are unacceptable threats to patient care and client safety. Those  proposals must be revoked.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">A report by the Regulation and Quality Improvement  Authority suggests that the loss of the nursing posts will cause an increase in  healthcare-acquired infections. The RQIA report contains powerful messages  about how inadequate nurse staffing levels contributed to the spread of  infections, yet the five trusts wish to add to that danger by doing away with  722 nursing positions.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">That eloquent analysis places none of us in any doubt about  what the motion is about: protecting front line services and enhancing, not  damaging, patient care. Does the Minister think that he knows better than the  Royal College of Nursing? Does he expect the House to believe that he knows  better than the men and women who daily provide services in an increasingly  pressurised workplace?</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister&rsquo;s logic that one can cut 722 posts and not  hinder front line services defies reality. I challenge him to go to hospitals,  treatment rooms and homes in which district nursing services are being provided  to witness for himself the pressures that nurses are under and to appreciate  the fact that many nurses are regularly working unpaid overtime. The Health  Service has many demands, but, frankly, the Minister&rsquo;s cutting of 722 nursing  posts will only add to the problems faced on the front line &mdash; it has no part to  play in solving those problems.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I have asked the Minister to direct his attention towards  areas that can contribute to the solution and increase productivity, and I make  no apology for reiterating that. Every time they are mentioned, he seems to  pooh-pooh them. I said that he must address the level of non-attendances at  outpatient clinics, which stands at 196,000 &mdash; he has not done so. I said that  he must address some of the 14,000 cancelled clinics &mdash; he has not done so. I  said that he must address the alarming cost of medical negligence claims, which  amount to &pound;14 million &mdash; he has not done so. Furthermore, he must address the &pound;6  million cost of independent sector providers, and whether it is really  necessary to pay management consultant fees of more than &pound;100 million. Consider  the &pound;40 million cost of employing agency staff: if one is getting rid of  nurses, it does not make sense to re-employ them as agency staff at twice the  price. Strategically, the Minister is in error in his belief that cutting 722  nursing positions will not detrimentally impact on front line services.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs I Robinson</strong>:  Would he also add to that lengthy list the fact that &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Through the Chair; that is a conversation.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs I Robinson</strong>:  I cannot keep my eyes from that end of the room. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span> Dream on.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister should also take cognisance of the amount of  money that is spent each year on locums. Last year, I believe that they cost  almost &pound;700,000.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Easton</strong>: I  take on board the points raised by the Member, and there are plenty more  statistics that we can read out if the Minister wants us to do so.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Better front line nursing cannot be achieved with fewer  nurses. Consider the pressure that they are under already. Put simply, this is  not rocket science. I suggest that the Minister takes a reality check. Do not  take my word for it; take the words of nurses:</p>
      <p class="Q1Quote">&ldquo;the proposals will damage patient care and place further  strain on an already pressurised nursing workforce.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The loss of 722 nurses will damage front line services. The  Minister should remember &mdash; to use a metaphor &mdash; that he will do what it says on  the tin. He said efficiencies, not cuts; he said resources would be directed  towards front line services &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Easton</strong>:  No, you would not do it for me, so tough.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">On close examination, the amendment reads:</p>
      <p class="Q1Quote">&ldquo;to review proposals from health and social care trusts to  reduce nursing posts&rdquo;.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The amendment does not guarantee those nursing jobs;  it only seeks a review. Furthermore, it asks the Executive to accept:</p>
      <p class="Q1Quote">&ldquo;that the Department of Health, Social Services and Public  Safety is exempt from the comprehensive spending review&rdquo;.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Is the Ulster Unionist Party asking us to break the  law and go against the directive from Westminster,  which we had no choice but to accept? What is equally amazing is that the  Ulster Unionist Party is asking us to go against its own Health Minister, who  supported the Budget in the Executive, stating that he was satisfied with the  Budget and that it was a good day for health in Northern Ireland.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Even if we were legally allowed to exempt the health budget  from the comprehensive spending review, what would that mean? It would mean  that all the efficiency savings identified by the Minister would not have  happened and that all the extra money he was given would not have been given.  It would mean that the Minister would not get first refusal on the first &pound;20  million handed back, which amounts to an extra &pound;60 million over three years. No  other Department gets that extra money, and failing to get it would mean that  the Minister would not have been able to announce all those new services,  including free prescriptions.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Those new services came about as a result of record  investment and the size of the budget that the Minister got, and that would not  have happened if the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety  had been exempt from the comprehensive spending review. Before the Northern  Ireland Assembly was up and running, the health budget was &pound;3&middot;982 billion. By  the end of the three-year Budget period, it will be &pound;4&middot;491 billion, which is  &pound;500 million more for health &mdash; a record investment in health in Northern Ireland.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The amendment from Tweedledum and Tweedledee is a smokescreen;  it cannot be done. If it could be done, the other Departments would have to  find savings to make up for the shortfall; DSD would have to stop benefits, and  there would be no money for community groups; DARD would have no money for  grants for farmers; DRD would have no money to repair roads; DEL would have to  close colleges &mdash; I am sure that the Ulster Unionist Party would not want their  Minister to have to do that &mdash; and DCAL would have to stop money for community  events.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In tabling the amendment, the UUP has shown itself to be  financially inept and financially unstable. It is no wonder that the Ulster  Unionist Party is in so much debt and almost broke. When one looks at the state  of the finances that Basil McCrea received from the Assembly, one will see that  he had to fire some of his own staff because of his financial ineptitude. Let  us get real; let us save the nursing jobs.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I will try to get through some of the points that were  raised during the debate. On the one hand, Sammy Gardiner praised the extra  money, but, on the other, he wanted to do away with the extra money by doing away  with the comprehensive spending review. I would be glad to see him coming  through the Lobbies with us to support the motion.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Tommy Gallagher said that the Health Minister should speak  to the Minister of Finance and Personnel. However, I submitted a question for  written answer in which I asked whether the Health Minister had raised the  subject of efficiency savings on nursing and residential care homes, and I was  informed that he has not even raised it in the Executive; he has not even  bothered to do so. That shows you what the Minister thinks of nursing jobs and  residential homes. He has not even bothered to raise the issue at the  Executive.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Minister McGimpsey complained about all the parties  supporting the comprehensive spending review, which he supported. It is a pity  that the Minister was not concerned enough about the nursing positions to raise  them at the Executive.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I did not take any notes on Basil McCrea&rsquo;s contribution,  because I do not think that he was talking about health.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">John McCallister said that the DUP was opposed to the new  health agency. When debating the Health and Social Care (Reform) Bill, DUP  members did not oppose a new health agency; we wanted to keep it within the new  regional board.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  They voted against it.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Easton</strong>:  No, they did not. Mr McCallister needs to tell the truth to the people of Northern Ireland,  because that is not true. Members can check the record.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. I think that I heard the Member say  that Mr McCallister has to tell the truth. I ask him to withdraw those  comments.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I was already on my feet to do exactly that.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Easton</strong>:  DUP members were accused of voting against the health promotion agency during  debates on the Health and Social Care (Reform) Bill, but we did not. Therefore,  Mr McCallister did not provide the truth. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. I need to hear the explanation from the Member.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Easton</strong>:  Mr McCallister stated that the DUP voted against the new health agency. We did  not vote against the new health agency, so what he said was inaccurate; it is  not true. Mr Deputy Speaker, you can check the Hansard report, and you will see  that the DUP did not vote against it. I will not be apologising.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. Following the debate and once the  Hansard report is published, I ask you to reflect on what was said by Mr Easton  and decide whether his comments were parliamentary.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I will refer the matter to the Speaker, who will make the  decision.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>:  Further to that point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. It would be helpful to have  clarification, because, if I heard Mr Easton correctly, he asked Mr McCallister  to tell the truth. That is not necessarily an accusation that he was doing  anything otherwise.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: That is precisely why I have decided to refer the matter to the  Speaker, who will be the final arbitrator.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Easton</strong>: I  am happy to await the Speaker&rsquo;s ruling.</p>
