          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I remind Members that the debate at Second Stage should be  confined to the Bill&rsquo;s general principles.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel (Mr Dodds)</strong>: I beg to move</p>
          <p class="Q3Motion">That the Second Stage of the Civil Registration Bill [NIA  20/07] be agreed.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill proposes several amendments to Northern Ireland civil registration legislation,  in particular the Births and Deaths Registration (Northern Ireland) Order 1976. It  also introduces new free-standing provisions on civil-registration records and  the notification of vital events.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill expands on the existing legislative framework to  enable reform and modernisation that will provide a service to suit today&rsquo;s  society&rsquo;s needs and expectations. The legislation will provide greater choice  and more flexibility in registering vital events, including where such events  may be registered, improved service delivery via much wider use of information  technology, additional types of certificates to meet public demand and greater  access to historical civil-registration records to facilitate genealogical  enquiry.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Civil registration, which has existed since the 1840s,  plays a vital role in securing and protecting basic human rights.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The records provide an individual with a name and identity  in society; a facility for marriage; evidence of parentage; and evidence of  entitlement to inheritance. The information gathered can also be analysed to  provide valuable statistical information for medical and social research &mdash; for  example, birth and death rates &mdash; as well as general information about the health  and well-being of people in the community.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The General Register Office (GRO) has been involved in a  process of continuous development of the civil registration framework,  including legislative reforms such as the Marriage (Northern Ireland) Order 2003. The  Civil Registration Bill is now being introduced to deal mainly with reform to  the registration of births and deaths. The previous piece of civil legislation  to cover births and deaths, the Births and Deaths Registration (Northern Ireland)  Order, was made in 1976. The Bill introduces new procedures to reflect changes  in society, address some issues of existing concern, and maximise the use of  technology for the benefit of both the registration service and the customer.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Allied to that, advances in information technology have  already allowed the GRO to deliver an improved service to users. Since 1997,  the actual registration of vital events has been computerised, allowing the  more efficient production of certificates by local offices. The GRO&rsquo;s own  computer system has been overhauled and updated to provide a  certificate-production process with direct electronic communication to all  local district registrars&rsquo; offices. The updated system links the GRO to all 26  district council areas and provides both a secure system for the registration  of life events and a reliable mechanism for the exchange of data between the  GRO and the 26 district registrars&rsquo; offices. The data that are held on a  central database in the GRO now give local registration staff access to all Northern Ireland  indexes from 1845 and full registration records from 1997.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The effort that has been put into updating and developing  significantly the computer system has resulted in a more efficient,  outward-facing and easier system for citizens to use. That success has been  recognised in the receipt of Charter Mark awards on four occasions since 2000.  A trained, committed and competent workforce was also essential and, indeed,  the General Register Office has won several Investors in People awards.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The current system thus provides the GRO with the  infrastructure that is required for future development that will improve, yet  further, the service that is provided to the public. The associated legislative  change that is required to achieve that, which comes before the Assembly today,  represents the last, but essential part, of the process. The Bill has been  subject to detailed consultation during its development, having undergone two  full consultation exercises. The Bill does not impose a financial burden on any  party, nor does it have an adverse impact on any section 75 groups. There are a  variety of detailed measures in the Bill, but rather than addressing each of  those separately, I will group them in several areas and refer briefly to each  one.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">First, there are several proposed service improvements for  customers, some of which are worth noting in more detail. One of those will  allow the registration of any birth or death at any register office in Northern Ireland.  For example, a birth can currently be registered only in the district of the  birth or in the district in which the mother lives. Removing that restriction  will facilitate a more customer-orientated approach.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Another proposal will allow the General Register Office to  introduce regulations &mdash; at an appropriate point in the future &mdash; that will allow  registration using electronic links without an individual having to physically  attend a register office. Of course, controls of any such technical solution  that may be implemented will comply with Government guidelines and standards on  the security and transfer of electronic information. The systems will have  industry-standard security features built in. There will also be stringent  online validation checks to ensure the validity of the registration and the  subsequent integrity of the records. However, I stress that face-to-face  registration with a registrar will always remain an option.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">A further measure will encourage the inclusion of unmarried  fathers on birth certificates. Currently, when a child is born to named  parents, the husband&rsquo;s details are included on the certificate unless he is  shown not to be the father of the child. If a couple are unmarried, joint  registration is required to ensure mutual consent, particularly as registration  of the father&rsquo;s details confers automatic parental responsibility rights.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">To encourage details to be included on the child&rsquo;s birth  entry in the future, it is proposed that fathers &mdash; if they so choose &mdash; will be  able to attend the register office separately. If, however, the father  registers the birth of a child before the mother does, the mother&rsquo;s position  will be safeguarded by delaying the finalisation of the registration until she  verifies the information provided.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Changes are also being introduced in relation to the  correction of registration records and the facility for changing a name or  surname. The system for the correction of errors and omissions in registration  records is complicated and can often lead to the implementation of complex  formal procedures to correct even minor typographical errors or omissions. All  amendments are made via an annotation to the entry, and the annotation is shown  on any certificate that is produced subsequently.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The proposed changes will allow for a more efficient and  less complicated method of amending straightforward errors &mdash; such as the  incorrect spelling of a child&rsquo;s name &mdash; and will enable the GRO to carry out the  amendment by computer. Copies that are produced after the amendment is  completed will contain only the correct information. A clean certificate will  be provided for the customer, but the GRO will maintain a full audit trail of  all amendments to registration entries.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Individuals who wish to change the names on their birth register  entry must produce documentary evidence to show that they have used their new  name for at least two years. At a time when more comprehensive steps are being  put in place to combat fraud, it is difficult to get banks, schools, etc, to  register the new name in their records. Under the new proposals, the  requirement to produce documentary evidence will be dispensed with and a  universal name-change procedure will be put in place from birth onwards.  Departments will also be able to check the GRO&rsquo;s database, which will contain a  full audit trail of name and/or surname changes, when the digitisation of GRO  records is complete.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Additionally, the legislation includes plans to introduce  commemorative certificates for occasions when people want a special certificate  to mark a special event, such as a wedding anniversary or a particular  birthday.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The legislation will also introduce a second range of  proposals which, although important, will not affect many people. It is  proposed to extend the period in which a stillbirth can be registered from  three months to 12 months, and to enable an unmarried father to register a  stillbirth without the mother being present.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">A stillbirth is always a sad and traumatic event, and the  three-month registration period is, sometimes, not sufficiently long for  parents. The inability of the unmarried father to enter his details as the  father on the stillbirth register is also a source of distress, particularly if  the mother of the stillborn child is ill.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Some individuals are concerned about the inclusion of the  cause of death on a death certificate. Such information, which is not required  for certain purposes, such as closing a bank account, can create sensitivities  for relatives. To address that concern, the legislation will provide for the  purchase of an alternative form of death certificate that excludes the cause of  death. As I said, such matters may affect only a small number of people, but,  in those circumstances, they are important.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">A range of efficiency measures will also provide customer  service improvements. I have already said that the digitisation of records is  being progressed &mdash; not least because the GRO is still working with paper  records that stretch back to the mid-nineteenth century. Digitisation will  allow the GRO to preserve the paper records under proper conditions, and result  in a fully computerised system. Legislation is required to facilitate the  optimum use of such computerised records, and the Bill provides for that by  allowing information from other mainly Government sources to be checked against  the GRO database.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">As a result, customers will find it easier to engage in a  range of transactions with Departments. For instance, someone who wants a  passport will no longer be required to go to the GRO for a birth certificate  and submit it to the Passport Office for processing. Instead, that person will  be able to provide all the necessary details on his or her passport application  form to allow the Passport Office to provide information for checking against  GRO records, thereby streamlining the process. Such electronic checks against  registration information by other Departments will also reduce the number of  certificates in circulation and, perhaps, remove them completely in the future.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">To assist the public further, the legislation will enable  customers to ask the General Register Office to notify certain organisations of  an event such as a death or a name change; that will save the customer having  to supply individual paper certificates to each organisation. The GRO envisages  supplying such information to Departments, banks, building societies, pension  companies and so on.</p>
          <p class="TimePeriod">10.45 am</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">One of the General Register Office&rsquo;s most valuable resources  is its repository of about eight million records dating from 1845, which are a  unique genealogical resource. The use of that resource has been encouraged and  the service is becoming increasingly popular with family historians and with  the general public. At present, only the indexes are available for inspection,  and anyone wishing to avail of information from the register must purchase a  certified copy of the entry. The legislation will allow certain records to be  made available on the internet, albeit with suitable safeguards.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The GRO proposes to restrict internet access to what are  termed historic records; in other words, a period must elapse before those  records are made available &mdash; 100 years for a birth record, 75 years for a  marriage record and 50 years for a death record. There will be a search  facility for those indexes, but the system will not allow for casual browsing  of the register entries; secure firewalls and authentication will be built into  the system to prevent misuse. A similar system to that which we are proposing  has been operating successfully in Scotland for some time.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">To assist genealogical enquiries further, the legislation  will provide for the creation of a record of Northern Ireland connections. That  will enable individuals who have a connection with Northern   Ireland, for example a parent or grandparent born in Northern Ireland, to register life events that  occur outside Northern    Ireland. Although such registrations will  not have any legal standing, they would be a valuable additional resource for  family histories.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Similar provisions in Scotland have generated considerable  interest. There are plans to launch that system in Scotland at the beginning of 2009,  and I trust that we can follow suit. In all those cases the costs will be paid  for by users &mdash; there will not be an additional demand on the public purse.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The legislation contains technical provisions, including  the delegation that the registrar general can give to other GRO staff and some  matters of general legislative clarification. Consequential changes will result  from the facility to allow registration in any registrar&rsquo;s office, or for any  registrar to be able eventually to issue certificates from local offices that  cover all of Northern    Ireland.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I trust that I have provided Members with sufficient detail  of the principles that underline the legislation and what will be achieved by  its introduction. Some of its benefits will be widespread; others &mdash; while no  less important &mdash; will focus on the needs of a small number of people. Together,  those changes will allow the General Register Office to make best use of technological  advances while ensuring that suitable safeguards are maintained. The  legislation will create a more efficient and effective General Register Office  service that will reduce the opportunity for fraud.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, the Bill will provide easier access to historic  records, which will further facilitate those with an interest in genealogical  enquiry and family history. I commend the Bill to the Assembly.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Finance and Personnel (Mr McLaughlin)</strong>: Go raibh maith  agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for explaining the general  principles of the Bill and I welcome today&rsquo;s debate. On 24 October 2007, the  Committee for Finance and Personnel received an oral and written briefing from  departmental officials on the background to the Bill, including the proposals  to reform registration services.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee recognises the vital role that civil  registration plays in securing and protecting basic human rights and  entitlements. The Committee is aware that a more flexible legislative framework  for civil registration is required and that the purpose of the Bill &mdash; as  outlined by the Minister &mdash; is to provide improved service delivery, better  access to services and information, as well as introducing new and more  responsive services.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Committee members were briefed on a range of issues,  including the outcome of the consultations undertaken by the Department of  Finance and Personnel (DFP) in 2003 and 2006.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">As set out by the Minister this morning, the key provisions  in the Bill include: the removal of geographic restrictions to provide greater  choice and more flexibility in registering vital events; changes to procedures  for altering registration records; the introduction of an abbreviated form of  death certificate; the provision of commemorative certificates for memorable  life-events; the provision of electronic sharing of registration information on  births, deaths, marriages, and civil partnerships, with all relevant Departments  and nominated organisations; and the provision for greater public access to  civil registration records.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Members of the Committee for Finance and Personnel received  an update on the progress of the Civil Registration Bill on 28 May. Committee  members raised a number of issues with the departmental officials at the  briefing session. Those included the potential threat to data security arising  from increased public access and the increased risk of the fraudulent use of  personal identity information &mdash; and I am pleased to note the assurances given  by the Minister this morning.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Other issues raised included the security capabilities of  the bespoke computer system, given the risk of system hackers etc &mdash; and, again,  the Minister has provided assurance about that. There are also the potential  risks involved in the removal of the need for reproduction or replacement  registers to be authenticated by the signature of the Registrar General; some  potential problems with the alteration of existing legal records and  abbreviating death certificates; the potential resource implications for the  registration service&rsquo;s having to cope with higher volumes of work as a possible  result of the reforms; the potential range of subject areas for commemorative  certificates; the possible use of electronic signatures to permit remote  registration; and the potential for sharing registration data in applications  for Irish as well as UK passports.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee recognises that the public will welcome the  changes introduced by the Bill. Sharp focus must be given to data security and  fraud detection given the current climate of concern around those significant  issues. As part of the scrutiny of the Bill, the Committee will carefully  consider the various measures and safeguards which will need to be taken to  ensure that a robust system is in place to protect the public from the risks of  data disclosure and fraud. The Committee will be greatly reassured by the  response from the Minister and the Department to the issues that have already  been identified. Overall, the Committee was satisfied with the briefing and  clarification provided by the Department, and members will continue to engage  with DFP officials and other stakeholders on the details of the provisions in  the Bill during the Committee Stage. On behalf of the Committee for Finance and  Personnel, and on behalf of Sinn F&eacute;in, I support the motion.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy  Chairperson of the Committee for Finance and Personnel (Mr Hamilton)</strong>: I  support the Bill. In this part of the world, civil registration is a 160  year-old service. Therefore, it is an opportune moment in which to recognise  the service that the General Register Office provides, and has provided &mdash; not  just by collecting information about the society in which we live, but by  offering protections in respect of names, identities, parentage and inheritance  rights as the Minister has outlined in his statement.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The service may be over a century-and-a-half old, but the  system is not as archaic as that. It is important that the system is updated on  an ongoing basis, and the Bill seeks to do that by reflecting changes in family  circumstances or by adapting the system to take account of technological  advances. Most importantly, the Bill recognises the need for civil registration  to provide an improved service to its customers, the people of Northern Ireland.  That can be seen in the greater choice of places in which a birth or death can  be registered, and in the prospect of electronic registration, which is  extremely user-friendly. An improved service is also reflected in simple,  straight-forward aspects of the Bill, such as the commemorative certificates  for significant life-events, as well as improved access to the register.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Much mention has been made of genealogy, and that is  something that has a wider impact than in Northern Ireland &mdash; people from  around the world want to trace their roots here.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">However, the importance of the Bill extends beyond  technological changes and improvements to customer service. The sensible  changes that it introduces to highly sensitive situations should be warmly  welcomed. I refer to the abbreviated form of the death certificate that omits  the cause of death. That is a useful option in some circumstances, such as when  people wish to close a bank account. In such circumstances, the details of the  death are not required on the certificate, and the ability to purchase an  abbreviated death certificate will be appreciated.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Also, as the Minister mentioned, the Bill proposes  significant changes to the registration of stillbirths, whereby they can be  registered anywhere, and the period of registration is extended from three  months to 12 months. Everyone can appreciate and understand the need for an  extension in such circumstances. Another important change is that the father is  able to register a stillbirth without the mother having to be present. Everyone  understands the sensitivities of such a situation and, therefore, why that is a  good and useful change.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">All will warmly welcome the wider sharing of registration  information throughout Departments. Everyone is, at times, frustrated by the  inability of Departments or Government agencies to share or swap information  that would be useful or facilitate better customer service. The impact on  passport applications is particularly welcome, and I hope that that will speed  up and transform the service and make customers feel more valued.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Only one area of the legislation gives rise to caution that  all Members will share. The Minister touched on the issue, and I echo what the  Chairperson of the Committee for Finance and Personnel said about sensitive  information. All information that is held by the General Register Office is  sensitive, in some cases extremely so. Robust measures must prevent that  sensitive information from falling into the wrong hands through any means.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the Bill, and I join all Members in looking  forward to its passing the further legislative stages.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: I  also generally welcome the Bill that updates the Births and Deaths Registration  (Northern Ireland)  Order 1976. Much has changed in the world since 1976. People did not even have  PCs then, but now, PCs, the Internet and intranet mean that it is now possible  to link the registration system in the way that the Bill proposes. In addition,  there have been many changes to people&rsquo;s lifestyles and movement since 1976.  People tend to travel further to work and have access to cars. The proposed  arrangements mean that people will not necessarily have to take a day off work  to register a birth or death; they can go to a register office that is close to  their workplace rather than to the office that is closest to where they live.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill proposes greater flexibility in the registration  of births and deaths, and I welcome that general improvement in service access  for citizens. The Bill mentions the consideration of the registration of deaths  by electronic means rather than by attending a register office. I sound a note  of caution there, particularly given the increase in electronic and identity  theft. At Committee Stage, Members will have to examine carefully how that  system will be protected. No Member wishes someone to suffer through others&rsquo;  inappropriate acquisition of information. I look forward to discussions on the  subject at Committee Stage.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill proposes considerably greater access to dated  information that will be of great interest to families who wish to trace their  genealogy. The proposed limits protect personal information from being released  at an inappropriate time: information on births will be released after 100  years; on marriages and civil partnerships, after 75 years, and on deaths,  after 50 years.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the release of that useful information. Its  availability may encourage additional tourism, as people are increasingly  interested in their family histories. I hope that, after having traced family  roots online, people might travel to Northern Ireland and make  connections with members of their extended families who live here.</p>
          <p class="TimePeriod">11.00 am</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I also welcome the proposals for the abbreviated death  certificate, which will ease the difficulties of families at times of tragedy.  The Bill allows greater flexibility for those families who have suffered as a  result of a stillbirth. That is an important area, and the Bill will allow  parents to record information that is important to them and to the family in a  flexible manner at such a sensitive time.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the Bill generally, and look forward to  considering it in further detail in Committee.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>: I  also strongly support the general principles of the Bill.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee for Finance and Personnel received a briefing  on the Bill from the Registrar General. The Committee&rsquo;s questions were answered  in a way that gave confidence to the members that the measure was sound and  would improve this important service. I wish to put on record that, given the  importance of this service, the general satisfaction of the public speaks for  itself.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill deals with vital events in people&rsquo;s lives: births,  marriages, deaths and civil partnerships. They are important events, and they  can be distressing and require sensitivity. The Minister made reference to  stillbirths, and all Members have come across cases of sudden or accidental  death and suicide. All those matters are dealt with by the General Register  Office, and it is important that a system is in place that deals well with such  important and sensitive events.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I will make one brief comment on a matter that is, strictly  speaking, outside of the Bill and on the general system: in co-operation with  the General Register Office, district councils do a good job in providing this  service. It is very important that the physical premises that are used for this  purpose provide for the proper level of sensitivity. It would be useful for the  General Register Office to have regard to that.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister gave reasons why the Bill was necessary to  meet the needs of contemporary society. It provides for more choice and  flexibility, and that will lead to an improved service and take advantage of  modern communication technologies. I support all of that wholeheartedly.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Family relationships and social circumstances have changed  greatly, and the Minister referred to the need that can arise for father and  mother to register separately. People are not always as fixed in their  situations as they have been; it is advantageous for them to be able to  register from other places. The ability to alter records retrospectively is  also an advantage.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Clearly, the General Register Office has taken account of  points that were made and has identified necessary changes. Like other Members,  I welcome the abbreviated form of the death certificate, which omits the cause  of death. In providing commemorative certificates, the service has listened to  the demands of the public and responded. I also welcome &mdash; with the caveats  expressed by other Members &mdash; the electronic sharing of registration  information. People have legitimate concerns about the growing accumulation of  information held by Government. Data security is one such concern; however,  there is also the feeling that Government know too much about the affairs of  individuals and that it is too easy to share information.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Those things must be examined very closely in the future.  In principle, the sharing of information is a good idea, as it will enable  better government and will provide a better service to the public; however, I  endorse the remarks made previously in relation to data security.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I repeat, I offer my full support to the principles of the  Bill.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  support the Bill and endorse its broad principles. At the outset, I pay tribute  to the work of the Department, in particular the Registrar General and staff,  for their work in preparation of the legislation. The process of preparation  was extremely thorough, and we in the Committee for Finance and Personnel were  impressed by the detail of the information presented and the breadth of the  knowledge of those staff members.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill is a modernisation of the law and reflects the  changing circumstances of society. It introduces a greater degree of  flexibility, taking into account the changing nature of family units and the  move away from the standard, nuclear family. Furthermore, it recognises our  present working and living patterns. When registration was introduced in Ireland, over  160 years ago, most people were born, lived and died in a smaller radius. Now  our lives take place across a much wider geographical spread, in and beyond Northern Ireland.  The Bill provides more flexibility and choice, which should be welcomed.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Also embodied in the Bill is an acknowledgement of the need  to handle information in a more sensitive manner, particularly in relation to  the tragic circumstances that can surround birth and death. There is a further  acknowledgement that information should be provided only on a need-to-know  basis, and that unnecessary information is not made known to bodies that do not  require access to it.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome, too, the envisaged co-operation among different  agencies in the Bill. However, given our particular circumstances, we must look  at that co-operation in the context of the all-island dimension in which we  operate, and in which many of our residents lead their lives. It is relatively  easy for agencies based in Northern Ireland  to co-operate, and co-operation currently exists between Northern Ireland  and UK-wide agencies such as the Passport Office.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The most obvious need for that co-operation between  agencies North and South is in relation to the obtaining of Irish passports &mdash;a  common occurrence for residents in Northern Ireland. We must decide whether we  can enter into protocols with the Irish Government that will dictate how we  handle information. That will make the process of applying for an Irish  passport easier and more straightforward, not least in relation to the  verification of identity.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The main issue that must be discussed as the Bill enters  the Committee Stage will be its impact on information security and the  avoidance of fraud. That should not, however, detract from the broad welcome  that has been afforded to the legislation. More detailed work must be carried  out in that area, but, in the broad sweep, the Bill is sound.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">It is a sad reality of the world that people seek to commit  identity fraud. Added to that, we have the ongoing threat of domestic and  international terrorism, and the impersonation of individuals is a tool that is  often used to perpetrate such wicked acts.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">It is important to avoid a situation that enables false  birth certificates to be used as &ldquo;breeder&rdquo; documents for other forms of ID. In  welcoming the legislation, the Alliance Party looks forward to the Committee  Stage, and to the Bill becoming law.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McQuillan</strong>:  I welcome the Second Stage of the Civil Registration Bill.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Many people believe that an overhaul of the present system  is long overdue, and that is exactly what the Bill is intended to provide.  Members of the public and some staff find the existing system cumbersome and  will welcome modernisation. The Bill will ensure more flexibility and wider  choice of registration. For those who have to deal with business following  someone&rsquo;s death, the planned abbreviated death certificate will be a welcome  and practical alternative to the full version.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">On a more cheerful note, the provision of a commemorative  certificate will serve as an added memento of events in people&rsquo;s lives.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">One welcome change is the greater access afforded to the  public that is envisaged under the Bill. That should reduce the hassle and  expense of accessing information, and go some way towards meeting the needs of  today&rsquo;s society.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">However, will the Minister clarify how registrars will know  whether a birth or death that occurs in their area has been registered in  another district, and what are the current arrangements for public access to  information on registration records?</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: I,  too, welcome the Bill, not least for the advantages that it confers on Members.  There are many in this House who, from time to time, have their parental  legitimacy questioned by irate members of the public. We will be in a position  &mdash; and I do not want to stray into unparliamentary language &mdash; to disprove  allegations of illegitimacy more efficiently and effectively.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the flexibility provided by the Bill. Dr Farry  said that the pattern of lives in Northern Ireland has changed  greatly in the past 160 years. My own grandfather comes to mind; he spent  virtually his entire life in Northern Ireland,  apart from a day-trip to Castle Kennedy in Scotland, which he sometimes  referred to as his &ldquo;foreign service&rdquo;. There may be Members sitting on the  opposite Benches who would also regard that as foreign service. Indeed, my  grandfather never set foot inside the Irish Republic.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">There may be much to commend that older, traditional  lifestyle, but the changing and more flexible pattern of life must be  recognised. Consequently, much of the Bill mirrors what is happening in modern  life.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">It is rare, but useful, to debate a piece of legislation  that is inherently designed to be sensitive towards people&rsquo;s lives. That is  reflected in two proposals. The shortened death certificate, which can be used  for official purposes, will avoid unnecessary distress to families, who may not  want to carry around a certificate highlighting a cause of death. The Bill&rsquo;s  provision on stillbirths shows sensitivity particularly with regard to  unmarried fathers and to the extension of the time period for registration.  There can be no greater heartbreak than for a parent to lose a child,  particularly as a result of a stillbirth. Many parents take a long time to come  to terms with the trauma of a stillbirth. Therefore, I welcome the additional  breathing space provided for in the Bill.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The sharing of information between Departments will be  beneficial. I agree with Dr Farry that the sharing of that data must be  maintained in the widest possible context. The opening of genealogical records  will benefit the growing number of people interested in the subject as a family  hobby.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">As some Members have already mentioned, there could be  tie-ins with tourism and the international market, thus maximising the  opportunities presented by interest in the roots of people from Northern Ireland.</p>
          <p class="TimePeriod">11.15 am</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I believe, as other Members do, that the general provisions  of the Bill are to be welcomed. We must ensure that the information that is  held is secure and is not susceptible to electronic fraud. Those of us who have  seen the film &lsquo;The Day of the Jackal&rsquo; will know that one of its premises  involves the theft of a birth certificate and the system being used to obtain  passports. Although that film was set 40 or 50 years ago and involved a  relatively crude device, the current situation with international crime and  fraud is such that we must be particularly careful.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">One of the areas that we must explore relates to  registration being done &ldquo;in the prescribed manner&rdquo;, as stated in clause 1 of  the Bill. During the consultations, a strong desire was expressed to retain  face-to-face registration, and we must ensure that, if we are moving towards a  more flexible position, that desire is addressed. The problem of identity fraud  has been highlighted in relation to bank cards and a range of other devices and  is, unfortunately, on the rise. For example, if, in an attempt to create a  false identity, someone with a similar appearance to me, such as Dr Farry, were  to try to steal my identity &mdash; which has happened on several occasions to both  of us in North Down &mdash; we would have to ensure that the potential fraudsters &mdash;  whose intentions, I am sure, are a million miles away from those of Dr Farry &mdash;  did not succeed in their nefarious activities.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The detailed scrutiny of the Bill in the weeks and months  ahead will prove invaluable. Fortunately, we have a couple of months to prepare  ourselves for the task ahead. However, overall, the Bill meets modern  conditions, applies flexibility, shows sensitivity above all, and is a  much-needed modernisation of the registration system. I welcome the thrust of  the Bill.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I thank, very sincerely, all the Members who have  commented on the Bill during the Second Stage debate, and I welcome all the  remarks that have been made and the support that the Bill has received. Some  general issues, and several specific points, have been raised, and I am happy to  deal with some of those.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">During his very supportive remarks, the Chairperson of the  Finance and Personnel Committee raised the issues of identity fraud and  security, which other Members, on all sides, have also raised. Given recent  events elsewhere, as well as those that have occurred locally, we must ensure  that as much protection as possible is built into the system to prevent  hacking, identity fraud and the misuse of data. The operating systems of the  General Register Office are internal and do not have a public interface.  Nevertheless, as bespoke operating systems, they have industry-standard  protection procedures in place that are kept under continuous review.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Some Members discussed the Bill in the context of  electronic registration &mdash; Mr Beggs and Mr Weir mentioned that, in particular.  That will only be introduced when the appropriate safeguards are in place,  which will include procedures for authenticating electronic registration,  ensuring the transmission of data over a secure network and the subsequent  verification of that data using independent sources before registration is confirmed.  Other public-facing systems &mdash; for example, those facilitating family-history  tracing and genealogical enquiry &mdash; will consist of static images that cannot be  altered.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Associated web-based transaction payment facilities that  allow the downloading of such static images will be subject to industry  standard protocols.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I am aware of the issues that Members raised and am  grateful for their comments on the briefing that was given to Committee members  before the introduction of the Bill. I hope that Members are reassured that, as  the Bill proceeds through its Committee Stage, the issues that they raised can  be explored in detail. The understandable concerns about the holding and storage  of data can be addressed.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Several Members, including the Deputy Chairperson of the  Committee for Finance and Personnel, Mr Hamilton, spoke about the improved  service for customers that will result from a better sharing of information.  For example, applying for a passport will be made easier as people will no  longer have to obtain their original birth certificate. The Bill introduces a  longer period in which to register stillbirths as well as short-form death  certificates. As I said, those measures affect a limited number of people, but  the circumstances for those people can be very difficult. It is important to  take on board what was said in the consultation, and those amendments to the  Bill will be widely welcomed.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Mr O&rsquo;Loan mentioned the partnership between the civil  registration service and district councils, which act as district registration  authorities in their respective areas. I support the excellent job that they do  and trust that that partnership will go from strength to strength.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill relates to births and deaths. As several Members  said, the Bill is the first piece of legislation in that area since 1976. As  the system dates back to the 1840s, it is important to update, modernise and  make the system as user-friendly as possible. In doing so, we must acknowledge  the tremendous work that has been done by the General Register Office and the  Registrar General and all his staff.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Dr Farry mentioned the authorities in Northern Ireland sharing information with those  in the rest of the UK and the  Irish Republic. He used the example of  applications for Irish passports, but the Bill does not address that, because  it is a matter for the passport authorities in the Irish Republic  to determine the desirability and feasibility of such an initiative. Significant  policy, legislative and technical issues will have to be explored in Northern Ireland  and the Republic.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the remarks from Mr McQuillan, who asked a couple  of questions about registrars. In answer to his question about how registrars  will know whether a birth or death in their area has been registered in another  district, registrars throughout Northern Ireland are networked to the General  Register Office&rsquo;s computer systems, which gives them access to all information  about births and deaths that are registered anywhere in Northern Ireland.  Therefore, such problems can be dealt with in a straightforward manner. Members  of the public who want to buy certificates must provide sufficient information  for staff in the General Register Office to identify the record. Alternatively,  the public can search the computerised indexes held at the General Register  Office and, quoting details from the index, apply for certificates. However, no  public access is permitted to the original records.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill addresses important matters, has been widely  welcomed by Members and will be welcomed by people throughout Northern Ireland.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">It provides the legislative framework for a more  flexible and modern registration service that will meet the needs of today&rsquo;s  society.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I look forward to my and my departmental officials&rsquo;  continued engagement with the Committee and with Members as the Bill proceeds  through its various Stages.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
          <p class="Q3Motion">That the Second Stage of the Civil Registration Bill [NIA  20/07] be agreed.</p>
          <p class="H4StageHeading"><a name="3"></a>Health and Social Care (Reform) Bill</p>
          <p class="H4StageHeading">Second Stage</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I remind Members that the debate at Second Stage should be  confined to the general principles of the Bill.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety (Mr McGimpsey)</strong>: I beg to move</p>
          <p class="Q3Motion">That the Second Stage of the Health and Social Care (Reform)  Bill [NIA 21/07] be agreed.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">When I assumed responsibility for the Department of Health,  Social Services and Public Safety in May 2007, I said that one of the greatest  challenges that I faced was how to reform and modernise the health and social  care system so that it is truly fit for the twenty-first century.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The organisational structure for health and social care has  its roots in the early 1970s, and, over the years, various adaptations have  been made to it. In order to address seriously the challenge of improving  health and social care for everyone in Northern Ireland, the time has  arrived for major surgery.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The health and social care system is changing; it faces  ever-increasing demands and expectations. Now, in the year of the sixtieth  anniversary of the introduction of the National Health Service, the time is  right to set a new course for the future.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I want to see a modern, responsive and forward-looking  service with more collaborative working and less bureaucracy. Reducing the  number of trusts is a start towards a more streamlined way of working. However,  we must go further, by redirecting measures to front-line services; eliminating  duplication; enhancing accountability; and improving safety and quality.  Furthermore, the service must become more patient-centred and client-centred,  more focused on prevention and primary care and less focused on  institution-based care. That is what the legislation intends to achieve.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Health and social care services are improving, and there is  strong evidence to support that statement. For example, people no longer have  to wait years for an operation &mdash; waiting times have been reduced to a few  months. Furthermore, trolley waits have been all but eliminated. Changes have  also been made to how services are delivered, with the focus now on prevention,  which means that people often do not end up in hospital, but have access to the  services that they need in their local communities.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">When I announced my initial proposals to the Assembly on 18  February on the way forward for the reform of health and social care, I stated  that a full public consultation would be undertaken. That was because I felt  that it was vital that people throughout Northern Ireland had their say  about such important reforms. That consultation has been conducted, and the  proposals are now before the Assembly. More than 200 responses were received,  which clearly demonstrates the high level of interest that people have in the  health and social care system.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">During the consultation period, my officials and I attended  a series of meetings and workshops, which gave us an invaluable opportunity to  meet with as many interested parties as possible in order to discuss the  proposals in more detail and to hear the views of a wide range of stakeholders.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The provisions in the Bill reflect the issues and points  raised during that consultation. It will allow people to have more of a say  about their treatment and care, and it will enable us to deliver the services  that people expect and deserve. The Bill will also provide for improved  accountability for performance; it will enable us to make the best possible use  of limited resources; it will ensure the achievement of agreed targets in areas  such as waiting times, and it will improve the quality of services that  patients experience on a daily basis. Furthermore, it will help to create more  focused commissioning that is strongly rooted in local communities, which will  drive towards continuous improvement, and it will introduce new care processes  that are more responsive to people&rsquo;s local needs, with less reliance on  institution-based care.</p>
          <p class="TimePeriod">11.30 am</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">It will allow a stronger user voice in the commissioning of  services through membership of local commissioning groups, which will help to  revitalise consumer representation and a stakeholder network. It paves the way  for a more cohesive and co-ordinated approach to health and social care with  improved partnership with local government and other key stakeholders in the  planning and delivery of health and social care.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Health and Social Care (Reform) Bill is a substantial  piece of legislation that will create the structure that will deliver true  reform for the benefit of all the people that we serve.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The key elements of the legislation are as follows. Clause  2 deals with the Department. Its provisions reflect my desire to see a smaller  Department with a much sharper focus on its core responsibilities, which  include developing legislation and policies to improve the physical and mental  health and social well-being of people in Northern Ireland, as well as  determining and reviewing policy, standards and targets.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Clause 5 deals with the framework document. In the new  system there needs to be total clarity about the roles and functions &mdash; at  regional and local level &mdash; of the new health and social care organisations and  the Department. Those arrangements will be specified in the overarching  framework document that the legislation provides, which will set out the roles,  responsibilities and accountabilities of each of the new organisations.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I will also take steps to ensure that the top management  structures of the new bodies are lean and avoid unnecessary duplication by  sharing resources, expertise and accommodation where appropriate.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Clause 7 relates to the regional health and social care  board. The existing four health and social services boards will be replaced by  a single regional health and social care board, which, including local  commissioning groups, will focus on the commissioning of health and social  care, performance management, and improvement and resource management.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">That body will have the authority to act on my behalf in  leading the drive for significant improvements in efficiency and performance to  make services more efficient, accessible and patient- and client-centred.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">To ensure co-ordinated commissioning at all levels in the  new health and social care system, I have also included in the Bill an obligation  on the regional board, when drawing up its commissioning plan, to consult with  and have due regard to any advice or information provided by the new regional  agency for public health and social well-being.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Clause 9 deals with local commissioning groups. I am on  record as saying that effective commissioning is the link between policy and  delivery. The creation of local commissioning groups in the regional board will  involve local health and social care professionals and local government and lay  representatives bringing together their innovation and expertise in identifying  and addressing the needs of their communities and planning services in  partnership with the voluntary and community sectors and with other key  stakeholders.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">For the present, I have decided to proceed with the  existing degree of coterminosity offered by five local commissioning groups  aligned with five trusts and the proposed local offices of the patient and  client council. I will, however, give that matter further consideration when the  local government boundaries are finalised. In the meantime, I expect a high  degree of engagement and partnership among the new health and social care  bodies and district councils within the present local government arrangements  and in line with agreed transitional arrangements.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Clause 12 deals with the regional agency for public health  and social well-being. The litmus test for the success of the health and social  care system will be a renewed focus on prevention, improved public health and  social well-being and reduced health inequalities. I want to see an enhanced  and sustained focus on public health and social well-being, and the creation of  a dedicated agency is the best way of achieving that.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The regional agency for public health and social well-being  will drive the public-health agenda in a way that is not possible under current  arrangements, and it will put public health and social well-being at the core  of the health and social care system.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The new agency will not only incorporate the Health  Promotion Agency but will undertake a much wider range of functions, including  health improvement and development, and health protection. Moreover, it will  have a particular responsibility for promoting improved partnership working  with local government and other public-sector organisations to bring about real  improvement in public health and well-being. The agency will also be  responsible for anticipating the new opportunities that community planning  offers.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">As well as preventing disease, the focus on working  upstream to tackle the underlying causes of ill health and health inequalities  will help to realise the shared goal of a better and healthier future for all  our people by adding years to life and life to years.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The new regional support services organisation (RSSO) that  is detailed in clause 14 will incorporate the majority of services that the  Central Services Agency currently provides. It will also provide a broader  range of support functions for the entire health and social care service. A  further RSSO objective will be to ensure that all users are provided with an  efficient, effective and economic service that is consistent in its response to  changing customer needs and local priorities.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Moreover, I want the RSSO to operate to clearly defined  standards, with measurable performance indicators, and to be equitable when  dealing with smaller health and social care organisations. The Bill will,  therefore, place a duty on the new organisation to put arrangements in place to  that end that the Department will approve.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Clause 16 details the patient and client council. It is  important that a strong and independent voice be provided to represent the  views of patients, clients and carers. I am, therefore, replacing the four  existing health and social services councils with a single, independent  regional body, the patient and client council, which will have five committees  operating in the same geographical areas as the five integrated trusts. I want  that new body to build on the work of the health and social services councils  by combining a powerful, regional voice with a strong, local focus and by  engaging effectively with the patients, clients, carers and communities.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">At this juncture, I will make a general point about the  constitution of the various new organisations. Members will note that, in each  instance, the Bill states that the details of the make-up of each organisation  will be provided for through subordinate legislation. I will take a little more  time to fine-tune my thinking on that. In any event, providing that level of  detail by means of subordinate legislation gives the degree of flexibility that  I consider necessary to enable me to amend those constitutions without further  recourse to primary legislation. However, I assure Members that the subordinate  legislation in question will be subject to full scrutiny by the Assembly.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I plan to begin the process of appointing designate  chairpersons to the boards of each of the main organisations as quickly as  possible so that, from April 2009, work can begin on establishing them in an  orderly fashion. Any such appointments will obviously be subject to  confirmation that the Bill has received Royal Assent. In turn, that will allow  the newly appointed chairpersons to play their part in selecting chief officers  for the new organisations.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Under clause 25, I have decided to transfer the Mental  Health Commission for Northern    Ireland&rsquo;s functions to the Regulation and  Quality Improvement Authority (RQIA). I gave a great deal of thought to that  decision, and I am convinced that the regulatory functions for mental health,  and the protection of some of the most vulnerable in society, can be undertaken  more effectively as part of the multi-sectoral RQIA, which has the resources  and infrastructure to ensure that quality improvements can be achieved.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The reform of health and social care is not about changing  structures for the sake of doing so. I acknowledge that better outcomes for  patients, clients and carers cannot be produced simply by changing the structure  of the health and social care system. However, better structures are vital in  ensuring continuing improvement not only in health and social care services but  in the health and social well-being of the population.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">As a result of the new organisational arrangements set out  in the Bill, I am convinced that we will be able to deliver more effective,  responsive and integrated services that will bring real decision-making to the  heart of local communities and deliver a world-class health and social care  system for the people of Northern    Ireland.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety (Mrs I Robinson)</strong>:  On behalf of the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety I  welcome the introduction of the Bill. As its title indicates &mdash; and as the  Minister has explained &mdash; the Bill will put in place a new structural framework  for the delivery of health and social care in Northern Ireland. Direct rule  proposals to reform and modernise the health and social care system were due to  come into operation earlier this year, but the Minister put those proposals on  hold when he came into office.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Over the past year, the Committee has been pressing the  Minister to reach an early decision on the new structures. I am aware that the  delay in setting out the proposals has been the cause of much uncertainty and  concern, particularly among staff who may be affected by the changes. That is  particularly the case for those working for the health and social services  boards, who have been aware for some time that those boards will cease to exist  in their present form, but with no indication of what will replace them. The  publication of definitive proposals is, therefore, welcome.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">At the beginning of March when the proposals were first  published for consultation, the Minister told the Committee that his target  date for the introduction of the new structures was 1 April 2009. He described  that as a tight, but achievable, target. I believe that it will be an extremely  tight timetable, and I am conscious that a lot of work must take place in the  meantime to ensure that that happens.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee is grateful to the Minister and his officials  for briefing Committee members on 6 March about the proposals when they were  first published, and for coming to the Committee on 29 May to brief it on the  outcome of the consultation exercise.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Health and Social Care (Reform) Bill is an important  piece of legislation. It will certainly be the most substantial shake-up of  existing health and social care arrangements for many years, and it will result  in new structures that are likely to be with us for some time. It is a  once-in-a-generation opportunity and it is important that we get those  structures right.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Following today&rsquo;s debate, the Bill will come to the  Committee for detailed scrutiny. In preparation for that scrutiny, the  Committee has taken evidence over recent weeks from several organisations that  will be directly affected by the provisions; for example, we heard the views of  the Health Promotion Agency and the Institute   of Public Health on the  proposals for a new public health agency. We also heard the views of the  Northern Ireland Local Government Association on the overall proposals,  particularly the key role that local government can play in delivering  services.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Later this week, the Committee will hear from the Mental  Health Commission &mdash; one of the bodies due to be dissolved under the proposals  and whose functions will transfer to the Regulation and Quality Improvement  Authority. We will also be inviting any interested organisations and  individuals to write to the Committee over the next two months with their views  on the provisions in the Bill.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">As the Minister has explained, the Bill will bring about  several new organisations, including the establishment of a single regional  health and social care board to replace the existing four health and social  services boards. The new regional board will have a vital role in  commissioning, resource management and performance management, and it will be  required to set up several local commissioning groups, although the exact  number is not set out in the legislation. The Committee is well aware that  there are concerns about the number and make-up of those local commissioning groups  and will wish to examine the proposals in detail. The Committee will also be  keen to examine how the new board will affect functions currently carried out  by the Department and how that might affect the size of the Department.</p>
          <p class="TimePeriod">11.45 am</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The establishment of a regional agency for public health  and social well-being is an important development; it will replace and build on  the role of the Health Promotion Agency but will have wider responsibility for  health protection and health improvement.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Health Promotion Agency told the Committee that it  views the restructuring proposals as a major opportunity for change. The agency  also stressed that health improvement or health promotion tends to lose out  when decisions are made on pressures on hospital or acute services. That cannot  be allowed to continue. The new agency will provide an opportunity to bring  together different aspects of public health and will give public health a much  stronger voice. As the Institute   of Public Health pointed  out to the Committee, there need to be strong links between the new board and  the new public health agency. The Committee will want to examine how those  links will operate in practice.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Stronger links will also need to be developed between the  new health and social care structures and local government. That will take  place, as the Minister has stressed, through the greater involvement of local  government representatives on the new bodies. Local government must also be  involved in the delivery of services; and the good working relationships that  already exist between local communities and local authorities need to be  developed and built upon to tackle issues such as health inequalities.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Another issue that I wish to mention is the establishment  of the new patient and client council, which will replace the health and social  services councils; its aim is to provide a stronger voice for patients, clients  and carers. The Minister stressed that he wants to see health and social care  services become more patient- and client-centred. The Committee will wish to  hear views from individuals and organisations on whether the new structures can  deliver on that aim.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, as set out in the Budget, the Minister is required  to make significant efficiency savings over the next three years, and the  Committee will be keen to examine the implications of the proposed changes from  that perspective. The question is whether the new structures will result in  less bureaucracy and the more efficient use of resources. A major part of the  reorganisation of health and social care was implemented last year, with the  reduction in the number of trusts. However, the Committee will want to study  the proposals of the Bill in detail. We look forward to hearing the views of  interested organisations. I support the general provisions of the Bill.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs McGill</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I welcome the Minister and his  statement; I do not have it before me, but I was listening carefully. I  apologise for the absence of the Deputy Chairperson of the Committee; she  cannot be here but sends her apologies.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">My party welcomes the general principles of the Bill. The  Chairperson referred to the uncertainty that existed when the details of the  proposed new structures were not available, as there were some delays. However,  things are moving forward and the Bill has reached its Second Stage, and its  provisions will be scrutinised at Committee Stage.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the proposed patient and client council,  particularly given some recent debates in the Chamber. The Minister said  throughout his speech that the Bill is aimed at improving healthcare and the  management of healthcare, as well as improving what happens to the patient, the  client and the carer. I hope that the patient and client council will be an  appropriate mechanism for dealing with the issues that need to be addressed.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">In his speech, the Minister mentioned various  organisations. It is possible that some of the documentation that the Committee  received prior to the debate contained gaps in information on how all of those  organisations would work together and individually. As I said earlier, that  issue must be examined when the Bill reaches its Committee Stage.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I also welcome the commissioning groups&rsquo; potential for  local delivery. I come from west Tyrone where, clearly, there have been  long-standing health inequalities. I do not want to go into that discussion in  the debate; however, it is important that I flag it up.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Although I welcome the Bill&rsquo;s general principles, they must  undergo scrutiny by the Committee. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I am delighted that the Health and Social Care (Reform) Bill has reached its  Second Stage in the House. I congratulate the Minister for that significant  achievement.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The sixtieth anniversary of the NHS has made everyone aware  of the changes that it has undergone during its lifetime. It is right and  proper that that process continues. Today, the challenges that face health and  social care services are different to what they were even 20 years ago. The  Bill will equip the Health Service with the necessary structures to tackle the  challenges of the twenty-first century. Those include the need for a more  patient- and community-based Health Service that must be increasingly focused  on preventative action, as well as on excellent care. I am delighted that the  Bill caters for those challenges and that public healthcare is at the core of  the Minister&rsquo;s proposals.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I am extremely pleased with the way that the Minister has  handled the complex Bill. By reviewing the direct-rule proposals, he has  guaranteed the outcome that is best suited to Northern Ireland. Mrs Robinson and  Mrs McGill mentioned uncertainty. It is vital that the direct rule proposals  were tailored to suit Northern    Ireland. Bearing in mind that devolution has  been restored for almost 14 months only, to get such a result so quickly is a  remarkable achievement by the Minister. I am also particularly pleased that the  Minister&rsquo;s main proposals are maintained in the Bill, which provides the  correct amount of rationalisation, while maintaining local accountability,  patient representation and access.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the single regional health and social care board  that will focus on commissioning resource management and performance  management. The improvements in delivery that the board will bring about must  not be underestimated. A regional agency for public health and social  well-being will have much wider responsibility for health protection and  improvement, and provision to deal with existing health inequalities. The  Health Service now has an obligation not only to treat people, but to give them  the greatest opportunity to improve and to maintain their own health. The  regional agency will provide that function. A regional support services  organisation will improve efficiency of support functions to the entire Health  Service. A single patient and client council, with five local committees that  operate in the same locations as existing trusts, will provide a strong voice  for patients, clients and carers at existing local level, while introducing  necessary central co-ordination and management. The Bill will also create a  smaller, leaner and much more effective Department.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the Minister for his personal input and investment  in the Bill. He should be commended for meeting personally a wide range of stakeholders,  including health and social care organisations and the voluntary and community  sector. I understand that those first-hand accounts helped the Minister to make  his final decisions.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Although I recognise that detailed scrutiny of the Bill should  remain for another time, I ask that the Minister considers the relationship  between the regional health and social care board and the regional agency for  public health and social well-being. Currently, the Bill requires that the  board must consult, and have due regard for, the agency in any decisions.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">However, I urge the Minister to examine the benefit of a  joint signing-off procedure on major decisions to ensure that close  co-operation and a strategic direction for health and social services are  maintained. I strongly welcome the Bill, and I look forward to working with the  Committee and the Minister on its Committee Stage and further legislative  stages.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Hanna</strong>: I  welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement on the Second Stage of the Health and Social  Care (Reform) Bill, and the SDLP supports the general thrust of the proposals.  However, there are many new proposals, and only time and the outworkings of the  various groups will demonstrate positive improvement.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Although we will have to wait to see some of the benefits, I  particularly welcome the Minister&rsquo;s reference to partnerships, because that is  important to the success of the proposals. Formal partnerships and meaningful  communication are essential to ensuring that all decisions are best informed,  particularly between the new single authority and the regional public health  agencies; the representatives of the health professionals, including allied  health professionals; the local councils; and the community health  organisations such as the health action zones and the healthy living centres.  That clear connection between bottom-up policy and delivery in the community is  required to tackle health inequalities and to focus on the prevention of  illness through early intervention.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  I give a guarded welcome to the Bill. I welcome the reduction of bureaucracy,  and I hope and expect that any savings will go to front-line patient care. I  oppose any enforced redundancies in the Health Service. Efficiencies can be  made, but not at the expense of the loss of human resources, which would  perhaps create more risk to patients, particularly to those patients in  hospital. There has already been an increase in hospital-acquired infections,  which has, in my opinion, been caused by cutting corners. That must be  prevented and not repeated in the future.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I want maximum representation from health professionals on  local commissioning groups. That must include the dental profession, which had  been excluded, and local council representatives. I am not happy with the  proposed abolition of the four health councils, because that would give less  input from a local perspective, which would be detrimental to the community,  especially isolated communities. From day one, this exercise was intended to  save millions of pounds. I still have my doubts about whether that will be  achieved, but any savings must be seen to go back into hospitals and healthcare  provision for the benefit of everyone in Northern Ireland.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Buchanan</strong>:  I also welcome the Second Stage of the Bill. The Bill is of great importance to  the structure, provision and delivery of the Health Service in Northern Ireland  for years to come. That delivery must be done in a way that is effective,  efficient and which puts the patient first.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">No one can be in any doubt that, over the past 30 years and  especially in more recent years under direct rule, the Health Service has been  inefficient, cumbersome, overly bureaucratic and greatly lacking in  productivity. Therefore, it is essential that the delivery of reforms of the  health system and structures under the watch of Minister McGimpsey, closely  scrutinised by the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety,  will result in a professionally led and patient-centred service and, as the  Minister said, that it produces a world-class Health Service for our people.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The reconfiguration of the health structures through the  review of public administration means that the focus on prevention and  community-based care is essential. Following on from the Programme for  Government, the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety and the  other Departments decided that they must deliver improvement and modernisation.  As we all know, the cost of providing health services is rising rapidly, so  innovation and cost-effectiveness are essential to improving outcomes and  overall performances.</p>
          <p class="TimePeriod">12.00 noon</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">In order to ensure greater practical input into service  development, it is important to devolve more responsibility to professionals.  That, in conjunction with strong local-level commissioning and the development  of local commissioning groups to provide people with the opportunity to  influence and improve services in their area, is essential. As we examine  structures, there is no doubt that we must establish a more streamlined service  in order to improve efficiency and performance.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Although public health is crucial, I am far from convinced  that another body &mdash; the proposed regional public health agency &mdash; represents the  best way forward. Some Members said that the public health agency and the new  board must establish strong links; however, there is no need for two bodies &mdash;  they should be amalgamated into a single regional health and social care board.  The Minister&rsquo;s proposal that the chief executive of the public health agency  also sit on the regional health and social care board emphasises the fact that  the two bodies should be combined, and I ask the Minister to reconsider his  position on establishing a public health authority, because that level of  bureaucracy is unnecessary.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister is aware that much good work is already being  done by Investing for Health partnerships. A separate regional body could, in  effect, reduce cross-sector working. Equally, the proposed body for support  functions, such as shared finance, recruitment, and information and  communication technology could also form part of the regional board, and I urge  the Minister to reconsider that matter.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The focus on strategic policy, long-term targets and  smaller Departments, combined with a regional board that would be responsible  for commissioning, performance management and the five fully integrated trusts  cannot help but to strengthen linkages between hospitals and community-based  services. However, the Minister should ensure that the services that local  commissioning groups commission are coterminous with the relevant council, or  cluster of councils, and that the single independent regional patient and  client council, as a watchdog with a subregional presence, is also based on  local government boundaries.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Members are aware that Derek Wanless&rsquo;s report, &lsquo;Securing  Our Future Health: Taking a Long-Term View&rsquo;, confirms that funding alone is far  from the answer for the Health Service. Massive year-on-year investment has not  solved the problems in Great    Britain; productivity is crucial. As Wanless  suggested, we must do more with each healthcare pound. In the long term, it is  unrealistic to expect high-percentage increases in health budget allocations.  The key question is not about how much money is allocated at the top, but,  ultimately, what results are achieves at the bottom.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">During the past decade, the number of administrators here  increased by 36%. I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s announcement that administration  will be much leaner under the new system. Hospital activity and overall  productivity here has been proven to be much lower than across the water, and  there are significant variations in unit costs in various trust areas. Moreover,  hospital throughputs and lengths of stay are less efficient here than in GB.  Those factors must be tackled in order to provide a quality service for Northern Ireland  patients.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">In 2005, the Appleby Report demonstrated that productivity  could be improved, and it emphasised the need to eradicate waste. Notably, the  report identified the distinct absence of an explicit performance-management  system, which is regarded as pivotal to achieving improvements in efficiency,  effectiveness and responsiveness. Professor Appleby was critical of the  Northern Ireland Health Service, which he said lacked urgency and suffered from  &ldquo;general drift&rdquo;. Consequently, he identified constant frustration at all levels  and a relative lack of improvement in performance.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Appleby argued that it remains to be seen how providers are  to be held to account for their performance. He also felt that although  partnerships and integration can generate good outcomes for patients and users,  there is a distinct danger that structural reform could fail to provide the  necessary incentive and sanctions &mdash; the &ldquo;bite&rdquo;, so to speak &mdash; to encourage  service providers to seek continually new ways of improving their performance.  We must take note of those comments at this time of reform.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The structural reforms are important, but what is more  important is how the Health Service conducts its work and how it is managed.  Productivity must increase. Performance management is critical, and the  successful reduction in waiting times &mdash; as a result of an initiative that was  introduced under direct rule &mdash; shows what can be achieved. Incentives must be  introduced, with greater management freedoms and sanctions, where necessary, to  discourage complacency in the system. The assumption must be challenged that an  organisation should always be entitled to provide services to a specific  population purely on the basis of geographical boundaries, regardless of  performance or efficiency. The pioneering of projects and incentives should be  encouraged &mdash; if they are successful and cost-effective, they can be extended to  offer a better service in other areas. Staff and management must continually  strive to make improvements, and quality and standards must constantly be  driven up, with appropriate incentives to enable improvements. The reform of  the health system and structures is a challenge for us all, but I look forward  to working with the Health Committee and the Minister in bringing those reforms  to fruition to create what I hope will be a world-class service for our people.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: I,  too, am pleased that the Health and Social Care (Reform) Bill has reached its  Second Stage. Reform is needed in our health and social services, and I am  confident that the Minister&rsquo;s proposals will bring about improvements and  deliver a Health Service that is fit for the twenty-first century, yet moulded  to the needs of the people of Northern    Ireland.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I am extremely pleased that most of the proposals that the  Minister previously outlined have found their way into Bill. I congratulate the  Minister on his handling of the Bill and in particular for his personal  interest and attendance at consultation meetings. I know that the Minister has  been greatly helped by meeting representatives of health and social care  organisations and of the voluntary and community sector. That engagement has  helped to create a Bill that reflects the needs of patients and professionals  alike.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill will create a smaller Department that will be more  robust, leaner and easier to administer. That will result in a greater  proportion of health funding being available for front-line services and a  better Health Service for patients, with reduced funding being absorbed by  Health Service bureaucracy. The Bill contains an appropriate mix of  rationalisation and local accountability, representation and access.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the creation of a regional health and social care  board that focuses primarily on resource management, performance management and  commissioning. That should enable better geographical use of resources &mdash;  certainly better than was possible under the previous boards system that  operated in Northern Ireland.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The regional agency for public health and social well-being  will have a much wider responsibility for health protection, health improvement  and development to address health inequalities than the Health Promotion Agency  had, and I welcome the establishment of that new agency. Prevention and health  education is an increasingly crucial part of the Health Service, and I strongly  welcome the measures that have been introduced to address health inequalities.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The creation of a single patient and client council must  also be welcomed. I have heard criticism of this measure from some quarters,  but I ask this question: where are we to achieve efficiencies so that we can  direct funds to patients? The proposals will enable five local offices to  remain in each of the areas in which the health and social care councils are  situated. That will strike a balance between creating more efficient central  management and strategies, yet maintain local access and accountability for  patients, clients and carers alike.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  How can the Member honestly say that doing away with the four local health and  social services councils will help isolated communities? As one who represents a  largely rural area, how will I find my way to the headquarters of a large  organisation? How will any of my constituents with a health problem find their  way there?</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: To  be able to speak to a local group does not necessarily mean an improved service.  What is important is that areas of genuine concern be taken into consideration,  and an efficient Health Service delivered. If improved local services are  required, those improvements will be more easily dealt with through having a  regional body than through the facade of a local health council. I talked to a  member of a local health council who has a degree of concern about their being  effective. Rather than give the impression that they can engage strategically  and deliver the necessary service improvements, they should be capable of doing  so.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Support services are, perhaps, the unsung heroes of the  Health Service. I therefore welcome the creation of the regional support  services organisation, which will improve support to the front line of health  and social care.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Ulster Unionist Party believes in strong local  democratic representation. I declare an interest as a Carrickfergus borough  councillor, and I am pleased that local government will be involved in Health  Service structures and delivery. Local democratic involvement can improve the  delivery of services and functions. It also gives people greater representation  in the delivery of their Health Service, and that must be welcomed.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I am looking forward to the Bill&rsquo;s passage through the  Assembly, and I hope that the Health Committee will work with the Minister to  make any necessary improvements that may be identified. After all, a  Committee&rsquo;s role is to scrutinise the legislation and to work with the Minister  to improve it.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill is one of the first examples of how devolution is  working for the people of Northern    Ireland. Its proposals will reduce health  bureaucracy and provide improved accountability. They should also result in an  increased percentage of funding being directed at front-line services and in  improved patient care. That must be welcomed.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I congratulate the Minister for his personal involvement in  delivering the proposed improved Health Service structures, which are designed  to meet our citizens&rsquo; needs.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Easton</strong>:  The Bill&rsquo;s objectives are clear and well defined, and everyone will welcome the  focus on prevention and community-based care. Any changes must be  cost-effective and increase productivity, and they must not affect front-line  services. We will, therefore, be watching out for that as the Bill progresses.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Times of structural change, such as this period of reform  of public administration, provide important opportunities for all involved to  review performance and to develop a refined vision in many areas of life in  general, and in public organisations in particular.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">We must keep at the forefront of our thinking the need to  improve and modernise in all areas of Health Service delivery. The Programme  for Government asks for that improvement and modernisation across all  Departments. Health Service costs are rising rapidly, and, in order to improve  outcomes and overall performance, we must emphasise the importance of  innovation and cost-effectiveness in every part of the system. Much can be  gained from devolving responsibility to professionals in order to ensure  greater practical input into service developments.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Nobody knows better the problems facing an organisation  than those who work in it daily. They know the problems and are often able to  provide solutions quickly from the available resources.</p>
          <p class="TimePeriod">12.15 pm</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">A strong local commissioning role is essential if we are to  provide local people with influence over outcomes and give them the opportunity  to improve services in their areas. Any increase in efficiency and performance  will have to be achieved in the context of leaner and more streamlined  services. That will be assisted greatly by the integration process, which will  strengthen hospital- and community-based services. In that context, we can  drive forward the vision of reducing and eventually eliminating waste and  costly duplication.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">We are all aware from our experiences in many areas of  employment that throwing cash at a problem is a poor way to solve it. In a  drive for increased productivity, we must make sound strategic decisions before  spending public funds.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The health budget is huge &mdash; the largest by far &mdash; and a  small percentage increase will absorb a large amount of money. Where do we seek  improvements? We must acknowledge the increase in the number of administrators  in the system. That area will require careful examination. Furthermore, there  are large variations in unit costs in different trusts, and we must consider  carefully the reason for that and for the reasons behind our performance, which  is relatively poor compared with other parts of the United Kingdom.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Appleby Report of 2005 emphasised the need to eradicate  waste and to develop an explicit performance-management system that would  secure the required improvement in efficiency, effectiveness and  responsiveness. The report also stressed the need to use incentives in the form  of clearly defined rewards or sanctions to encourage the innovation and change  process. However, although structural reforms are important and necessary, it  is people and their ideas that will drive an increase in productivity in any  organisation. The quality of people&rsquo;s performance, especially management  performance, will characterise an organisation that is seeking continuous  improvements. The ideas, attitudes, enthusiasm and skills of the people in the  system are the critical factors. Although we recognise the dedication of people  who provide health services, we must demand more in qualitative terms from  every individual and from every part of the system in order to create a culture  of continuous improvement. That is the goal towards which everyone in the  Assembly is striving.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  I welcome the debate, which follows the Minister&rsquo;s announcement, and I  acknowledge the fact that he has moved on with the very important matter of  introducing new structures for our Health Service. Other Members who spoke  recognise that there are too many levels of bureaucracy in the Health Service  and that the Department must be trimmed down. Indeed, the Minister also  referred to a more trimmed-down Department. In that regard, it is important to  consider opportunities for the relocation of public-service jobs in the reform  of the Health Service structures. It would be a major disappointment if the new  structures were put in place at the end of the process but the public found  that all the authorities were based in the greater Belfast area and were still far removed from  the majority of the population.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the measures that are being taken to develop the  local commissioning groups. Members have referred to their membership, which  comprises professionals and elected representatives. They are capable of  dealing with more treatments and procedures than is the case at present. If  such activity is concentrated more in the local commissioning groups, the  burden on our hospital services will, in turn, be reduced.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The establishment of a regional public health agency is a  welcome development. The current situation is unsatisfactory as there are too  many levels of bureaucracy. Public health is handled by several authorities,  including the Department, the trusts and the public health authority. That  results in a diluted message about the importance of public health. Just as the  local commissioning groups will reduce the referrals and burdens on our  hospitals, a good public health agency, through its messages, will act in the  same way and have a similar impact.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Although the Minister mentioned consultations  between the single health authority and the new public health agency, the  latter should have its own executive powers. Public health functions, which are  the responsibility of the trusts, should transfer to the new public health  agency during the development of the new structures. That is the best way to  send out a strong message about public health.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I listened to the views of the Minister and Members about  the patient council, and I sympathise with Kieran McCarthy&rsquo;s comments. The  development process must outline clearly the type of local committees that will  be established, because such committees are crucial in reflecting local needs and  circumstances, which will be overlooked if all authority is vested in a single  body. That is particularly relevant to people in the west, if that single body  is located in greater Belfast.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">New local committees for the patient council must be  developed properly. They should have a recognised status, earmarked budgets,  administrative staff and a local chief to act as a watchdog for his or her  area. If we follow that route, local councils will have some teeth, because,  ultimately, they undertake important functions. The Minister has introduced  many Health Service initiatives; however, some needs remain unmet and must be  reflected by strong, local voices.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I thank Members for their  contributions. The health and social care system is of immense importance to  everyone in Northern Ireland.  At some time or another, everyone will use those services, and, when they do,  they expect them to be available, easily accessible and effective. Members will  agree that we need to improve our ability to address the major public-health  and social well-being challenges that face Northern Ireland. The Health and  Social Care (Reform) Bill provides us with a unique opportunity to improve the  health and social well-being of people in Northern Ireland and the health and  social care services for which we are all responsible. Although much progress  has been made, we must redouble our efforts and effect this change in order to  prevent and reduce illness and disability, save lives, support the increasing  number of people who need our help in the future and maintain our Health  Service.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I am grateful to all Members for their comments and their  universal welcome, in principle, of the Bill, which will now proceed to  Committee Stage. I make no apology for the delay; I understand Members&rsquo;  concerns, but, at this time last year, I was faced with a giant Health Service  authority. That model suited a direct rule Minister but did not reflect the  needs of the Assembly, the Executive or a devolved Minister, regardless of who  that may be in the future.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">One of the stipulations under the Hain model, for example,  was that no elected representatives would form part of the system. That was a  missed opportunity. Therefore, I have taken the time to get things right. As  Iris Robinson said &mdash; and as I have said on several occasions &mdash; this is a  once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to rebuild the Health Service and we must get it  right. The changes that we make must stand the test of time; however, they  should be made in a way that allows the Health Service to evolve. We should not  have to break it to fix it.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Mrs Robinson talked about making efficiency savings over  three years, but I am not sure whether she was talking about the RPA period or  the CSR period. A great deal has been said about over-bureaucracy. Seventeen  hundred administrative jobs will be shed in this exercise, producing a saving  of &pound;53 million per annum over the period of the CSR, which began this time last  year, when the direct rule Administration anticipated having its model in  place. In effect, we have lost nothing as far as those efficiencies are  concerned.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Claire McGill spoke about delays. It is important to repeat  that I make no apology for those delays, which happened because we wanted to  arrive at the right model for a devolved Administration rather than for a  direct rule Administration. I accept John McCallister&rsquo;s points about reviewing  the direct rule model and about commissioning.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Some Members may have missed an important point, which is  that the management and performance of the system is a key element of the  construction of the regional health and social care board. Although the board  deals with local commissioning, it also deals with the key issues of  performance management and improvement. Furthermore, John McCallister made a  point about a smaller Department, which is just as important.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome Mr McCallister&rsquo;s support for a single regional  public health agency. It is important to have a new focus on public health. The  direct rule model for the public health authority would have abolished the  Health Promotion Agency. I felt profoundly that that was a missed opportunity,  very much in line with the need to engage local populations on the matter of  their health. We had to have a renewed focus on public health in order to  tackle health inequalities. That is why there is a proposal for a regional  public health agency. It will not exist simply to offer advice or make the right  noises. It will have an important part to play. I listened to what John  McCallister had to say about the joint sign-off option. He said that the Bill  requires the health and social care board to have due regard for the public  health agency. That may not be enough, and I will actively consider the joint  sign-off option.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome Carmel Hanna&rsquo;s remarks about health inequalities,  about which she has spoken on many occasions. She recognised the important role  that the public health agency will play in addressing those inequalities. I  anticipate that the agency will have its own budget, which will be substantial,  and which will allow it to pursue that agenda.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Kieran McCarthy&rsquo;s guarded welcome of the Bill centred  around the proposed patient and client council. I had a debate about this  issue. We have five trusts in place, and four patient and client councils. The  direct rule model would have abolished those councils in favour of one. I took  the view that we needed one council in each trust area. That meant that there  would be five patient and client councils. Questions were asked about how to  provide a regional voice, and do what Roy Beggs said had to be done, which was  to make it effective. The overwhelming response from the consultations was that  there should be one patient and client council with four committees &mdash;  effectively patient and client councils, each in a local format. Rather than  going in the direction that Mr McCarthy thinks I am going, I am going in the  opposite direction to provide more local input, which was always my objective.  The five bodies will provide an effective local voice in the five trust areas  and will mirror and shadow the work of the commissioning groups, but providing  effectiveness at a local level.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">That is the model. Of course, it is really a matter of how  all the practicalities work out. However, the model will provide a much  stronger focus on, and will give a strong voice to, local areas.</p>
          <p class="TimePeriod">12.30 pm</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Tom Buchanan talked about the need for efficiency and  effectiveness. He is not convinced about the new agency. The new agency will  play a huge role in addressing health inequalities, for example.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Buchanan also talked about the Appleby Report, and he  said that investment is not the answer, but that productivity is the key. He  ought to take a walk through the Ulster  Hospital&rsquo;s ward block or the Royal Victoria   Hospital&rsquo;s maternity  unit. He should look at Craigavon, Altnagelvin or Daisy Hill Hospitals. Those hospitals were all  built in the 1950s or early 1960s. They all failed to get the investment that  they required, and they now need huge infrastructure investment. There are nine  acute hospitals in Northern    Ireland, most of which require major work.  We cannot run an efficient service in inefficient buildings.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Buchanan is fond of talking about the Appleby Report,  but I refer him and the House to the Wanless Report. That report was  commissioned by Tony Blair and Gordon Brown when they took office 10 years ago.  They asked whether Britain  could afford a Health Service that would provide healthcare from the cradle to  the grave, as envisaged by Nye Bevin 60 years ago. The Wanless Report said that  that was possible, provided that the Health Service had investment, was  efficient and engaged the local population in looking after their own health. Those  requirements are very much at the core of my proposals.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I constantly argue that the Health Service requires  investment. I argued that at the time of the Budget consultations, and I will  continue to do so. I make no apology for doing so, either. We must also be  efficient. That is why the new board will focus on performance management and  improvement and on engaging the local population in dealing with issues such as  health inequalities. Engagement with the public will be the driving force  behind the new public health agency. This will all produce a much better Health  Service.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">As Appleby has been mentioned several times, I remind  Members that Appleby said, in 2005, that the Health Service in Northern Ireland was around 9% less efficient  than that in England,  although he later modified and reduced that figure. He also gave an account of  the fact that we do not benefit from economies of scale.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I have already indicated the way in which we will go during  the RPA period. Although major efficiencies have been found, some under  efficiencies have happened since the RPA. Therefore, I must find &pound;700 million  in efficiency savings over the next three years &mdash; 3% per annum. I look forward  to having Tom Buchanan&rsquo;s support for the proposals that the trusts are working  on at the minute.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I am grateful for the remarks of Alex Easton and Tommy  Gallagher, particularly Mr Gallagher&rsquo;s expression of support for the public  health agency. My Department will carefully examine the relocation of  public-sector jobs. All the structures that we envisage require a strong local  presence. Therefore, they cannot be based simply in Belfast.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">When Members have the opportunity to reflect on the Bill&rsquo;s  proposals, they will agree that it represents a positive route towards creating  a health and social care system that the people of Northern Ireland truly need and  deserve.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Once again, I am grateful to everyone who contributed to a  very productive debate on an extremely important piece of legislation.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
          <p class="Q3Motion">That the Second Stage of the Health and Social Care (Reform)  Bill [NIA 21/07] be agreed.</p>
          <p class="H5StageHeading"><a name="4"></a>Pensions Bill: Legislative Consent Motion</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development (Ms Ritchie)</strong>: I beg to move</p>
          <p class="Q3Motion">That, further to the Legislative Consent Motion passed on 26  February 2008, this Assembly endorses the principle of the extension to Northern Ireland  of additional amendments to the Pensions Bill dealing with the Pensions  Regulator, persons working on vessels and persons in offshore employment and  pre-consolidation modifications to pensions legislation.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Before explaining the purpose and need for the  motion, I express gratitude to my Executive colleagues and to the Chairperson  and members of the Committee for Social Development for the expeditious manner  with which they considered my proposal to bring the motion before the Assembly.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The motion deals with the extension to Northern Ireland  of proposed amendments to the Westminster Pensions Bill, which is at Committee  Stage in the House of Lords. We have spoken many times about parity and about  the requirement to seek to maintain single systems of social security, child  support and pensions across Great Britain  and Northern Ireland.  Pensions provide a very good example of the highly integrated nature of the  systems in Great Britain and  Northern Ireland.  Most statutory bodies in the field &mdash; such as the Pensions Regulator, the  Pensions Ombudsman and the Financial Services Authority &mdash; operate on a UK-wide  basis. Similarly, the pension protection fund, the fraud compensation fund, the  financial assistance scheme and the Personal Accounts Delivery Authority were  all established on a UK-wide basis. As a result, a considerable amount of the  relevant legislation is, by necessity, of UK extent.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">As the wording of the motion highlights, this is the second  time that the Assembly has debated the extension to Northern Ireland of provisions of  the Bill. On 26 February, the Assembly approved the extension to Northern Ireland  of a number of provisions of the Bill, such as the setting up of the personal  accounts scheme; the extension of the remit of the Personal Accounts Delivery  Authority; and amendments relating to the financial assistance scheme. This  motion is necessary because further amendments are being made to the  Westminster Bill. Those amendments deal with the Pensions Regulator, seafarers,  offshore workers and pre-consolidated modifications to pensions&rsquo; legislation.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Pensions Regulator was established on a United  Kingdom-wide basis under the Pensions Act 2004. The regulator promotes high  standards of scheme administration and works to ensure that those involved in  running pension schemes have the skills and knowledge that they need. Under the  Pensions Bill, the regulator will have powers to ensure that employers comply  with their duties, including auto-enrolling employees and paying employer  contributions. The Bill will enable the issuing of penalty notices to employers  who fail to comply with those requirements.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Current legislation that extends to Northern Ireland  allows for certain functions of the regulator to be contracted out, provided  that suppliers of services are listed in regulations made by the Secretary of  State for Work and Pensions. The proposed amendment removes the need to  identify specific suppliers of services to the regulator in legislation. That  approach ensures that the regulator has the flexibility to identify a best  value-for-money approach to delivering compliance. Furthermore, the regulator  will be given wider scope to incur expenditure in relation to contracting out.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The second proposed amendment relates to seafarers and  off-shore workers. At present, the Pensions Bill could be interpreted to  include seafarers of any nationality working on any ship in Great Britain and Northern Ireland waters. Those may  include non-UK nationals or non-UK registered ships. Although the broad  intention is to extend the reforms to seafarers and off-shore workers in  appropriate cases, it is recognised that this is a complex area that raises  issues relating to international, maritime and European law. Several of those  issues remain to be resolved. The proposed amendment will, therefore, take all  seafarers outside the scope of the Bill until those issues can be resolved.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill will confer a power on the Secretary of State for  Work and Pensions to make regulations to enable the provisions of the Bill, and  any corresponding Northern    Ireland legislation, to be applied to  seafarers at a later date, but before the introduction of personal accounts in  2012.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Similar provision will be made for off-shore workers, such  as those working on the continental shelf, by way of an Order in Council. That  is necessary, because provisions in the Bill will be extended beyond the UK&rsquo;s normal  jurisdiction. The intention is to ensure that seafarers and off-shore workers  receive equal treatment with land-based workers as far as is possible under  international, maritime and European law.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I am anxious to ensure that seafarers and off-shore workers  from Northern Ireland  benefit from the new pension arrangements in the same way as those in Great Britain.  Until the outstanding issues are resolved, it is difficult to say with  certainty whether some of the matters to be addressed will be within the  legislative competence of the Assembly. It is, therefore, imperative that the regulations  extend to Great Britain and Northern Ireland  to ensure that there will be no gaps in coverage.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The final proposed amendment relates to the power of the  Secretary of State for Work and Pensions to make an Order to amend specified Westminster pensions  legislation to facilitate a further consolidation of that legislation. There  are strict rules on consolidation, which means that changes that alter the  effect of the legislation that is being consolidated or that change policy  cannot be made. A pre-consolidation Order will allow for errors in existing  legislation to be corrected. Furthermore, it can clarify doubts and remove  anomalies in existing legislation prior to its consolidation.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">However, that power is limited to amending legislation that  was in place when the Pensions Act 2004 was passed. The proposed amendment will  update that power to include the Pensions Act 2007 and the current Bill in the  list of legislation that can be amended by a pre-consolidation Order.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">A considerable amount of the legislation on pensions covers  Great Britain and Northern Ireland,  and, therefore, the powers must also cover that geographical remit. Given that  pension matters are transferred under the Northern Ireland Act 1998, the  approval of the Assembly is required for the proposed amendments and their  extension to Northern    Ireland.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Executive considered urgently and endorsed the  proposals for the motion at their meeting on 19 June, and the Committee for  Social Development considered the proposals and expressed its support for them  at its meeting on the same day. I am grateful for the support of Executive  colleagues and of the Committee. I trust that Members will agree that it is  necessary for the proposed amendments to extend to Northern Ireland.</p>
          <p class="B3SpeakerinChair">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr Molloy] in the Chair)</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy  Chairperson of the Committee for Social Development (Mr Hilditch)</strong>: I thank  the Minister for her detailed explanation. As she said, on 19 June, the  Committee for Social Development considered correspondence from the Department  in which it notified the Committee of the Minister&rsquo;s intentions to table the  legislative consent motion on the Westminster Pensions Bill.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">As the Minister said, the motion relates to amendments that  were made to the Bill during its passage through Westminster. The Committee has considered the  amendments and agreed that they should extend to Northern Ireland. The Committee  supports the motion.</p>
          <p class="TimePeriod">12.45 pm</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brady</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for her  statement. It is apparent from that statement that the legislation in respect  of pensions is complex. Mr Hilditch and the Minister have said that the  Committee considered the amendments and were in agreement. The issue of  seafarers and offshore workers has been explained by the Minister, and anything  that protects their rights has to be positive. I endorse the motion.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>:  The Minister referred to an earlier legislative consent motion that came before  the Assembly. At that time, I submitted an amendment that was not accepted by  the Speaker, and I took that to mean that there was a convention of  discouraging amendments to legislative consent motions &mdash; I can understand why  that would be the case. The amendment that I tried to submit highlighted an  issue that was addressed during a subsequent debate. However, it is important  that that issue be raised again, given that the legislative consent motion  deals with amendments that have been agreed or that might be made in respect of  the Pensions Bill.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">There is an acute anomaly that affects a number of  pensioners who belong to a few pension schemes, the most significant of which  involves quite a number of people in Northern Ireland. I refer  specifically to the Desmond and Sons Ltd pension scheme. With just short of 300  members, pensioners who are members of that scheme are suffering a significant  reduction in the pension that they receive. Those pensioners are receiving only  around 53% of their pension entitlement, which they have earned, bought and  paid for. That is happening because they are caught in a calendar warp with  existing schemes.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">When Parliament passed the previous pensions legislation,  everyone assumed that people who belong to pension schemes would be covered by  either the pension protection fund or by the financial assistance scheme. The  Desmond and Sons pension scheme and two other smaller schemes in England  demonstrate that that is not the case. Insolvency occurred in those cases  before 5 April 2005, but the wind-up occurred after that date. Therefore, they  are disqualified from benefiting from either the pension protection fund or the  financial assistance scheme.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">At Westminster,  I have been pressing for amendments, and I tried, during the previous debate,  to urge the Assembly to ensure that amendments are pursued by the Government to  ensure that that anomaly is rectified. I have held a number of meetings and  engagements with Ministers responsible for pensions, including the current  Minister of State for Pensions Reform, Mike O&rsquo;Brien, who has been very  sympathetic. I have relied on members of the House of Commons Standing  Committee to table an amendment, and I have tabled a new clause, all the while  receiving assurances from Ministers that the Government will table an  appropriate amendment in the Lords.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Last week, an amendment was tabled in the Lords that would  have the effect of allowing secondary legislation to deal with some of those  anomalies. I would prefer a more upfront and categorical amendment that would  directly deal with, and dispose of, the issue. I hope that, throughout the  passage of the legislation, the Minister will undertake to use her office and  the representative channels of the Executive to ensure that further amendments  can be made to the Pensions Bill. Those amendments are necessary to provide more  upfront assurances to the workers from Desmond and Sons that they can be  accommodated immediately. If those amendments cannot go that far, strong  assurances must be given that the secondary legislation that will remedy the  problem will follow immediately. We do not want to be left in long pursuit of  that secondary legislation.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the wider comments that the Minister has made  about the importance of the Pensions Bill.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Pensions legislation, by its nature, is more complicated  than any of us would like, but if we are to provide the cover that people  require, it needs to be &mdash; and it must apply on a UK-wide basis.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">A particular anomaly affects the Desmonds&rsquo; pension scheme  in Northern Ireland,  more so than anywhere else. I hope that the Minister representing the Assembly  and the Executive will not be behind the door in pressing the case. These  people need to see justice &mdash; they are carrying a grave injustice. A legal  remedy to the calendar warp would help the financial assistance scheme to be  made available, if this corrective legislation is passed. Those pensioners who  have experienced a serious reduction in benefits would have their situation  made good, and people whose pensions have been deferred would have more comfort  and confidence about the future that they face.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lo</strong>: The  Alliance Party supports the legislative consent motion. We welcome the  amendment to make the office of the Pensions Regulator more flexible and able  to contract out some functions to ensure better value for money. If that helps  with efficiency savings, it will be better for the public purse.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">In the case of seafarers and offshore workers, I appreciate  that theirs is a complicated issue, involving other legislation. I realise that  there has been an assurance that the case would be looked at before 2012, but I  still have some reservations &mdash; perhaps the Minister can elaborate on the issue.  There will be a gap of some years before the matter of the protection of  seafarers and offshore workers is resolved, and they will not be entitled to treatment  equal to that offered to land-based workers. What sort of protection will these  workers have in the meantime?</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I thank Members for their contributions to the debate.  I am particularly grateful for the support of the Committee&rsquo;s Deputy  Chairperson, Mr Hilditch, as well as that of other members of the Committee for  Social Development, namely Mr Brady and Ms Lo. I will return to the comments  made by my colleague Mr Durkan.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">It is right that the proposed amendments outlined earlier  should extend to Northern    Ireland. Seafarers and offshore workers from  Northern Ireland should  benefit from the new pension rights in the same way as their counterparts in Great Britain.  Equally, it is vital to maintain the current integrated system by agreeing to  the amendments to Westminster legislation that  already extend to Northern    Ireland.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I am conscious of the fact that Mr Durkan raised the issue  of the Desmonds&rsquo; pension scheme during the first debate on the legislative  consent motion on 26 February 2008. I assure him that I have been in  consultation with the Minister for Pension Reform in the Department for Work  and Pensions about the position of people affected by the Desmonds&rsquo; pension  scheme. Work is ongoing, but I have been assured that a successful conclusion  will be reached in the near future to extend the financial assistance scheme to  cover schemes such as that in Desmonds. I am conscious that many of the people  involved in the scheme are quite advanced in years and that they need concrete  and categorical assurances that this is going to happen. I will be making  direct contact with the Minister for Pension Reform. I hope to visit London in the next few  weeks to meet various GB Ministers, and that will be one of the issues that I will  be discussing.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I agree with my colleague Mark Durkan that people who  worked in Desmond and Sons have a right to natural justice, and they should  receive a proper and adequate pension. I am happy to re-examine the matter and  pursue it to the bitter end.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that I have answered all the questions that were put  and addressed all the issues that were raised. I agree with Members that the  legislation is technical, complex and difficult to understand. If I omitted to  address any particular point, I assure Members that I will respond to them in  writing.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I commend the motion to the Assembly, and I thank all  Members who contributed to the debate.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
          <p class="Q3Motion">That, further to the Legislative Consent Motion passed on 26  February 2008, this Assembly endorses the principle of the extension to Northern Ireland  of additional amendments to the Pensions Bill dealing with the Pensions  Regulator, persons working on vessels and persons in offshore employment and  pre-consolidation modifications to pensions legislation.</p>

          <p class="H4StageHeading">Primary-School Funding</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Business Committee has agreed to allow up to two hours and 30  minutes for the debate. The proposer of the motion will have 10 minutes to  propose and 10 minutes to make the winding-up speech. All other Members will  have five minutes in which to speak.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I remind Members to consider whether they have any relevant  interests to declare before speaking in the debate.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Education (Mr Storey)</strong>: I beg to move</p>
          <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly calls on the Minister of Education to  urgently examine measures and bring forward proposals which would significantly  increase funding to primary schools.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I declare an interest, as I sit on the board of governors  of Ballymoney Model  Primary School and Ballymoney High School.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">As Chairperson of the Committee for Education, I wish to  highlight some important points in support of the motion. The Committee heard  considerable evidence on the underfunding of primary schools. To reflect how  seriously the Committee regards the issue, I wrote to every Member of the House  on 26 June 2008 and included copies of the most recent evidence to the Committee  from the Northern Ireland Primary Principals&rsquo; Action Group (NIPPAG) and the  briefing paper from senior officials in the Department of Education.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The full record of all the key evidence to date is  available on the Committee&rsquo;s website. I say &ldquo;to date&rdquo; because the matter will  not end with today&rsquo;s debate. I notice that the Minister of Education made a  pre-emptive strike when she took time to issue a press release prior to  evidence being presented to the House. I use the term &ldquo;pre-emptive&rdquo; but, in  light of her previous career and the week that we are in, it may be better  described as a weak-wristed volley that did not climb halfway up the net.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee has agreed to continue its scrutiny of the  issue until, as the motion demands, the Minister introduces proposals to:</p>
          <p class="Q3Motion">&ldquo;significantly increase funding to primary schools.&rdquo;</p>
          <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Any attempt to lob the ball into someone else&rsquo;s  court will not do. The Minister has moved from playing singles to partnering  her colleague John O&rsquo;Dowd in a mixed-doubles team &mdash; I wonder how good he will  be when he comes to the net.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome representatives from NIPPAG to the Assembly  today. I, and other Members, had the pleasure of addressing the entire group of  130 principals in the Long Gallery on 11 June 2008. The evidence from NIPPAG  and other groups, such as the East Belfast Primary and Nursery Principals&rsquo;  Group and the North Belfast Principals&rsquo; Group, is compelling on several fronts.  Information from various sources reflects a significant differential between  primary and post-primary funding in Northern   Ireland and in how primary funding here compares with  other parts of the UK  and beyond.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Officials caution that some statistics do not reflect  like-with-like comparisons. However, the serious funding differential between  primary and post-primary funding is clear, and that is one issue that I want to  highlight to Members today. The Department made the following statement that  includes its own figures:</p>
          <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;After taking account of all funding factors, a  difference, on average, of &pound;1,375 per pupil exists.&rdquo;</p>
          <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Is that acceptable to the House?</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Department of Education told the Committee:</p>
          <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;In developing and introducing the common funding  formula in April 2005, a key focus was to make progress in narrowing the  funding differential between primary and post-primary phases.&rdquo;</p>
          <p class="TimePeriod">1.00 pm</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee accepts that the formula has been revised and  changed regularly to increase the proportion of available resources to primary  schools, without having an adverse impact on other phases of education.  However, that has produced too little, and, to date, it has had virtually no  impact. It is argued that the Minister&rsquo;s efforts to reduce the differential  have resulted in a widening, not a narrowing, of the gap.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">In her statement on the distribution of the education  budget on 12 February, the Minister provided an increase to the primary  age-weighted pupil unit from 1&middot;02 to 1&middot;04 in the 2008-09 budget. That is  equivalent to an average of 4% per primary school pupil and amounts to &pound;102.  Members who have read the evidence of the Northern Ireland Primary Principals&rsquo;  Action Group, which was presented to the Committee on 6 June, will know:</p>
          <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;4% of nothing or very little is not very much&rdquo;.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">That &pound;102 is immediately absorbed by inflationary price  rises, such as the cost of cleaners&rsquo; pay, heating and other running costs,  leaving the staggering amount of &pound;14 per pupil. NIPPAG said that that sum would  buy 20 minutes per day of a classroom assistant&rsquo;s time. Given that there is  clearly a need to produce good results from the revised curriculum and improve  literacy and numeracy standards, is that the Department&rsquo;s best effort to deal  with primary school underfunding?</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">As evidenced in the debate on early-years education in June  2007, an abundance of research proves that investment in a child&rsquo;s early  education pays back, some suggest, sevenfold. Sir George Bain&rsquo;s review points  out that substantial international research demonstrates that levels of pupil  attainment, particularly at the foundation stages of education, and  particularly among low-achieving groups, increase when high pupil teacher  ratios decrease. The post-primary sector obviously benefits when the primary  sector has the resources to do its job right.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">In her press statement, the Minister has pointed out that  her budget allocated an additional &pound;32 million, specifically to support primary  schools in the delivery of the foundation stage of the revised curriculum over  the three-year budget period. Furthermore, over the next three years, the  Department has allocated funding of &pound;12 million specifically to help primary  school principals who teach. That is particularly welcome.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">However, the Committee heard about other funding that is  intended to benefit primary schools in such areas as ICT support. That brings  me to a fundamental point about the structure of the education budget, which  the Committee raised with departmental officials on 6 June. Some &pound;190 million,  which is more than 10% of the overall education budget, is being channelled to  schools through earmarked initiative funding. The Committee eagerly awaits a  paper from the Department on that matter; we understand that there are 57  initiatives, although I have heard that the number being funded in that way may  be as high as 70. They are often one-off, short-term initiatives, perhaps cut off  before they have any real impact.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Last week, I visited the greater Shankill area of the city.  Sadly, and to the shame of the Department of Education, I witnessed children  saying farewell to their special-needs teacher because funding for that teacher  had come to an end. In an area where one is two and a half times more likely  than average to suffer deprivation the only and best thing that the Department  of Education could do is to say to a special-needs teacher: thank you very  much, your services are no longer required; goodbye, and close the door after  you. That is a shame and a disgrace, and it is something that needs to be  addressed urgently. How short-term, how short-sighted, how short-changed is our  education system?</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee has heard much criticism from school  principals about initiatives that often involve a complicated and lengthy  application process and follow-up bureaucracy. Those initiatives also generate  extra administration for the Department and for the education and library  boards.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee will continue to scrutinise the matter and  will press the Department to mainstream much of the funding. Ideally, some of  it should go directly into core funding for primary schools, where school  principals and boards of governors would have the flexibility and discretion to  prioritise the scarce resources to meet their needs.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Education</strong>: On a similar theme, the Committee has asked  for urgent information about bringing the funding that is outside the common  funding formula into the formula and transferring it into core funding for  primary schools. The Committee understands that the Department is examining the  foundation stage and is making a good start on funding in the area. The  Committee will press for urgent action to explore other areas.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The local management of schools steering group is  responsible for the continuous review of the formula. The Committee will  require assurances that any mainstreaming of funding &mdash; or adjustments to the formula  &mdash; are factored in so as to benefit primary schools directly.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, the Committee plans to closely scrutinise the  fundamental review of the formula that is about to begin. We will look at the  scope for taking action to address the underfunding of primary schools.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee is looking for immediate, urgent action. The  Committee will be pressing the Minister and her officials to be proactive and  imaginative in delivering real changes to address the underfunding of primary  schools. Long-term solutions &mdash; such as recycling savings from the creation of  the proposed education and skills authority (ESA) &mdash; remain an ideology that has  yet to see its fulfilment.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I support the motion, and I  welcome the fact that we are having the debate today. The debate is the  beginning of a process that will ensure that we, collectively, garner more  finances for primary school children, principals and teachers.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I will have to examine the Hansard report and unpick the Chairperson  of the Committee for Education&rsquo;s speech to see where the DUP started and where  the Chairperson ended, because it is unfortunate that he used his first  opportunity to table a Committee motion to make a political speech.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The underfunding of primary schools is one issue that  garners all-party political support, and it is one that the primary school  principals have been at pains to ensure does not become a party-political  football to be used by one party against another.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  On a point of order, will the Deputy Speaker rule on the appropriateness of a  Committee Chairperson delivering a party-political statement? It is my  understanding that when one speaks as the Chairperson of a Committee, one must  emphasise the Committee role and not the party-political role.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The point has been made. It is up to the Committee to deal with  that situation.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  The motion refers to the need for urgent examination of the funding available  to primary schools. The Chairperson alluded to one sector of that funding in  the main part of his speech, which is the age-weighted pupil unit. Should the  unit be increased? Yes, it should be increased. However, how do we increase it  in such a way that ensures the continuation of small rural primary schools in  particular? Are we proposing that the only funding source for schools should be  based on that method, or does the entire funding formula need to be  re-examined?</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I believe that the formula needs to be re-examined to  ensure that funding going into primary schools suits the needs of individual  schools. Under the current system, there is funding support for small, rural  primary schools that ensures that they will survive in rural communities.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">When comparing figures from here, England, Scotland,  Wales  or across the border, those figures must be on a like-for-like basis. To ensure  that primary schools here receive more funding, requirements must be identified  using an evidence-based formula. Furthermore, Members must do more than simply  table a motion in the House. We must ensure that the Minister proposes, as  quickly as possible, a funding formula that satisfies the needs and demands of  the current lobby.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The secondary-school sector is also observing this debate  with concern, and wondering whether the extra funding for primary schools is  going to come from it. We must consider primary-school funding in terms of the whole  education system in order to ensure that whatever formula is arrived at is  well-tested and meets the needs of primary schools. In the meantime, if money  is available, it should be injected into primary schools.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I listened intently to the earlier debate during which the  DUP demanded the more efficient running of the Health Service and the removal  of back-room services. I support the primary-school teachers&rsquo; demands, and  their areas of concern must be noted.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">They want more funding to help with administration, and to  give them time out of the classroom so that they can run the schools.  Therefore, the DUP and others must be careful how they make their demands for  an end to administration. It runs counter to the argument made by primary  schools. It is also counter to the argument over health, but that is another  debate. It is correct for primary-school principals to want more time out of  the classroom, because they have become managers as much as teachers. They need  time away from the classroom in order to ensure that their schools are run  correctly.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Chairperson of the Committee stated that the failure to  move ESA on meant that the savings that it was to generate had not entered the  system. ESA has not moved on because the DUP has not let it move on. Therefore,  the funding that was to have been available through ESA can be delivered to  primary schools.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Chairperson referred to his visit to a Shankill Road  primary school that has lost a special-needs teacher. I, too, regard that as a  disgrace. In the past financial year, the education boards handed back &pound;27  million in resources &mdash; that would have paid for a lot of special needs teachers  in Shankill Road  primary schools.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I support the motion.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Education</strong>: Will the Member give way?</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>: I  am almost finished. I support the motion, and I hope that we are at the start  of a process that quickly brings more funding to primary schools.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Academic selection dominates the debate on education. Those who argue for its  removal cite the long tail of educational underachievement. They imply that  academic selection is the major cause of such underachievement, and that its  removal would end many education problems. That is the stuff of nonsense,  propagated by people who see the debate on education as an ideological battle,  a cause c&eacute;l&egrave;bre, and an opportunity to flex political muscles. As such, it  diverts attention away from the real issues.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Underachievement in education does not begin at the age of  11, inequality does not begin at the age of 11, and a sense of failure does not  begin at the age of 11. The challenges faced by society emerge at a much  earlier age. It falls to primary schools to respond to that challenge. Our  primary schools are in the front line of this battle, and they have been asked  to take on more responsibilities with little or no resources.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Department of Education tries to address challenges  facing society in the only way it knows how; it launches one initiative after  another, with ring-fenced finances and centralised control. I am not attacking  the Civil Service for doing what it can to alleviate problems. However, there  is a better way forward. Primary-school leaders must be empowered and  resourced. They need fewer initiatives and more core funding.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I have had the privilege of talking to many primary-school  leaders &mdash; at their conference in Cookstown, in the Long Gallery at Stormont, at  Committee, in schools and in their groups. They speak more eloquently than I do.  Members may have read some interesting statements in the newspapers. In  explaining the difficulty of ring-fenced finance, Martin Short, principal of Holy Trinity   Primary School in  Andersonstown, told me that the Department of Education provided funding for a  new laptop computer for each of his teachers, at a cost of &pound;14,000, and  foundation money, which was also ring-fenced. At the same time, he employed one  classroom assistant for three P2 classes, while having to make two teachers  redundant. That is counter-intuitive &mdash; it does not make sense.</p>
          <p class="TimePeriod">1.15 pm</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Northern Ireland Primary Principals&rsquo; Action Group has  raised the issue of inequality in funding between primary and secondary  schools. Government reports indicate that such a disparity is for historical  reasons. Those who, during other debates, argue about antiquated, outmoded,  40-year-old education systems might take note of that point and deal with  funding inequality.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister accepts the case, as does the Department, but  the Department says that more cannot be done without increasing the overall  fund. That is not a trivial sum. The estimates of &pound;125 million per annum  represent a very significant increase on the budget of &pound;1,000 million. To quote  Mr Short again:</p>
          <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Every political party represented here recognises  that primary-school funding is insufficient. Nobody &hellip; disagrees with that.&rdquo;</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">As Mr Short argued, if we do not do something about it, the  status quo will remain. School principals are asking us, their elected  representatives, to do something about that.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">However, it is not simply a question of funding. Teachers,  as Mr Greer said, complain more about a shortage of time than a shortage of  money. They struggle desperately and are under enormous pressure, as are all  primary-school principals. There has been a massive increase in expectations,  yet very little increase in funding. It could be argued, as Mr Jess told the  Committee, that we have a potentially very good curriculum, but underfunding  means that we cannot deliver it. That leads to one stark conclusion, and I look  forward to the Minister&rsquo;s response.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">If we are to deal with the legacy of the past, with  educational underperformance, with the inability of some of our young people to  read and write when they leave school, with the health of our school leaders  and with preparing our young people for a future, a step change in funding for  primary schools is needed, as is a change of attitude. That cannot be done  incrementally &mdash; that would take too long and is too little, too late. I  sincerely hope that the Minister will introduce radical proposals that enjoy  the support of all her Executive colleagues so that the situation in the  Province can progress.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>:  I talked to all my local schools in preparation for this debate. The effects of  the funding inadequacy are shocking, to say the least. The extent of the  differential is &pound;1,258 a pupil. That is a vast sum of money for any school to  have to make up, but is particularly so for schools situated in an area that  ranks highly on the Noble index.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">If there were no difference in funding, one primary school  in my area would have an additional &pound;484,330. That would have a massive impact  on that school, and &mdash; oh, boy &mdash; what it could achieve with that. The school has  440 pupils, there is 53% uptake of free school meals and approximately 20% of  its pupils are on the special educational needs (SEN) register. However, due to  the funding imbalance, it now faces several major difficulties.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">No additional classroom-assistant support is available for  the most vulnerable children in that school. Children with significant learning  difficulties are moving from nursery into primary 1 but do not meet current  statementing criteria, despite recognition from all the professionals involved  that those pupils are in urgent need of significant support. No funding is  available for emergency situations. Such funding would support pupils who  experience a traumatic and sudden change in circumstances. For example, one child  at the school suffered a very serious eye injury, and temporary additional  support is clearly needed to enable that child to manage his or her new  circumstances. There is no available funding for that, and that child must go  through a protracted statementing process.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">If primary schools had their fair share of resources, they  could deal with such matters immediately. That would be in the interests of the  child, the family, the class and the teacher. That particular school must also  cope with a temporary SEN support teacher&rsquo;s being made redundant. It has  insufficient funds to provide appropriate SEN support for Key Stage 2 pupils  who are operating below the required standards in literacy and numeracy. Unless  that problem is dealt with effectively at primary level, those pupils are at  significant risk of leaving the education system without good grades in those  core subjects.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">There are insufficient funds to refurbish schools &mdash; some  floors and ceilings have not been refurbished for over 20 years because of a  funding shortage. Recently, my grandson had a near miss when a ceiling fell,  moments after he brought the problem to the attention of his teacher.  Thankfully, that school has been rebuilt, but many others have not even been  refurbished.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Essential maintenance is barely catered for, despite it  being exactly that &mdash; essential. Money for such measures must be found. Reduced  expenditure on resources and refurbishment means that some schools operate on  budgets as ridiculous as &pound;15 a pupil a year to save funds for staffing, so that  the maximum individual and group support can be provided where it is required.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">None of the examples that I have mentioned is exaggerated.  Instead, those examples are a sad indictment of the times that we live in.  Where are the better times that we were promised by the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in? When  it voted against the Budget, my party knew that there was not enough money to  deliver all that was promised. The Minister says that she will deliver a better  education system. How? Where is the money to do that? I urge her to be  responsible, lead the way and show that she is a member of the Executive who  will do what she often says she wants to &mdash; put children at the heart of her  policies.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Confusion reigns supreme about the 11-plus, so the Minister  must not allow the sorry state of affairs in primary-school funding to  continue. Children are depending on us to deliver a better way of life for them  through education and, as public representatives, the onus is on us to ensure  that that happens. A lack of funds means less access to education for all  children and, more importantly, for those on the SEN register. How can every  school be a good school when they are all under extreme financial pressure?</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lunn</strong>: The  Alliance Party supports the motion. However, I assume that the Minister is  urgently examining measures to increase funding to primary schools &mdash; in fact, I  am sure that she does that on an ongoing basis. She must bring forward  proposals; however, that will not be as simple as it sounds.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">All the major subjects that are under review will  contribute to an outcome that may provide funds to alleviate the problems  experienced by our primary schools. The sustainable schools initiative,  area-based planning and ESA all have the potential to make savings in the  education budget.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I note the figures that the Northern Ireland Primary Principals&rsquo;  Action Group quote for the deficit in funding between Northern Ireland and the  rest of Great Britain, and the differences of opinion about how wide those  discrepancies are. Is the difference in funding between secondary and primary  education the main issue or, is it the evidence from all sides that,  irrespective of what funding is allocated to secondary education, we do not  spend enough on primary schools and early-years funding?</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Like the other members of the Education Committee, I have  sat through presentations from educationalists and departmental officials ad  infinitum, been to union conferences and private meetings and visited schools.  The most impressive presentations were those from teachers and head teachers at  the sharp end of the system, and the message is beyond argument &mdash; our primary  schools are not given sufficient funds to do the job that we ask of them, and  they are run ragged trying to cope.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">We do not allow enough money for building maintenance,  classroom assistants or special needs. We do not allow sufficient scope for  preparation time, and we pile regulations, form filling and excessive  bureaucracy upon initiatives. I heard that, this year, there are 70 different  initiatives, and the Chairperson said that there are 56 &mdash; I will not argue  about which is right, because they are both disgraceful. Some of those  initiatives involve enormous amounts of time for pitifully small amounts of  funds. As Basil McCrea said, we require core funding, not initiatives.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Money should be allocated on the basis of need, not by  random formulae. I do not care how scientific the funding formula is, it is not  doing its job, and we are failing our teaching professionals, our youngest  children and their parents. I cannot think of any aspect of our primary  education system that is regarded as satisfactory by those who work in it. The  pressure that is being imposed is driving good people out of the teaching  profession.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Alliance Party&rsquo;s long-term solution will not surprise  anyone; the costs of running a segregated system are indefensible. Whether our  estimate of &pound;1 billion or the higher figure quoted by Deloitte is accepted,  there is an enormous waste of resources, and a lot of that must apply to  education.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I have noted a gradual acceptance in recent times of that  fact by other parties, and indeed, Members. Even the new Chairman of the  Committee for Education has revealed his Alliance  credentials by recently acknowledging that point. He has brought a welcome  breath of fresh air to the education debate, which was good to see. The First  Minister has also obliquely acknowledged our argument. He may argue about the  amount, but whatever it is, it is substantial and is there to be saved.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Action, as opposed to a quick fix, is required for a  sustainable remodelling of the system. Those who work in primary schools will  continue to hold the line, provided that they can see light at the end of the  tunnel. The sooner the Minister can draw all the strands together and present a  cohesive plan, the better. She will have our support for the constructive  reform of educational funding and structures, and, in particular, as  highlighted by today&rsquo;s debate, for primary-school funding.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Miss Mcllveen</strong>:  We have heard a great deal about statistics already. However, sometimes it is  easy to forget about the human issues when facts and figures are thrown about.  The Committee for Education heard from primary-school principals who told us  about the financial realities that they face in managing a school. I visited  primary schools throughout my own Strangford constituency, and, along with  party colleagues, I went to several primary schools in north and west Belfast only last week.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I am sure that many Members have received letters that are  similar to the many that have been posted to my office. Headlines last week  told of the high levels of absence among teachers, which results in part of the  education budget being used to pay substitute teachers. This year alone, 18,698  teaching days have been lost because of stress-related illnesses. Given the  conditions under which many primary-school teachers have to work, I find myself  echoing Frank Bunting of the Irish National Teachers&rsquo; Organisation (INTO) in  saying that I am surprised that the figure is not higher.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I am aware of schools in my own constituency that have had  their extended-schools funding removed and now have to rely on parent-teacher  associations (PTA) to raise funds. Parents are willing to do that because they  care about their children&rsquo;s futures. As a result, they are prepared to go that  extra mile to help, tough as that is in today&rsquo;s economic climate.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The East Belfast Primary and Nursery Principals&rsquo; Group  identified several areas in which core funding is grossly inadequate,  including: no release time for teachers; a lack of administrative support; no  ICT support for primary schools because they cannot afford it; an inability to  afford technical and classroom assistants&rsquo; support; a lack of pastoral-care  support; poor special-needs provision; and a poor level of resourcing. Such  issues are not exclusive to East Belfast.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">One school that I visited could not afford a part-time  secretary, and the principal was left to fulfil that role on top of her other  duties. The Minister needs to address such problems before she can call every  school a good school.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Schools are often forced to teach large composite classes  as a result of laying teachers off in order to meet their budgets. They are unable  to invest in the resources that are needed to teach the revised curriculum. It  seems grossly negligent to me that a new curriculum is implemented when schools  are ill-equipped to cope with it. There is embarrassment if schools get into  debt, which is an additional burden that principals have to carry. Essentially,  the principal is left to try to make terms meet.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">As we heard, additional funding is available through  departmental initiatives. However, principals apply for such initiatives only  to find that the funding is stopped before any real benefits are realised.  There are times when as much as &pound;14,000 is spent on computers because the money  needs to be spent; however, principals are aware of areas in which such money  could have been much more beneficial. Principals are being distracted from  their real jobs by having to chase funding for their schools.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">One member of the Committee described the Department&rsquo;s  initiatives as being like using a plaster. It is time that the Minister and her  Department started to treat the illness rather than applying first aid. There  is an acknowledgement &mdash; even among people in the Department &mdash; that it would  suit them to produce a better formula in order to better distribute the funds  to schools. That would enable the principals to distribute the money in a way  that addresses the needs of their particular schools. Furthermore, the  Department needs to make efficiency savings in order to raise the proportion of  the education budget that is allocated to front-line education.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">At present, a paltry 63% goes to front-line education. In  the rest of the UK,  that figure is in the region of 80%.</p>
          <p class="TimePeriod">1.30 pm</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">It is self-evident that primary-school and early-years  learning are of the utmost importance. Teaching during that period sets the  framework for later learning. Those are the formative years. It is during that  time that difficulties with literacy and numeracy can be tackled before they  become real problems. Addressing that at primary level leaves pupils free at  secondary level to broaden their minds. We are not creating a satisfactory  learning atmosphere for our children, and they will carry that on to  secondary-level education.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">It is time that the Minister focused on the growing crisis  in primary schools. Now is the time for action. In the last year, all that we  have seen from the Minister is prevarication. She talks a lot about failures  and labelling failures, but her Department is failing primary schools and, as a  consequence, failing our children.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">There is deep frustration among principals, teachers and  parents &mdash; some of whom are present today to hear this debate &mdash; that children  are not getting the education to which they are entitled. I have no hesitation  in supporting the motion.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Ba mhaith liom taca&iacute;ocht a  thabhairt don r&uacute;n seo. Ar dt&uacute;s, ba mhaith liom a r&aacute; go bhfuil s&eacute; ceart agus  c&oacute;ir n&iacute;os m&oacute; airgead a thabhairt don scola&iacute;ocht.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I support the motion and welcome its being tabled.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Last month, I joined Members, including Basil McCrea,  Dominic Bradley, and the Chairperson of the Committee for Education, Mervyn Storey,  in the Long Gallery &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I ask Members to check that their mobile phones are switched off.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat. In the Long Gallery, I listened intently to a presentation  from primary-school principals, of which more than 130 were present. It is  significant that so many considered the matter sufficiently important that they  left the school setting for a whole day, which can be disruptive, to come here  to express their views.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">During that presentation, I heard concerns for the  well-being and stress levels of principals and teachers; I keep hearing that.  It may not be easy for people who are not parents or governors or do not have  occasion to visit a primary school to understand the degree of pressure and  stress that is placed on teachers and principals nowadays.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Being a member of a board of governors affords me some  opportunity to gain that insight. Today, I declare an interest, as a governor  of St Lawrence&rsquo;s Primary School, Fintona; St Patrick&rsquo;s Primary School, Eskra;  and St Patrick&rsquo;s Primary School, Garvallagh. I call on other Members, during  this debate, to declare an interest as a member of a board of governors, if  they have not already done so.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The pressures placed on principals and teachers include the  revised curriculum, various initiatives, and performance review and staff  development (PRSD), over which principals must preside.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Teachers have increasingly said that they need space to  teach, with which we agree. If primary schools were to be granted additional  funding they could employ someone with specialist expertise, such as an IT  co-ordinator or, as Michelle McIlveen said, a part-time secretary, as required.  That would help to free up the teaching principal. If schools were to get extra  money it could lead to smaller class sizes, improved planning, preparation and  assessment time for teachers, increased and improved learning resources, and  more staff and management support.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I am pleased that the Minister acknowledges that the gap in  funding between primary 7 pupils and year 8 pupils in a post-primary setting  must be narrowed in the future. I also observe that that greatly exercised the  Committee for Education. Everybody is increasingly aware that the earlier an  intervention is made, the better that is for achieving results in schools.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Mervyn Storey called for the Minister and the Department to  be proactive and imaginative, and I echo that call. John O&rsquo;Dowd said that we  should work collectively to garner more finance for education, because  education is everyone&rsquo;s business. The SDLP likes to say that it voted against  the Budget, but it remains a fact that Margaret Ritchie, the SDLP Minister,  voted for the Budget when she was in the Executive room, at the Executive  table. The SDLP is, therefore, rather disingenuous when it makes that point.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, I welcome the fact that Mervyn Storey and other  DUP MLAs recently visited schools on the Shankill Road. Perhaps they can get on  message with those principals about academic selection and the 11-plus, because  the DUP has not been on message with those principals for many years.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCausland</strong>:  I will start by declaring that I am on the board of governors of Carr&rsquo;s Glen Primary School,  Ligoniel Primary   School and Wheatfield   Primary School. I am also  a member of the Belfast Education and Library Board.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">So much &mdash; indeed, too much &mdash; of the debate on education has  concerned the age of 11 and, with it, the issues of transfer and selection. The  emphasis should be on children&rsquo;s early years, including the years spent in  primary school. If children can get off to a good start, many of the problems  that occur in later years would be dealt with and could be avoided. If  educational disadvantages and inequalities can be dealt with at an early stage,  the primary and secondary sectors would benefit, as would the children and  society. More investment is needed at an early stage.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee for Education heard from principals across  the Province, and there was a unanimous voice no matter who came before the  Committee. There are not enough resources at primary level, and there are too  many special funds and special, short-term projects. The money is in the  departmental budget, but, unfort&shy;unately, much of it is unwisely directed.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">There is a general issue about primary-school funding  across the Province. I must, however, speak on behalf of the teachers in my  constituency. There are very special problems in the Shankill area and North Belfast. The Chairman of the Committee recently  visited the Malvern, Springhill, Springfield  and Edenbrooke primary schools in the Shankill area. He will soon receive a  request to visit schools in North Belfast, if  he has not already received that request.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Principals of schools in the Shankill area and North Belfast came to the Committee, and they spoke about  the particular problems that they faced. They pointed out that they had  benefited from extended schools funding, but there was now a question over that  funding because it had been reduced &mdash; it was even removed from some schools.  Many of them had benefited from interface and Renewing Communities funding, but  both of those had gone.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">In the June monitoring round, the Minister put extended  schools into her list of bids. However, there was no mention of interface or  Renewing Communities funding. If she had put those into her bid as part of the  June monitoring round, more money &mdash; even at this point in the year &mdash; could have  been put into primary schools in those needy areas. I hope that the Minister of  Finance and Personnel would have responded positively to those requests. The  tragedy, however, is that the Minister did not even bother to ask, despite the  fact that those school principals said that that funding should have been  requested.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">John O&rsquo;Dowd asked for people to listen. Perhaps he should  ask the Minister to listen to the principals who came to the Committee and  clearly set out those issues.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister did not bother. Yet schools such as Malvern Primary School,  Edenbrook Primary   School and Currie   Primary School, which  have difficult situations, have benefited to some small degree from that money  over the past few years. The money was welcome, although it was not the perfect  scenario, because the money came with restrictions; it would have been better  if the money had gone directly to the schools.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">However, there are ways of saving money in current budgets  so that money can be directed to primary schools. Special short-term  initiatives tend to be costly and involve costs for setting-up, monitoring and  reporting to the school and to the board &mdash; a whole range of issues. They are  not the most efficient way of saving money. The most efficient course of action  is to direct the money to the schools. A review of the funding formula for  primary schools, taking particular account not only of social advantage but of  educational disadvantage, is the way forward. I hope that when the review takes  place, educational disadvantage will be one of the criteria, along with social  disadvantage, and we will then see the children in those areas benefit.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>:  I am a governor of two schools &mdash; Hollybank  Primary School on Monkstown estate and  Whiteabbey Primary School. I also declare an  interest as a former member of the North Eastern Education and Library Board  and, perhaps most damning of all, as a former primary-school principal.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The issue of the differential in funding between primary  and post-primary schools lies at the heart of the motion. In Northern Ireland,  the funding for primary-school pupils stands at 66% of the funding for  post-primary pupils. In monetary terms, that translates as &pound;2,646 for each  primary-school pupil, compared to &pound;4,021 for each post-primary-school pupil.  That compares to a differential of 78% in England,  71% in Scotland and 82% in Wales. The  discrepancy revealed by those figures is of a sufficient size to be  statistically significant and worrying. To make matters worse, the UK is not known  for its generosity to primary-school pupils. Indeed, out of 29 countries, the UK has the  twelfth lowest investment in primary education. That puts Northern Ireland  at the bottom of the table once again &mdash; a position that must be addressed without  delay.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I am not persuaded that the advent of the education and  skills authority will result in administrative savings that can be redirected  into front-line services in our schools. Experience has shown that any new  structure in its early years invariably takes more financial resources that  originally intended.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">So far, under the LMS funding mechanism, the Minister has  promised an increase from 1&middot;02 to 1&middot;05 in the age-weighted pupil units for  primary-school pupils. That will not be nearly enough to address the gaping  differential between primary and post-primary pupils. In fact, the Minister&rsquo;s  proposal will, ultimately, lead to an increase of only &pound;102 for each pupil,  which will hardly close the differential.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Primary schools are concerned about the problem, partly  because of the attitude towards them which historically lies behind their  underfunding. Historically, primary schools were seen as a place to shove  youngsters into to get them off the streets and keep them out of other people&rsquo;s  hair. Therefore, they were put into large classes, with one teacher in charge,  in the hope that they would be kept out of the view of society. That attitude  must change. The primary-school stage is the key to the educational process. If  we do not build that foundation, how can we expect the house to stand at secondary,  further-education, or higher-education level? It is a historic attitude that we  must break away from.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Attitudes in the Department of Education also lead to low  morale in the teaching workforce. The Department often issues edicts but never  seems to consider their impact. A school principal may open yet another  envelope or email and trek around the school trying to break the good news &mdash;  sadly, very rarely &mdash; or the bad news to his already overburdened staff.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">A consultation exercise carried out by the Department of  Education in 2007 revealed that 99&middot;5% of teachers felt that their funding  weighting should be increased significantly. That level of dissatisfaction  should be of serious concern to the Minister.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">That reveals a depth of feeling that should not and must  not be ignored, and which cannot be answered by a mere 4% increase in  weightings for 2010-11.</p>
          <p class="TimePeriod">1.45 pm</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">On 11 June 2008, more than 100 school principals, some of  whom are present in the Public Gallery, descended on this Building to demand an  extra &pound;100 million plus for Northern Ireland&rsquo;s primary schools &mdash; and rightly  so. It is unfortunate that they were driven to the extent of having to come  here to ask for that. Surely the Department, the boards, and the educational  system must have been listening to them &mdash; if not, why not?</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Principals claimed that a primary-school funding deficit of  around &pound;1,300 per pupil less than the post-primary level was unfair, unequal,  and too low. That was rather mild language. They also warned that educational  standards would be affected if the Government failed to invest more in the  early years of education over the next two years.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I have news for the Minister: underfunding of the primary  sector has seriously impaired the ability of schools to effectively deliver the  numeracy and literacy targets that they are aiming for. It is a minor miracle that  schools have managed to maintain levels of numeracy and literacy as high as  they currently are. That achieve&shy;ment has been bought at the expense of the  health of the head teachers and all the other teachers who have struggled to  try to deliver endless initiatives.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Primary Review in England stated that:</p>
          <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The Government should increase primary school budgets  to match those in secondary schools to pay for specialist teachers to tackle  illiteracy&rdquo;.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member must bring his remarks to a close.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>:  I regret that I have had to rush through these important issues, but I  appreciate that my time is up. I support the motion.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Anderson</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat. Ba mhaith liom labhairt i bhfabhar an r&uacute;in seo. I support  the motion. Last week, I attended a meeting in Derry  at which the Education Minister spoke passionately about her reforms of the  education system. The hundreds of people in that room were left in absolutely  no doubt as to the Minister&rsquo;s commitment to deliver a world-class education  service that cherishes all of our children equally, and which affords them  every opportunity to reach their full potential in life.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Despite the often vitriolic reaction that she has met from  the opponents of change, the Minister is clearly determined to pursue her  reforms, because that is in the best interest of our children. I know that she  enjoys the support of the vast majority of educationalists and, indeed, wider  society.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCausland</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Anderson</strong>:  No; you have already had time to speak. The Minister has already demonstrated  her commitment in a tangible manner by increasing primary-school funding.  Members will also be aware that she is engaged in an RPA rationalisation  process. There are currently 50,000 empty desks in our schools, and that is  simply not sustainable. However, I ask the Minister to ensure that any savings  that emerge from the rationalisation process will be invested straight back  into front-line services.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">At the heart of this debate, there must be a realisation  that, owing to the constraints under which we operate &mdash; due to the fact that  some in this Chamber, and across the North, seek to retain the link with  Westminster, which provides a limited block grant &mdash; the Assembly is able only  to deliver a certain amount for the people whom we are elected to represent.  The reality is that the block grant that we receive is simply not adequate to  provide the type of services that we want to see for our people.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Members need to make a decision: do we want to continue as  a plastic parliament, with all the pomp and ceremony, but little substance, or  do we want to take control of our own destiny &mdash; to take control of fiscal  matters, of policing and justice powers, and to start delivering real and  meaningful change for all of our people?</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Until we grasp that reality, I am afraid that the most that  we will ever be able to do is to tinker around the edges of a Budget that we  all agree is simply inadequate. Although I support the motion, I urge all  Members to think seriously about their responsibilities to their constituents.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Members have all been elected to deliver a better future.  The people have put their faith in us &mdash; God knows that that might be  questionable when one listens to the comments of some Members. It is about time  that the Assembly started to have a bit more faith in itself and to take  responsibility for its own affairs. Only then will it be able to deliver  meaningful change for primary-school children, post-primary schoolchildren,  pensioners, working families, single parents and every sector of society. Go  raibh maith agat.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: I  apologise that I was not present in the Chamber earlier in the debate &mdash; I was  meeting members of the construction industry, which is facing serious problems.  One of the issues that they raised was that capital projects are not being  delivered in schools and hospitals. The industry is in crisis because decisions  are not being made to move ahead quickly with capital projects. Schools are  crying out for those facilities to be built.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  Is the Member aware that the Minister handed back &pound;37 million in 2007 for  capital projects that she was unable to deliver?</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: I  am well aware of that. That is disap&shy;pointing because many schools need capital  works to be carried out and facilities to be put in place. Instead, the  Minister has handed money back to the Westminster Administration. That is to  the detriment of children, the construction industry and the country of Northern Ireland.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  Does the Member agree that his singular failure to preside over the development  of a multi-sports stadium at Long Kesh has delayed the creation of 4,000 jobs  that would have done much to help the construction industry?</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: If  the Member wishes to enter into a debate on sport, he can table a motion on  that issue. This debate is on education, Mr McElduff. If you are not interested  in education, you would be as well to leave the Chamber. The Assembly will  discuss education, irrespective of what you wish to do.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. All Members must address their remarks through the Chair.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  The subject of the debate is the needs of primary-school children, who  currently receive &pound;1,375 less than children in the post-primary sector.  Primary-school children in England  receive 79% of the funding that is received by children in secondary schools.  In Scotland, that figure is  72%, and in Northern Ireland  it is just under 62%. That demonstrates the significant difference in the value  that is placed on primary-school children and on that education sector in Northern Ireland, vis-&agrave;-vis the rest of the United Kingdom.  That is not good enough.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">During the latest Education Committee meeting, I listened  to Mr O&rsquo;Dowd, who was extremely defensive &mdash; I could not understand why,  because, in fairness, the current situation was inherited from direct rule  Ministers. I suspect that if Sinn F&eacute;in goes ahead with its threat to pull down  the institutions by Christmas if policing and justice powers are not devolved,  that party will attack direct rule Ministers in a year&rsquo;s time for underfunding  the post-primary sector, if that were the situation. Because that party happens  to be in charge of the education portfolio at present, it tries to defend the  indefensible.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">It is evident that the primary-school sector needs more  resources to enable it to deal with children&rsquo;s particular needs. Northern Ireland  has a serious problem of educational underachievement. Many young people leave  school without requisite numeracy and literacy skills. Instead of focus being  directed at pet projects of social change, the concentration should be on where  the problem starts. Virtually all educationalists agree that that problem  originates during children&rsquo;s early years. It is clear that failings exist in  preschool provision and in the early years of primary school.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I have heard the Minister say that she is concerned with  tackling educational underachievement. That problem must be tackled at its  core, which is in the primary-school sector. The issue of funding for that  sector must be addressed in order to ensure that children get the right start  and that they achieve adequate numeracy and literacy skills by Key Stage 1 and  Key Stage 2. If resources were in place to assist children in the important  early years, the secondary-school sector would not have to pick up the pieces  after children had failed in their primary-school years.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I will welcome and fundamentally embrace change if the  Minister&rsquo;s changes really are about tackling educational underachievement at  the source of the problem. I hear a great deal about change, but it is often  change for change&rsquo;s sake. The changes that are necessary and that will make a  difference to children must be identified so that when they go out into the  world of employment, they are prepared young people.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I lay down a challenge to the Minister. If she is serious  about tackling educational underachievement, she must forget about her pet  projects and about funding policies to which she is favourably disposed. She  must provide funding to the primary sector, where it is required.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Armstrong</strong>:  The motion addresses an important issue facing the future of society in Northern Ireland.  I, along with other Ulster Unionist MLAs, recently met a delegation of more  than 100 primary-school principals from all sectors, who came to Stormont to  express their frustration at the lack of funding for the primary sector. I  appeal to the House to unite behind the motion for the sake of our children.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Funding for primary schools in Northern   Ireland is far below that of all other regions in the United Kingdom.  One does not need much persuading that the heads of primary schools have a  point, and that point must be addressed.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Recent debates on education have centred on the question of  academic selection, and it has been said often that the system fails children  at age 11. I know the importance of a good primary-school education, because I  left school soon after my fourteenth birthday. If children have not managed to  acquire basic educational skills at primary school, it does not matter how they  transfer to post-primary school. If the basics have not been picked up at  primary school, children will be at a huge disadvantage when trying to make up  the ground at secondary level, no matter at what age they transfer or how much  money is spent at secondary level.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">It cannot be denied that money that is invested in education  at primary level will pay dividends further down the line. We must accept that  not all children will have equal chances in life. Some children&rsquo;s parents will  value education; others will not. Some children will have parents who have  spare time to sit with them and help them with their homework. Other children  will not be as fortunate, because their parents have demanding jobs and do not  have the spare time to be able to help. Factors such as income and nutrition  will also have an impact.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">In the real world, schools will never be able to eradicate  such disadvantages, but it is surely not asking too much for them to seek to  promote equality of opportunity for children inside the school gates, at least  as far as the basics of the three Rs are concerned. In an ideal world, the  teacher should be able to intervene to help a child who is falling behind in  the basics to catch up. That would only be possible with smaller class sizes,  which would allow the teacher to give individual attention to the children who  needed it most.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">That has a cost implication, but what are the hidden costs  &mdash; not just financial &mdash; of the thousands of children who leave primary and  secondary school with poor literacy and numeracy skills, leaving them  handicapped in the labour market?</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">What about the cost to employers who cannot find workers  with even basic education skills, or to taxpayers who must pay for benefits  that go to people who are virtually unemployable. What about the human cost in  unfulfilled potential? A great deal could be avoided by increasing investment  in primary-level education.</p>
          <p class="TimePeriod">2.00 pm</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Additional resources are required to ensure that pupils are  not left behind due to a lack of English language skills. That is only right,  because such skills will help integration and social cohesion. If sufficient  assistance to primary-level pupils is not provided, even more money will have  to be spent in attempting to rectify mistakes when those pupils reach secondary  level and are falling even further behind. The same principle must apply to all  schools; get the basics right at primary-school level, and the jobs of  secondary-school teachers will be made easier. That should be the aim not only  of the Minister of Education but of all Members.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Craig</strong>: I  shall begin by declaring my interests. I am on the board of governors for Harmony Hill  Primary School, Killowen  Primary School and Laurelhill Community    College.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">There is no question that extreme pressure has been put on  primary-school principals, especially over the past couple of years. Numerous  principals &mdash; not only in my constituency, but throughout Northern Ireland  &mdash; have been suffering from increasing degrees of sickness due to stress.  However, that stress is not caused by teaching. Although teaching puts a lot of  pressure on principals and primary-school teachers, the stress to which I am  referring is caused by budgetary pressures, and the Chairperson of the  Committee for Education referred to that earlier.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">What did the Department do about that this year? From the  extra &pound;102 a pupil that each primary school was given, &pound;61 went to cover  inflation; &pound;17 was spent on cleaners&rsquo; pay rises; &pound;10 must be spent on  additional fuel costs, and that figure is rising; and the paltry &pound;14 that is  left over does little to relieve schools&rsquo; financial pressures.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, if one studies the figures closely, there has  been paltry investment in the revised curriculum. Although there are areas to  which the Minister has little or no trouble giving extra money &mdash; such as GAA  matches and joint Irish-Spanish lessons &mdash; there has been no investment in the  core primary school curriculum. The Minister appears to have no problem in  finding money for her hidden political agenda.</p>
          <p class="B3SpeakerinChair">(Mr Speaker in the Chair)</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Considering other jurisdictions, the Scottish Parliament&rsquo;s  goal is to have only 18 pupils in each class from P1 to P3. Why is that? Maybe  the Scottish Parliament consider achieving that objective to be a sounder  investment in their children&rsquo;s education and future. Urgent action is required  and, unlike other Members, I take nothing for granted. I do not assume that the  Minister will review funding. In fact, I cannot identify any urgency in her to  do so.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I commend the Northern Ireland Primary Principals&rsquo; Action  Group (NIPPAG). When it met in April, it unanimously agreed six resolutions,  which have been presented to the Department of Education and, indeed, to the  Northern Ireland Assembly. The situation in Northern Ireland is completely  unacceptable.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Members referred to the fact that a P7 child attracts  &pound;1,258 a year less in core funding than a year 8 child in secondary school.  That is unacceptable and leads to major difficulties for primary schools.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">NIPPAG has made some demands, including smaller classes and  planning, preparation and assessment (PPA) time for teachers. In England, all teachers are allowed to spend 10%  of their time on PPA, but in Northern    Ireland, teachers do not get that time. More  and better learning resources, and more support staff and manage&shy;ment support,  were also among the demands. It is unacceptable that primary-school funding of  that type has been cut to the absolute core. Primary-school principals are left  with practically no money for school adminis&shy;tration. That ridiculous situation  must be addressed.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I listened with absolute astonishment to some Members&rsquo;  remarks today. They blamed the block budget for all the faults in the education  system. That is an amazing thing to say when we consider that the British  taxpayers &mdash;</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Craig</strong>:  The British taxpayers subsidise not only education, but the whole system here,  to the tune of &pound;4&middot;5 billion. I support the motion.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  I must first declare an interest: I am honoured to serve on the board of governors  in two of the many excellent primary schools on the Ards  Peninsula, namely St Patrick&rsquo;s Primary  School in Ballygalget, and Portaferry   Integrated Primary    School. I fully support this important motion and  commend the Education Committee for bringing it before the Assembly for debate,  and, I hope, action.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the presence of the Education Minister in the  Chamber today. I hope that she will be totally convinced by our argument that  primary-school children are being sold short when compared to those in other  regions of the UK.  That anomaly must be rectified without delay.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Unfortunately, I was unable to be present at the recent  gathering in this Building of the many primary-school principals. However, they  can be assured of my full support in their endeavours to get parity of  treatment and the appropriate funding to manage their schools and enable their  pupils to attain the highest possible educational standards. Everyone agrees on  this issue, even the Minister herself, who wrote to NIPPAG on 31 July 2007:</p>
          <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;I do believe that the funding differential currently  between primary and secondary is too great.&rdquo;</p>
          <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The question is: how and when can that discrepancy  be put right? It is entirely up to the Minister. The Minister also stated that:</p>
          <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;I am convinced that investment in early intervention  delivers real benefits in improving access to learning and thus reducing later  differences.&rdquo;</p>
          <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">It is good to hear the Minister acknowledge those  facts, but she really must follow up her words with action.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">At their conference in Cookstown in April, the Primary  Principals&rsquo; Action Group passed six resolutions which it sees as paramount to  delivering a first-class schools system for students. I give my full support to  those six basic resolutions. Indeed, I appeal to the Minister and her  Department to take whatever steps are necessary to deliver on those basic  demands.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">As the Alliance Party&rsquo;s health spokesperson, I paid  particular attention to the fourth resolution. We acknowledge the stresses and  strains experienced by all schoolteachers, and we must do whatever is necessary  to ensure that their health and well-being is paramount. We must prevent the  Health Service from having to unnecessarily fund the return to health of many  in the teaching profession. Such health problems could and should have been  avoided in the first place if sufficient funding had been put in place to allow  our primary-school principals and staff to deliver the world-class education  system and results to which we all aspire.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I commend all our teachers on their excellent contribution  to education, as well as the parents who help to raise funds throughout the  year to enable principals to purchase extra facilities &mdash;indeed, sometimes just  the basic necessities &mdash; for the benefit of the pupils.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Teachers are like all other tradespeople: if they do not  have the right tools for the job, the job can remain only half done, and that  is unacceptable.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister of Education once said that she did not want  to be a Minister if all that she could deliver was second-class education  provision for Northern    Ireland. I plead with Minister Ruane to  listen to school principals, the Committee for Education and to her Assembly  colleagues today, and deliver proper funding for the success of primary  schools.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I commend Victoria Primary School in my constit&shy;uency,  which Members will have seen on television last night, for being number one for  energy saving. I hope that the Minister will not take any funding away from  that school because it is being energy efficient.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: On  a point of order, Mr Speaker. I apologise for not declaring an interest in that  I am on the board of governors of Carr  Primary School, Meadow  Bridge Primary   School and Riverdale   Primary School.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Speaker. I declare an interest, in that I am a member  of the board of governors of St Brigid&rsquo;s Primary School in Derry,  just in case Barry McElduff is concerned that I did not declare that interest.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>: I  was just waiting for any further advances. I welcome the opportunity to speak in  the debate. Although I am not a member of the Committee for Education, I have  been contacted by several principals in my East Antrim  constituency about this issue.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">At this stage in the debate, many of the issues have  already been covered. However, I am a member of the Committee for Employment  and Learning, and I come at the matter from a slightly different angle. On that  Committee, we have taken evidence about how many young adults in Northern Ireland  lack the basic numeracy and literacy skills that they need in order to get on  in life and find a good job. The frequency of the evidence that the Committee  hears, and the number of young adults who do not have those skills, is  startling.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Those people did not stop being able to read and write once  they turned 16 years of age; they could never read or write. That is a direct  result of their educational experience in their earliest years. Some 20% of  children in Northern Ireland  leave school without the appropriate level of numeracy and literacy skills,  with the evidence pointing to the fact that that is most acute in inner-city  areas, particularly among boys in Protestant areas.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Education is the building block for life. Early-years  education is imperative for society, because today&rsquo;s children will be the  workforce of the future. Many education debates have focused on post-primary  education, academic selection and grammar schools. Members opposite repeatedly  claim that a child&rsquo;s future should not be determined at the age of 11. A child&rsquo;s  future is not determined at the age of 11, because, for most children, their  educational opportunities and experiences in their earliest years will impact  directly on their future attainment and academic ability. That is why primary  schools must be well funded, and that, as an Assembly and a society, we  recognise the importance of early-years education. It is, after all, in primary  school where we learn to read and write.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">We have heard the facts and figures from other Members, and  it has been clearly recognised that, in Northern   Ireland, the gulf between the money that primary schools  receive in comparison with secondary schools is much greater than in England and Wales. There is also evidence that,  if the figures from Northern    Ireland were taken on their own, we would be  lagging behind with regard to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and  Development table in the ratio between the money that the Government invest in primary  education compared with secondary education.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr I McCrea</strong>:  Does my colleague agree that, with regard to the disparity of funding between  primary and secondary schools, the answer is not to force teachers to take  compulsory redundancies but to make extra funding available?</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>:  That is the fact of the matter. Indeed, in July 2007, the Minister conceded that  the funding differential between primary and secondary schools is too great. It  is not a question of taking money away from other areas. However, we must  ensure that, where money is focused, it goes to the right areas.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">When I speak to primary-school principals, they are the  first to say that they do not feel that the funding should necessarily be  removed from secondary schools. They make the point, however, that resources  must be available for them to do their job.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Over the past few months, we have heard a great deal about  the credit crunch. As Mr Storey said in his opening comments, that comes at a  time of increasing costs to heat buildings and to pay for fuel for minibuses &mdash;  or for what, at a school that I recently visited, the children called the venga  bus, and sang how the &ldquo;venga bus is coming&rdquo; when the minibus arrived. There are  also issues such as paying for staff and cleaners, as well as natural  inflation. Those costs all add up, and they make life very difficult for  principals.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">In the Chamber, we have often heard that we need to invest  in the education of young people and focus on early-years education. That was  mentioned again today. However, it is no coincidence that the most successful  countries invest in young people&rsquo;s education, and we must do likewise. The  primary sector must be funded properly to ensure that people leave primary  school with the level of numeracy and literacy skills that they require. That  means that we stop throwing money at schemes and activities that are  politically motivated or short-lived initiatives. Resources must be targeted at  core learning.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McCarthy referred to a number of the issues that were  highlighted by the Northern Ireland Primary Principals&rsquo; Action Group.</p>
          <p class="TimePeriod">2.15 pm</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">In my closing minute, I will turn briefly to the issue of  class sizes. We have been told that a child in year 8 receives &pound;1,250 more  funding than a child in year 7, thus allowing secondary schools to have smaller  class sizes. As my colleague for Lagan Valley Mr Craig said, reducing class  sizes has been a priority in Scotland.  There has been a great deal of research into the issue, and there is also a big  move in the United States  to reduce class sizes.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The statistics that show the results of taking such action  speak for themselves. Evidence shows that if a class has fewer than 20 pupils,  that has a dramatically positive effect on pupils&rsquo; results and attainment.  Indeed, in other countries, Governments decided to focus money on education for  early years. Although cost is an issue, we must ensure that the money that the  Minister spends on schemes goes to the right places and makes a real difference  to academic attainment.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I support the motion and hope that the Minister takes the  relevant action to ensure that no child leaves school without the necessary  numeracy and literacy skills.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  I join with others in welcoming the debate. I declare an interest as a member  of the boards of governors of Bessbrook  Primary School and Newry High School.  It is significant that, on the Assembly&rsquo;s last day of term, we are focusing on  this important issue. There is a growing and significant body of evidence that  outlines the reason that it is vital that there is adequate and significant  investment in the initial years of education. It is known that children develop  most quickly in their formative years. Therefore, it is crucial that they gain  a firm foundation in literacy, numeracy and academic skills.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Institute of Education in the University of London  worked on the Effective Provision of Pre-School Education Project, which found  that children who attended a primary school that was identified as academically  more effective had better outcomes at the age of 10 than those who attended  less-effective primary schools. Additionally, children who attended effective  primary schools showed reduced antisocial behaviour and an increased  possibility of gaining a higher education.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">That study is backed up by other opinions such as those of  Professor Heckman and Professor Robin Alexander, who is the former director of  the Primary Review in England.  Although there is now overwhelming evidence to suggest that investment in  primary education is crucial to the future success of children and society, we  have to ask why 99&middot;5% of primary schools in Northern Ireland believe that their  funding needs to be increased. Why is there a difference of more than &pound;1,258  between funding for primary-school children and funding for secondary-school  children in Northern Ireland?</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Is the Member aware that the Minister attempted to increase primary-school  funding to close the differential, but that that small increase was  insufficient, compared with the increase for secondary schools?</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">In fact, despite attempting to increase that funding, the  outcome was an increase of &pound;8 in the differential between the two sectors.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  I am grateful to my colleague for highlighting that fact. I agree entirely, and  we expect the Minister to address that issue later in the debate.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Why do we persist with a funding scheme that discriminates  against primary-school pupils? Furthermore, the ratio of funding for  primary-school children in Northern Ireland  &mdash; in proportion to funding in secondary schools &mdash; is much lower than in the  rest of the United Kingdom.  Previously, the Minister stated:</p>
          <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;all grant-aided schools at all phases &hellip; receive  delegated funding according to their relative need.&rdquo;</p>
          <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Is the relative need of primary-school children in Northern Ireland less than that of children in  the rest of the United    Kingdom? Sadly, the Minister of Education  has taken her eye off the ball. Instead of focusing on educational issues, the  Minister has pursued a political agenda, focusing on the transfer of children  at the age of 11. Unfortunately, her agenda has been to fulfil a party-political  plan, rather than an educational one.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The idea that problems can be solved solely by increased  efficiency is an insult to teachers. Moreover, it is an easy, glib and  political answer. A comprehensive review is necessary, and the Minister must  examine measures and introduce new proposals to increase significantly funding  to primary schools, otherwise it will send the message to parents, children and  teachers in Northern Ireland  that they are less valued than those in the rest of the United Kingdom.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Primary schools require smaller class sizes, increased  planning and preparation time for teachers, more &mdash; and better &mdash; learning  resources, and greater management support, and it is paramount that we deliver  those improvements. I support the motion, and I hope that the Minister will  engage positively with the Committee for Education and attempt to find  solutions.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  W B Yeats said:</p>
          <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Education is not the filling of a bucket, but the  lighting of a fire.&rdquo;</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I declare an interest as a member of the board of governors  of Glastry College.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Tha Edyecatshun o&rsquo;oor yung yins is yin o&rsquo; graet muckle  respoansibility, we put oor greatest tresur in tae tha hauns o&rsquo; P1 teechers as  we luk at theim takkin oor wean bi tha haun an leed theim intae a&rsquo; new woarl o&rsquo;  larnin. We haep that they wull git tae ken eech wean an help theim reech their  goal as they delve intae tha woarls o&rsquo; wurds an nummers.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The education of our children is a major responsibility; we  place our greatest treasure in the hands of the P1 teacher, who takes our  children by the hand and leads them into a new world of education. We trust  those teachers to get to know all of the children and to help them achieve  their potential as they explore the world of words and numbers. We expect them  to understand and work with each child as a unique person, while attaining  educational targets for that age group &mdash; we demand a lot from teachers.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Resources must be made available to enable teachers to do  their jobs effectively. Primary-school days are the most important and, perhaps,  the simplest time in life. During those days, you went to school and could not  wait for the bell to ring and release you to play with your friends. In school,  you listened to the teacher, obeyed her requests, learnt tables and letters,  studied the map to learn the countries of the world and listened to stories of  historic battles. Although teachers still teach the basics, they also teach  sciences, IT, French and crafts before a door is opened into secondary-school  education.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I do not question teachers&rsquo; ability to provide a more  intensive education. Northern    Ireland has the most qualified teachers in  the world, who are capable of achieving educational targets. However, the  Assembly does not allocate sufficient resources to allow them to do so.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr W McCrea</strong>:  We must bear in mind what we are asking our teachers to do. Is it not  ridiculous that the Department of Education can deny a board of governors the  right to use money wisely for the education of children in the situation where  a school requires an additional mobile classroom and its board of governors,  because of their financial stewardship, are willing to pay for it from their  own budget?</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member will be allowed some extra time to speak.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  Thank you, Mr Speaker. I am looking forward to that extra minute.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I agree wholeheartedly with Dr McCrea. As he says, the  problem is that teachers need the resources to enable them to do their job. As  class sizes swell, teachers have to cope with up to 30 pupils, and have to get  to know each child while treating them all equally and while trying to squeeze  every aspect of the curriculum into the school year. That is almost impossible,  and it is obvious that more time is needed, for example, to bring the most  badly-behaved children round or, indeed, to identify those children who will  excel and encourage them. In the middle, many children need more help and more  time, and teachers are finding it impossible to divide their time.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">We always come back to funding. The more funding that is  available, the more teachers we will have who will be able to spend one-on-one  time with each child in order to help them achieve their full potential. The  simple maths that I was taught in school &mdash; that was not yesterday &mdash; sticks with  me. If more resources are made available, better quality teaching can be  offered. If more support staff are taken on, learning programmes and the  standard of education will be better. The equation is simple, as is the part  that the Department of Education must play. It must stop throwing money away  needlessly; it must fund primary schools properly so that they can do the job  that the Department &mdash; and every parent &mdash; is asking them to do.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I have been inundated with letters from parents, teachers  and boards of governors. I will quote from one of them:</p>
          <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;It is indefensible that the Northern Ireland Executive presides over a  situation where Primary schools in Northern Ireland receive only 61&middot;8%  funding of that of Secondary schools. Also, it is totally unacceptable that a  secondary school pupil in Year 8 attracts &pound;1,258 per year more than a child in  Primary 7. In order for Primary schools to deliver what is now expected of them  a significant increase in resources is now urgently required.&rdquo;</p>
          <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The author of that letter goes on to say that in a  recent survey comparing primary and secondary school funding per pupil,  Northern Ireland, if ranked alone, would be twenty-sixth out of 29. The letter  continues:</p>
          <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;This is hardly the way to build the economic  prosperity and social cohesion our country needs now and in the future.&rdquo;</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">If we want the right results, we must spend the money to  build the foundation. I ask the Minister and the Department to ensure that the  necessary and correct funding is made available urgently. The Department must  ensure that all schools are viable and have the correct number of pupils. It  must stop using education funding to make political points and gestures. If it  made the money available, the difference to young people&rsquo;s lives and education  would be noticeable. I urge the Minister and the Department to do the right  thing: allocate the money properly, and not on a political basis, and secure  the future of our children as a matter of urgency. I support the motion.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education (Ms Ruane)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I thank the  Committee for Education for the opportunity to respond to the debate on funding  for primary schools. I welcome that the Committee would like more resources to  be made available to primary schools. I also welcome the work of primary-school  principals, and I thank them. It is fitting, at the end of the school year, to  thank them for all their invitations to their schools and for the discussions  that I have had with them. I have been in schools from every sector in  communities throughout the North.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I also pay tribute to teachers. Like many others, I have  been listening to the radio. It is very easy to bash teachers at this time of  the year. I wish them the best as they go on their holidays, although many of  them &mdash; and their support staff &mdash; will be working in the schools throughout the  summer. I assure them that we support the fact that they have holidays. All of  us, parents, teachers, educationalists and politicians alike, understand the  importance of teacher holidays &mdash; both for them and for the children.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I sincerely welcome that the primary principals throughout  the North are working hard to raise the issue of the disparity of funding  between primary and post-primary schools.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I look forward to the support of all my colleagues on all  Benches when I seek resources to continue increasing funding to the  primary-school sector. I look forward to working with them all.</p>
          <p class="TimePeriod">2.30 pm</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I am delighted that the loud voices of primary-school  principals are being heard. I am delighted that the trade unions, the Irish  National Teachers&rsquo; Organisation and the Ulster Teachers&rsquo; Union,  are working for the primary-school staff. I have attended their conferences; I  pay tribute to the work that they do, and I listen to what they say, as do  others, when they seek more funding. I hope that the Members opposite will also  listen to those unions when they talk about the impact on our young people of  academic selection at age 11. I note that all the teachers&rsquo; unions released a  statement about that last week.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">T&aacute; m&eacute; cinnte de na bunt&aacute;ist&iacute; de bheith ag infheist&iacute;ocht  in&aacute;r mbunscoileanna.

          <p class="B3BodyText">I am convinced of the benefits of investing in primary  schools. They play a fundamental role in laying the foundations for education  and in providing the early intervention that is so vital in preventing or  reducing future difficulties in learning. Equally, I am fully committed to  ensuring that those in greatest need receive the support and opportunities  necessary to enable future school-leavers to break the cycle of deprivation  that continues to affect many in our society.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Like the Members who spoke, I recognise that children  should acquire in early education the basic skills that are necessary for  success. As announced in my education budget on 12 February 2008, for the next  three years, there will be a strong focus on early-years and primary education,  including adjustments to the formula funding that is distributed to all  schools, and specific funding for foundation-stage support. There is funding of  &pound;12 million as direct support to primary principals, who will be able to avail  themselves of two days&rsquo; release from teaching duties, as they requested.  Furthermore, &pound;8 million a year, for the next three years, will be available for  early-years services.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Chuir m&eacute; bar&uacute;lacha bunscoileanna agus gr&uacute;pa&iacute; eile san  &aacute;ireamh ar mhaoini&uacute; LMS, agus d&rsquo;fhreagair m&eacute; ar na h&aacute;bhair is imn&iacute; d&oacute;ibh tr&iacute;d  an ual&uacute; dhalta bunscoile a mh&eacute;ad&uacute; &oacute; 1&middot;02 go 1&middot;4 in 2008-09. Rinne m&eacute; seo le  maoini&uacute; LMS a mh&eacute;ad&uacute; de r&eacute;ir a ch&eacute;ile thar thr&eacute;imhse an Bhuis&eacute;id.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I have taken on board the views of primary schools and  others on local management of schools (LMS) funding issues, and I have  responded to those concerns by increasing the primary-pupil weighting from 1&middot;02  to 1&middot;04 in 2008-09, with a view to increasing progressively the relative  funding levels distributed to primary schools, under the LMS funding  arrangements, across the budget period.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">In the &pound;20&middot;4 million uplift to school budgets for 2008-09,  compared to that of 2007-08, some &pound;12&middot;67 million was directed to primary  schools. That represents an overall cash uplift of more than 3% and 4% a pupil.  For 2008-09, the average increase of &pound;102 a primary-school pupil is higher than  the average increase for post-primary-school pupils.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I also brought in a sports and languages programme. I hope  that Members understand the importance of physical fitness in dealing with the  rising levels of obesity. I aimed that programme at primary schools, especially  at P1 and P2 pupils, so that children can acquire fundamental skills, such as  ball and co-ordination skills, at a very early age.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I also hope that Members were not suggesting that learning  a second language at an early age will not be useful to our children in an  increasingly global society. If we examine growth areas for languages in  Europe, and if we wish to play our role in Europe,  Spanish &mdash; Espa&ntilde;ol &mdash; and Irish are two key, official languages &mdash;<span class="Italic"> [Interruption.]</span></p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. The Minister has the Floor.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: I visited schools, the GAA and the IFA, and I witnessed the  success of the various programmes that I introduced. The sports and languages  programme is not merely another initiative; it is a long-term programme that we  will continue to promote.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I would do more &mdash; I would do a lot more &mdash; if I had more  money at my disposal. Only last week, my bids for additional money from the  June monitoring round &mdash; for extended schools and to meet increased fuel and  food costs &mdash; were turned down. I welcome the Finance Minister&rsquo;s mention of  extended schools in his speech because it is a very good programme. As Members  will know, I have raised the importance of extended schools at every available  opportunity, whether in writing or at forums. I welcome the fact that the  Finance Minister is listening to me now.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Significant resources are also being made available to  primary schools outside the current formula-funding arrangements. An additional  &pound;32 million over the next three years, including &pound;7 million in the 2008  financial year, will be made available to support primary schools with the  delivery of the foundation stage of the revised curriculum. Primary 1and  primary 2 teachers are aware of just how important the initiative is. The  additional funding will, for the first time, provide every year 1 and year 2  class with access to classroom assistants. A further &pound;12 million will be  available specifically to ensure that teaching principals of primary schools  are released from teaching duties at least two days a week. The initiative  represents significant new money for primary schools. As I have said before &mdash;  idir l&uacute;ib&iacute;n&iacute; &mdash; give me the money and I will put it into our primary schools  because that is where it needs to go.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I recognise that many people, including primary-school  principals, want more rapid progress to reflect the importance of primary  learning in the balance of funding distributed across all schools. I also  readily acknowledge that the differential between primary-school funding and  that of the other phases &mdash; as measured by the average per pupil &mdash; is too wide.  From day one, I have said consistently that I want more funding to be directed  to early intervention, and for the gap between primary and post-primary funding  to be reduced.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the interest of all politicians in working-class  children and social disadvantage. I ask the Members on the Benches opposite to  understand the impact of the current selective system on children of social  disadvantage.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>:  Will the Minister give way?</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: Through the Chair.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I ask the Members on the Benches opposite to talk to the  primary-school principals and teachers who, year after year, have had to pick  up the pieces when children are told that they are failures.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  Will the Minister give way?</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: No; the Minister will not give way. Members have had their  chance to speak.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I ask the Members on the Benches opposite to talk to the  educationalists. The vast majority &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. We have had a two-hour debate, which was the time allocated by the  Business Committee. Every Member in the House has had an opportunity to  contribute to the debate. The Minister is now responding to the debate. Members  must allow the Minister to respond without being interrupted.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: I will repeat myself, just in case people did not hear me over  the interruptions from the Members on the Benches opposite. I ask those Members  to talk to teachers and principals in primary, post-primary and secondary  schools in their constituencies about the impact of the selective system.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Education</strong>: The issue is funding.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: No, the impact of it &mdash;</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Education</strong>: The issue is funding.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: The selective system fails far too many of our young people,  sending them out into a difficult world without the appropriate qualifications.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">As I have said on many occasions, I am not prepared to  preside over education apartheid. The Members opposite may do that, but I will  not.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I am sure that Members who are concerned about funding for  primary schools will join me in advising primary-school principals not to use  their resources to further the aims of a private organisation that proposes  private tests.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Various figures have been suggested to me and comparisons  have been used, stating how many more resources need to be directed into  primary-school funding. Officials have provided details to the Committee for  Education on the quantum of suggested funding, stating that &pound;200 per  primary-school pupil equates to an additional funding need of approximately &pound;31  million; and funding of &pound;800 per primary-school pupil &mdash; as suggested by some &mdash;  would cost about &pound;123 million. I would love to have that money, and I look  forward to every political party in the Assembly supporting me when I make a  bid for &pound;123 million. &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: Such funding is not available to me &mdash; even though much of it  comes into a block grant &mdash; and could be delivered only through extensive cuts  to other essential services. What services will I cut?</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Will the Minister give way?</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: I will not give way.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I would love to secure more funding, and I look forward to  the support of all Members when I bid for further resources.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">If one of my Executive colleagues were to suggest moving  money from one of their departmental responsibilities &mdash; such as health or  housing &mdash; I would be more than willing to take him or her up on that. I would  welcome any additional funding to enhance the provision of learning for pupils  at all levels. I have argued for education priorities in the Budget priorities  for the Assembly, and I will continue to do so. Further&shy;more, I look forward to  the support of the Committee for Education when, jointly, we lobby the Finance  Minister. When we are at it, we will also lobby the First Minister and the  deputy First Minister, because if we are serious about dealing with  underachievement in our selective system, we need to put more money into that  system.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I assure the House that I am determined to ensure that  funding provision best supports learners in schools at all levels and that,  within the available resources, there is an increased emphasis on early  learning and support for the most disadvantaged. However, the figures that are  being used to illustrate the difference in funding for primary schools do not  provide an accurate picture of relative levels of funding.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The oft-quoted differential of 61&middot;8% for a primary pupil  compared to a post-primary pupil reflects only the age-weighted pupil unit  funding delegated to schools under the formula-funding arrangements. That does  not take account of all other funding factors, including some &mdash;</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr W McCrea</strong>:  Is it in order for the Minister to plead poverty and look for &pound;120 million when  she handed back &pound;50 million to the Exchequer?</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  That is not a point of order.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: Go raibh maith agat. The oft-quoted differential of 61&middot;8% for a  primary-school pupil compared to a post-primary pupil reflects only the  age-weighted pupil unit funding delegated to schools under the formula-funding  arrangements. It does not take account of all other funding factors, including  some that distribute significant funding to small primary schools &mdash; which I  hear Members talk about constantly &mdash; in the form of small-school support and  funding for above-average teaching costs. Nor does the differential take into  account the significant funding, outside the formula-funded allocations, that  is being made exclusively available to primary schools, with, for example, the  investment of more than &pound;20 million into the early-years primary school  initiative making a good start (MAGS), the foundation stage provision and  support for primary-school teaching principals.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The assessment of primary schools in the North against  international comparisons of funding is simply not comparing like with like.  Such comparison is always difficult. The figure for primary schools here is  based on a single budgetary differential for one factor of formula funding  against a table of total expenditure data for countries in 2003.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">It is impossible to say whether that is the case for other  countries. Without extensive research on the basis for figures and detailed assessments  of expenditure in schools, it is not possible to state where schools in the  North would sit in such comparative tables.</p>
          <p class="TimePeriod">2.45 pm</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I have heard mention of other countries throughout Europe:  I say to Members, go to other countries in Europe &mdash; go to Finland &mdash; and  ask what they think of academic selection at 11. They think that it is  disgraceful &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order, order. The Minister has the Floor.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: They would say that it is disgraceful, discriminatory and  unfair, and severely impacts on the education of our children. Those countries  would not be turning a blind eye to the 12,000 people whom we are failing.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I want to emphasise the reality that, without significant  increases in available resources within the totality of the education budget,  the significant increases to funding being called for by primary schools could  only be at the expense of those children in other phases of education, such as  nursery and post-primary. The message has been received from schools and from  representatives at all levels that the skewing of funding to primary level can  be at the expense of stable provision for those other phases. Would anyone argue  that I should rob Peter &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order, order.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: Would anyone argue that I should rob Peter to pay Sinead? I  think not. Or should that be: rob Nigel to pay Sinead?</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Steps are being taken to maximise the use of resources in  the education system. Those changes will take time, as will the release of more  funding into the front-line services provided in schools. Shortly, I will be  initiating a review of existing funding arrangements that will better inform  the analysis of the funding required, not just for the primary sector but for  all schools. I want that review to examine funding arrangements in the South of  Ireland, in England, Scotland, and Wales,  and throughout Europe, and to undertake  extensive consultation across the education system in order to determine future  funding arrangements.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">In changing the current, largely historic funding arrangements,  the core focus needs to be on maintaining stability for schools and avoiding an  undue impact on school budgets, which would impact on education provision. I  have asked my officials to draw up a coherent framework for a review that will  provide assessment against current levels of provision; alignment with  outcomes; and a focus on the potential funding arrangements required to support  revised educational structures, collaboration and learning communities.  Significant emphasis will be placed on ensuring that all stakeholders and  partner bodies &mdash; including the Committee and the trade unions &mdash; are involved in  that review process, culminating in recommendations for changes.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">In the interim, as the Committee will be aware, proposals  are being developed for the first steps toward a review of both formula funding  and funding that is outside the formula. Proposals include distributing  foundation-stage funding to primary schools under the common funding formula,  which will consolidate that provision for schools, giving them additional  flexibility over its deployment.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">For many of those involved in the delivery of education  services &mdash; in schools and education and library boards &mdash; the earmarking of  funding by the Department has long been a source of frustration. The  introduction of the education and skills authority will provide the opportunity  for the Department to fundamentally re-evaluate previous practice and tackle  that issue head on. In the past, the accepted practice was to earmark money to  ensure that it was spent for the purpose for which it was given. I want to  change that and focus on where that money should be and on ensuring that policy  and the expected outcomes are being correctly delivered.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I recognise fully the importance of providing greater  autonomy to schools in managing their budgets; a balance must be struck,  however, to ensure that principals and boards of governors do not take short-  or medium-term decisions at the expense of long-term priorities. It may be  necessary, at times, to earmark budgets to ensure that specific initiatives are  delivered; however, that should be the exception and not the rule.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Another facet of the review of public administration is the  establishment of an education and skills authority. The authority will  streamline the administration of education, and is expected to release an  additional &pound;20 million annually to spend on the direct delivery of services in  schools. I look forward to the implementation of the review of public  administration.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Departmental budgets for next year will be determined by  the Executive and the Assembly during the Budget process, which is planned for  autumn 2008. The overall resources available for the North for the next two  years have been determined by the Treasury as part of the 2008-2011  comprehensive spending review. The scope for additional resources, therefore, is  likely to be limited for all Departments. Nevertheless, I will continue to  press for more resources for education at every opportunity, and I look forward  to Members&rsquo; support for my efforts. I hope that when the Budget is debated,  everyone who spoke so passionately here today will be equally supportive of my  call for more resources for education.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Recently, I launched the revised literacy and numeracy  strategy for consultation. To give all young people the best opportunity to  succeed in life and in work, we must all carefully consider the teaching and  learning of reading, writing and mathematics. We must set out for teachers,  schools, education and support bodies, parents and young people how we think  every child can be given a fair chance.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I thank Members for tabling the debate. Primary schools  have made their case for additional funding very well through their  representations. I say to them, Maith sibh!, well done, keep it up; we need to  hear your voices. I am committed to ensuring that the balance of funding for  primary schools reflects their fundamental role in building educational  foundations, tackling the cycle of deprivation, and equipping all learners with  the skills and knowledge that they need.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The motion calls for an urgent examination of issues and  proposals that would significantly increase funding in primary schools. Changes  are unavoidably constrained by the need to ensure that children are properly  supported at all stages.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Tac&oacute;idh an t-athbhreithni&uacute; ar mhaoini&uacute; le cinnt&iacute; agus le  socruithe maoinithe sa todhcha&iacute;.

          <p class="B3BodyText">The work on taking forward a review of funding will help to  support future decisions and funding arrangements. I hope that I have explained  the steps that I am taking to increase funding for early learning with the  resources that are available to me. I am sure that as we move forward, Members  will join with me in seeking to secure the maximum funding possible for all  education services.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat. Beidh m&eacute; ag dr&eacute;im le taca&iacute;ocht &oacute;  gach Comhalta. Thank you very much for all your support; I look forward to  working with you in the days, weeks and months ahead.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. T&aacute; an-&aacute;thas orm achoimri&uacute; a dh&eacute;anamh  ar an d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht, chan amh&aacute;in ar mo shon f&eacute;in ach ar son an Choiste  Oideachais. Gan amhras ar bith bh&iacute; d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht shuimi&uacute;il sp&eacute;isi&uacute;l againn  inniu, agus t&aacute; ard-&aacute;thas orm orm bhfuair an oiread sin daoine seans labhairt  uirthi. Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Cheann Comhairle as sin.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I declare an interest as a governor of an Irish-medium  primary school. I thank the Members who participated in the debate today, which  was extremely lively at times.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I am glad that so many Members were afforded the opportunity  to contribute to the debate.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome members of the Northern Ireland Primary  Principals&rsquo; Action Group. Mr Basil McCrea and I met them at their conference in  Cookstown, and we jointly sponsored their visit to the Long Gallery. I am glad  that the Chairperson of the Committee for Education, other Committee members,  Mr McElduff and I had the chance to address the group that day.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I will outline the per annum funding figures:  primary-school pupils attract &pound;2,045; secondary-school pupils in years 8 to 12  attract &pound;3,302; and sixth-form pupils attract over &pound;5,000. From my examination  of the issues, I concluded that there are five main reasons that  secondary-school pupils attract more funding than those at primary school:  secondary schools require smaller classes for certain subjects; teachers are  afforded preparation, planning and assessment time; some subjects require  specialist accommodation; pupils require specialist equipment for certain  subjects; and elements of the curriculum require specialist support staff. The  same five reasons apply to the even higher funding that is attracted by  sixth-form pupils.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Why do primary-school pupils attract only &pound;2,045 per annum?  The five reasons for that are: pupils are taught in large classes; their  teachers are not allocated 10% of their time for preparation, planning and  assessment; the schools do not have the necessary specialist accommodation that  many parts of the curriculum require; there is none of the specialist equipment  that is needed to implement the revised curriculum; and primary schools do not  have the specialist support staff who are required for many subjects, including  IT.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I agree with the Minister that funding education should not  be a case of robbing Peter to pay Paul. However, one cannot help thinking that  the secondary sector is better off and that the primary sector is its poor  relation. It is ironic that pupils who stay on at school beyond the statutory  school-leaving age attract twice the amount of funding per capita as those in  the early stages of their education. Surely that demonstrates where priorities  lie &mdash; and they are not in the primary sector.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister has told the House time and time again, and it  has been reiterated in the debate, that early intervention is educationally and  economically beneficial. However, the funding of the education system does not  reflect those truths. Mr Kennedy reminded the Assembly that, in late 2007, the  Nobel laureate economist James Heckman told us in Belfast that investment in policies that  result in early intervention has a high rate of return, whereas social policies  that mean intervention in later stages of the cycle result in a low economic  return. Investment in primary education is, therefore, the best form of early  intervention.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Primary-school principals are not asking for better  treatment than their secondary-school colleagues; they want a level playing  field so that primary-school pupils and their teachers have equality with their  respective counterparts at secondary level, and they want that level playing  field to extend to other geographical areas.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I thank members of the Assembly&rsquo;s Committee for Education,  who accepted the motion that I put to them and that is being debated.</p>
          <p class="TimePeriod">3.00 pm</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I would have preferred the motion to have had more teeth,  but, to ensure all-party support, I agreed to a wording that was not so strong.  I am also grateful to the Committee for Education for agreeing to launch an  inquiry into the funding of primary education in the new Assembly session.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I return to the debate and to the themes that Members have  outlined. The Chairperson of the Education Committee, Mr Storey, and Ken  Robinson spoke of the AWPU. The increase from 1&middot;02 to 1&middot;04 in 2008-09 worked  out at &pound;102 per pupil. That increase was immed&shy;iately absorbed by inflationary  price rises, leaving only enough money to buy 20 minutes per day of a classroom  assistant&rsquo;s time. The Chairperson of the Committee gave the House an assurance  that the Committee would scrutinise the review of the funding formula.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Mr O&rsquo;Dowd said that this debate marked the start of a  process, and he welcomed all-party support for the motion. He cautioned against  an increase in the AWPU &mdash; he believed that that might prove dangerous for  smaller schools. However, he agreed that the funding formula should be  reviewed.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Basil McCrea emphasised that educational underachievement  begins in early life. Other Members, including Mr McCausland, Mr Ross and Mr  Poots, agreed and &mdash; in common with the Minister and me &mdash; advocated early  intervention.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Other Members, including Mr Lunn and Mr Basil McCrea,  considered that there were too many initiatives and that there should be more  core funding. The Department of Education accepts that the differentials are  historical. Every party agrees that that situation should be addressed. Basil  McCrea said that if nothing were done, the status quo would remain. He  considered that we have a very good curriculum, but not the resources to  deliver it.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Mary Bradley referred to a primary school in her  constituency, and the effects of underfunding on it. She said that no  additional classroom assistants will be provided for children with learning  difficulties and a special-educational-needs support teacher has been made  redundant.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Michelle McIlveen and Jonathan Craig referred to the high  levels of stress in modern teaching and emphasised the need to address that  problem. They also observed that some schools were relying on fund-raising by parent-teacher  associations to compensate for underfunding.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McElduff berated the SDLP for voting against the Budget.  However, at the time, we warned the Minister that she had not costed her  reforms and that they were not in the Programme for Government. I notice that,  in her latest statement, on area-based planning, the Minister now agrees with  us and is seeking more funding for her reforms. I am glad that she has come  round to our way of thinking.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister&rsquo;s party colleague Martina Anderson provided a  fine eulogy of the Minister during a recent apparition in Derry.  I was tempted on that occasion to call the Minister &ldquo;blessed Caitr&iacute;ona of  Crossmolina&rdquo;.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I am glad that we have achieved such a strong degree of  agreement on the motion, to which I add my support.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
          <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly calls on the Minister of Education to  urgently examine measures and bring forward proposals which would significantly  increase funding to primary schools.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Speaker. The time that was allotted for the debate was  two and a half hours. I made a representation to you to the effect that Members  should have longer to speak. Will you bring that matter to the attention of the  Business Committee so that Members who wish to speak for longer, or who wish to  speak a second time, can do so?</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>: I  thought yours was long.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. I am content to refer to the Business Committee the issue of the length  of speaking time that is allocated to Members during debates.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McLaughlin</strong>:  Further to that point of order, it may be worthwhile to examine the Hansard  report of the debate to see how often Members repeated the same point ad  infinitum. It was a very predictable and boring discussion &mdash;<span class="Italic"> [Interruption.]</span></p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. This is, as always, the cut and thrust of debate &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Further to that point of order, Mitchel McLaughlin was not here for most of the  debate. I do not see how he is in a position to pass judgement on it. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  He only heard the Minister.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McLaughlin</strong>:  I was watching it on television.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. As regards Basil McCrea&rsquo;s point of order, and from the point of view of  the Business Committee, all party Whips agree time limits for Members who wish  to speak in debates. For the preceding debate those times were 10 minutes for  the proposer, 10 minutes for the winding-up speech, 25 minutes for the Minister  and five minutes for every other Member. Members should be clear on that issue.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Further to my point of order, I accept the Speaker&rsquo;s explanation. However,  perhaps the Business Committee when considering the matter will take as its  primacy that every Member who wants to speak should be allowed to speak first  and that if time remains, perhaps another way could be found.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I would ask that the Member also refers those remarks to his party Whip.</p>
          <p class="H4StageHeading"><a name="6"></a>Report of the Committee for Agriculture and Rural  Development into <br>
            Renewable Energy and Alternative Land  Use</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Business Committee has agreed to allow up to one hour and 30 minutes for  the debate. The proposer of the motion will have 10 minutes to propose the  motion and 10 minutes for the winding-up speech. All other Members will have  five minutes.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development (Dr W McCrea)</strong>: I beg  to move</p>
          <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly approves the Report of the Committee for  Agriculture and Rural Development (39/07/08R) into Renewable Energy and  Alternative Land Use.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I apologise to Members for the slight delay in the delivery  of the report. The Committee unanimously approved the report at its meeting on  Tuesday 24 June and it must be said &mdash;</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Neeson</strong>:  On a point of order, is it in order for the debate to take place today? On 30  January, the Chairperson of the Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development  wrote to the Chairperson of the Committee for Enterprise,  Trade and Investment and gave assurances that members of the Committee for Enterprise, Trade and  Investment would have a week to consider the report&rsquo;s recommendations. That did  not happen. Therefore, is it in order that the debate should proceed today?</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  All items of business on the Order Paper are in order. Perhaps, the Chairperson  of the Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development would like to address  the point made by the Member?</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: The Member is a  former Deputy Speaker of the House and should know how the business of the  House operates. When a matter of business is on the Order Paper, it is in  order.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">When he made his point of order, I was in the midst of  apologising to Members, the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment and  members of the Committee for Enterprise,  Trade and Investment for the delay in getting the report to them. The Committee  for Agriculture and Rural Development &mdash; which is representative of the vast majority  of Members in the House at the moment &mdash; passed the report on 24 June. The  Printed Paper Office did an excellent job in getting the report to the  Committee Office by the following Thursday. Unfortunately, the Committee was on  a visit arranged and hosted by the Department on that day and it was not until  the following day &mdash; 27 June &mdash; that the Committee Office was able to process and  deliver the report.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee could have delayed the report, but there is a  tremendous pressure out there, and for the Committee to allow the report to sit  in abeyance until after the summer recess would not be fitting, and I do not  think that any Member of this House would want the report to be sitting,  collecting dust. We want action on the issue rather than standing on some  little piece of ceremony. I apologise, and I assure the House that there was no  discourtesy meant.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Today, we are dealing with issues that are relevant to the  Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development. I am sure that there are many  issues that the Committee for Enterprise,  Trade and Investment will be able to take up, and I would be happy for the Department  to take those on board.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Surely, Members are mature enough to realise that there is  a tremendous need in the community for renewable energy. Rather than standing  on ceremony, we should ensure that we take those needs seriously.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">That is, unless we want to play a game that allows the  report to sit in abeyance for the next two months, until we return and find  time to reschedule it for debate. That is not what people want. I urge the  honourable Member to think seriously before he suggests that we go down that  road.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I have apologised on behalf of the Committee. Mr Neeson may  hold up as many papers as he wants, but I am telling him exactly how it is. I  would be delighted if the Committee for Enterprise,  Trade and Investment, of which he is a member, were to takes its own action on  renewable energy, at the same time as the Committee for Agriculture and Rural  Development fulfils its responsibilities and pursues its course.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">My Committee tried to keep the matter completely within the  remit of the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, for which we are  responsible. The Committee has no wish to stray into the Department of  Enterprise, Trade and Investment&rsquo;s territory. I also put on record my apology  to the Minister &mdash;</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms J McCann</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: No, I have only 10  minutes in which to speak, and I want to deal with the issues. If the Member  wants to speak, I am sure that she will catch your eye, Mr Speaker. That is a  possibility if her party Whip has put forward her name to speak in the debate.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Speaker, I am honoured to present the first report of  the Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development to the House for Members&rsquo;  approval.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee&rsquo;s inquiry was conducted against a background  of low incomes in the farming sector, increased feed costs and pressure from Europe to comply with nitrates directives. Those are  serious issues that fall within our remit, as the scrutiny Committee for the  Department.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee believed that practical solutions, evident in  most other European countries, would already have been packaged and set for  delivery. As the inquiry progressed, energy needs and the rising cost of  meeting consumer demand were seldom out of the news headlines.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee found that solutions existed, that they were  available, and &mdash; importantly &mdash; that they were working. Unfortunately, those  solutions were in other European countries, while Northern Ireland waited for them to  be packaged.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I will not criticise Departments for the sake of doing so &mdash;  I am simply reporting what the Committee found out during its deliberations.  The Committee was deliberate in linking most of the recommendations in its  report to the comments of individuals and organisations that provided it with  evidence. However, as part of Govern&shy;ment, we have a duty to apply constructive  criticism when applicable, and to respond in an appropriate, positive manner.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Members are aware that the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment has the lead  role on energy issues. The Committee took time to ensure that the inquiry&rsquo;s  terms of reference precisely and clearly addressed renewable-energy matters in  a rural context. The majority of the Committee&rsquo;s questions explored how  macro-energy solutions could be applied to the rural environment and to rural  communities.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">However, the Committee was told that renewable energy is a  legitimate concern for many Assembly Committees and must not be regarded as the  exclusive preserve of either the Committee for Enterprise, Trade and Investment or the  Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Several of the report&rsquo;s recommendations call on the  Executive to take collective action. The most important of those is the  recommendation to use public-sector procurement to create a market demand for  the use of biomass as an energy source. No Department on its own can achieve  that. Central Government must create the market certainty that is required to  encourage farmers to invest their time, land and money. I am certain that the  agricultural sector will respond to that level of support.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Unfortunately, the lack of progress is frustrating  stakeholders and some Committee members. They believe that Northern Ireland remains behind its counterparts  in Europe. I have already stated that we based  the report purely on evidence that was presented to the Committee. That  evidence included 26 written submissions, four of which were from Departments  or Government bodies.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee called in witnesses from the Department of  Agriculture and Rural Development and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment, and it was extremely disappointed to learn of delays in key  strategic reports.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I will depart slightly from my earlier statement about  levelling criticism.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Some criticism must be directed at the Department of  Agriculture and Rural Development.</p>
          <p class="TimePeriod">3.15 pm</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee was genuinely keen to learn about the actions  deriving from the renewable energy action plan and, equally, from the agrifood  waste challenge fund. Therefore, it was with great disappointment that the  Committee learned that little progress had been made on the action plan. The  Committee acknowledged the excellent research being undertaken at the College of Agriculture, Food and Rural Enterprise  and by the Agri-Food and Biosciences Institute. Indeed, the Committee  recommends that, using whatever resources are necessary, research should  continue, particularly the on-farm anaerobic digestion trials and the research  on whether anaerobic digestion might be another means of complying with the  nitrates directives.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee recommends that the Department of Agriculture  and Rural Development establish a virtual centre of renewable energy excellence  to capture the benefits of the work being undertaken in Northern Ireland  and to introduce best practice in the rural context. That could also include a  non-food crop centre for Northern    Ireland to link research to production and  to the market.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">However, there remains a need to progress beyond research  and into action. That action can be incorporated in, and provide value to,  rural communities. It is genuinely unfortunate that the Department has not  provided the Committee with evidence that those actions will be implemented in  the long term. We must move beyond the research stage, and the Committee will  support any bid for additional funding that the Department might make to ensure  that there is movement on the matter. I could raise many other issues but I  realise that time is going by quickly.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I genuinely believe that the Committee has taken a very  balanced approach throughout its preparation of the report, and members have  been privileged to have received evidence from several very knowledgeable  individuals and organisations. Indeed, we are still receiving submissions to  the inquiry, which the Committee will continue to consider as part of the  normal Committee sessions. We are indebted to all who have taken a keen  interest in the Committee&rsquo;s work, and we applaud them for their role in the  report.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I wish to put on record our thanks to our special advisor  to the Committee, the Committee researcher, the Hansard staff and the  doorkeepers for their help during the inquiry as well as the Committee staff. I  commend the report to the House and I trust that we will have its full backing.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Doherty</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I commend the Chairperson, the Deputy  Chairperson and members of the Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development  for presenting the report into renewable energy and alternative land use.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I will quote from the section of the report relating to market  certainty, which says:</p>
          <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Rural businesses need more certainty of the market if  they are to invest in the bio-energy sector; lack of confidence in the supply  chair is a major barrier in the renewable energy sector. Farmers&rsquo; long-term  commitment to energy crops needs the support of secure market demand.&rdquo;</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The recommendation in that section reads:</p>
          <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Public sector procurement should favour biomass  heating solutions, helping to create the market demand to stimulate the industry.  Such a commitment would be aligned with the Government&rsquo;s climate change and  sustainable development objectives.&rdquo;</p>
          <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Confidence and secure market demand are key to  developing the whole sector. The question is how to secure market confidence  and create a secure market demand. At this point, a huge onus lies on the  Executive, as the collective body, to produce a working group spanning all  sectors. For example, can heating systems be provided in new houses that will  draw energy from agriculture? Other sectors must also be considered. However, although  this is a good, solid report, if we do not get market certainty it will sit on  the shelf and gather dust.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Confidence and market certainty are required. The only way  to achieve them is if the relevant Minister &mdash; Michelle Gildernew in this case &mdash;  works with the Committee, raises the issue in the Executive and tries to  establish a working group across the various sectors, from which a basic action  plan to develop the sector will emerge.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Savage</strong>: I  support the motion. In 2005, the total greenhouse-gas emissions in Northern Ireland  were 5&middot;5% below the levels in 1990. However, there was a 15&middot;8% reduction on  1990 emissions of greenhouse gases in the UK overall. Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  performance in response to climate change can be improved, and the report offers  constructive proposals for the use of renewable energy. In addition, we face  unprecedented rises in energy costs and emerging energy security issues.  Renewable energy and alternative land use can play a crucial role in the future  of energy provision in Northern Ireland  and the UK.  It can also offer business and diversification opportunities to the rural  community.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I will examine the section of the report entitled  &ldquo;Opportunities for Farms and Rural Businesses&rdquo;. I concur with the Committee&rsquo;s  findings that:</p>
          <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;there was a lack of focus on the opportunities for  family farms and rural businesses in the development of renewable energy with  most of the attention, investment and fiscal support being for large-scale wind  developments.&rdquo;</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I agree that:</p>
          <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The Executive should increase the use of biomass as  an energy source, introducing a hierarchy of its use. There is widespread  agreement that the best use of biomass is for heating, replacing fossil fuels.  Below that in the hierarchy comes electricity generation and finally liquid  biofuels, the least carbon-efficient use of biomass.&rdquo;</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">It is also clear that:</p>
          <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Rural businesses need more certainty of the market if  they are to invest in the bio-energy sector; lack of confidence in the supply  chain is a major barrier in the renewable energy sector.&rdquo;</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The long-term commitment of farmers and small businesses to  renewables requires the support of Government and the development of a secure  market. With that in mind:</p>
          <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Public sector procurement should favour biomass  heating solutions, helping to create the market demand to stimulate the  industry. Such a commitment would be aligned with the Government&rsquo;s climate  change and sustainable development objectives.&rdquo;</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Many technologies are fledgling, and it may be years before  commercial application is taken up by many small businesses. However:</p>
          <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;There is much of value on which to build &mdash; some  world-class research at the universities and at AFBI, a range of commercial  companies investing in the sector here and a budding demand for some of the  technologies &hellip;</p>
          <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">The Department for Agriculture and Rural Development  should establish a (virtual) Centre of Renewable Energy Excellence to capture  the benefits of the work being undertaken in Northern Ireland and to introduce  best practice within a rural context.&rdquo;</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The report makes reasonable and considered recommendations  that promote the use of renewable energy sources in Northern Ireland. The Committee&rsquo;s  most significant conclusion was that DARD and DETI could be more proactive in  providing the necessary research and funding for &mdash; and implementation of &mdash;  their relevant strategies, because they are having a detrimental effect on the  potential renewables industry.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The report recognises the importance of Government support  and subsidies for the fledgling field, much as it was to the development of  wind power in the 1990s. That includes support for technological development  and the creation of some market certainty for the initial stages of market  development through initiatives such as the establishment of public procurement  for biomass heat and electricity.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">However, it is worth considering some of the wider issues  that surround the potential agricultural and environmental effects of renewable  energy and alternative land use.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Wider debates are going on about the effect that biofuel  production could have on food costs, production and biodiversity. Such debates  are important, and we must continue to examine whether the global aggregate  environmental and humanitarian costs of biomass, especially biofuels, are  greater than the climate change and economic benefits.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member&rsquo;s time is almost up.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Savage</strong>:  Although Northern Ireland  has been intensively farmed, there are large areas of grazing land that provide  many opportunities.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P J Bradley</strong>:  I welcome the opportunity to comment on the report. Although I support the  motion, I wish to place on the record my views about renewable energies, which  I accept will not necessarily be fully shared by all who contributed to the  report. I said previously that some may think that such views place me out on a  limb.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I have studied in reasonable detail many differing views  and opinions on the subject of biofuels, and I have noted that some  commentators have concerns about the content of the gas that is produced when  biofuels are burned. One biomass expert claimed that when biofuels burn in an  engine, the combustion gases that are produced are carcinogenic and over 20  times more potent than carbon dioxide. That is why I stated that I was disappointed  that the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety did not avail  itself of the opportunity to make a submission to the inquiry. However, as we  heard from the Chairman, it may yet be on its way &mdash; the Committee is still  receiving submissions. One day, the views of health departments around the  globe may well determine the future thinking on the burning of biofuels.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I also urge caution to those who promote the use of our  best agricultural land for biofuel crops. It is rather short-sighted to  relegate prime farmland to growing products that we know little about.  Questions must be asked about whether there is any long-term damage to topsoil  when biofuels are grown. If that were to be the case, how many generations  would it take for the soil to recover its former food-producing qualities?</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">It is such questions that force me to qualify my support  for the alternative use of land and the growing of energy crops. Therefore, I  suggest to those who may be listening seriously to the debate that only the abundant  poor-quality land across Northern    Ireland and the areas that are not best  suited to producing good food should be used to grow biofuel crops.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">There is, as the report claims, enormous potential to  participate in the renewable-energy sector. However, that should not be at a  price; prime farmland must be safeguarded. I know that by saying that I am  somewhat ruling out the growing of rapeseed and other oil-bearing crops, but so  be it.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">It is an established fact that on the island  of Ireland we grow the best grass and  root crops in Europe, and high-quality grain  crops. Why, at a time of great hunger throughout the world, should we give up  doing what we do best, which is producing high-quality, healthy food?</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I refer to world hunger, and I contend that it would be  foolish to think that food problems are confined to locations many tens of  thousands of miles away. Our dependence on imported food is so great that  contingency arrangements must be put in place for the day when the inward  supply of food may not be so plentiful.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">It should also be noted that the prime reason for the  significant increase in food prices in recent times is the shortage of land for  food production. In a joint statement issued in early July 2007, the Food and  Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and the Organization for  Economic Co-operation and Development warned that:</p>
          <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Increased demand for bio-fuels is causing fundamental  changes to agricultural markets that could drive up world prices for many farm  products.&rdquo;</p>
          <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Within six months to a year, those predictions have  already become a reality.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">If the inward supply of food were to cease tomorrow for  whatever reason, in Northern    Ireland we have enough food on supermarket  shelves and in storage to feed people for five to six days. If we have no home-produced  food to rely on, that could become a problem.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I accept that, should we develop the use of biomass as an  energy source &mdash; even from less-favoured land &mdash; its best use would be for  heating purposes. I doubt whether electricity generation or liquid biofuels  will ever emerge as the answer to what we are hoping to achieve in deriving  energy from the renewable sector.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I support the call to devise and develop the use of  alternative energy, which might help to reduce our dependence on oil and natural  gas, and, in keeping with my earlier comments on the protection of prime  farmland, I believe that alternatives can be found.</p>
          <p class="TimePeriod">3.30 pm</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The utilisation of wind energy, although not necessarily a  new discovery, is the most natural alternative available. Anaerobic digestion  is another source worthy of thorough investigation. The principle is sound, but  is the viability in keeping with the principle?</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">In mid-May, the Committee, as Members heard, visited the  Agri-Food and Biosciences Institute at Hillsborough. We saw at first hand the  excellent experimental work carried out on anaerobic digestion. It was  disappointing to learn that the Department&rsquo;s action plan had not progressed in  the first 15 months of its existence.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">It is important that DARD ensures that no financial  restrictions are placed on funding the work carried out at Hillsborough, as  anaerobic digestion might one day allow many farming families &mdash;</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr T Clarke</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P J Bradley</strong>:  I am sorry but the time in which I have to speak is almost up.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Anaerobic digestion might one day allow many farming  families to join the plans to deliver alternative sources of energy.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member&rsquo;s time is almost up.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P J Bradley</strong>:  I support the motion, albeit with a health warning.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  am certainly the first &mdash; and perhaps will be the last &mdash; Member to speak in this  debate who did not help to write the report.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">In that context, I do not intend to engage in the spat  between representatives from the Committee for Enterprise, Trade and Investment and the  Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development who raised the issue. However,  it is important that this topic is debated; it should not sit on the shelf. It  is something with which every Member of the Assembly should be seen to be  engaged.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">When the Chairperson began the debate he talked about the  need for action, which Mr Doherty supported. It is regrettable to read in the  report that the Department&rsquo;s so-called action plan has sat for 15 months  without any action being taken, which P J Bradley highlighted. If I were not  running the risk of being accused of acting as opposition for opposition&rsquo;s sake  &mdash; although some Members here doubtless do that &mdash; I would say that unfortunately  that is too often the case.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Departments have action plan after action plan. All kinds  of wonderful recommendations are put down on paper, but sometimes we are not  particularly good at putting those into practice. There is a lesson there for  each of us. As the Chairperson said at the start of the debate, the Committee  represents nearly every section of the Assembly. In fact, it is representative  of the four Executive parties, and I trust that all members of the Committee  will lobby their Ministers for some kind of movement forward, because this is  an issue that requires a joined-up approach.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The issue does not just involve DETI, which is responsible  for energy and the electricity-transmission infrastructure. Yesterday, during  questions to the Minister for Social Development, the potential for alternative  fuels to be used in social housing to deal with fuel poverty was highlighted.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">DOE has major issues about, in particular, the Planning  Service and its environmental responsibilities, and yet it did not have any  input into this particular report. The report makes reference to building  regulations, which have been held back by DFP. Some of us hold the opinion that  unfortunately certain potential building regulations have not been carried  through.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">OFMDFM has an overarching relationship with almost  everything, but has particular responsibility for sustainable development.  However, we are far off being able to meet the targets for renewable energy  that we are obligated to under European, international and UK agreements.  Real issues exist, which must be examined to see what needs to be done.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">P J Bradley spoke of the role of DHSSPS, but I am not sure  that I necessarily agree with his comments in that respect. Some points,  however, can be highlighted from outside regarding the Committee&rsquo;s report: in  particular, the recommendation that there should be a hierarchy in the use of  biomass. Will the Member who is to make the winding-up speech in this debate  consider the use of more innovative thinking in looking at opportunities to  develop combined heat and power on a domestic scale? We are not meeting those  needs by saying that electricity comes after space heating. Otherwise it  appears that the report is merely catching up with other people rather than  using the unique opportunities of tidal power, which I may not be allowed to  mention, and wind power, and the possibilities for growing willow and  miscanthsus as biomass. Northern    Ireland should not be catching up with other  countries; it should be innovating compared with other countries.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">That ties in with the issue highlighted in the report&rsquo;s  recommendation that refers to the Executive&rsquo;s risk aversion. Unfortunately,  that seems to be a byword for the culture here; we are generally risk averse.  It would be good to see a few failures because DARD had encouraged people to  innovate. At present, it seems that DARD and other Departments are entirely  risk averse and only a small number of entrepreneurs are taking risks and  setting lessons for all of us.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The issues of anaerobic digestion are similar. I know that  such work is currently under way at Hillsborough, but work on anaerobic  digestion was done 20 years ago in a Portglenone monastery. We have not really  moved a great deal &mdash; why not, after we faced the problems of the nitrates  directive? To be parochial, in South Antrim,  we might solve some of the problems of incinerating poultry litter if there  were more anaerobic digestion.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">We should praise the efforts that are being made by groups  such as Balcas in respect of wood pellets and rural generation; and the use of  willow, particularly for remediation. We should, however, also face up to the  fact that progress on wind energy is being held up by PPS 18. There are genuine  issues of land quality and how we should encourage the appropriate growing of  crops. Moreover, we should recognise the recent report by Action Renewables,  which demonstrated the potential for 400 jobs in the long term in the field of  alternative energy production.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Irwin</strong>: I  welcome the Committee&rsquo;s report, and I declare an interest as a farmer.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">To the average farmer, the idea of renewable energy and  alternative uses of land firmly remains a secondary option. For a number of  years, farmers in Northern    Ireland have been under considerable strain.  We need to be cautious about championing the benefits of renewable energy when  the Assembly could do much more to assist farmers in ways that would yield much  more stabilising results.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">In some cases, harnessing renewable energy requires a  fairly large outlay of cash. In many cases, such finance is not readily  available to farmers. Under recent programmes, the use of grant aid has been  welcome. However, even with the assistance of such aid, a large contribution  has been required from the farmer.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">In some cases, farmers have been unable to use wind  turbines due to units failing or blades working loose and flying across  farmyards. Those types of stories, and the difficult situations in which  farmers find themselves &mdash; when turbines cannot be used, or when the farmer&rsquo;s  money is tied up &mdash; do not paint the perfect picture of renewable energy. I want  an assurance from the Minister that the Department will do all in its power to  help farmers to address those issues, which the Department has a moral duty to  do.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Northern    Ireland almost entirely relies on imported energy  supplies such as oil, coal and electricity. Therefore, we have little control  over the cost of energy. In recent months, world energy prices have risen  sharply, and everyone is feeling the effects of that.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">As the report points out, the development of renewable  energy is in its infancy. A great deal of work remains to be done in order to  encourage more rural businesses to consider using a source of renewable energy.  The renewable energy action plan must become the renewed focus of the  Department. More importantly, rural businesses should be made fully aware of  the funding options that are available to them. I welcome the report.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Molloy</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I welcome the report. An important  stage has been reached in respect of energy and in dealing with farm waste. The  report details how we should implement a plan that will get the best from the  energy that is available and how we capture it, particularly when it comes to  crops and biomass.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">As is already the case in many countries, such measures should  be combined with waste-management structures. If such a system were put in  place, it could deal with both farm waste and municipal waste. In some  circumstances, one system can be combined with the other.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">We recently held a debate on the issue of chicken litter.  That matter could be dealt with by a combined system that could deal with the  waste and produce energy from it in a way that could be managed.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">People have concerns about anaerobic digestion and incineration.  Those concerns are rightly held, but there are means of modern technology that  could deal with the mechanical biological treatment of waste, gasification and  anaerobic digestion. Once a package is put together, there will be a mechanism  that could deal with farm waste and municipal waste at the same time.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The benefits of producing crops to coincide with that  system, and using the maximum amount of available resources, in order to  provide a solution should be a cross-departmental challenge. The issue is not  entirely one for DARD, nor DETI.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Several Departments can come together to ensure that we  find practical ways of dealing with the situation. Our situation may be unique,  but we can learn from the experiences of other countries &mdash; some of which have  been well researched in the past few years &mdash; to ensure that we have a means of  capturing energy and turning it into resources or fuel for the future. The  report is important and the Assembly must take it on board.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">This morning, I talked to a gentleman from Sweden about  waste and waste management. He asked me what our plans were to develop energy  from waste and how we were preparing to deal with the energy needs of the  future. I had to tell him that we had no direct plan in place. He found it very  strange that we had no overall strategy for dealing with energy and waste,  considering the present fuel crisis and the problems associated with European  directives to deal with waste and waste on farms.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The process is at an important stage, so we do not have time  to sit back and let the matter rest on the shelf. Action must be taken across  Departments and the Executive must make decisions. It is unfortunate that this  Executive does not have the Executive programme funds of the previous  Executive, which would have ensured that the matter was driven and resources  were available. However, we must ensure that benefits can be gained from energy  already on our farms to benefit our farmers and to clean up the environment.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bresland</strong>:  I support the report of the Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development  into renewable energy and alternative land use. The Committee sought to explore  the potential economic benefits that Northern Ireland&rsquo;s agriculture  industry and rural businesses could gain from renewable energy and alternative  land use.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Northern    Ireland farmers have always sought to  provide high-quality food, and they are internationally renowned for excelling  in breeding high-quality pigs, sheep and beef and dairy cattle, and for growing  world-class grasses, clovers, grains and potatoes. The main aim of our farmers  has been to produce top-quality, healthy food and, regrettably, the agriculture  industry in Northern Ireland  has not been receiving its fair share of economic return. Many farmers have  left the industry while others have diversified or sought alternative  employment in order to maintain incomes for their families.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Recently, we have heard much about a possible world  shortage of food. Farmers in Northern    Ireland are not paid enough and continue to  be choked with red tape, neither of which encourages the farming community to  maximise its food-producing potential. Recent farm-gate price increases have  been wiped out by the increasing cost of inputs, many of which are due to the  continual increase in the demand for oil.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">It is in that climate, along with new opportunities from  the Northern Ireland  rural development programme, that farmers are looking at the opportunities  offered through renewable energy. The Assembly recently debated a motion on  fuel costs and the effect of fuel poverty, and it was clear that we have little  control over fuel costs beyond energy efficiency and the possibility of  supporting renewable energy programmes.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The report highlights the need for a joined-up approach by  several Departments, including the Department of Agriculture and Rural  Development, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment, the Department  for Social Development and, as regards planning policy, the Department of the  Environment.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I take this opportunity to highlight one of the  recommendations that supports the concept of a centre for renewable energy  excellence. Many farmers benefited from the Peace II-funded Focus Farms  Programme, which provided farmers in Northern Ireland with a resource  that enabled them to learn at first hand new ideas, the impact of research and  how such ideas affected working farms. That centre of excellence could give the  opportunity farmers to learn at first hand the processes and pitfalls of any  new direction for our farming community.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Such support also requires adequate and effective research  that provides the industry with the information that is necessary to make  choices. The need for such research has been highlighted in the report,  especially that concerning anaerobic digestion and the benefits that the  nitrates directive offers.</p>
          <p class="TimePeriod">3.45 pm</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I am confident that the farming community will see the  opportunities that renewable energy can create. I hope that Departments will  also respond positively to the opportunities that are outlined in the report.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development (Ms Gildernew)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a  Cheann Comhairle. I welcome the Committee&rsquo;s timely report into renewable energy  and alternative land use, especially given the continued escalation of energy  prices, which have an impact on us all.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee has carried out a very valuable piece of  work. However, I received the report only last Friday afternoon; I got sight of  it only on Monday; and I have not had sufficient time to consider its  recommendations in detail. That said, I intend to issue a detailed response to  the Committee in due course.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I note that the Committee acknowledges that the bioenergy  report that was commissioned by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment and that will be available in several weeks will have a bearing on  its own report. I also await the bioenergy report with interest. It, along with  the Committee&rsquo;s report, will inform the development of a cross-departmental  strategic approach to bioenergy. The DETI report in particular will assist in  informing the rural community of the potential market opportunities that exist  here in the North. My officials have been working closely with DETI to ensure  that the interests of the land-based sector are considered fully.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Bioenergy is unique in that it can make a contribution to  the three main energy markets &mdash; electricity, heat, and transport &mdash; all of which  are important for family farm and rural businesses. It is also very important  to ensure that bioenergy resources are deployed in the best possible way to  optimise feed-stock uses and to give the best energy and carbon-reduction  outcomes. The very challenging EU and public service agreement renewable energy  targets are also rightly prominent in the Committee&rsquo;s report, and the response  to the current consultation on the renewable energy strategy will also be key  in developing a road map to address those targets. I note the Committee&rsquo;s  comments of a strategic nature, and, in particular, I and my ministerial  colleagues will wish to ensure alignment of departmental policies.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Turning to what my Department has done to date, the  implementation of the 35 recommendations of the renewable energy action plan  has provided a positive start. Perhaps more consideration could have been given  to the work that officials have carried out in briefing the Committee on that  action plan and on what has happened.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I will mention some of the other things that have been  done. Training and awareness of renewable energy technologies has been provided  to over 1,500 farmers. The well-attended renewables open day at the Loughry  campus of the College   of Agriculture, Food and  Rural Enterprise (CAFRE) last August, which I attended, was successful in  communicating new technologies. That work continues at CAFRE in collaboration  with the Carbon Trust and the Farm Energy Centre at Stoneleigh in England to  develop a range of industry benchmarks that are aimed at delivering energy  efficiencies at farm level.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Additionally, training for installers of renewable energy  technologies has also been funded under the INTERREG programme. The NIRDP in  particular has implemented several measures that will help to further develop  land-based renewable energy systems. Those measures include: the introduction  of processing and marketing grants in the forestry sector; modernisation of  agriculture holdings via biomass boilers and solar panels; support for  short-rotation coppice; diversification; and business creation and development.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Case-study work from the wind-powered turbines that have  been installed on the CAFRE estate will also provide much-needed information on  operational issues. Work is also under way to assist the development of energy  supply chains through demonstration of best practice through, for example, our  focus farms and in the forestry sector.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">A range of research programmes that have been sponsored by  my Department are currently underway at AFBI in collaboration with other  research centres. Miscanthus, which is an additional potential energy crop, is  being evaluated, and at this stage yields look promising.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">AFBI is also hosting an international conference and  exhibition on renewable energy at the end of October to explore the local  contribution that can be made to renewable energy targets. I am sure that the  Committee will be interested in hearing about that conference and in perhaps  attending it, so I would welcome the Committee&rsquo;s interest.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Biomass boilers at the CAFRE and AFBI sites will be used to  evaluate and demonstrate the effectiveness of biomass systems for heat  production in the rural community and the supply chains that are needed. There  must be a sustainable procurement strategy. The supply of biomass in the North  is finite; at present, some is brought across from Scotland. It must, therefore, be  ensured that supply can meet demand. An on-farm anaerobic digester is also  being trialled at AFBI Hillsborough. Innovation fund bids have been secured for  research and development of anaerobic digestion in the local context.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">On my appointment as Minister, I inherited the renewable  energy action plan, which included a proposed challenge fund. In late 2007, I  established a renewable energy policy unit. The Department has secured national  and matching EU funds, which are available from 1 April 2009. At present,  therefore, that money is not available. I am currently reassessing needs in the  current climate in order to target any capital intervention for the best  possible return and to ensure that sustainable technologies are identified.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee report has come at a time when several  reports, which include the all-Ireland grid study, are to hand. During the  coming weeks and months, it is important that all reports are fully considered  in order to achieve a coherent framework. To assist that, I am currently  establishing a stakeholder-led group to ensure that my Department&rsquo;s renewables  action plan is reviewed and refreshed and that available support is effectively  targeted at sustainable actions that contribute to targets for energy from renewable  sources. Comple&shy;mentarity with existing work and reports will be a key objective  of the group. My Department and its agencies have made a constructive start in  building infrastructure and conducting research that will provide an important  expertise base and will instil confidence in people to invest in the future.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I also recognise the importance of supporting policies that  drive opportunities for renewable energy production and utilisation in an  efficient, sustainable and balanced way, particularly for the rural community.  I am keen to ensure that renewable energy policies are aligned across  Government and are implemented in an integrated manner. I hope that Committee  members will realise that renewable energy will demand long-term sustainable  approaches and robust economic evaluations.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I agree with most of the Members&rsquo; contributions. For  example, I support comments on the balance of the food-versus-fuel debate and  on the need to consider all forms of renewable energy, such as wind and wave  energy. However, in saying that, the escalating price of energy is unlikely to  recede. The challenge is on everyone to meet energy needs from more than just  traditional sources. It is important that I make the point that I want farmers  to be at the centre of appropriate business-led responses and for them to take  a lead role in the exploitation and maximisation of the benefits of renewable  energy.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">As I said at the outset, I will respond in detail to the  report within the eight weeks that is stipulated in the procedures of the  House. I welcome the debate and the work that has been carried out. A joined-up  partnership approach is needed in order to find long-term sustainable solutions  to the substantial problem.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr W Clarke</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I apologise that I was late for the  debate; I had to lead a delegation to meet the Minister for Regional  Development in order to discuss sewerage problems in Newcastle. I have waited a long time for the  meeting, so I could not give it up.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the Minister and Members for their contributions to  the debate. As was stated at the outset, the debate&rsquo;s subject matter is not  reserved to any one Committee or Member. The variety of contributions that were  made in the debate supports the Committee&rsquo;s viewpoint.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Go raibh maith agat. In making my winding-up speech, I do  not want to take up too much of the House&rsquo;s time. However, I want to comment on  one or two matters. I certainly do not intend to recount every point that has  been made in the Chamber. The Committee seeks the House&rsquo;s approval of its  report. I assure Members that we &mdash; I, in particular &mdash; will also examine Hansard  in order to follow up on what has been said. The Committee will forward  Members&rsquo; valid points to the relevant authorities, which is the proper action  to take. Ultimately, all Members want the same outcomes. Committee members have  done much work to bring the report to the House. It is important, therefore,  that a way forward emerges from the report.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I will cover a few points from the debate. In response to  the point of order, I apologise for not forwarding the report. As the Minister  said, it is important that we all work in partnership and in a cohesive manner  to move forward on the issue. The Committee will copy the report formally to  the Committee for Enterprise,  Trade and Investment, and we will welcome the response of that Committee.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee agrees wholeheartedly with Mr Doherty; we  will do all in our power to ensure that the report does not simply gather dust.  The Committee for Enterprise,  Trade and Investment invested a great deal of time in the report. We must  endorse it, and we must not allow it to gather dust because that would not be  acceptable to the community. Given the high cost of fuel, I urge everyone to  act on the report.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I acknowledge PJ Bradley&rsquo;s comments on biofuels, but the  report states that biofuels are the least carbon-efficient type of biomass. The  report does not suggest that the growth of commodities be stopped; it  encourages the planned creation of demand. The Committee accepts Mr Ford&rsquo;s  comments on combined power and will put those points to the Department. Mr  Irwin is correct to say that the recent coverage of wind turbines is not a good  advertisement for those technologies.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  Is the Member aware of the story that appeared in the press today that wind  turbines, if established on the east coast of Northern   Ireland, could supply enough power for the whole of Northern Ireland?  Will the Member agree that more should be done to encourage diversification  from farming into tourism? Last week I read that in Ballywalter a farmer who  grows potatoes and keeps milk cows now has a quad track, a crazy golf course  and a railway.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr W Clarke</strong>:  I agree wholeheartedly with Mr Shannon. Diversification may not suit all  farmers, but it is an option for some; it is an excellent way forward for rural  development.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee welcomes the Minister&rsquo;s support for the  report, and we look forward to receiving her detailed comments. The Committee  is keen to move forward with the Department of Agriculture and Rural  Development and with other Departments.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The report presents a massive opportunity for rural  communities to develop renewable energy, and that opportunity must be grasped.  The Executive must increase the use of biomass, which includes woodchip and  wood pellets, and that is the one aspect to shine throughout the report.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr T Clarke</strong>: <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr W Clarke</strong>:  That is anaerobic digestion.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr T Clarke</strong>:  No, it is not.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr W Clarke</strong>:  Each Minister must take on board some of the report&rsquo;s recommendations. Schools  must be considered. Today, a school with a wood-pellet heating system won an  award for its environmental nature and became the first school in the North of  Ireland to do so. That shows what is achievable and the way forward. Hospitals  and Government buildings and the public sector must start to lead the way. The  Department for Social Development could lead the way by moving towards the use  of wood-pellet and biomass energy in its social housing stock. Communal heating  systems for leisure centres, for example, and in all Government buildings  should be considered.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The farming community could come together to provide such  heating systems through woodchip and biomass boilers. Farmers need a guaranteed  income for such projects; they must be able to enter a five-year plan or  service agreement to build confidence in the rural community to take up such  initiatives. Establishing a centre of excellence is a key recommendation and,  if we wish to make progress, we must grasp that opportunity.</p>
          <p class="TimePeriod">4.00 pm</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Hemp is a plant that must be considered seriously. Hemp has  many, versatile uses &mdash; not the one of which Mitchel McLaughlin is thinking. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span> It is four times more viable than corn, and it  can be used as a food supplement and as biomass. It grows widely and has  already been planted in some areas in the North. Indeed, in my constituency, a  house has been totally built from hemp, including the concrete and the building  blocks.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The House is in agreement that embracing renewable forms of  energy is the way forward. However, rural communities must be given confidence  to buy into them, and Members must demonstrate leadership and have a plan to  bring those communities with us.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee thanks those people who took time to attend,  and showed an interest in, its inquiry, and I hope that witnesses and  stakeholders recognise the report in the positive light that it has been  presented to the House today. I commend the report to the House, and I seek  Members&rsquo; approval of it. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
          <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly approves the Report of the Committee for  Agriculture and Rural Development (39/07/08R) into Renewable Energy and  Alternative Land Use.</p>
          <p class="H4StageHeading"><a name="7"></a>Motions to Amend Standing Orders</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The next 26 motions relate to amendments to Standing Orders, so I propose to  conduct the debate as follows: I propose to group the motions, as shown on the  separate sheet that has been provided for Members, and to conduct four debates.  Debate will take place on all the motions in the relevant group. When all  Members who wish to speak have done so, I shall put the Question on the first  motion. I shall then ask the Chairperson to move formally each of the remaining  motions in the group in turn, and I will then put the Question on each motion without  further debate. If that is clear, we shall proceed.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The first group consists only of motion (a), as indicated  on the Order Paper.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee on Procedures (Lord Morrow)</strong>: I beg to move</p>
          <p class="Q3Motion">(a) In Standing Order 15, leave out paragraph (1) and insert  -</p>
          <p class="Q3Motion">&ldquo;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Except as  provided for in paragraphs (1A) and (1B), any amendment to a motion shall be  given in writing to the Speaker not later than 9.30 a.m. two clear Working Days  before the day on which the motion is to be taken.</p>
          <p class="Q3Motion">(1A)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any amendment to  a motion to be debated on a day on which the Business Committee has arranged an  additional sitting of the Assembly under Standing Order 10(6) shall, where the  time between such decision of the Business Committee and the day of the additional  sitting is less than two clear Working Days, be given to the Speaker not later  than 9.30 a.m. on the day of the additional sitting.</p>
          <p class="Q3Motion">(1B)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any amendment to  a motion to be debated on a day on which the Assembly is summoned to meet  earlier than that to which it stood adjourned shall, where the time between the  Speaker&rsquo;s summons and the meeting to which the Speaker&rsquo;s summons relates is  less than two clear Working Days, be given to the Speaker not later than 9.30  a.m. on the day on which the Assembly is summoned to meet.&rdquo;</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Standing Order 15 was reviewed at the Speaker&rsquo;s request.  The Speaker has only between 9.30 am and 12.00 noon on Mondays, and between  9.30 am and 10.30 am on Tuesdays, in which to assess proposed amendments to  motions. Such assessments can take time, and it is unreasonable for either the  Speaker or the Member who tabled the motion to rush that job. Given that  amendments are often technical or legal in nature, it is therefore important  that they be given due and proper consideration. The Committee considers that, perhaps  at times, using the current arrangements, a rush job can ensue, and that may  produce the wrong result.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee on Procedures set about reviewing Standing  Order 15 in the normal manner. It commissioned research on how the procedure  works elsewhere, and, for Members who are interested, that research can be  found on the Committee&rsquo;s web pages. The Committee then consulted party Whips  and the Business Committee to identify any problems that might arise if the  period for tabling amendments were to be extended.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee on Procedure&rsquo;s consideration of the matter  was greatly helped by the Business Committee&rsquo;s decision to schedule business on  a two-week basis.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Without that decision, it would have been very difficult to  lengthen the time for tabling amendments. If it is agreed that amendments to  motions should be tabled two working days in advance, there will be two  consequential impacts on Standing Orders 10(6) and 11, which deal with  additional plenary meetings called by the Business Committee and the Speaker  under the conditions specified in the Standing Order. Those consequential  amendments to Standing Orders 10(6) and 11 are shown as new paragraphs (1A) and  (1B) in the motion. The renumbering of the paragraphs will be carried out as  part of the annual summer reprint of Standing Orders. I commend the motion to  the Assembly.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>: I  support the motion to amend Standing Orders. As the Chairperson said, the  proposal has been well tested through proper consultation with all relevant  sections in the Assembly. It is fair and proper to the parties in that they  will have proper time to consider any motion that is tabled. Members will have  adequate time to consider the motion and table an amendment to it if they wish  to do so; most importantly, there will also be adequate time for others to  consider an amendment and their response to it. The Assembly should, therefore,  welcome the motion.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  regret that I cannot be as positive as Mr O&rsquo;Loan. It is certainly not my wish  to make life difficult for you, Mr Speaker, or the people in your office &mdash; he  says in an attempt to ingratiate himself to the Speaker. Issues would arise if  several complicated or technical amendments were to appear before the Speaker  at 9.25 am or 9.29 am on a Tuesday morning when there would be little time to  consider them before the plenary sitting begins.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">However, the motion would require that any amendment to a  motion be submitted two full working days before the day on which the motion is  to be taken. Thus, for a Monday Order Paper, amendments would have to be  submitted by early Thursday morning. The Alliance Party feels that that  significant period of notice could create difficulties in ensuring that  amendments fit in well with the motion and can be properly considered.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I accept Lord Morrow&rsquo;s point that the provisional Order  Paper is published a week in advance, and that practice has made a difference.  Nevertheless, the official Order Paper emerges at the Business Committee  meeting only on Tuesday lunchtime. Members may be informally notified by Whips  on Tuesday afternoon of its contents, but some Back-Benchers may not see the  Order Paper until late Thursday morning when the time for tabling amendments  has passed. Perhaps party discipline is such that Whips will ensure that each  and every Member of their party is fully aware of what is going on. Lord Morrow  is nodding, so clearly the DUP Whip is as efficient as the United Community  Group&rsquo;s Whip.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">However, an issue arose last week that caused concern. My  colleagues and I had tabled a motion on the situation in Zimbabwe. When  the motion was originally submitted, it was entirely appropriate. Several weeks  later, when the motion was considered by the Business Committee for the  provisional Order Paper, it was still entirely appropriate. When the Order  Paper was finalised at the Tuesday Business Committee meeting, it was entirely  appropriate. On the Thursday morning &mdash; which, under the proposed amendment to  Standing Order 15, would be the last time for submitting amendments &mdash; it was  appropriate. Yet the situation in Zimbabwe changed over the weekend,  and it was possible for our party to table an amendment that was accepted first  thing on Monday morning &mdash; and we appreciated your indulgence in that matter, Mr  Speaker. That amendment ensured that the debate that was held was relevant and  appropriate.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>:  First, I want to address the Member&rsquo;s more general points. Given that the  proposal to amend this Standing Order has been before the Assembly for many  months and that the Committee on Procedures has carried out a proper  consultation on it, I am surprised that such a significant difficulty is being  presented at this very late stage.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, with regard to the Zimbabwe motion, I thought about  that issue when it arose, and, again, in the past few minutes, when I became  aware that the Alliance Party was going to present concerns.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">If that motion had had to go ahead as it was originally worded  &mdash; because we were simply using the opportunity to express strong views about Zimbabwe &mdash;  those views would still have been fully understood, and the House would have  understood that the motion had been framed in light of the knowledge that  existed at the time.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">If the change to the Standing Orders goes through as  proposed, we may at some time in the future detect difficulties that require  further change. At this point, and with the Assembly having fully thought, and  having been consulted, about the matter, we should not at this stage alter what  is proposed. The change should be made and put to the test; and, if something  needs changing in the future, let us change it. However, that may not be  necessary.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  am grateful to the Member for his second speech. There are two substantive  points. I understand that my colleague raised his concerns when there was  discussion in the Committee, but was not present when the vote was taken to  approve this motion. Secondly, the key issue that was highlighted &mdash; and this  was the point that I was going to mention with regard to the Zimbabwe motion &mdash;  was that it is fine to say that we may discover at some time in the future that  there will be a problem; however, what we are actually saying is that last week  there was a problem.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I do not see at this stage, as Standing Orders are  proposed, that there would have been any way of dealing with that problem. If,  for example, we were a body that had the Speaker&rsquo;s discretion to deal with a  matter of urgency, I have faith in the Speaker to consider matters of urgency.  As I understand it, however, there is no such discretion in the Standing Order  &mdash; it is rigid. Although it would have been possible to have had that debate  around the motion as it was originally framed, to have sat in this Chamber,  knowing that people from Zimbabwe were listening in the Gallery, to have heard  Members make impassioned speeches in support of the motion, and then, in the  end, to have had to withdraw the motion because it was not relevant, would not  have given this place a good name as a proper parliamentary debating Chamber.  Therefore, an issue that needs attention was highlighted.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Lord Morrow may give an assurance that the Committee will  not just wait to see whether something occurs in a year or two, but will look  urgently at how we might deal with what in other places would be called an  emergency amendment or an urgency amendment.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Something potentially as early as Thursday for any Monday,  given that the Order Paper is not always finalised two weeks in advance, but  only one week in advance, raises issues that have not been thoroughly  addressed. I appreciate that there is a problem and that the Committee has been  trying to resolve it. However, I remain to be convinced that this is the way to  do so.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee on Procedures</strong>: I thank all those who took part in this  discussion. The Committee did spend considerable time in examining this  amendment, and it researched what happens in other legislatures. The  Committee&rsquo;s approach was that, compared to other legislatures, the time  provided in the Assembly&rsquo;s Standing Orders was deemed to be unreasonable.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Most other places allow two or three days. The Committee  spent a significant amount of time looking at the impact of changing to one,  two or three days, and that information was brought back by the Committee  members to their parties. After further discussion, the Committee reached a  consensus that two working days was workable, particularly as the Business  Committee had moved to scheduling business on a fortnightly basis.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I have listened carefully to what Mr Ford said with regard  to this matter, and there is merit in some of it. I do not want to misquote  anyone, and I stand to be corrected if Members feel differently, but I do not  recall this issue being raised with the same force as it was raised by Mr Ford  today.</p>
          <p class="TimePeriod">4.15 pm</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I remind the Member that, recently, the House adopted an  additional Standing Order to deal with matters of the day, which are deemed, at  your discretion, Mr Speaker, to deal with urgent issues that may arise from  time to time. Therefore, we have made provision for such matters. I hope that  that will go some way to reassure the Member.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Member raised an issue about the motion on free and  fair elections in Zimbabwe.  I do not wish to be derogatory, but I suspect that not many people in Zimbabwe took  notice of what Members of the Northern Ireland Assembly said about the matter.  I would have thought, however, that there was still provision for a Member to  come to the House and make a declaration that, owing to a change in  circumstances, he or she felt that a particular motion could not proceed but  that it would be presented again to the Business Committee. As a member of the  Business Committee, I suspect that its members would be sympathetic to that. In  fact, it would not be difficult to reschedule the motion, and it would lose  none of its impact, given the continuing situation. Therefore, I take the  Member&rsquo;s point, and I hope that he takes the point that we try to make.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  appreciate that the Member is trying to make gestures in our direction by  saying that if a motion were no longer relevant, we could handle it on another  day; however, that could be at least two weeks hence. However, that would not  have been a satisfactory way of dealing with it, given the crisis that faces Zimbabwe at the  moment.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee on Procedures</strong>: With all due respect, I suspect that the  crisis in Zimbabwe  is no worse today than it was when the motion was debated. Although the Member  felt strongly about the issue &mdash; perhaps because it was election time &mdash; nothing  seems to have changed in Zimbabwe.  Regrettably, nothing has changed because of anything that the Assembly has  done. Although the motion was passed unanimously, unfortunately, it did not  change things for the people in that unfortunate, sad country. Therefore, in  that particular instance, there would have been plenty of time for it to be  re-addressed because of the change in circumstances as perceived by the  Members. I beg to move that the House adopt the procedures.</p>

          <p class="B3BodyText">There are many amendments to be made to the Standing Orders  for Statutory and non-Statutory Committees, which are listed as motions (b) to  (v) inclusive on the Order Paper. Some of the amendments are substantial but  most are grammatical. The amendments simply improve the readability and clarity  of the Standing Orders for MLAs, staff and the general public.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Dealing with the amendments took up considerable Committee  time and involved detailed consideration by the Members who, in the end, were  unanimous in their support of the amendments. I wish to take the opportunity to  thank them for their input and their work.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I will deal with each motion sequentially and explain the  thinking of the Committee on Procedures.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Motion (b) is a tidying up exercise, and the Standing Order  deals with proportionality and party strengths. Therefore, it should include a  reference to Standing Order 47 as well as Standing Order 46.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Motion (c) is an amendment designed to improve the readability  of the Standing Order. It makes no change to the substance, principles or  meaning of the Standing Order.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Motion (d) is an amendment designed to improve the  readability of the Standing Order and does not change its substance, principles  or meaning. Members should note that the terms &ldquo;Chairs&rdquo; and &ldquo;Deputy Chairs&rdquo;  have been changed to &ldquo;Chairpersons&rdquo; and &ldquo;Deputy Chairpersons&rdquo;. That is a purely  grammatical amendment, which will be made to all Standing Orders during the  summer reprint.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The amendment outlined in motion (e) is designed to improve  readability, and, again, does not change the substance, principles or meaning  of the Standing Order.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I will discuss motions (f) and (g) together. Motion (g)  deals with the principle that the power is exercisable by the nominating  officer. That has been reformatted to show that it applies to sub-paragraphs  (a) and (b). In its current form, it could be interpreted as applying to  sub-paragraph (b) only &mdash; that is not the case. The principle of the 15-minute  time period has been moved to a new paragraph &mdash; (7A) &mdash; for ease of  understanding and improved clarity. Motion (f) allows for a cross-reference  between paragraph (7A) and paragraph (9), as it applies to paragraph (7), which  was not previously explicit.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Motion (h) is a consequential change to take account of the  new paragraph (7A). Motion (i) is designed to improve the readability of the  Standing Order and does not change its substance, principles or meaning.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Motions (j) and (k) deal with paragraphs (10) and (11).  Members should note that those paragraphs are being swapped because, in  application, paragraph (11) should precede paragraph (10). Furthermore, Members  should be aware that paragraph (11) will be reworded in order to improve the  readability of the Standing Order without changing its substance, principles or  meaning.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Motion (l) refers to Standing Order 46(12) and is a  substantive amendment. Under current Standing Orders, an MLA can be a  Chairperson or Deputy Chairperson of both a Statutory and a Standing Committee.  Although the Committee on Procedures found no problem with an MLA being a  Deputy Chairperson of both a Statutory and a Standing Committee, members feel  that the role of Chairperson is too time-consuming and intense. Therefore, the  suggested amendment excludes MLAs from chairing two Committees.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Although the principle of paragraph (14) remains the same,  motion (m) is, nevertheless, a substantive amendment. Paragraph (14) currently  covers two principles &mdash; the nomination of an MLA to replace a Chairperson or  Deputy Chairperson, and the timescale within which that nomination should  occur. For clarity, those two aspects have been separated, and the second  principle now has its own paragraph &mdash; paragraph (15). A number of minor  grammatical changes have been made to the new paragraph (15) to improve  readability. The current version of paragraph (14) is deficient, because it  covers only two of the three circumstances listed in Standing Order 46(13).  Replacement of a Chairperson or Deputy Chairperson under paragraph (13)(c) is  not covered in the current version of paragraph (14), but was applied in  practice. In order to correct that deficiency, the Committee consulted the  Northern Ireland Act 1998 to find technically correct wording, which differs  from the current wording.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I now move to the amendments to Standing Order 47, which  are listed as motions (n) to (u) on the Order Paper. Members should note that  motions (n) and (p) should be read together. Those motions allow the  information in paragraphs (1) and (2) to be amalgamated and moved to Standing  Order 47(4), which will necessitate a renumbering exercise that will be  conducted during the summer reprint.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Motion (o) is an amendment designed to improve the  readability and clarity of the Standing Order and does not change its  principles, substance or meaning. Motions (q), (r) and (s) also make minor  grammatical amendments that are designed to improve clarity and understanding,  while not affecting the principles or substance of the Standing Order.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Motion (t) is a substantial amendment. It arises out of the  Assembly&rsquo;s approval of the recommendations in the &lsquo;Report on Committee Systems  and Structures&rsquo;. The motion allows a Committee to operate with a quorum of four  when no decision is taken or question put.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Motion (u) is designed to improve the readability and  clarity of Standing Order 47 and makes no change to the substance or principles  of the Standing Order.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Motion (v) is a substantial amendment, and will make  express provision for Standing Committees and Ad Hoc Committees. The current  Standing Orders for non-Statutory Committees work by referring to the Standing  Orders for Statutory Committees. That was less than satisfactory as there are  important differences between the two types of Committee. For example, it is  important that the Chairperson of a Statutory Committee is not of the same  party as the Minister of the relevant Department. However, that is not an issue  in the case of a non-Statutory Committee. As permanent Committees of the  Assembly, non-Statutory Committees deserved their own unique and specific  Standing Orders. That is what is being provided for in this motion.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Standing Order 44 (1) gives Ad Hoc Committees powers, but  their ability to have a reduced quorum is left with the Assembly. Where  suitable, motion (v) follows the wording of Standing Orders 46 and 47 as  revised by the previous motions to amend. There are some minor differences in  wording in order to allow for differences in voting in the Business Committee  and the quorum of the Audit Committee. Otherwise, the substantial and  grammatical amendments in motions (b) to (u) have been followed.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I thank Members for their patience, and I recommend this  group of motions to the Assembly.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>: I  wish only to speak in support of motion (t), which alters the quorum of a  Statutory Committee. The present quorum is five in all circumstances. The  motion to amend will direct the Committee to have a quorum of five when  decisions are taken or when questions are put to the Committee, but four when  the Committee is engaged in non-decision-making activity. That is a practical  adjustment that all Members can support.</p>

          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee on Procedures</strong>: This is another amendment that provides  clarity for users of Standing Orders and members of the public who pick them up  in an effort to understand the rules of the Assembly. The term &ldquo;nominating  officer&rdquo; is used in Standing Orders for Committees and ministerial  appointments, but there is currently no definition of what or who the  nominating officer is. The definition in the amendment is lifted straight from  the Northern Ireland Act 1998, as amended.</p>
