                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee to Advise the Presiding
                Officer, in making preparations for today’s sitting and
                appreciating the number of Standing Orders to be considered, and
                with a significant number of amendments likely, requested me to
                write to the Secretary of State asking that her previous
                determination that the Assembly would be able to meet until 6 pm
                on 9&nbsp;March be extended to 10&nbsp;March.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Secretary of State has replied as
                follows:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;By virtue of Paragraph 1 of the
                Schedule to the Northern Ireland (Elections) Act 1998 it falls
                to me to determine where meetings of the Assembly shall be held,
                and when. In my letter of 26&nbsp;February, I directed that the
                Assembly shall meet at Parliament Buildings, Stormont at
                10.30&nbsp;am on Monday 1&nbsp;March until 6&nbsp;pm on Tuesday
                9&nbsp;March. Having considered your letter of 1&nbsp;March, I
                withdraw that direction and now direct that the Assembly shall
                meet at Parliament Buildings, Stormont, at 10.30&nbsp;am on
                Monday 1&nbsp;March until 10 pm on Tuesday 9&nbsp;March. I will
                consider making a further direction as respects this period, in
                particular in the light of any indication I may receive as to
                the wishes of Assembly Members after the Assembly has begun to
                meet.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The House needs to be aware that there are
                some 71 Standing Orders to be approved. In respect of item 3,
                the motion to take note of the report, I have received one
                amendment. However, in respect of item 4, the compendium of
                Standing Orders, there are some 87 amendments to be considered.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is impossible at this stage to be sure how
                long these will take, but as we only have until 10.00&nbsp;pm
                tomorrow, unless there were a different determination from the
                Secretary of State, Members may find as today proceeds that it
                will be difficult to complete business if the sitting is
                suspended at 6.00&nbsp;pm today. Therefore I will take
                soundings, during the procedures this afternoon, through the
                usual channels to see whether the Assembly wishes to continue to
                meet into the later part of this evening and also tomorrow, or
                whether it wishes to suspend at 6.00&nbsp;pm this evening,
                resume at 10.30&nbsp;am tomorrow and sit until 10.00&nbsp;pm, or
                as late as is necessary. I will take soundings on that as it
                becomes apparent what we need to do.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Paisley Jnr:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Is it in order for the Assembly to
                congratulate Northern Ireland racing ace Eddie&nbsp;Irvine on
                his magnificent victory in the early hours of yesterday morning
                in the Australian Formula One Grand Prix? Over the first months
                of 1999 we certainly have seen sporting excellence —</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Initial Presiding Officer:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Order. The Member has gone substantially
                beyond a point of order. As he knows, it is not in order for the
                Assembly to vote on a matter on which a motion has not been
                tabled in due time. It would be surprising if some personal
                messages of congratulation were not sent. If the Member wishes
                to table a motion on the matter he is perfectly at liberty to do
                so.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the sitting of Monday 1&nbsp;March
                Mr&nbsp;David&nbsp;Ervine asked me to rule on the definition of
                fronting paramilitary organisations. I have reviewed the
                relevant extracts from Hansard and have nothing to add to my
                ruling at that time.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I should like to advise the Assembly on the
                procedure that I intend to follow on
                items&nbsp;3&nbsp;and&nbsp;4 on the Order Paper. Item&nbsp;3 is
                a relatively straightforward motion to take note of the report
                by the Committee on Standing Orders. After it is moved by the
                joint Chairs, I will take an amendment to it before inviting
                Members to address the general principles of the report. The
                amendment is for a general tidying-up — if I might put it in
                that way — and takes the form of a resolution on how the
                Assembly would treat the subsequent compilation of Standing
                Orders. I will take that at that time.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Because the report and the motion on it is
                not a change to Standing Orders, of itself it should not require
                cross-community support. However, because the amendment proposes
                to make changes, albeit of a largely typographical nature, to
                Standing Orders it will properly need to be decided by a
                cross-community vote. That means that the substantive motion, if
                the amendment is approved, will also have to be decided by
                cross-community vote.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Apart from the question of the amendment, I
                suppose that one might describe the debate as a second-reading
                type. In such a debate Members can deal with the report’s
                general principles outlined and with any other matters that
                arise from that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I shall remind Members of some of what I am
                about to say at the appropriate point. Item 4 on the Order paper
                — approval of draft Standing Order — is a substantial piece
                of business. As I have said, there are some 87&nbsp;amendments.
                As Members are aware, amendments can be presented up to one hour
                prior to the commencement of the sitting, that is to say, until
                9.30 am. Amendments were coming in up to that time. I apologise
                to Members on behalf of the staff for the fact that it has not
                been possible up to this moment to provide a full, marshalled
                list of amendments. That work is in progress, and I trust that a
                list will shortly be available to Members. I hope that the House
                will understand that a substantial amount of work was involved.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have outlined the process that I intend to
                follow on item&nbsp;4. We shall take each natural section of the
                report. Some of those are quite short sections of perhaps half a
                dozen Standing Orders but other sections are much more
                substantial, with a considerable number of Standing Orders.
                However, we shall deal with the Standing Orders as they appear
                in their natural sections of the report. At each section we
                shall consider amendments to that section, discuss them in the
                order in which they are relevant to it, and debate the whole of
                that section at one time.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We will vote at the end of the debate on that
                section, and we must vote on each Standing Order. If there are
                no amendments it will be possible, as in the case of the clauses
                of a Bill, to take, say, Standing Orders 1 to 4. Strictly
                speaking, according to the Standing Orders every vote requires
                cross-community approval. However, if we were to vote on 71
                Standing Orders and 87 amendments, about 160 cross-community
                votes would be required, and that would involve about 40 solid
                hours of voting. Members will agree that that is not a practical
                way to proceed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the case of Standing Orders that can be
                taken together because there are no amendments, I propose simply
                to put the Question and collect the responses. If there is no
                dissent I shall consider that cross-community support has been
                achieved. Any dissent on the vote on an amendment or on a
                Standing Order will allow no option but to proceed to a
                cross-community vote irrespective of the time that is involved.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When we come to the end of the consideration
                of the whole compendium of Standing Orders I will take a vote in
                the full fashion so that we can measure cross-community support
                for the Standing Orders as amended in the debate. I trust that
                that is reasonably clear, but I shall try to draw it again to
                the attention of Members.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The First Minister (Designate) (Mr Trimble):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have no objection to what has been said
                about voting. A process that abbreviates the time spent voting
                is appropriate. Will there be a separate debate on each
                amendment? Taking amendments in groups means that there will not
                be a coherent debate on any one of them. We need to have a
                separate debate on each amendment.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Initial Presiding Officer:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My proposal is to group the amendments
                according to the grouping of the Standing Orders. For example,
                the first group contains a small number of Standing Orders, and
                there would perhaps be some amendments at that point. I would
                ask the proposers of the amendments to speak to them in order,
                and we could debate all those amendments at that point.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If Members wish to proceed in another
                fashion, there will have to be a debate on 87 separate
                amendments. That would entail a substantial amount of work, and
                no matter how late we sit tonight and tomorrow we might have
                some difficulty in accommodating it. Some amendments would be
                more contentious than others. Each Member could speak for
                10&nbsp;minutes in moving his amendment, and there is the
                subsequent response. In that sense each will have to be treated
                as a separate debate. If I do not treat them as separate
                debates, Members may speak only once for 10&nbsp;minutes during
                the consideration of the whole compendium of Standing Orders.
                That would be a completely unsatisfactory way to proceed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If Members are content, we shall proceed to
                the debate on the report. Members will have the marshalled list
                of amendments delivered to them in the Chamber as soon as it is
                completed. I appreciate that Members must proceed to debate the
                report without having seen the list but the only alternative
                would be to suspend the sitting, and that could be done only by
                leave of the House. Unless I hear a proposal to that effect I
                propose to proceed to item 3, the debate on the report.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report of the Committees on Standing
                Orders is in two volumes. The first volume gives the essential
                detail, the remit, membership, what we did, how we did it and
                what we recommended, and so on. The minutes are appended.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The second volume contains the recommended
                Standing Orders. At our last meeting one might have expected
                that we would have agreed a cut and dried report — not so. The
                Committee was actively making changes to the report right up to
                the final bell.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members should have also received the
                inevitable errata that accompanies this type of document. I
                would like to pay tribute to Denis&nbsp;Haughey, my joint Chair,
                who has done a marvellous job particularly on those occasions,
                one of which Members heard about last week, when the Committee
                found itself all at sea. At all times he has shown scrupulous
                fairness and a concern to keep the Committee together. I would
                also like to thank the Members of the Committee and the many
                substitutes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Standing Orders is not an easy area for many
                people — indeed, it is not even an interesting one — but it
                was an essential area that had to be covered. All those
                involved, including the observers, must have been totally
                bemused at times. Our thanks are also due to Murray&nbsp;Barnes
                and Denis&nbsp;Arnold for all their hard work and support.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee first met on
                6&nbsp;July&nbsp;1998. We have held 22&nbsp;meetings and,
                bearing in mind the diverse make-up of the Committee, we have
                achieved much in bringing together this agreed report. When
                Denis Haughey and I were elected as joint Chairs of the
                Committee we resolved to proceed on the basis of consensus, as
                far as possible. The documents before the House today are there
                as a result of consensus.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Party size and the voting power that comes
                with it was not used to push things through. The smaller parties
                will testify to this and agree that their concerns were taken on
                board in a fair way. The Committee had its ups and downs, but
                everyone, including the substitutes, contributed in a
                constructive and helpful way. In the minutes Members will see
                that the 19&nbsp;strong Committee was well attended at all
                meetings.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We began by looking at the Standing Orders of
                different assemblies — the European Parliament, the Commons
                and the Dáil. In the absence of any guidance, we decided that
                the best basis on which to proceed would be to look at the
                Orders of the 1973 Assembly. We considered these, armed only
                with our knowledge of the agreement. We also looked at Initial
                Standing Orders and considered how we could adapt them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We reported our progress to the Assembly on
                two occasions. Of course, all of this was overtaken by the Bill
                and the need to base many Standing Orders on this. The business
                of devising Standing Orders by committee is not an easy task.
                For a time some reliance was placed on officials to get on with
                the job and consult when necessary. The hastily drafted Bill
                underwent major amendment, as is usual, particularly during its
                passage through the Lords. Therefore complete clarity could not
                be expected until it was enacted. Standing Orders are, above
                all, procedures. Some of these are prescribed in the Act. The
                rest were devised by the Committee after lengthy deliberation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have produced 71 draft Standing Orders
                over a relatively short period. This compares with the Welsh who
                have drafted their Standing Orders in advance over a year. The
                Scots are also in the process of doing something similar. The
                advantage in our case is that we, the elected politicians, will
                have had a hand in producing our own compendium and that will
                result in a greater feeling of ownership.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Standing Orders in the compendium are
                divided into nine&nbsp;sections dealing with all facets of the
                Assembly. The first section deals with preliminary matters that
                must be addressed at the beginning of any assembly. These Orders
                stick rigidly to the requirements of the Act, and there is
                little scope for any fundamental change.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The next section deals with the day-to-day
                business of the Assembly, and it owes as much to an updating of
                the 1973 procedures as to anything else. The Clerks at
                Westminster have been consulted on the updating process.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In respect of voting, we have adopted the
                Westminster-style Division system. This is not to say that we
                are against modernisation, and we can certainly look at
                alternatives in the future, but we have decided to opt for what
                we believe is a tried-and-tested methodology. For the time
                being, I believe, this is the safest route to take.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The next section deals with legislation. Once
                again we have proceeded according to the Act, and because this
                Assembly is unicameral we have decided to build in safeguards.
                Bills will normally undergo a five-stage process, which will
                include a full Committee stage, during which the statutory
                committee will consider the Bill in detail and may, if
                necessary, take evidence on the matter. In addition, the
                Assembly will have the opportunity to examine the legislation in
                detail. Should issues of equality arise, provision has been made
                for such issues to be referred to a special Assembly committee
                and, where necessary, to the Human Rights Commission. Again,
                these are requirements of the Act and of the agreement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There may be incidences where primary
                legislation has to be passed quickly — for example, on social
                security matters where the Assembly will want to maintain parity
                with Great Britain — and so provision has been made for a
                process we have called the accelerated-passage procedure, which
                will enable Bills to be enacted within a relatively short
                period. However, this very necessary mechanism must not be
                abused. It should be used in exceptional cases only, and a
                considerable onus will be placed on Ministers to justify using
                it at all.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have also given consideration to
                subordinate legislation. The agreement envisages a role here for
                Statutory Committees, and we have had to take account of this.
                But Statutory Instruments are generally of a technical nature.
                In many ways, they are best dealt with at a technical level, and
                we recommend the appointment of an examiner of statutory rules
                to assist the statutory committees in this field. We believe
                that the provisions of these Orders are capable of dealing with
                the full range of legislation — including financial
                legislation — that is likely to come before the Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The legislation section is followed by a
                short section on Ministerial appointments. You will note that
                there is no reference in the compendium to the appointments of
                the First and Deputy First Ministers. There is no need. Where
                the Act itself stipulates procedures, we have not repeated these
                in Standing Orders. Members may be surprised at the structure of
                the Standing Orders in this section, but I should point out
                that, like other Orders, they must be read alongside the Act.
                Here we differ from Westminster. The Westminster Parliament is
                sovereign, and we are not.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The next section deals with Committees. In
                addition to the Statutory Committees, we envisage having what we
                have called Standing Committees; examples of these are given in
                the compendium. These named Committees will include a
                representative from each party. We believe that in an Assembly
                of this type this is important.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There will also be other types of standing
                Committees in the future. These may be less central to what we
                do, and we recommend that, like the statutory Committees, they
                have a fixed membership of 11.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We also see scope for a further type of
                Committee which we have simply called &quot;ad hoc
                Committees&quot;. Such Committees would be set up to deal with
                issues over a specified time and would then be stood down; the
                present Ad Hoc Committee (Port of Belfast) may well be an
                example. The Committee membership figure of 11 was arrived at
                following much debate, and the Committee considered using the
                matrix at the back of Volume 1 of the report — the impact that
                different sizes of committees would have on parties. We believe
                that the Chair and Deputy Chairs of Statutory and Standing
                Committees should be appointed using the d’Hondt system, but
                it will be up to the Assembly to decide on the appointment of
                Chairs to ad hoc Committees.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is another issue to do with committees
                which I must mention. There is no Statutory Committee for
                central functions. There could be a non-statutory Committee with
                powers to call for persons and papers, but the Act does not
                allow for any Statutory Committee. I could say more about
                Committees, but time is against me.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The next section deals with order and is
                self-explanatory. The only point I want to make here is that the
                Keeper of the House, a functionary whom we equate, in some
                respects, with the Serjeant at Arms at Westminster or the
                Captain of the Guard in the Dáil, will not have the full powers
                that are deemed to be necessary in the Standing Orders until the
                Assembly legislates on this matter. This should not present any
                problems.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Last week the Assembly adopted the proposals
                on Members’ interests. I will say something about that because
                it is a matter for Standing Orders. Ideally the Assembly should
                have its own Commissioner on standards. This will be the case in
                Wales and probably in Scotland, and it would be appropriate here
                also. The Commissioner would have duties similar to those of the
                Commissioner at Westminster and would report to the Assembly’s
                Committee on Standards and Privileges. This committee’s
                principal officer would be the Clerk of Standards and the
                custodian of the register of Members’ interests. This is the
                structure envisaged, but, as pointed out by the other joint
                Chairman, a deeper consideration of the whole issue will have to
                await the formation of the Committee on Standards and
                Privileges.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The last section of the report is called
                &quot;Other Orders&quot;. It contains two late entries on
                language and the Commission. The language Standing Order is the
                briefest in the compendium, and its conciseness belies the time
                spent by the Committee on it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee has worked for inclusiveness,
                as is borne out by its decision to recommend that the much
                over-burdened Commission be given the assistance that is due to
                it. We suggest that five-a-side is far too strenuous a game for
                the elderly quantity surveyors, and we recommend a full team of
                11.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I understand that Members have not yet
                received copies of the amendment that is about to be moved. I
                have asked, somewhat unusually, that the Doorkeepers make
                themselves available to distribute it in the Chamber. As soon as
                we have the full list of marshalled amendments, I will arrange

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I beg to move the following amendment: At the

                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;and further notes that the Standing
                Orders, once approved by the Assembly, shall be renumbered where
                necessary, punctuated and proofed to ensure consistent
                language&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As someone who never darkened the door of the
                Standing Orders Committee, it falls to me to be the first person
                to welcome the publication of its report. I congratulate the
                Committee on the very substantial task that it has performed. I
                would also like to point out that the 70-odd amendments that are
                down in my name are not meant as a criticism. It is inevitable
                that any substantial document listing Standing Orders is open to
                amendment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Most of the amendments are of a tidying-up
                nature. The amendment to this motion is of a general character,
                and there is no party-political edge to it whatsoever. It simply
                allows me to do what it would otherwise have taken another
                200&nbsp;amendments to do — it is one catch-all amendment.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">11.00 am</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a series of punctuation errors and a
                proliferation of instances where different terms are being used
                for the same activity. For example, &quot;lodged&quot; and
                &quot;deposited&quot; both appear, as does &quot;left with&quot;
                on one occasion, and there are many similar references. There
                needs to be consistency. And if any of the amendments are
                passed, or if any of the initial Standing Orders are deleted,
                there will have to be a renumbering.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have no emotional capital tied up in the
                wording of any amendment. They are there to show that there is a
                gap to be filled or that a change is required. They can be
                concluded in whatever terms Members wish. I do not know — and
                this is a question for the Initial Presiding Officer — what
                the procedure would be in the House if Members wanted to change
                the terms of an amendment. I know that Members still have not
                seen the amendments. They may, however, agree with the thrust of
                an amendment but find its terminology awkward or unsatisfactory.
                Will they be permitted to table a manuscript amendment, or is
                there another way of dealing with such a case?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the last two meetings of the Assembly we
                have been dealing with matters that are of equal importance to
                every Member. The normal party political divisions did not take
                place, the pro- and anti-agreement factions did not take
                different sides. That should also be the case in relation to
                Standing Orders. Although some of us may not have recognised it
                yet, we all have a vested interest in ensuring that the Standing
                Orders we produce this week are reasonable, fair to everyone and
                can stand the test of time.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When we propose an amendment to a Standing
                Order, we do not know whether it will eventually be used in our
                favour or against us. At this stage we can only judge what is
                right and proper and create a set of Standing Orders that
                ensures we regulate our business in a fair and reasonable way.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The amendments in my name, in general, will
                not need to be debated. Most of them are self-explanatory and I
                hope they will be accepted. Most of them are meant to be
                tidying-up measures, but some might be described as probing
                amendments. It could be that, in debate, the Committee will be
                able to show that the substance of an amendment has been dealt
                with elsewhere, in which case I shall be content to withdraw.
                However, should we discover that the matter has not been dealt
                with, I will obviously wish to move that amendment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I said, some of my amendments are intended
                to fill gaps. On some occasions these are gaps that we are
                required to fill by the Northern Ireland Act. Where the Act
                requires us to bring in a Standing Order on a particular matter,
                we must do so. In some instances the first draft of the Standing
                Orders fails to do this. There are also one or two areas where I
                have raised new issues. Members will take a view on these as
                they are raised.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am concerned about the premise that our
                Standing Orders must be read alongside the Northern Ireland Act
                1998 and the Belfast Agreement. This means that every good
                Assembly Member is going to have to go around with three
                documents tucked under his or her arm. We could get to the stage
                where one consolidated document, even if it only imported the
                language of other documents which are referred to in it, became
                a consolidated volume of Standing Orders.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As the Standing Orders Committee has
                recognised, there is an ongoing role for that Committee,
                particularly in the early stages of any institution, and no
                doubt after today, as we work through the Assembly, we will have
                many occasions on which Standing Orders need to be framed, and
                the Committee will be able to do that. I hope that in doing so
                it will also attempt to get a consolidated volume.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In moving the amendment, I was not sure if
                there was some confusion on the part of some of the officials of
                the Assembly or of some of the members of the Standing Orders
                Committee about the process that has to be followed. My concern
                about that arose as soon as I was handed a copy of the list of
                errata. An errata list is quite acceptable if one gets it along
                with a report or printed document that is not amendable, but if
                it is an amendable document the only changes that can be made to
                it are by way of amendment, and that has to be done in the
                Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Indeed, the reason there is an amendment to
                the take-note motion is to ensure that: no one outside the
                Assembly can tamper with the end product of our deliberations
                after Tuesday evening. That can be done only by ourselves unless
                we instruct somebody specifically to carry out a task in
                relation to it. So, in case no amendment was moved by the
                Committee to agree the errata as a change, one of my amendments
                is to do just that. However, there should have been an errata to
                the errata, because there were some errors in it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Other amendments take account of some matters
                that should have been included. Whether or not there was a
                misunderstanding about the process, the only change that can
                take place to the published document is by way of an amendment
                during the course of this debate or subsequently in the
                Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I should indicate that the general issue
                behind these amendments is to provide the Assembly with a
                document that does not require to be amended after each meeting
                of the House. It is undoubtedly the case that we will have to
                define further many of the Standing Orders that we are producing
                or allow the Speaker certain discretion in their interpretations
                or accept Erskine&nbsp;May or some other volume as a mechanism
                whereby we can adjudicate on issues not covered by the Standing
                Orders.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr C Murphy:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A Chathaoirligh, I acknowledge the work done
                by the Standing Orders Committee and pay tribute to the
                officials who have serviced that Committee over the last eight
                months. The task given to the Committee last July was not an
                easy one in view of the political importance that is attached to
                the rules which govern the conduct of the Assembly and the
                diversity of political opinion around the table. An early
                indication of this came with the number of meetings that it took
                to elect the people who eventually became the joint
                Chairpersons.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Further problems were created by the
                timescale in which we had to complete our business and by the
                fact that the legislation, which had a direct impact on the
                Standing Orders, was processing through Westminster during this
                time. This caused our deliberations to be suspended for at least
                two of the eight months during which we were sitting.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Despite all that, in the main the atmosphere
                in the Committee was constructive and businesslike. There was a
                great deal of agreement on most issues. We were able to reach
                compromises on many other issues, although it is a matter of
                regret that compromise could not be achieved on the recognition
                of the Irish language within the Chamber. That matter will be
                dealt with by my Colleague.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I should like to deal with an issue that
                caused great concern to the entire Committee and which is
                reflected in paragraph 7 of the report. It is the issue of a
                statutory committee to scrutinise the executive functions of the
                Office of the First and Deputy First Ministers. When the
                Committee discussed on 11&nbsp;February the appointment of
                statutory committees I raised the question of a statutory
                committee to scrutinise the executive functions of the First and
                Deputy First Ministers. On my proposal, the Committee agreed to
                add the phrase from paragraph&nbsp;8 in strand one of the Good
                Friday Agreement which states</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;There will be a Committee for each of
                the main executive functions of the Northern Ireland
                Administration.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That became part of the Standing Order. At
                the subsequent meeting on 17&nbsp;February, we were informed
                that provisions in the Northern Ireland Act prevent the
                establishment of a statutory committee for the Office of the
                First and Deputy First Ministers because they are not considered
                to be Northern Ireland Ministers. Standing
                Order&nbsp;44&nbsp;(1)(a) was rewritten to reflect the
                requirements of the Act, and removed the word from the Good
                Friday Agreement. The detailed explanations for that are in the
                appendix to the minutes of the meeting on 17&nbsp;February.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Therefore the Committee on Standing Orders
                has been rendered powerless by the Act to provide the Assembly
                with the range of scrutiny powers of executive functions that
                was envisaged in the Good Friday Agreement. What can benignly be
                interpreted as a serious flaw or gap in the drafting of the
                legislation contradicts not only the wording of the agreement to
                which it was to give legislative effect, but has serious
                consequences for the ability of the Assembly to provide
                completely open and accountable government.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Regrettably, that is not the only derogation
                from the Good Friday Agreement by the British Government. The
                flying of the Union Jack on this building today is in direct
                contravention of paragraph&nbsp;5 of the section on
                &quot;Rights, Safeguards and Equality of Opportunity&quot; in
                the agreement. We intend to bring the matter to the notice of
                the Secretary of State.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the full impact of this legislation on the
                Committees had been evident during the negotiations on the
                departmental structures in December, there would be considerably
                fewer functions in the Office of the First and Deputy First
                Ministers. The only slight relief to be drawn from this
                situation is that the argument to locate Finance and Personnel
                in the centre did not succeed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Important executive functions such as those
                of the economic policy and equality units, liaison with other
                institutions, international relations, legislation progress
                unit, office of the legislative counsel, public appointments
                policy, freedom of information, victims, Nolan standards, public
                service office, machinery of government, emergency planning,
                women’s issues, policy innovation unit and an Assembly
                ombudsman are not, as it stands, subject to the scrutiny of a
                proper statutory committee. That should not be accepted by the
                Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have heard it suggested that issues such as
                equality and community relations could be covered by
                non-statutory committees, but those do not have the same powers
                of scrutiny as statutory committees, and those two functions are
                only a small part of the remit of the First and Deputy First
                Ministers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It has also been suggested that a single
                statutory committee would be inappropriate for such a range of
                executive functions. The Assembly will note that the
                recommendation from the Committee on Standing Orders is not
                prescriptive. If a number of committees are needed, so be it,
                but it is in the interests of the First and Deputy First
                Ministers, the Assembly and the electorate to ensure that there
                is proper scrutiny of all the executive functions of this
                administration.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee has not proposed how this
                matter will be addressed or who will address it. It may require
                an amendment to the Act. If that is the case, the Assembly
                should speak with one voice on the issue to ensure that any such
                amendment is dealt with as a matter of urgency by the British
                Government.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee has also expressed the view
                that its work should not end with the adoption of the report,
                but it may be the best vehicle to ensure that this issue is
                dealt with satisfactorily. Whatever the decision of the Assembly
                this is one issue that should not be allowed to go by default,
                and we intend to return to it as often as necessary until it is
                resolved.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The adoption of the report from the Committee
                on Standing Orders, which I support, is another significant step
                in the preparation of the Assembly for the transfer of powers
                from Westminster. The way in which the Committee completed its
                task with every party in the Assembly represented at the table,
                with many disagreements — sometimes heated but more often in a
                constructive atmosphere — is firm evidence of the ability of
                all parties to agree the way forward. It is further progress in
                the establishment of the institutions that were envisaged in the
                Good Friday Agreement. There is no reason why that task cannot
                be completed in the near future.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sinn Féin does not have a problem with
                Mr&nbsp;Robinson’s amendment. The document was produced in a
                rush so that the Committee could meet the deadline. Perhaps that
                is an example to both Governments. It was inevitable that there
                would be minor flaws in the document, and we are not opposed to
                the tidying up of its text. Go raibh maith agat a Chathaoirligh.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Close:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was eight months ago that we set out to
                produce this compendium of Standing Orders for the good
                governance and conduct of the House. Today, let us hope, we have
                fulfilled that task.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It would be remiss of me, on behalf of the
                Alliance Party, if I did not extend my thanks and
                congratulations to the co-Chairmen for assisting all of us in
                the business of this difficult task. As Mr&nbsp;Cobain has said,
                the devising of Standing Orders and the drawing up of a
                compendium of Standing Orders is a somewhat tedious and, at
                times, rather boring task. Thanks to the co-Chairmen’s humour
                and cohesiveness, we managed to get on with the job and produce
                a report which, I hope, will receive the support of the House.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also wish to pay a special tribute to the
                Clerks, and particularly to Murray&nbsp;Barnes and
                Denis&nbsp;Arnold, who worked, it is fair to say, far beyond the
                call of duty. The fact that there are errata is no fault of
                theirs; rather these are the result of the enormous amount of
                work that they were endeavouring to do in meeting rather strict
                and at times rather false deadlines.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While I have not seen the amendments, their
                large number gives me some cause for concern. I hope that they
                are of the nit-picking variety, the tidying-up type which,
                essentially, reflect the fact that we were operating under
                strict and difficult deadlines. If some commas et&nbsp;cetera
                have been left out, that is perfectly understandable.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee would obviously have been
                well-served if Mr&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;Robinson had found time to
                come on to it. The Democratic Unionist Party had five
                substitutes, as well as their three members, over the
                22&nbsp;meetings. They were well-represented. But it would have
                been very helpful, and it would have facilitated the speedy
                agreement of the report, if the Member for East Belfast had
                graced us with his presence on some occasions and helped us not
                to make so many mistakes. However, since one of the Standing
                Orders permits me now to use the language of my choice, <i>errare
                humanum est</i> — we are all human, and we all can make
                mistakes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Most of today’s debate will be taken up by
                Members who were not on the Committee and who will want to have
                their say — and that is right — but there are a number of
                issues that I would like to flag up.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The first one is in reference to Standing
                Order 3(7), which refers to designation. I recognise that this
                cannot be changed strictly through Standing Orders — we will
                have an opportunity to do that if we review the Good Friday
                Agreement — but we have always felt that designation
                represents the institutionalisation of tribalism and that having
                it in Standing Orders does not augur well.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have flagged up the problems with
                designation before, and we will continue to do so, with the
                ultimate goal of having removed the necessity for people to be
                bunched into the little tribes of Unionists, Nationalists or
                Others. To perpetuate tribalism does not help our society.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The other issue that I want to flag up has
                already been referred to. It is in relation to Standing
                Orders&nbsp;42 to 44, which refer to the statutory committees. I
                was surprised to learn that the functions Department of the
                Centre will not be, or could not be, subject to statutory
                scrutiny. It could be that this omission was an oversight when
                the legislation was being passed, but I question that. Given the
                number of amendments that were put forward to the Bill on its
                passage through Westminster, such an obvious and glaring
                omission suggests a degree of deliberate intent rather than
                merely oversight.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If I am wrong — and I have already said
                that to err is human — the First Minister (Designate) and the
                Deputy First Minister (Designate) will join with the rest of the
                Members and ensure that a change in legislation is brought about
                quickly so that there can be proper scrutiny by the House of the
                Department of the Centre.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When we were discussing the various functions
                to be held by the Department of the Centre it struck some
                Members that an attempt was being made to suck too many
                functions into that Department. Efforts should be made either to
                withdraw some of those functions from the Centre or to bring
                about a change in the legislation to enable there to be full
                scrutiny of that Department.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The final issue that I wish to flag up —
                and I know that some of my Colleagues will be referring to this
                by way of an amendment — is the number of members on these
                committees. It is only fair that there should be the widest
                possible representation of all Members on the committees of the
                House. Members from four parties will form the Executive, and it
                is up to the rest of us to scrutinise fully, with the best
                possible representation, all the functions that are retained by
                the Executive. For that reason the number of members on the
                statutory and other committees should be increased, but this
                will be discussed later.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The overall job was done well. It will stand
                the House in good stead, and I look forward to the debate on the
                various amendments when we are able to see them.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Roche:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While congratulating the Committee on
                Standing Orders, it does seem that an opportunity may have been
                lost to remedy what is a fundamental fault in the
                Belfast&nbsp;Agreement. In the agreement we have on the one side
                the all-Ireland institutions, the North/South Ministerial
                Council, the implementation bodies and the Intergovernmental
                Conference. On the other side we have the Assembly, and the link
                between those two is the Executive.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The North/South Ministerial Council and,
                indeed, all those institutions appear to have two fundamental
                features. First, they are embedded in international law. This
                means that it is absolutely beyond the competence of the
                Assembly ever to remove them once they are set up. Second, there
                is something extremely ambiguous about the functioning of these
                institutions in relation to the Assembly. Paragraph&nbsp;13 of
                the Belfast Agreement states</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;it is understood that the North/South
                Ministerial Council and the Northern&nbsp;Ireland Assembly are
                mutually inter-dependent, and that one cannot successfully
                function without the other.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Whatever that statement means, it does not
                mean that one cannot function at all without the other. There is
                a distinction between what someone would perceive as successful
                functioning and no functioning at all. So this statement does
                not mean that in the event of the Assembly’s being deadlocked
                or collapsing the institutions would cease to function. That
                raises the issue of what control the Assembly can have over the
                all-Ireland dimension of the agreement in the event of these
                institutions being established and, in particular, in the event
                of their starting to function.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The key issue is what control the Assembly
                has over the Executive, because the Executive is the link
                between the Assembly and the all-Ireland institutions. There are
                two points of contact between the Assembly and the Executive in
                terms of control. One of them is the capacity of the Assembly to
                vote annually on a programme of government presented by the
                Executive, and the other potential area of control is through
                the statutory committees. The problem with the Standing Orders
                is that they specify that the statutory committees are simply to
                advise and assist each Minister. In other words, they are to be
                as weak as they possibly can be.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Once this mechanism is up and running, there
                will be a fault line between the Assembly and the all-Ireland
                institutions that means that the Assembly will have virtually no
                control over the all-Ireland aspect of the agreement, and to
                some extent the opportunity to remedy that situation has been
                entirely lost by the Committee.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I commend the report and the work of the
                joint Chairmen — Fred&nbsp;Cobain and Denis&nbsp;Haughey —
                and our very capable Clerks.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A two-day or three-day debate on Standing
                Orders would not inspire the most intrepid political scientist,
                let alone our friends in journalism. However, it is important
                that they stop and read between the lines. This simple,
                unassuming report is, in fact, a document of tremendous
                significance as it outlines the rules and regulations that will
                govern the making or the breaking of new laws in Northern
                Ireland. The report outlines the procedures to be followed to
                guarantee that every piece of legislation is in accordance with
                anti-discrimination, equality and human-rights legislation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These Standing Orders exist to ensure that
                every check is balanced and that every balance is checked. It is
                simply the translation of the Good Friday Agreement and the
                Northern Ireland Act into the conduct of business on the Floor
                of the House.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, there is an important difference.
                These Standing Orders were agreed by representatives from every
                political party in the Assembly. In fact, the Standing Orders
                Committee is possibly the best example so far of all parties
                working together for the common good. Unionists, Nationalists,
                Loyalists, Republicans and &quot;Others&quot; sat side by side
                on the Committee, and together they wrote, rubbed out and
                rewrote the rules for the operation of the Assembly.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, Mr Initial Presiding
                Officer. It should be on record that the Northern Ireland
                Unionist Party did not have a member on that Committee. It had

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank Mr&nbsp;Boyd for that point of order.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Things started to look good from the outset
                when it was agreed that the UUP and the SDLP should jointly
                chair the meetings. At almost every meeting there was an obvious
                sense of people listening to and learning from each other. It
                surprised the Committee that political adversaries backed each
                other on several occasions. It has already been mentioned that
                there was only one occasion on which the deliberations became
                uncomfortably tense. That was at the second last meeting, about
                a week ago, when the sensitive issue of language was broached.
                At the last and possibly the best meeting, there was a very
                definite sense of compromise and agreement on the need to move
                forward.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is our rule book. Mr&nbsp;Cobain has
                said that we got here by looking at what happens in Parliaments
                in London, Dublin and Strasbourg and at what happened in the
                last parliamentary body in Northern Ireland and by choosing the
                bits that suited us best. We have in this rule book the
                potential for a thoroughly modern Assembly. It will place human
                rights and equality at the very top of the agenda, and cronyism
                at the very bottom. It will be open and transparent and will
                allow for a system of government which will be a role model for
                other Parliaments.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">11.30 am</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One great achievement, of which we in the
                Women’s Coalition can feel proud, is the decision to end
                sittings at 6.00&nbsp;pm. I was, however, disappointed to learn
                this morning that a decision could be made to change that,
                because of the task that is before us, for this sitting. The
                reason we decided to end sittings at 6.00&nbsp;pm was that this
                would represent a family-friendly working day. The problems that
                have been caused in other Parliaments by the need for Members to
                stay for late sittings or overnight sittings have been obvious.
                This applies not just to women with families but also to men
                with families. We can leave at 6.00&nbsp;pm and get home to our
                families, which is very important. In fact, I understand that
                the Scottish Parliament will be following our lead in this
                respect.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am also especially pleased on International
                Women’s Day — and let me repeat, for Members who may not
                have heard, that today is International Women’s Day — to see
                that the language of the Standing Orders exhibits gender
                consciousness through the use of &quot;he/she&quot; and
                &quot;his/her&quot;. I am also pleased to note that Members
                exhibit a similar consciousness when they are speaking in the
                Chamber.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have referred to the tremendous potential
                which the Assembly has to create a unique system of coalition
                government, which could be the envy of the world. However, it
                must be based on the principle of inclusion, which means
                including the smaller parties as well as the larger ones. Those
                of us in the smaller parties have demonstrated that we are ready
                to roll our sleeves up and work hard. We should not be squeezed
                out of Committees to which we can make a valuable contribution
                by way of constructive opposition and as another voice that adds
                breadth to their deliberations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr&nbsp;Cobain, in his opening remarks, said
                that he felt that the concerns of smaller parties had been
                fairly considered. However, we in the Women’s Coalition still
                have some concerns about this, some of which have already been
                raised by other Members. Standing Orders 43 to 45 refer to the
                principle of proportionality in the make-up of Committees which
                will enable them to reflect party strengths in the Assembly.
                However, if these Committees are to have only 11&nbsp;members,
                this will not happen. Number 23(2)(b) of the draft additional
                Initial Standing Orders drawn up by the Secretary of State says
                that proportionality will apply to &quot;each Committee&quot;
                rather than to &quot;all Committees&quot;, as set out in these
                Standing Orders. Mr&nbsp;Close has said that this matter will be
                discussed further. Inclusiveness must apply to everyone.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When the Assembly approves this report we
                will be ready to open for business. The foundations have been
                laid, and the bricks and mortar are in place. We will have our
                rule book, and we will be ready, at last, to roll up our sleeves
                and start working. We have fulfilled our legal obligations under
                the Good Friday Agreement. It is now up to us to fulfil our
                moral obligations to the people of Northern Ireland.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McCartney:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the key issues, as identified by a
                number of Members, is the relationship that will exist between
                the Assembly and the Executive. It is very evident from its
                behaviour that another Executive is becoming increasingly
                indifferent to the views of Parliament and that the influence
                which can be exercised by elected representatives on the
                Government is diminishing. Indeed, it has almost become a habit
                for the Government to release to the media what they intend to
                do before bringing it to the House of Commons. I therefore share
                the views and anxieties expressed by some Members about the
                control, if any, which the Assembly can exercise over the
                Executive.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">From the earliest meetings of the Standing
                Orders Committee, which I attended, I made it evident that there
                should be a strong committee system to control, insofar as it
                can be controlled, the work of the Executive. That is
                particularly so when one realises that the composition of the
                Executive in the Assembly is rather different from that in most
                democracies.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have consensual arrangements here.
                Consensual arrangements have certain benefits, and they have
                particular benefits to those who actually exercise power under
                those arrangements. Put bluntly, that power will be exercised by
                the larger parties, particularly the Ulster Unionist Party and
                the SDLP, who will have a majority of members on the Executive.
                Other parties, such as the DUP and Sinn&nbsp;Féin, will have a
                smaller membership. What is very important is that the
                activities of the Executive can be controlled — and controlled
                effectively.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I therefore have a degree of sympathy with
                the arguments that have been put forward for a committee to
                control the activities of the First and Deputy First Ministers
                (Designate). These Ministers will have a great deal of power
                outside the remit of the specific statutory Committees. It will
                be a power over a broad range of issues of important and extreme
                significance, yet, in formal terms, there is no committee to
                which these Ministers will be directly accountable. I appreciate
                that there is no statutory provision for such a committee and
                that therefore it was not within the remit of the Standing
                Orders Committee to create a committee specifically charged with
                the supervision and control of the offices of the First and
                Deputy First Ministers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also appreciate that, subject to that
                omission, it was necessary for the Standing Orders Committee to
                make whatever arrangements it could for the control of the
                powers exercised by the First and Deputy First Ministers. Those
                Ministers represent the two largest parties, and Members must
                avoid, in an arrangement which is supposed to be a consensual
                one for the exercise of power, power being effectively exercised
                by the two largest parties without a formal means of control.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This principle applies whether one is a
                Nationalist or a Unionist, though doubtless Nationalists would
                want different objectives controlled than Unionists.
                Mr&nbsp;Roche has quite properly pointed out some of his worries
                and anxieties, which I share, about the Executive’s role as
                the link between the Assembly and cross-border bodies and about
                the general influence by another independent sovereign state on
                the internal governance of Northern Ireland. Those are very
                important matters and were quite properly addressed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also have a deal of sympathy with the views
                expressed by Sinn&nbsp;Féin about the absence of a specific
                statutory committee. Doubtless it would have very different
                objectives from those which I share with the pro-Union
                community, but the essential element that Members must ensure is
                that the Executive come under the control of the Assembly. The
                Executive must be fully accountable to the Assembly, even if it
                is engaged in activities considered to be inimical to the
                objectives of the pro-Union community or to those of a more
                extreme Nationalist view. It must be under control. I share the
                view, which has been expressed by some Members, that there
                should be some change in the legislation to ensure this element
                of control over the two Ministers who will, in effect, exercise
                more individual power than anyone else.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is a curious anomaly that even the power
                of junior Ministers — and I am talking not about
                junior&nbsp;Ministers within the definition of the Act, whom I
                once referred to irreverently as the ministerial piglets, but
                about Ministers who will be in charge of the Departments —
                will be much more limited than those of the First and Deputy
                First Ministers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Presumably the First and Deputy First
                Ministers — representatives of the largest parties — will
                have the greatest overall input into the preparation of the
                annual policy document which the Assembly will subsequently be
                required to ratify as the Executive’s policy objectives and
                functions for that year. They will be at the centre of power.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In terms of a wheel with 10 spokes, all the
                Ministries will be accountable down to the central hub, which
                will be the Office of the First and Deputy First Ministers. As
                the hub of that governmental wheel, they will control the office
                which is in touch with all of those Ministries, yet that hub
                will not be subject to any statutory committee, upon which all
                parties should have representatives, that could have a direct
                input and exercise direct control over what those Ministers are
                doing.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In terms of the matters that were raised by
                Assemblyman Roche, it seems that the area, functions and powers
                of the North/South Ministerial Council and of the implementation
                bodies are necessarily painted in rather vague terms. I was
                amazed to hear the First Minister (Designate), on the radio
                programme ‘Inside Politics’, refer to me, saying &quot;Poor
                Bob does not seem to realise that international treaties are not
                written in plain language.&quot; Mr&nbsp;Trimble ought to know,
                because if ever there was an exponent of obscure and
                obscurantist language, of circumlocution, of fudge, of any form
                of language that is particularly utilised to ensure that his
                listeners have not got a damned clue about what he is talking
                about, it is the First&nbsp;Minister (Designate).</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A proposal to set up a committee to ensure
                that the gobbledegook of the First Minister (Designate) is
                analysed and examined and turned into plain language that not
                only the Assembly but the entire electorate of Northern Ireland
                can understand would be well worth implementing. For the benefit
                of all parties, whether Republican, Nationalist, Unionist or
                Loyalist, the Assembly should have a degree of control by way of
                a strong central committee over the activities of those who will
                exercise more power than anyone else.</p>

                report, issued on 26&nbsp;October, dealt with some of the issues
                contained in the final report. It must be stressed — as it was
                by the joint Chairman — that not all the issues that the
                Committee spent much of its time on eventually ended up in
                Standing Orders. Some ended up in the minutes, some in notes
                which will accompany the Standing Orders —</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some ended up in the bin.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dodds:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Indeed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An enormous amount of work was done, not all
                of which is reflected in these documents we have before us. We
                have had to deal with the fact that the Northern Ireland Bill
                was going through its various stages in Parliament at the same
                time as we were trying to draw up Standing Orders. There was a
                period when we were not sure what the legislation would say
                about the Standing Orders. This lead to the suspension of the
                work of the Committee in its plenary form, although officials
                carried on working behind the scenes. That was one reason why
                the Committee was not able to progress its work as quickly as
                some of us would have liked.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee also had to deal with
                additional Initial Standing Orders, sent by the Secretary of
                State. At the beginning of September, we spent some time
                debating the draft additional Initial Standing Orders, and we
                returned them to the Secretary of State. She commented on our
                recommendations, but we have not heard anything about those
                additional Standing Orders since. Some of us asked what had
                happened to them. We queried why, at a crucial time in its work,
                the Committee was burdened with having to deal with these
                additional Standing Orders when nothing ever came of them, but
                to this day, the Secretary of State has not given the Committee
                a satisfactory answer.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We will be dealing with the Committee’s
                work section by section. There will be specific amendments, and
                we can, at that time, deal with some of the minutiae and some of
                the individual Standing Orders as they come along.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to make some general points about the
                more significant issues. Mr&nbsp;Close mentioned the issue of
                changes in designation. We had this debate, I think, at the
                26&nbsp;October Assembly meeting. Mr&nbsp;Close still maintains
                that it is a nonsense to have people divided up into tribes —
                Unionists, Nationalists and Others. He has argued this point in
                Committee. The difficulty for him, of course, is that he and his
                party signed up to this designation, this division of people
                into tribes, under the terms of the agreement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As we tried to point out on a number of
                occasions, it was a bit late expecting the Standing Orders
                Committee to argue about this when the Member had already agreed
                that tribalism should be enshrined in the Belfast Agreement and,
                therefore, in the Act itself. There was nothing we could do
                about it, and the reality is that we now have a system of voting
                which ensures that we have these designated blocks for ever
                within the lifetime of the Assembly — Unionist, Nationalist
                and Other. That is the way in which votes will be taken on key
                issues.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Initial Standing Orders which we were
                given by the Secretary of State included a provision to enable
                Members to jump from one designation to another — from
                Unionist to Nationalist and then the following week, if Members
                so decided, to Other and then back to Nationalist or Unionist.
                Some Members actually argued in the Committee that we should
                continue with that — astounding though it may seem.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am glad that common sense prevailed and
                that Standing Orders say that while it is possible for someone
                to change once during the term of the Assembly, it will be once
                and once only. There will be none of the nonsense that was
                intended by the Secretary of State and encouraged by some
                parties here of Members being able to change their designation
                with seven days’ notice in order to influence a vote in the
                House. We were successful in deleting that piece of nonsense
                from the Standing Orders.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The matter of language raised its head in the
                Committee on numerous occasions, and we had exchanges on this
                subject at the meeting on 26&nbsp;October. No special
                recognition is now given in the Standing Orders to any foreign
                language that may be used in the Chamber. The Standing Orders
                provide for Members to speak in any language other than English
                should they wish to do so, but there is no provision for
                translation, simultaneous or otherwise, and no special
                recognition or place is given to any particular foreign
                language.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thought that the purpose of debate was to
                try to influence how other Members vote or think by having one’s
                voice heard and opinions expressed. But if some Members are so
                discourteous that they want to speak in a foreign language that
                others do not understand, that is a matter for them. If they
                want to waste their time in that way, that is a matter entirely
                for them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms&nbsp;Morrice said that she was glad that
                the Northern Ireland Women’s Coalition had achieved a
                family-friendly time for sittings: 10.00&nbsp;am to
                6.30&nbsp;pm. However, I am disappointed that it is a woman
                Secretary of State who has told the House to meet until
                10.00&nbsp;pm both today and tomorrow in order to get through
                its business. I am sure that the Northern&nbsp;Ireland Women’s
                Coalition will be taking this up with the Secretary of State,
                and I hope that they will be as vehement in raising that with
                her as they are about other issues.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I understand it, however, this was not an
                issue. Members from other parties will agree that this was
                something that found broad agreement among all parties. We all
                agreed that we should have a sitting arrangement which would be
                family-friendly and family-orientated — this was not something
                that just the Northern&nbsp;Ireland Women’s Coalition wanted.
                Indeed, the only dissenting voice on this, as reported by the
                joint Chairman, was that of the Chief Whip of the Ulster
                Unionist Party, who proposed that the Assembly meet at
                2.30&nbsp;pm each Monday and finish at 10.00&nbsp;pm. I am glad
                to say that the Committee unanimously rejected that view. I do
                not know whether there is to be an amendment on this or not, but
                we will wait and see.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A problem has arisen regarding the scrutiny
                of statutory committees of the Office of the First Minister and
                the Deputy First Minister, and this has caused the Committee a
                great deal of concern. I will not rehearse all the arguments. I
                agree with the arguments that other Members have made about the
                importance of this issue. It is absolutely unacceptable that the
                important executive functions of the First Minister, the Deputy
                First Minister and the junior Ministers will not be subject to
                scrutiny by the appropriate statutory Committee. This is a very
                significant matter. We must address it, and one of
                Mr&nbsp;Robinson’s amendments does just that. The Assembly
                will have an opportunity to do something about this later in the
                debate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are other issues that I could raise,
                but I will reserve some of my comments until later when we deal
                with some of these amendments in detail.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Wells:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Initial Presiding Officer — I hope
                within the next few days to be able to address you as
                Mr&nbsp;Speaker — I was not a member of the Standing Orders
                Committee, but, because of the busy nature of the work that the
                three Members from my party had to attend to, I attended as a
                substitute on no fewer than six&nbsp;occasions. Indeed, so
                regular was my attendance that one set of minutes recorded me as
                a member.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Like many others I am alarmed that the
                legislation does not enable the Standing Orders Committee to
                establish a statutory scrutiny committee to examine the powers
                exercised by the First and the Deputy First Ministers. I am
                extremely suspicious about how this happened because, while the
                Standing Orders Committee was meeting, a huge raft of new powers
                were added to that Office, and it would be total negation of
                democracy if there were not some controls and checks on that
                work. There is unanimity in the House on this: if the rights of
                all parties and the rights of all minorities are to be
                protected, there must be a brake on the powers, on the almost
                absolute powers on some very important matters, of the First and
                the Deputy First Ministers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The message from the Assembly to the
                Secretary of State this morning is that new legislation is
                required on this crucial issue. It is no good saying that we can
                establish a committee if that committee does not have the power
                to require the presentation of papers or to request the First
                and the Deputy First Ministers to come forward and answer
                questions. It is really a bit of a sham. We must have the same
                powers as the statutory committees have over the Office.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Wells:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am certainly not reading.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wish to speak on an issue which I have
                raised before —the speeches in the Assembly. I am glad to note
                that under Standing Order&nbsp;17 this is addressed, but I think
                it is worth rehearsing the points that I made in the Committee.
                The present way in which we deal with speeches is strangling
                this body as a debating Chamber. A Member, unless he is
                proposing a motion, has 10&nbsp;minutes in which to speak. The
                crucial point is that interventions from anyone on the Floor of
                House are included in that 10&nbsp;minutes. The result is that
                Members are encouraged to get the head down and rattle through
                their speeches at 100&nbsp;miles per hour because they have to
                try to squeeze in the maximum amount of material they can in the
                10&nbsp;minutes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I got a lot of flak a few weeks ago when I
                suggested that people glanced at their notes while they were
                speaking. An all-party delegation came to me and told me that my
                remark was totally unacceptable, that it was scurrilous, and I
                was asked to apologise. If I caused offence, I apologise. I now
                realise that people glanced at their notes not to read them but
                to try to get as much material as possible into 10&nbsp;minutes.
                Benefiting from this were the ‘Mourne Observer’, the ‘Strabane
                Weekly News’ and ‘The Londonderry Sentinel’ because as
                soon as a speech is made, the text is rushed by fax machine to
                the local papers. I am confident that if I miss a speech in the
                House I will always pick it up in the local papers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The problem with the 10-minute rule is that
                people are encouraged to rattle through their speeches at great
                speed and, because interventions are included in their time,
                there is no incentive for them to give way. Why would anyone
                give way, although I always do? Members will not give way
                because they will lose precious time —</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr A Maginness:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the problems about reading or giving a
                prepared speech, as opposed to an extempore speech, is that the
                reporters and journalists who cover the Assembly do not write
                down what is said. They rely on scripts. Some of the Member’s
                remarks should be aimed at the media’s reporting of the
                Assembly rather than at individual Members.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is a valid point. One solution to that
                problem would be to cut the communication links to the rooms
                that the media have in this building and force them to sit in
                the Press Gallery and listen to the debates. A speech never
                seems as good in cold print as it did on the Floor of the House.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The hon Member for East Belfast,
                Sammy&nbsp;Wilson, is one of the best speakers in this Chamber.
                Others are, of course, Dr&nbsp;Paisley, Peter&nbsp;Robinson,
                Nigel&nbsp;Dodds, Gregory&nbsp;Campbell — to name a few. <i>[Interruption]</i>
                I certainly do not fall into that category.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are blessed with some Members who speak
                outstandingly well, but in cold print in Hansard their speeches
                do not read as well as one typed by a research assistant who
                dotted the i’s and crossed the t’s.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This House must act as a debating chamber,
                where Ministers and Committee Chairmen stand up and are called
                to account by the Members. If we do not allow interventions
                during speeches all we will get is a series of monologues. We
                might as well stand out in the corridor and hand our speeches to
                the press. There is nothing to be gained by standing and reading
                10&nbsp;minutes of prepared text at great speed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I proposed in the Committee — and I hope it
                will become the policy of this Assembly — that an intervention
                by someone not from the Member’s own party should not be
                included in the 10&nbsp;minutes and that an intervention by
                someone from his own party should. I suggested this because
                there could be an abuse of the situation — for instance,
                someone representing the DUP could allow 19 interventions.</p>

                that is allowed to happen that Member could, effectively, have a
                29- or 39-minute speech, which would not be acceptable. I
                suggested in the Committee that interventions, no matter who
                they are from, be limited to one minute. Any point raised can be
                made in that time. If it comes from an opponent it does not
                count, if it comes from someone in the Member’s own party it
                does count.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr P Robinson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a standard which is used practically
                in the House of Commons that it is not an intervention unless it
                is short. A minute would be far too long for an intervention, as
                mine has proved.</p>

                Member for East Belfast. I thought when I included him among the
                best speakers in the House he would have let me have an easy
                ride, but he has not.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The point is that it is a maximum of one
                minute. Some of the highlights of Westminster parliamentary
                debate have been the cutting intervention which have sometimes
                floored the argument of an opponent, completely smashed it, or

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Occasionally when my TV aerial turns the
                wrong way and I pick up RTE I have noticed Members in the Dáil
                reading their speeches. The former Prime Minister,
                Albert&nbsp;Reynolds was one of the worst examples of this. He
                would get a sheet of paper, put his head down and read very fast
                in a totally unintelligible accent. We do not want our Chamber
                to turn into that. We want to be much better than the Dáil. We
                should have the same standards as Westminster where some of the
                best debates ever recorded have occurred. People like
                Michael&nbsp;Foot, Tam&nbsp;Dalyell, Tony&nbsp;Banks, the
                Minister for Sport, are able, with a cutting intervention —</p>

                listened to. Let us turn this into a debating chamber so that
                people can turn on their television sets, see this Chamber and
                say &quot;Those people that we elected are debating. There is
                cut and thrust. They are worthy of election. They are not simply

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Initial Presiding Officer:</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I cannot speak for the Committee, but I will
                try to reflect the kind of consensus that we achieved. Members
                will have to speak for themselves if they differ from that. I
                can only make personal observations on the matters raised this
                morning.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like to pay tribute to
                Fred&nbsp;Cobain, Denis&nbsp;Arnold and Murray&nbsp;Barnes and,
                indeed, to the members of the Committee. The working of the
                Standing Orders Committee has been an example of what can be
                achieved when people put their best efforts towards achieving
                consensus.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To refer to the points raised by
                Mr&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;Robinson, the amendment which he put down and
                which has just been carried is perfectly sensible and not
                contentious. He referred to the incorporation of relevant
                sections from the Act and the agreement into a consolidated
                volume of Standing Orders. Again, a perfectly sensible and
                appropriate suggestion which, I imagine, we will follow up.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In relation to the errata which were
                circulated, he is proposing that they should be agreed as a
                single amendment. That is also sensible. I am not entirely sure
                that it is necessary, since the errata are part of the Standing
                Orders agreed in the Committee and reported to the House.
                However, this will put the matter beyond any doubt and is not
                unduly burdensome.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Murphy raised the matter of the scrutiny
                of the Department of the Centre, and a number of other Members
                subsequently referred to the matter. Because of the nature of
                the Act, this is an extremely complicated matter which needs
                careful consideration. The Standing Orders Committee has
                properly reported that this issue gave rise to concern, and the
                Assembly needs to look at it. The point raised by Mr&nbsp;Murphy
                about flags on this Building is not a matter for the Standing
                Orders Committee, and that was one of the things we rushed to
                agree at the very beginning.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Close also raised the issue of the
                scrutiny of the Department of the Centre. I should point out to
                Mr&nbsp;Close that amendments to the Bill were taken in the
                House of Lords. Perhaps he might look within his own party for
                procedures for dealing with that. My party unfortunately cannot
                deal with the House of Lords.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Roche suggested that Standing Orders
                should provide the Assembly with a means of controlling
                North/South bodies. No doubt he has put down an amendment to
                that effect, and the House will have an opportunity to consider
                it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms&nbsp;Morrice raised the question of gender
                consciousness. A proper appreciation of gender consciousness is,
                I think, reflected throughout this report. Where it is not, the
                report can be properly amended under the procedure which has now
                been adopted subsequent to Mr&nbsp;Robinson’s amendment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms&nbsp;Morrice also raised the question of
                the concerns of the smaller parties, particularly in relation to
                the composition of Committees. I have to say that strict
                proportionality could be achieved only if every Member were a
                member of every Committee. Other than that, it is a question of
                trying to get proportionality in a manageable way within each
                Committee. In relation to the statutory Committees it would be
                an extreme burden, particularly upon the larger parties, if
                membership of those Committees were to reach a point where the
                smaller parties would be able to cover every standing Committee.
                It just would not be possible.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A membership of 11, which was generally
                agreed in the Committee, will give every Member a fair
                opportunity, insofar as it is possible, to be a member of a
                Committee.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr&nbsp;McCartney raised the question of the
                control of the Executive, and he referred to the situation in
                the House of Commons by way of illustrating his point. However,
                the situation here will be different in that, first of all, we
                will have a Committee system which will give a certain degree of
                control of the Executive, and the Executive Committee itself
                will give a degree of control over the functions of the First
                and Deputy First Ministers. The Committee did not find that
                entirely satisfactory, and this is something that we will have
                to come back to.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I should also say that, obviously, the First
                and Deputy First Ministers would have to have won the confidence
                of their own parties in respect of any proposals they intended
                to make; they would also have to have won the support of the
                House. So the First and Deputy First Ministers will not be free
                agents, able to conduct business as they please; they will have
                to have the support and confidence of the House.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like to thank Nigel&nbsp;Dodds for
                his kind remarks, particularly in relation to Denis&nbsp;Arnold
                and Murray&nbsp;Barnes, whose work has been outstanding. The
                House owes them a debt of gratitude.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr&nbsp;Dodds also referred to the additional
                Initial Standing Orders which the Committee looked at but which
                disappeared — I think there will be more about that shortly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In relation to the parallel-consent
                requirement, I believe that that flows naturally from the
                agreement, and I can deal only with the Standing Orders aspect
                of that. I think the Standing Orders we have adopted properly
                reflect what was agreed in the Good Friday Agreement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If, in his remarks about foreign languages,
                Mr&nbsp;Dodds intended to imply that Irish is a foreign language
                for all Members, I would regard that as unfortunate. Obviously
                it is not, and if he did intend to imply that, he is making
                foreigners out of a great many Members.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Nigel&nbsp;Dodds also raised the question of
                the functions of junior Ministers and the need for their
                functions to be scrutinised. He pointed out that Committees set
                up by the Assembly itself will not necessarily have the same
                powers as the departmental Committees. We need to look at that
                in some detail and come up with proposals which can be put
                before the House.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Jim&nbsp;Wells raised the question of
                extempore speaking in the House, and, in a remarkable tour de
                force, covered the whole question of speaking from notes and the
                impact of time limitation on speeches. Over a period of time,
                convention and usage will lead to a much more satisfactory
                situation than the one that has arisen from time to time when
                Members get up and read from prepared scripts. I do not regard
                that as particularly satisfactory, but you will remember,
                Mr&nbsp;Initial Presiding Officer, that I and the other joint
                Chairman, Fred Cobain, raised this matter with you. It is
                extremely difficult to know how one could legislate for that in
                Standing Orders.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, I promise not to breathe a word to
                anyone — and I think everybody will undertake to do the
                same&nbsp;— about Mr&nbsp;Wells listening to RTE.</p>

                within the next 15&nbsp;minutes or 30&nbsp;minutes a marshalled
                list of the amendments for the first six Standing Orders. While

                that we would receive the list of amendments by 1.00&nbsp;pm. In
                fact, we did not receive details of the amendments until 2.05 or
                2.10 — an hour later. I therefore request a further suspension
                of at least 30 minutes to give us a chance to study the list.
                Given that we have 87&nbsp;fairly complex amendments, even that

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I trust that all Members have now received
                the marshalled list of amendments and the groups. The amendments
                are numbered in the order in which they were received by the
                Business Office, but they are marshalled in the order in which
                they relate to the Standing Orders. The first amendment on the
                list is number 42, and it comes first because it relates to
                Standing Order 3(5) and there are no amendments in relation to
                Standing Order 1 or&nbsp;2. The marshalled list will be worked
                through in the order that is shown, albeit the numbers of the
                amendments refer to when they were received by the Business

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Further to that ruling, Mr Initial Presiding
                Officer. I thought that you might have more time to consider the
                matter of the errata. You say that Standing Orders 1 and 2 have
                no amendments attached to them, but they do under the errata.
                Standing Order&nbsp;2 has a change, but if it is covered by the
                amendment that was made part of the substantive motion this
                morning, I think Members could accept it as having been passed
                — depending on your ruling.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Initial Presiding Officer:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am content to rule that the amendment that
                was passed in respect of item 3 will subsume all those matters
                that are referred to in the errata, which were supplied with the
                Committee’s report. All the amendments in the errata will
                therefore be accepted and actioned on the basis of the amendment
                to item 3.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The groupings of amendments, which Members
                have received, refer to the groups of Standing Orders in the
                compendium. I have not sought to produce any new groupings but
                have simply taken the sections in the compendium and grouped the
                amendments so that they relate to the groups of Standing Orders.
                They are ordered in relation to the individual Standing Orders.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Group 1 covers the first six Standing Orders
                relating to preliminary arrangements. The amendments which
                relate to those are amendments 42, 85A, 85B, 41, 40, 38 and 39,
                and they form the first group on the list of groupings of
                amendments. Any Member not having a list of groupings can obtain
                a copy from the Doorkeepers in the rotunda.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When we debate each group of amendments which
                refers to the group of Standing Orders, the proposers of
                amendments should speak in the order called. I would request
                proposers to refer to as many amendments as possible — in some
                cases it might be possible to refer to all of the amendments in
                that group. For example, Mr&nbsp;Robinson, in addressing group
                one, will speak first to amendment&nbsp;42, but it may also be
                possible for him to deal with amendments 41, 40, 38 and 39, or
                to as many of them as is possible. Mr&nbsp;Neeson, or one of the
                other proposers may speak to both 85A and 85B if it is possible
                for them to do so.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not rule that Members must address all
                of the amendments in a group. While that may be possible in
                group one it is very unlikely that it will be possible in group
                two or in the group of amendments that relate to the Standing
                Orders of Committees, where there are very substantial numbers
                of amendments. It would simply not be possible to deal with
                those within the 10&nbsp;minutes.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What is the consequence of your suggestion if
                Members attempt to do that and fail? Does it mean that they will
                not be able to speak to their own amendments?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Initial Presiding Officer:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If Members feel that they can speak to the
                amendment for which they are called at that point and also to
                two or three other amendments, which may not be substantive
                amendments, within the 10&nbsp;minutes, which is the limit to
                which they can speak at any one point, then so be it. If it is
                not possible for the Member to deal with it then it would be
                better if they stood down at that point and were then called
                later when the other amendment comes up. If I do not deal with
                it in that fairly flexible way we will find ourselves having a
                debate on each of 87&nbsp;amendments, which is not a helpful way
                to proceed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Conversely, it would be just as unhelpful if
                Members only had 10&nbsp;minutes to deal with all of the
                amendments in a particular group. In the case of some Members,
                particularly the Member who has raised the question, and in
                respect of a number of the groups, that would clearly be
                unsatisfactory and unfair.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am trying to encourage Members to get as
                much as they can into each speech. It is to be hoped that we
                will deal with things in a thoughtful and flexible manner.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Before putting the Question on any Standing
                Order where there is an amendment I will ask &quot;Is the
                amendment moved or not moved?&quot; This will give Members an
                opportunity to treat their amendment as a probing amendment or
                to be influenced by the tenor of the debate and to either to
                withdraw or not move their amendment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the amendment is moved and there is any
                dissent I will have no option but to let the House divide so
                that we can measure the level of cross-community support. It is
                very difficult to do anything else if dissent is expressed at
                the point where an amendment, or indeed a Standing Order, is
                being voted upon.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I intend to try to enable the Assembly to
                have completed the approval and consideration of the Standing
                Orders and amendments up to and including those that relate to
                ministerial appointments, that is, up to and including Standing
                Order&nbsp;41, before suspending today’s proceedings and
                resuming at 10.30&nbsp;am tomorrow. We will then have dealt with
                about half of the Standing Orders and amendments. I trust that
                that will encourage us to proceed as best we can. The sooner we
                get that far along the road the sooner we can suspend today’s
                sitting.</p>

                &quot;during sitting days&quot;.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am not going to waste any time on dealing
                with what are simply tidying-up amendments. They stand on their
                own feet.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I assume that the amendment simply states
                what was intended by the Standing Order. The Standing Orders
                regulate the Assembly’s life not just when it is sitting, but
                when it is not sitting, and therefore the present terms of
                paragraph 5 could be construed to mean that the Roll of Members
                is in the Chamber all the time. There are visitors to the
                building, and we do not want other people signing the Roll. It
                might be a good idea to have it taken away between sittings.
                This is a straightforward simple tidying-up amendment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Amendment No&nbsp;85B in the name of Mr&nbsp;Neeson
                contains a mistake. It was probably correct when it was received
                by the Business Office. I assume that &quot;other&quot; should
                be &quot;Other&quot; as in the legislation. The effect is to
                suggest that any other designation can be entered and that, of
                course, is not what the agreement proposed. It is not what the
                Act requires, and I suspect that we would be acting outside our
                legal competence.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Since the Member has specifically raised the
                issue, may I make it clear that in the current draft order, the
                word &quot;Other&quot; appears in quotation marks. Our amendment
                seeks to remove the capital O and the quotation marks.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr P Robinson:</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That presents a difficulty because that is
                not what is stated. There are two mistakes here, and there are
                errors in other amendments. We shall point them out as each
                amendment is moved. I saw at least two in our amendments.
                Amendment No&nbsp;41 contains mistakes that were not there
                originally. It requires the notification to be in writing, which
                I suspect will be a safeguard for the Speaker or any subsequent
                Speaker.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Amendment No&nbsp;40 indicates the practice
                of the Assembly to date. Members may change their affiliation at
                any time, and if they do so they must give seven days’
                notification. It puts into our Standing Orders what has been our
                practice. It is particularly important to do that because
                elsewhere in the Standing Order there is reference to the
                identity designation and a time period of 30&nbsp;days. There
                might have been a tendency to assume that the party affiliation
                should follow the same timescale. The amendment makes it clear
                that the period of seven days that we have applied thus far
                would continue to apply.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The other two amendments relate to the
                position of the Speaker. They are probing amendments if either
                of the joint Chairmen or any member of the Committee wanted to
                report on the thinking of the Committee on the issue. My reading
                of the Standing Orders is that only on the first day of the
                sitting is it designated that the Speaker, if returned, shall be
                in the Chair. In his absence there can be a Deputy Speaker or
                the eldest Member, and there will always be such a person. But
                they will act only for the business to be transacted in the
                first day, and the Standing Order does not show a continuing
                role.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There may be assumptions about that, and the
                amendment seeks to remove them and make the provisions more
                solid. If we cannot agree on the election of a Speaker, we can
                elect a Deputy Speaker or Speakers and they, in turn or the
                Deputy Speaker could take the Chair until a Speaker is elected.
                If we cannot elect either a Deputy Speaker or a Speaker, we are
                down to the eldest Member. Perhaps I may put your mind as ease,
                Mr Initial Presiding Officer, by saying that those circumstances
                relate to the procedure at the first meeting of a new Assembly.
                We are dealing with what happens after the next election.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is necessary that we be fairly clear about
                the procedures. We do not have a satisfactory set of
                circumstances at present. If we do not define the procedures
                clearly we could have a less satisfactory set of circumstances
                where we could not elect a Speaker and would have no procedure
                to deal with the business that the Speaker would transact, apart
                from presiding over Assembly sittings. I think that that covers
                everything in the first section. Mr Initial Presiding Officer, I
                am looking for assurance. If that is the case, I will formally
                move the first amendment.</p>

                that it has been lost among all the paperwork.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to refer briefly to the amendments
                which stand in the name of Mr&nbsp;P&nbsp;Robinson, and in the
                spirit of charity with which he referred to ours I would like to
                give my party’s full agreement to his first three amendments.
                We have some doubts about the issue of getting a Speaker by the
                back door. After the next election there is a danger that the
                oldest Member might find himself stuck in the chair for longer
                than might be healthy for him. However, given that
                Mr&nbsp;P&nbsp;Robinson has described those as probing
                amendments, we shall listen with interest to any response which
                comes from Standing Orders Committee.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to speak to what I thought was one
                amendment and now stands as two amendments — 85A and 85B. The
                net effect of those would be to leave out four sets of inverted
                commas, but those inverted commas go to the heart of our
                problem, which is the whole issue of identity and each person’s
                right to define his or her identity. We have already had a minor
                row about how some Members designated themselves. The Standing
                Order is based on the Good Friday Agreement. Paragraph 6 of
                strand one refers to nationalist, unionist or other, with lower
                case letters and no quotation marks.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Northern Ireland Act&nbsp;1998 refers to
                designated Nationalist and designated Unionist, with lower case
                &quot;d&quot;, capital &quot;N&quot; and capital &quot;U&quot;
                and no quotation marks. The Initial Standing Orders from the
                Secretary of State similarly use capital letters but no
                quotation marks. The difference between the word
                &quot;Other&quot; without inverted commas and the word
                &quot;Other&quot; with inverted commas, as it appears in this
                draft Standing Order, is fundamental. The Alliance Party
                believes that every Member has the right to define herself or
                himself. This is quite clear in the Agreement, in the Act, in
                the Initial Standing Orders and in the current draft, as long as
                one defines oneself as either Nationalist or Unionist.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It might be thought slightly bizarre that
                Members of the House, elected on behalf of Sinn Féin or the
                SDLP, can designate themselves Unionist but that is their right.
                Similarly, any Member of one of the many parties with
                &quot;Unionist&quot; in their title can designate himself or
                herself as Nationalist. That is the current position, but the
                right of self-designation is no less than the right of
                self-determination. Every Member must have the right to
                designate his or her own identity. It is a gross insult to
                Members from my party and, indeed, other Members who do not put
                their primary identity in terms of the ancient quarrel to say
                that we cannot choose our own designation but must adopt the
                meaningless and offensive term &quot;Other&quot;.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Are we to be regarded as what South Africans
                used to describe as &quot;non-white&quot; because we are neither
                orange nor green? It is not only Alliance Members or others in
                the centre who will be affected. Some Members have already
                designated themselves as Nationalist/Irish Republican, and in
                the future some Members may wish to define a particular form of
                Unionism. Neither would be permitted under the draft Standing
                Order which specifies a single word. Anything other than the
                single word &quot;Nationalist&quot; or the single word
                &quot;Unionist&quot; could not be regarded as fitting that
                designation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The proposed Standing Order is, however, more
                than just offensive to some of us. In demanding the use of the
                term &quot;Other,&quot; it contradicts the Good Friday Agreement
                and also the Act, which is specifically for the purposes of
                implementing the Agreement. The Agreement and the Act lay down
                circumstances in which votes are counted which depend upon the
                votes of Nationalists and the votes of Unionists. There is no
                specific counting of the votes of those who do not fit into
                those two designations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Therefore there is absolutely no reason to
                specify how other Members should designate themselves if they do
                not wish to be regarded as Nationalist or Unionist. Attempting
                to specify how others designate themselves appears more than a
                little arrogant.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The draft Standing Order is contrary to the
                European framework convention on the protection of national
                minorities which was ratified by the UK in January 1998 and came
                into force in February of that year — that is before the Good
                Friday Agreement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If this draft Standing Order is approved by
                the Assembly, the next Alliance Member to take a seat will have
                no choice but to force a determination of the legality of the
                Standing Order. Standing Orders, I repeat, can only be made
                within the bounds set out by the Northern Ireland Act 1998. The
                Act uses the terms &quot;designated Nationalist&quot; and
                &quot;designated Unionist&quot;, which are defined in
                Chapter&nbsp;47, clause&nbsp;4(5). It does not use the term
                &quot;Other&quot;, either with or without inverted commas, and
                the use of the term &quot;Other&quot;, with a capital letter and
                in inverted commas, in the draft Standing Orders is therefore
                inconsistent with the Act. It is wrong, and it is ultra vires.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It would hardly be an advertisement for
                pluralism and new relationships in Northern Ireland if this
                Standing Order were held to be illegal under any aspects of
                human-rights legislation, whether domestic or European, because
                a few inverted commas infringed the rights of a minority of
                members. I urge Members to amend this Standing Order of their
                own volition to bring it into line with the agreement rather
                than wait for the courts to do so.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We now come to the second group of Standing
                Orders and amendments. I want to draw attention to two matters
                in this regard. First — and I am indebted to one Member who
                pointed this out to me earlier — the list includes two
                amendments numbered 26. The first should be numbered 36.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to amendments 1A, 1B, 2A and 2B,
                if these are all moved, then we will come first, of course, to
                the vote on amendment 1A. If amendments 1A and 2A are passed, we
                need not move to amendments&nbsp;1B and 2B as they are
                alternative proposals. However, if amendments. 1A and 2A are not
                passed, amendments&nbsp;1B and 2B may be moved.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The first amendment is in the name of
                Mr&nbsp;Peter Robinson.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr P Robinson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The purpose of amendment No&nbsp;37 is to add
                at the end of paragraph (2) of Standing Order 9 the following
                words:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The business adjourned shall be the
                first business when the Assembly next sits&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It would be difficult to cover all these
                issues in 10&nbsp;minutes. I hope at some stage to speak to the
                other amendments. There is the further difficulty that there are
                many issues of more substance in this group, and we might be
                juggling too many balls at one time. That concerns me.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Initial Presiding Officer:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What the Member says is perfectly reasonable,
                not only in respect of this group but in respect of the group
                further down the list, and particularly the group of amendments
                on committees. I ask Members to speak to the number of
                amendments that they can reasonably deal with in
                10&nbsp;minutes. We must try to be reasonable on these matters.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr P Robinson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thank you for that ruling, Mr&nbsp;Initial
                Presiding Officer.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The first amendment in my name in this group
                relates to the issue of the quorum, and refers to the loss of a
                quorum during a debate and the possible adjournment of the
                Assembly. I leave myself open to advice from the joint Chairmen
                or any members of the Committee, but as I understand it, a
                Member could wait for some time to bring a matter that is
                important at least to him, to the Assembly only to find that it
                is not of the same importance to others who leave the Member
                almost alone in the Chamber. The quorum is lost, and Members are
                not interested in returning to the Chamber. Is the business lost
                or can the Member have his day when the Assembly resumes?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I suspect that a quorum will not be a problem
                for the four major parties as each of them is capable of
                providing a quorum, and can do so when they have an interest in
                the business. It will be more difficult for smaller parties that
                could not provide a quorum and could be denied the opportunity
                to deal with an issue. A similar principle is dealt with in a
                later amendment to Standing Order 16, which is a delaying motion
                when a motion is made for the adjournment of a debate. In that
                case the adjournment is caused not by the loss of a quorum, but
                through the Question being put. That would be a mechanism that a
                party or parties could use to avoid a vote during the life of
                the Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">People who bring a motion or subject to the
                Assembly have the right to have it decided, irrespective of
                whether it is decided in their favour. They have a right to a
                determination, and it is necessary for us to ensure that the
                Standing Orders clearly provide the right of Members to have a
                vote and to have the time to make their case. The aim of those
                two amendments is to ensure that if the House is adjourned for
                one reason or another, its first business at its next sitting is
                the business that was adjourned. That might make less likely the
                use of procedure as a device to curtail debate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The next amendment deals with public
                business, and I am again open to advice from the members of the
                Committee. I assume that we attach some importance to the role
                of statutory committees. We would consider their reports to be
                of such significance that they would be included in public
                business along with stages of Bills and notices of motion. That
                is a simple, tidying amendment to include statutory committee
                reports.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.45 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members may consider that the reports from
                other Committees should also be included. I have not considered
                that, but the Standing Orders Committee may wish to consider it
                at a later stage.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The next amendment affects Standing
                Order&nbsp;15(4). I suggest simply taking out the last two
                words, which indicate that one can only withdraw an amendment
                during debate. An amendment is usually withdrawn at the end of a
                debate, and my proposed amendment would simply have the effect
                of allowing a Member to withdraw an amendment before a Division
                was called.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My amendment to Standing Order&nbsp;16(2)
                takes away the right of the Speaker to make proposals. The
                Speaker simply puts a Question; he does not propose it. I was
                pleased to hear that you, Sir, when explaining the various
                amendments, encouraged everyone to support Standing
                Order&nbsp;26. I think his exact remarks were &quot;you can only
                approve of 26 once&quot;, and I hope that Members follow his
                advice. So my amendment to 16(2) would have the effect of
                replacing &quot;propose&quot; with &quot;put&quot;, and that
                part of the Standing Order would then read &quot;decline to put
                the Question&quot;. There is a similar drafting amendment to be
                found later on.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The next amendment deals with statements. The
                Committee spent some time considering the amount of time to be
                allowed for questions on statements. As it stands, the Speaker
                must allow questions on a statement for up to one&nbsp;hour if
                there are Members still wanting to ask questions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Speaker must be given some discretion in
                this matter. My amendments would introduce two changes. The
                first amendment would have the effect of allowing questions to
                last for no more than one&nbsp;hour, and the second would allow
                the Speaker discretion to curtail the amount of time subject to
                the content of the statement. If it were a statement of
                substance, the Speaker would determine that it was a matter on
                which questions should last for as much of an hour as Members
                needed for the matters to be elucidated. The Speaker might
                determine that a statement was not a matter of such importance
                as to warrant the full hour.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the moment there are proposals for
                10&nbsp;Departments as well as the central Department. Each of
                the Ministers could decide, over his cornflakes, to make a
                statement that day, and we could therefore have ten statements
                being made in any one day. Do Members really want to have
                ten&nbsp;hours of questions? No is the answer to that. There
                must be some discretion on the part of the Speaker to deal with
                that matter in a way that would reflect the wishes of the House
                and the importance of the statements being made. I expect that
                the Executive Committee will organise its business so that we do
                not have ten statements on one day, but if the Assembly is only
                going to have two sitting days in the one week, we could still
                have, on a very frequent basis, a number of statements on any
                one day.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The next amendment relates to Standing
                Order&nbsp;18(5). I have decided, in Churchillian fashion, that
                this is something up with which I shall not put. As the Standing
                Order ends with a preposition, I am suggesting a change to
                correct the grammar.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are only two amendments that I have not
                touched on. The Standing Orders do not put any requirement upon
                a Minister to respond to an Adjournment debate. There is a
                general view in the Assembly that if a Member takes the trouble
                to bring forward an issue of importance to him, and perhaps to
                others, the relevant Minister of the Northern&nbsp;Ireland
                Executive should have an allocated time slot in which to
                respond. I suggest 10&nbsp;minutes, but I am not hard and fast
                on that. That amendment is put forward on the basis that a
                Minister should have the right to respond to issues concerning
                his or her departmental responsibilities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, and very briefly, I will touch on
                the matter of questions being placed. As the Standing Orders
                stand, questions will be taken in the order in which they are
                put down. This practice did not serve us well in another place
                because Government Ministers ensured that all their
                Back-Benchers placed questions down immediately, leaving them
                with a friendly set of questions. Were questions to be decided
                by ballot, held by the Clerk or the Speaker, that would be fair
                to every Member.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The First Minister (Designate):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While we have not completely settled our
                mind, and consultations are continuing, we are favourably
                disposed to most of the amendments that
                Mr&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;Robinson has dealt with.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">By way of contrast, the amendments in my name
                were put down to enable me to make some points about the times
                at which we should be sitting. I do not intend to press any of
                them to a Division. They were tabled in the spirit, as is often
                the case on these occasions, of running a flag up the pole to
                see who salutes it. Very few people saluted these four
                amendments and that was the case even among my friends around
                me.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do, however, have an important couple of
                points to make which I wish to press on Members. With regard to
                the sitting times in the House, I believe that a serious mistake
                is being made, and I expect that in a few months’ time we will
                have to come back to this issue and look at it again.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It may be thought superficially attractive to
                have sitting hours that correspond to working hours, but that
                does not work. It is not practical. Members need to consider
                that if the Chamber is sitting from 10.30&nbsp;am to
                6.00&nbsp;pm and that if there is serious business in the
                Chamber between those times, the likelihood is that they will be
                engaged for some or most of that time in the Chamber. If they
                are so engaged, when are they going to do their work? And there
                is work to be done outside the Chamber.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That work involves constituency work,
                research, reading and thinking. Some of it can be done in the
                evenings, but how much? Research work and preparation requires
                access to materials and that material may not always be
                available in the evening at home. It may be that Members will
                need time for that other than in the evening.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Then there are those who will have other
                responsibilities, whether as Committee chairman, vice-chairman
                or Ministers — when are they going to work if the Chamber is
                sitting from 10.30&nbsp;am to 6.00&nbsp;pm? They cannot
                administer their offices during the evening unless Civil Service
                hours are changed radically, and that might involve a fair
                amount of overtime.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So there is a serious point here because
                while the affairs of the Chamber are extremely important, they
                are only a part of the work that a Member has to do. It is for
                this reason that almost all deliberative and legislative bodies
                sit in the afternoon and evening, not the morning. Mornings are
                required for work, and if Members do not have the mornings for
                work, there is a problem.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Even the larger parties have problems,
                particularly in relation to group meetings: if they had to begin
                before 10.30&nbsp;am, that would obviously limit the numbers
                able to attend. This is not a problem for small parties; nor is
                it a problem for those parties that run on the Führerprinzip,
                where everybody does what the Leader says, irrespective of
                circumstances. But not all parties are like that. There is a
                serious point there too.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a not-so-serious point but, equally,
                it is not an insubstantial one. One of the consequences of an
                Assembly, legislative body or parliament’s sitting in the
                evening is the growth of a degree of esprit de corps among its
                members that would not happen were the sittings to be limited to
                daytime.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I know the objection that will be made to the
                argument I am putting forward, and I have been told that it was
                made in the Standing Orders Committee. Members have said that
                they want family-friendly sitting hours. That argument is also
                wrong. It is the mornings and afternoons that are needed for
                those with young children, not the evenings. When Members use
                the expression &quot;family friendly&quot; they really mean that
                they want their evenings free for their own social lives, not
                for families and children. People who enter public life must
                realise that they do so at the sacrifice of their social life.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am interested to know what exactly the
                First Minister’s children do in the evenings that they do not

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The First Minister (Designate) has said that
                he needed to see his children in the mornings and the
                afternoons, but what happens to their schooling?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The First Minister (Designate):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was making a very simple point which I
                thought Mrs Bell would understand. Young children need parental
                care in the mornings and afternoons rather than the evenings.
                With older children, of course, parental care is demonstrated in
                other ways.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I return to the primary point that I made
                earlier. Work has to be done outside this Chamber, and the
                sittings of this Chamber have to be organised with that in mind.
                That is why similar bodies have tended towards sitting in the
                afternoons and evenings. The pattern of sitting from 10.30am to
                6.00pm has not been a problem with the Assembly only sitting
                intermittently, but it will be a problem in the future when the
                Assembly will be sitting on a regular basis. In time those who
                do not see substance of my present argument will come to
                appreciate that this is a matter that we will have to return to.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wanted to make that argument and to share
                with Members some of the reasons why experience has led other
                bodies to sit at the times they do. Experience will also have an
                impact on what we do in the future. However, I shall not be
                pressing these amendments to a Division. From my soundings, I
                have already gathered that the House would be against them.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs E Bell:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are a few people who would like to
                comment on the First Minister’s proposals.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, I take on board what has been said
                about the pressure of business and, as time goes on, about the
                extension of that. However, we should establish the principle of
                having hours that will help us both in our professional life and
                in our family life.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With all due respect, I do not feel that
                Westminster is necessarily an example which we should follow.
                Many of the Members at Westminster have flats or town houses. We
                do not, and most Members here travel to and from their homes. I
                understand that at one of the earliest meetings of the Committee
                on Standing Orders there was very little dissent — apart from
                Ulster Unionist Members — when it was proposed that we should
                operate according to the current timetable, with, perhaps, a
                slightly different starting time. The plan was to see how these
                hours suited the House and to review them in due course, if
                necessary.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I can be as friendly with people during the
                day as I can during the evening, so I do not think that that
                represents an argument in favour of a change. Also, if the House
                sits from 10.30 am, I have time to do a considerable amount of
                work, including housework, before I come in, so I do not think
                that that is a serious argument either.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I appreciate what the First Minister
                (Designate) is saying about the workload that we will have, but
                I feel that we should try to operate a system that is both
                family-friendly and profession-friendly. I will not support this
                change.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Morrice:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I endorse what Mrs Bell has said, and I thank
                the First Minister (Designate) for deciding not to push this
                point. The fact that we have agreed to suspend sittings at 6.00
                pm is of great importance to a number of us. This is not just of
                benefit to people with families — men as well as women — but
                also more suitable for Members who have to travel considerable
                distances. Those with journeys of one-and-a-half to two hours
                will not get home until after midnight if we do not stop until
                10.30 pm.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As Mrs&nbsp;Bell said, we can be friendly
                with our colleagues during daylight hours, not just in the
                evening. It is important that we move into the modern world. I
                said earlier that the Scottish Parliament would be following our
                lead. These old-fashioned times are for the dinosaurs.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The First Minister (Designate) asks where
                that is. I got the impression that he had consigned
                responsibility for the care of his children to the lady of the
                house. Many people, in the modern world, would consider that to
                be sexist and to have overtones of male chauvinism.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, I have some sympathy for what the
                First Minister (Designate) has said. Anyone who is involved in
                public life, in Government, or in the work of the Assembly, is
                involved in a public duty. Such public duty, from time to time,
                calls for sacrifices in our domestic lives. Members of the
                Assembly who are also Members of the House of Commons will know
                that. Members, such as Mr Hume and Mr&nbsp;Paisley, who are also
                Members of the European Parliament have sacrificed a great deal
                of their domestic lives to public service.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The First Minister (Designate) has a point
                when he says that there is much business to be conducted in
                addition to attendance in the Chamber. I think that we should
                have a trial period for the times given in the proposed Standing
                Orders, whether they be family-friendly or not, to see if they
                are suitable. The First Minister (Designate) has agreed not to
                pursue this issue at this stage. Many Members may well have
                grave reservations as to whether these times will be suitable in
                practice.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those who have spoken about the long
                distances travelled by some Members should bear in mind that
                many Members of Parliament have to be away from their families
                from Monday to Friday.</p>

                see your family for three or four days a week — this might
                even apply to the Member for South Down. We must accept that, if
                we are involved in public service and have decided to put other
                things to one side, there will be a certain degree of domestic
                inconvenience.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Domestic arrangements should be met to a
                degree, but it would be entirely foolish to make the work of the
                Assembly subservient to whether a Member could get home by
                6.30&nbsp;pm to make her husband’s tea or, in the case of a
                male Member, to do his share of the ironing. <i>[Interruption]</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But let me return to a serious note. Being
                engaged in public service makes demands upon all of us in our
                private, social and domestic lives. It is impossible to organise
                public business entirely around the hours that would be
                convenient and suitable.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As the First Minister (Designate) has
                suggested — and he is not pushing this — Members should give
                this a run but keep it under very careful observation to see
                whether it works. If it does not work, Members will have to
                revisit the issue.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The First Minister (Designate) has decided
                not to push this issue to a vote having taken some soundings. I
                suspect that these were taken among his party as well as other
                parties. My Colleagues and I have noted that this has become a
                bit of a habit — his finding difficulty in getting support
                from his party for some of the things that he has been
                proposing. I suppose he did not want to embark on another round
                of letter-writing to give assurances.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to comment on the argument put forward
                that if Members wish to stop the sittings of the House at
                6.00&nbsp;pm it is to allow Members to enjoy an extended social
                life, get away from work and have a jolly old time. I do not
                know about the First Minister (Designate), but most Members who
                represent inner-city constituencies — and I suspect other
                areas are no different — will find that when they leave here
                at 6.00&nbsp;pm on a Monday or Tuesday, they are not going home
                immediately or to enjoy social life.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In areas of extensive redevelopment there are
                housing and community groups, and other activities as well,
                which can only be accommodated in the evening. That is the only
                time when constituents who are working during the day are
                available. I wish to dispel the idea that by adjourning the
                House at 6.00&nbsp;pm, Members are then free. That is not the
                case, and if Members were to continue until 8 pm, some very
                important constituency duties could not be carried out.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members must be careful not to regard this
                place as a kind of ivory tower where they are increasingly cut
                off from their constituents. The time here must be arranged to
                allow Members to do the things which are important to their
                constituents.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The First Minister (Designate) asked when the
                work was going to be done if Members started at 10.30&nbsp;am.
                He wondered how time could be found for reading, thinking and
                constituency work — especially if holding ministerial office.
                There are three other days in the week when the Assembly will
                not be sitting full-time. Committees may be meeting, but there
                are three days to fit this work in. If Members have research or
                other work to do, or constituents to see, this is more easily
                fitted into an evening. So I am not sure that his argument about
                needing time in the morning for this sort of work is valid. We
                discussed this in the Committee, and I do not think that there
                was any great division in the Committee at that stage.</p>

                business and other potential means of remuneration outside the

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That was a point which was made at that time.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would make one last point about
                flexibility. What happens if Government business runs on? The
                Committee has already allowed for this in the Standing Orders.
                Standing Orders&nbsp;10(2) and 10(3) provide for an extension of
                time into Tuesday evening, Wednesday, or both if business cannot
                be completed in the allocated time. The flexibility is there. We
                are mindful that there may well be occasions when the pressure
                of business will require the House to sit that bit longer, and
                that is a much more sensible way of facilitating that need.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was also felt that the sitting hours
                should be as flexible as possible to allow people with families
                to have some time in the evening with their families. All in
                all, the kind of compromise we have reached on timing is a
                reasonable way to order the business of the House and to give
                Members the flexibility they need to do their duties to their
                constituents inside and outside the Assembly.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Loth as I am to speak against the wishes of
                the First Minister (Designate), I am minded to agree with the
                remarks made by the hon Member for East Belfast and also by my
                Colleagues from North Down. It may well be that in reviewing
                these arrangements in the future we may find that there is a
                better way forward and that there are hours which would suit us
                better. For the moment I am very much persuaded by the views
                which have been put forward already with regard to timing.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a degree of flexibility in the hours
                we have agreed. Ministers will have full days at work during the
                days, two of which will be Committee days, when plenary sessions
                are not taking place. I assume, and Members may correct me, that
                Ministers will not sit on Committees. Not only will they not
                chair Committees, or be Deputy Chairmen, they will not be
                sitting on them either. Thus Government Ministers’ time will
                be freed up during that period.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to the timings of plenary
                sittings, it has been suggested that one of the days might run
                from 2.00 pm to 8.00 pm. As has been indicated by Members, there
                is a great deal of pressure on them to attend meetings in their
                constituencies in the evenings if they are to service their
                constituents in a proper fashion.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Groups of constituents are not usually
                available during the day. Some people are able to meet Members
                during the day, but quite often the most convenient time for a
                group to meet you in connection with a planning issue or an
                education or housing matter is in the evening. If we are in the
                Assembly until 8.00 pm it will be very difficult for Members to
                attend such meetings, and particularly difficult for those whose
                constituencies are a long way from Belfast. Members who face a
                one-and-a-half-hour drive, or in some cases a two-hour drive to
                the most far-flung parts of the Province, will not reach their
                constituencies until 9.30 pm or 10.00&nbsp;pm. It would be
                almost impossible for them to attend any meetings during the
                evenings of those days.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.15 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A six o’clock close would allow people,
                including those who live a long way from Stormont, to get home
                and attend those meetings. The proposal for the times to be
                11.30 am to 7.30 pm would afford some opportunity for group
                meetings, but there is a danger that whenever a group was not in
                session, and things were only starting at 11.30 am that that
                would be, to some extent, a waste of the morning. It would be
                difficult for ordinary Members to get much work done. There is
                clearly a point in the suggestion that it would enable Ministers
                to perform their functions, but there is enough flexibility in
                that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When the Assembly goes ‘live’, about 90%
                of its Members will not be Ministers. We have to think of the
                work to be done by the Back-Benchers, not just the Ministers —
                and I speak as someone who is likely to remain a Back-Bencher
                for the foreseeable future. <i>[Laughter]</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The hours that have been put forward are
                sensible; they are, at least, worth trying, although I note the
                concerns of the First Minister (Designate) who obviously has a
                lot more parliamentary experience than the majority of us.<i>
                [Laughter]</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Obviously some have not been persuaded by my
                argument.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am glad to see that the matter is not being
                pressed to the vote. As someone who was on the Standing Orders
                Committee and agreed these hours, I think they represent a
                sensible and flexible way forward. This is probably true of a
                number of rules, but if we find, six months down the line, that
                this system is not working, that it would be better to have more
                evening meetings, the procedures can be reviewed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unlike some of the other Standing Orders,
                where there would, arguably, be some contention between
                individual parties, this is something which, I think, is
                non-political in that sense. If we find that the system is not
                working for the benefit of constituents and in the best
                interests of the Assembly, it can be reviewed very easily and
                adjustments made. But as it is, the proposals contained in the
                current Standing Orders are adequate and flexible enough, and I
                am glad that the amendment will not be —</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Hussey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thought the Member was drawing to a close.
                Another factor that has to be taken on board and one that no one
                has mentioned is Members’ safety. Following a long journey
                here and a day’s work, a Member can be tired when returning to
                his or her constituency. Those of us who live in the west find
                that travelling home can be quite dangerous. That should be
                taken into account; when we are returning home, we should be
                doing so in a reasonably fresh condition.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Weir:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I live in the east of the Province and have
                the good fortune to live relatively close to Stormont — about
                half an hour’s drive away — so I have not encountered this
                problem directly. However, Members who represent the Greater
                Belfast area ought to behave in an altruistic fashion and
                realise that Members who come from the west and, indeed, the
                north and south of the Province, will have lengthy drives. They
                should try to avoid situations in which, late at night, their
                safety is endangered.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree with Mr Hussey’s point. There is a
                wide range of issues which would persuade me and the vast
                majority of others in this Chamber that the proposals, as
                currently outlined in the report represent the best way forward.
                They can be reviewed later, but at the moment, I am glad that
                these amendments are not being put to the vote.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dodds:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to deal first with
                amendment&nbsp;No&nbsp;27. This is a sensible amendment, in
                keeping with the thoughts of the members of the Standing Orders
                Committee. It was the Committee’s view that if Adjournment
                debates were to be worthwhile, a response from a Minister was
                essential.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the difficulties we currently have is
                that while we have provision for an Adjournment debate, it is
                very much a case of speaking into the ether. No one takes any
                notice of what the Member is saying, because there is nobody of
                any authority to answer the points being made, although as
                Mr&nbsp;Wells pointed out earlier the relevant local newspaper
                will, no doubt, get a copy of his speech within a very short
                time. It is sensible, and it certainly accords with the view of
                the Standing Orders Committee that a Ministerial response should
                be required at the end of the Adjournment debate. I do not know
                why the Standing Orders did not reflect that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is a very sensible amendment, and it
                should not be left to a Minister’s discretion to decide if he
                wishes to reply to such a debate — the relevant Minister
                should be required to do so. I also want to deal with amendments
                31 and 32, which relate to ministerial statements, as raised by
                Mr&nbsp;P&nbsp;Robinson, about the time that could be used up if
                a large number of Ministerial statements were to be put forward
                for the same sitting.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This was also the subject of debate in the
                Standing Orders Committee. Indeed, one of the initial drafts
                suggested that a Ministerial statement would be followed by a
                debate, but it was, quite rightly, thought that would be
                improper because many Members would only have received notice of
                the statement when the Minister stood up or a short time before
                that. The Committee debated the question of how much time should
                be devoted to follow-up from the ministerial statement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the case of some statements, you would
                certainly want to use up a full hour, but for others you might
                not wish to do so. It may be that, out of courtesy, the Minister
                will wish to draw something to Members’ attention, but it
                would not be sensible to use up a full hour’s business. The
                Member should be given discretion, and it should be made clear
                that he has no more than one hour. As it stands at the moment,
                it is normally one hour.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In relation to amendment&nbsp;34, we have
                provision dealing with the adjournment of the Assembly in the
                Standing Orders, and it is clear under draft Standing Order 10
                that an adjournment of the Assembly shall mean an adjournment
                until the next sitting day unless the Assembly, on a motion made
                by a Member of the Executive, after notice, has ordered an
                adjournment to some other definite date.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The point we are dealing with is to do with
                the adjournment of a debate. It would be wrong and an
                infringement of Members’ rights if that debate could be
                adjourned and adjourned for some time. We have built-in
                provisions which deal with the adjournment of the Assembly.
                Clearly, if it is adjourned then it will resume at the point at
                which it left off when it next sits. But if a motion has been
                tabled, and there is a debate on it, the Standing Orders should
                make it clear that that simply cannot be done away with by some
                tactic.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Regarding the amendment standing in the name
                of the First Minister (Designate) — and I welcome the fact,
                like the Member who spoke earlier that these are not going to be
                pressed to a vote — the Standing Orders Committee considered
                this issue a number of times. When it first came up, most
                parties agreed that we should at least aim for this sort of
                timescale, starting in the morning and ending early in the
                evening. It was brought to the attention of the Standing Orders
                Committee that the Chief Whip of the Ulster Unionist Party
                wanted to have the sort of hours that have been shown in these
                amendments in the name of the First Minister (Designate). There
                was no support for that from any quarter in the Standing Orders
                Committee.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am somewhat surprised that they even appear
                on the Order Paper. I have some sympathy with some of the
                initial arguments advanced by the First Minister (Designate)
                with regard to how we manage our business and how the work might
                progress. If we see that there is a need to change because of
                the requirements of the Assembly then certainly the matter can
                be placed before the Committee on Procedures which will continue
                to consider and review the procedures and Standing Orders.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The First Minister (Designate) was on
                altogether more dicey ground when he started into the whole
                question of family time. He seemed to be suggesting that after
                6.30 pm Members go off to socialise or advocating that we spend
                more time at home in the mornings and afternoons, which was
                either an argument for people not going out to work at all or an
                argument for keeping your kids off school. His arguments did not
                seem to stack up. We should, in the interests of this House and
                the management of the work of this House, keep that subject
                matter under review.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We should try, if at all possible, to make
                the suggested hours work. It is in the interests of most Members
                with families to try to stick to them. Mr&nbsp;Wilson’s points
                in relation to the workload of Members was a case in point.
                Bearing in mind these points, most of the amendments that are
                going to be moved on the Floor are ones that many of us who are
                members of the Standing Orders Committee would have no
                difficulty with.</p>

                6 o’clock to grab something to eat before reporting for duty
                at 6.30 pm, and then working from 6.30 pm to 3&nbsp;o’clock in
                the morning. Then I was going home to get up at 7 o’clock the
                next day to go to work again. There were many men working with
                me who were doing the same thing. There were men who worked
                12-hour shifts in Shorts, and then put in eight&nbsp;hours duty
                in the evenings as well. There are a lot of people who —</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I was listening to the Member I was
                thinking, as many other Members must have, that we are doing
                much the same thing. As Mr McCartney said when one takes on a
                position one takes it on as a matter of duty. That applies to a
                job or to a Member’s commitment to the Assembly, and we did
                take that into account. The Member may not have meant to but he
                did sound quite patronising.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dalton:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My apologies if the Member felt that I was
                being patronising. I was simply making the point that outside of
                this place there are a number of people who, for reasons of
                their work or family commitments, have to work unsociable hours.
                It is a bit rich for the Assembly to decide that we would rather
                work more social hours so that we can have the evenings
                available. If we choose to use them for constituency business,
                that is fine. Many people do.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, it does not seem unreasonable for us
                to consider that we leave the mornings available for work in
                this House in order that Ministers and those who hold positions
                can carry out those functions. We work through the day and into
                the evening on two days of the week and leave ourselves three
                evenings for constituency business. That seems a perfectly
                reasonable proposal to me.</p>

                overly concern myself with because I do not have a family. Apart
                from feeding the cat, I do not have a heavy domestic burden. The
                points made by Mr McCartney were relevant. Taking on a public
                position, taking on a position in the Assembly, is a
                responsibility that Members choose to accept, and if they choose
                to accept that responsibility, there is going to be a burden
                upon their domestic lives. Clearly, in this community, that has
                been a burden that has gone beyond merely domestic life for many
                years. We have accepted that burden; we chose to come here, to
                put ourselves up for election. If Members would prefer more
                social hours, let them take another job.</p>

                have difficulties in the future in that domain. Children are as

                responsibility and one that every person should think carefully
                about before taking on. But that does not detract from the point
                I am making that, in taking up a position in public life, a
                person is accepting additional responsibilities that will have
                an impact upon his family and domestic circumstances.</p>

                Committee. Clearly Adjournment debates in this place have been
                relatively ineffective — one speaks into thin air or gets one’s
                press release into the local papers. For an Adjournment debate
                to be worthwhile, the appropriate Minister must be present in
                the Chamber.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members, especially Back-Bench Members who
                will not always get the chance to address their concerns to the
                appropriate Minister, can direct those concerns to the Minister
                responsible and ask for a reply. That is extremely important for
                those Members who have vital, pressing constituency concerns or
                other concerns that they have specialist knowledge in. I do
                welcome that particular amendment from Mr&nbsp;P&nbsp;Robinson.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Most of the other amendments seem to be
                corrections of various mistakes or grammatical errors that the
                Committee has made. It is unfortunate that
                Mr&nbsp;P&nbsp;Robinson was not on the Committee and could have
                pointed those out as we went along. We live and learn.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr A Maginness:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For the record, the SDLP supports the draft
                Standing Orders that deal with the present hours. We believe
                that these hours are family-friendly. We also believe that in
                relation to travelling, for many of our Members, we are putting
                an extra burden on them if they have to leave the Assembly at a
                late hour. Members have many duties in their constituencies at
                night-time.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is not appropriate to compare what happens
                here with what happens at Westminster. Many Members of the
                Westminster Parliament go to London and stay for three or four
                days. It is impossible for them to leave Westminster and go back
                to their constituencies on a daily basis unless they live in the
                greater London area. The circumstances that prevail at
                Westminster are quite different from those that prevail here. As
                a new institution we should strive to set standards that have
                not been set by Westminster or by other parliamentary
                institutions in Europe or throughout the world. We should try to
                set a new standard by which we can afford family-friendly hours
                to our Members.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another important point is that, although the
                Chamber is predominantly male, one hopes that in the future we
                will have an increase in the number of female Members.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While I emphasise that the hours we have are
                family-friendly, favourable not only to female Members but also
                to fathers like myself, it makes it easier for people with young
                families to come into politics and to be Members of this
                institution. There is flexibility within our Standing Orders,
                certainly on Tuesdays, and also on Wednesdays if necessary, to
                extend the period for debates and plenary sessions. There is a
                safeguard within the draft Standing Orders to assist us.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Leslie:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does the Member agree that if the hours were
                extended into Wednesday, it would obviate the argument that has
                been made that as long as the business is conducted in two days,
                there are three days left for other business? Extending into
                Wednesday would be an unsatisfactory trade-off, and Tuesday
                evening is to be preferred.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr A Maginness:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am grateful to the Member for his
                intervention. The context in which I said that we could go into
                Wednesday was as a safeguard, increasing the flexibility of
                sittings. It would not be taken lightly, and it would not
                automatically follow. It is a safeguard which gives the Assembly
                extra flexibility to cope with situations that may arise from
                time to time.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The important thing is for the Assembly to be
                innovative. The Scottish Parliament will also be addressing the
                issue of family-friendly hours. We should set an example for
                other institutions. We should support the present situation and
                the draft produced by the Standing Orders Committee. If in the
                future we find that the hours are not working out, we can
                revisit this, as we can revisit any of the other Standing
                Orders. For the time being, my party and I believe that we
                should support this.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr C Wilson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, Mr Initial Presiding
                Officer. We are engaged in important work here today on the
                Standing Orders, but I wonder if Members are aware, and whether
                it would affect their enthusiasm for the matters before us if
                they were, that the Secretary of State has decreed in Dublin
                today that she intends to operate d’Hondt on the 29th of this
                month and thereby push this process to destruction if necessary
                —</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Initial Presiding Officer:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is not a point of order. It may be very
                interesting to Members, but it is not a point of order.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I believe that Mr Robinson, when he spoke
                earlier, referred to all his amendments in this group save one
                — No 26. I will call him now in case he wishes to speak to
                that, but before doing so, I wish to make two references to the
                draft before us. One concerns a typographical error: &quot;a
                petition shall related&quot; should be &quot;a petition shall
                relate&quot;.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The second concerns a matter on which I am
                seeking advice. It might be better if the amendment were to say</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;within the legal competence of the
                Assembly as defined by exception in section 6(2)&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">rather than simply &quot;as defined&quot;,
                because section 6(2) of the Act defines by listing the
                exceptions — that is to say, those things that are not within
                the competence. That does not create any problems for our
                considering it or for our voting upon it, because we already
                have something of a catch-all rewrite clause in the first
                amendment to the report. In order to ensure that we are legally
                correct, I am taking advice on the matter.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr P Robinson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am quite content with that. As I have
                already mentioned to some Members, most of these were drafted
                either on a flight to or from London at the weekend. Section
                6(2) deals with excepted matters but does not include reserved
                matters which should not be the subject of petitions either.
                Your advice is sound.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is a fairly matter-of-fact amendment
                simply to take account of the fact that nobody should be
                entitled to petition the Assembly on a matter over which the
                Assembly does not have any power. That may be our working
                practice, but it will make matters much easier for Members who
                will undoubtedly be asked to present petitions on all sorts of
                issues, some of which may be security related. I was asked today
                to sign one which I suspect may be outside the Assembly’s
                competence. There will be a series of issues, and it is better
                to be able to give the clear answer that it is not within the
                competence of a Member to bring a petition of that nature to the
                Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I trust that the amendment, as redirected,
                can be approved. I have one comment on the amendments in the
                name of the First Minister (Designate). I hope that the
                Committee is right in its judgement. I fear that he is right,
                and I rather suspect that he will be able to smile broadly at
                some later stage when we shall undoubtedly have to revisit the
                issue. We will not get it right first time, but if it is
                possible to work on what seems to me to be the most appropriate
                basis, we should do that. Let us see if it works while
                recognising that we may have to revisit this issue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must also appreciate that constituency
                Members have other duties. I have no doubt that it is not
                because Ulster Unionist Members want to lie in bed on a Monday
                morning that the amendment was tabled. I think that there are
                genuine reasons for it and that in the fullness of time many of
                us will have to accept them.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We move to the third set of amendments. The
                first of these is No&nbsp;83, which stands in the name of
                Mr&nbsp;Peter Robinson.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr P Robinson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This amendment, if moved, would have the
                purpose of inserting after paragraph&nbsp;(2) of Standing
                Order&nbsp;25 the following new paragraph:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;the election of the First Minister and
                Deputy First Minister shall require parallel consent.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The amendment relates to a matter concerning
                the election system that is operating in the Assembly. At least
                three mechanisms are employed — parallel consent, the issue of
                cross-community support and the simple majority. I felt that it
                was important to have the definition of the two less-well-known
                voting procedures included in Standing Orders.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During the debate on the motion to take note
                of the report, one of the joint Chairmen said that the Committee
                would consider producing a consolidated document covering all
                the matters relating to the Assembly. Therefore it might be
                appropriate not to move amendment No&nbsp;83, and leave it to
                the Committee to work on as part of its consolidation. It deals
                with one of the areas in which the parallel consent mechanism
                will operate, but as Mr McFarland has pointed out privately to
                me, that would take the issue of the election of the First
                Minister and Deputy First Minister out of its proper sequential
                position in the Standing Orders.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am quite content not to move this amendment
                unless there is any strong feeling that I should.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to move the amendments which include
                definitions of cross-community support and parallel consent, as
                set out in the Northern Ireland Act&nbsp;1998 and, indeed, in
                the Belfast Agreement. There was a heading for amendment No 23,
                which deals with crosscommunity support, just as there is for
                amendment No 50, which deals with parallel consent. This simply
                reflects the way that it would be set out in the Standing
                Orders.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is also an error in amendment
                No&nbsp;25 as set out on the Marshalled List. The reference to
                Standing Order 26(b) should be to Standing Order 26(2)(b)&quot;.
                I consider Standing Order 26(2)(b) —</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Campbell:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Or not to be.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr P Robinson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It may not be.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sub-paragraph (b) is unnecessary because
                paragraph (2)(a) allows the Speaker to determine whether there
                is sufficient agreement in the Assembly for a Division to be
                called. If it is not possible for parties to provide two
                Tellers, clearly there will not be a Division.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have seen from proceedings to date that
                there will not be a Division unless Members force one. Some
                Members said &quot;No&quot; in votes on amendments, but we did
                not get to the stage where the Initial Presiding Officer felt it
                necessary to call a Division. Likewise, when Members from one of
                the smaller parties feel that they would like to have their
                views on a particular matter recorded, it is quite likely that
                the Speaker, under the terms of paragraph&nbsp;(2)(b), would
                decide that there is no need for a Division, as the number of
                Members calling for it is so small.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, if we remove sub-paragraph (b),
                smaller parties will be able to force Divisions, as long as they
                can nominate Tellers. That seems appropriate in instances where
                they feel strongly about a particular issue. The removal of this
                sub-paragraph would not reduce the effectiveness of the Assembly
                in that regard, and the Speaker would still have considerable
                discretion in cases where parties cannot nominate the necessary
                Tellers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those are the only issues I wish to raise on
                this group of amendments.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Haughey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The SDLP is prepared to support amendment No
                83, even though it might be regarded as superfluous. Mr Robinson
                referred to the fact that I said that we would probably produce
                a consolidated compendium of Standing Orders, incorporating not
                only the Standing Orders agreed here, but also the relevant
                sections of the Northern Ireland Act 1998 and of the agreement.
                If the Member who moved the amendment is happy to withdraw it,
                we would be content with that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to amendment No&nbsp;25, we have
                some reservations about the withdrawal of Standing
                Order&nbsp;26(2)(b). We would oppose that.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McFarland:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am slightly concerned because there are
                three areas, and Mr Robinson has referred to them already —
                amendments 83, 23 and 50 — which repeat sections of the Act.
                As I understand it — and I am a late arrival to the Standing
                Orders Committee — the policy of the Standing Orders Committee
                is clear, and the whole set of Standing Orders is predicated on
                the understanding that areas of the Act are not repeated in the
                Standing Orders, except on very specific occasions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If that policy were to be changed it could
                have a knock-on effect right through the Standing Orders. If the
                Member was willing to withdraw those three areas and allow the
                Standing Orders Committee to re-examine whether there are areas
                of the Act that need to go into the Standing Orders, that would
                be a slightly more satisfactory option than voting today.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dodds:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members have seen today how the initial
                Standing Orders are operating given that we have to vote by
                recorded vote. Many Members who are on councils know that that
                is the way that voting operates, but it is not very
                satisfactory. It is a long, drawn-out process. The type of
                voting system set forth in Standing Orders 24 to 26 will mark a
                major improvement in terms of voting by Division and going
                through the Lobbies. It will be a much more efficient system,
                and it is modelled very closely on what happens in other places.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, the Standing Orders Committee did
                say — I am sure that the Chairmen will back me up on this —
                that the question of voting systems would be looked at again,
                given the advances in technology. Again this is an issue which
                we will leave to see how it works in practice, but I am sure
                that it will be a major advance on the current system.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I raised the matter of 26(2)(b) with
                officials because I, like Mr Robinson, was concerned that it
                might be unnecessary and might be used against small parties —
                indeed, any party — which wanted to force a Division in order
                to have a vote recorded. The Speaker might use this power to
                deny that opportunity to parties. If parties want their vote to
                be recorded, that should be their right. For example, in
                councils if one member demands a recorded vote, the vote is
                recorded. Therefore in a legislative body a party should have
                the right to insist that its votes be recorded. That is
                essentially why the proposal is being made in relation to
                26(2)(b).</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Amendment No 24, in Mr Robinson’s name,
                relates to a petition of concern. The Standing Orders Committee
                had included this Standing Order, but it is in the wrong place.
                If Members look at Standing Order 53(5) as drafted in the
                compendium of Standing Orders, they will find that the Standing
                Order has been placed there. Members agreed that there should be
                a Standing Order in relation to a petition of concern.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I think it was Mr Farren of the SDLP who said
                that he wanted to come back to this issue. Members looked at
                this Standing Order and agreed the text of it, but it has
                somehow ended up in 53(5), which deals with equality. However,
                it is a much more general Standing Order. Therefore what Mr
                Robinson is proposing, quite rightly, is to take it out of the
                equality section and put it into the voting section where it
                belongs.</p>
                <i>

                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As far as the other matters are concerned,
                this is a repeat of what is in the Act. I heard what
                Mr&nbsp;McFarland has said, and this is clearly a matter which
                the Assembly can decide. It is something that might be more
                sensible to have complete, in that sense, when we are dealing
                with voting. But it is a matter for the Assembly to decide.
                These are important provisions, and the section on voting will
                mark a major improvement in the way that work is carried out in
                the Assembly.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The point relating to the petition of concern
                is to some extent well-made. Does it not follow that there is no
                need for the petition of concern in the equality section, in
                which it now appears, because it is couched in the general terms
                which are required for its general application to our
                proceedings? If this amendment were adopted, would this Standing

                indicated that we had taken from section&nbsp;53(5). However,
                subsection&nbsp;(5) relates to paragraph&nbsp;1 of the proposed
                new Standing Order under amendment No 24. We have had to add
                paragraph&nbsp;(2) to comply with the legislation. That fulfils

                of the consideration of this group of amendments and of this
                section of the compendium. I said at the start, which was about
                three hours ago although it seems longer, that we would try to
                get to Standing Order&nbsp;41, which deals with ministerial
                appointments. However, with 15&nbsp;minutes to go we have come
                to the end of a group.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have dealt with 28 amendments. There are
                65 to go, so we have dealt with just under a third of the
                amendments. We have dealt with 26 Standing Orders out of 71,
                which is just more than a third, in about three hours. I sense
                that at this rate we should be able to finish our business
                tomorrow. I hope that I have sensed the mood of the House. I
                suggest that, by leave of the House, the sitting be suspended
                now and resumed at 10.30 tomorrow morning, continuing if
                necessary until 10.00 tomorrow night.</p>
