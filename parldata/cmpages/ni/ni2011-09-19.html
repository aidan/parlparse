    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Members observed two minutes&rsquo; silence.</p>
    <p class="H3SubHeading"><a name="a"></a>Assembly Business</p>
		<p class="H4StageHeading">Acting deputy First Minister</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I wish to advise the House that I received written notice this morning from the  deputy First Minister, Mr Martin McGuinness, that, under section 16A(11) of the  Northern Ireland Act 1998, he has designated Mr John O&rsquo;Dowd, the Minister of  Education, to exercise the functions of the office of deputy First Minister.  The designation takes effect from midnight tonight. A copy of the letter will  be available in the Business Office for Members to inspect.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">On another issue, I ask Members for their help. We are  experiencing some technical problems with the amplifying system in the Chamber,  and Alban Maginness and Jim Wells raised the issue last Tuesday. Assembly  Broadcasting is monitoring the situation to see whether it can identify the  problem and rectify it. However, if Members feel that there are problems with  the amplifying system, they can alert the Table or raise it as a point of  order, and, hopefully, it will help the broadcasting team to identify the  problem and resolve it. Therefore, I ask for Members&rsquo; patience. We will move  on.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Allister</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Speaker. Further to your announcement under section  16A, can you advise the House whether the deputy First Minister will be paid as  such while he pursues his project of foreign adventurism?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. That is not a matter for the Speaker. I have fulfilled my role this  afternoon. I simply received a letter from the deputy First Minister, which was  very clear and procedurally correct, and I am informing the House of that this  afternoon. That is where my role ends. I am sure that the educated Member will  know that as well. We shall now move on.</p>
		<p class="H3SubHeading"><a name="b"></a>Ministerial Statement</p>
		<p class="H4StageHeading">North/South Ministerial Council: Environment</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Minister of the Environment wishes to make a statement to the House this  afternoon.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood (The  Minister of the Environment)</strong>: In compliance with section 52 of the Northern  Ireland Act 1998, as amended by the Northern   Ireland (St Andrews Agreement) Act 2006, I wish to make  the following statement on the twelfth meeting of the North/South Ministerial  Council in environment sectoral format, which was held in Armagh  on Friday 1 July 2011. This statement has been agreed with the Minister for  Regional Development, Mr Danny Kennedy, who also attended. The Irish Government  were represented by Mr Phil Hogan TD, Minister for the Environment, Community  and Local Government, who chaired the meeting. I, as Minister of the  Environment, along with Danny Kennedy MLA, Minister for Regional Development,  represented the Northern Ireland Executive.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">In respect of waste management, Ministers noted developments  in waste policy and that the revised European waste framework directive has  been transposed in both jurisdictions. The Council welcomed the work of the  North/South market development steering group on three particular issues: the  planned tender for a feasibility study on bulky waste reuse management best  practice; the all-island end of waste/quality protocol gypsum baseline survey;  and the work to be taken forward by a subgroup on the detail of mutually  recognised quality protocols.</p>
		<p class="B3SpeakerinChair">(Mr Principal Deputy Speaker &nbsp;[Mr Molloy] in the Chair)</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Ministers noted the intended publication, at that time, of  an all-island recycled plastic waste arisings study, which looks at the  generation and fate of recycled plastic waste across the island of Ireland.  Since agreeing this statement, the arising study was published by Mr Hogan and  me at an all-Ireland environment conference at Croke Park  last Thursday.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">In respect of cross-border movements of waste, Ministers  noted that the removal of waste from sites at Slattinagh, County Fermanagh, and  near Trillick, County Tyrone, is now complete; that, when this statement was  drafted, work was expected to commence &mdash; it has done so &mdash; in August on a  further site in Ballymartin near Kilkeel, County Down, which I visited last  Thursday; that work on a site north of Newry will commence in, I hope, early  September; and that the Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA) will draw up  plans to repatriate waste from the remaining 13 sites thereafter. The Council noted  that joint enforcement actions continue to be conducted by the competent  authorities.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">In respect of the implementation of the EU water framework  directive, Ministers noted that the joint document &lsquo;Working Together: Managing  Our Shared Waters&rsquo; for the north-western and Neagh/Bann international river  basin districts has been completed and published on the Departments&rsquo; websites.  Those documents will complement the river basin management plans for each  jurisdiction. The North/South working group on water quality will continue to  oversee co-ordinated implementation of those plans.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">The meeting also touched on environmental reporting and  research. Minister Hogan and I welcomed progress by the NIEA and the Republic&rsquo;s  Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in taking forward actions including joint  participation in EU-funded programmes and the sharing of research projects to  support the implementation of the water framework directive obligations.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">The Council welcomed co-operation in accessing funding for  priority environmental research under EU FP7 &mdash; the key R&amp;D innovation  research fund of the European Union, which is currently measured in the scale  of &euro;50 billion over the lifetime of the fund &mdash; INTERREG and LIFE+ programmes,  including the delivery of two events focusing on information and networking for  European funding leverage and the establishment of an external funding support  team in NIEA to assist development of a joint headline project with EPA. That  work is ongoing.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Finally, Ministers welcomed ongoing collaborative work to  develop a common set of environmental indicators, which includes a web-based  approach to presentation and the publication of a short statistical bulletin.  The Council agreed to meet again in environment sectoral format in October  2011.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Principal  Deputy Speaker</strong>: I remind Members that they must confine themselves to  asking questions on the Minister&rsquo;s statement.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton (The  Deputy Chairperson of the Committee for the Environment)</strong>: I thank the  Minister for his statement. Illegal dumping of waste from the Irish Republic  north of the border has exercised the Committee for the Environment for some  time. I welcome the progress that has been made, which the Minister mentioned  in his statement. I look forward to further progress on the other 13 sites that  he mentioned.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">On behalf of the Committee, I ask the Minister to say a wee  bit more about the joint enforcement proceedings that he touched on. Can he  assure the House that the issue is now under much greater control than it was?  If possible, can he quantify the financial scale of the problem and, indeed,  the contribution that his Department has made to clearing it up?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  I thank the Deputy Chairperson for his questions. He is quite right that the  Committee has been attentive and vigilant to that particular matter. As Members  know, there are 17 sites in the North of Ireland where waste has been dumped  illegally. Those sites have been identified for repatriation of waste. Work has  been completed on two of those sites. Work is ongoing at Ballymartin, near  Kilkeel. We hope, subject to the weather and technical and legal  considerations, to pursue work at the site north of Newry in the near future.  Thereafter, work at the rest of the sites will be rolled out. It is a very  expensive process.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">I think that Anna Lo, the Chairperson of the Committee,  went down to Ballymartin. The scale of the Ballymartin dump, which is not by  any means the largest of the illegal dumps, would take your breath away.  Indeed, as I discovered, the smell and taste of what was dumped, left rotting  and is now being removed from there lingers with you for a very long time.  Total costs could be upwards of &pound;30 million &mdash; for criminals and their gangs to  get short-term benefit from dumping waste from the South. I must acknowledge that,  under the framework agreement that was agreed by previous Ministers and the two  Governments, the Irish Government are responsible for 80% of the removal costs  and 100% of the disposal costs. That will remain the situation as long as the  waste that comes out of the ground is sourced from the Republic of Ireland  to the same extent. Under the framework agreement, if it happens that the  amount of waste that comes out of illegal dumps passes a threshold of 20% from  the North, that matter may be revisited.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">I am somewhat restricted in commenting on where we might be  with enforcement or potential prosecutions arising from illegal dumping, save  to say that any evidence or information that emerges from sites &mdash; it may be  that there are papers in the sites that betray or potentially betray  information on where the illegal waste came from &mdash; is, quite properly, bagged,  collected and assessed. Any information that arises is then forwarded to the  Irish Government. I assure the House that, even in the past number of days,  information has been forwarded to Dublin City Council to determine whether  there is an opportunity to pursue prosecutions.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Finally, only in recent times &mdash; 2008 &mdash; has the Department  established an environmental crime section. I have met the environmental crime  section team, which is passionate and determined about the work that it  undertakes. It is risky work. Its staff have to watch themselves, because they  deal with criminal gangs and individuals who would want to identify people who  are involved in that sort of business, for obvious reasons. Since 2008, there  have been 15 confiscation orders, amounting to &pound;1&middot;7 million, relating to  environmental crime in the North. Where evidence arises to pursue those who  engage in illegal waste dumping or other environmental crime, I assure the  House that the Department is determined to act and see that over the line.</p>
		<p class="TimePeriod">12.15 pm</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr W Clarke</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for the work  that has been carried out in Ballymartin, south Down. Will he outline the time  frame for the completion of the removal of the waste from the Ballymartin site?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  I thank the Member for his question. The intention is that that site will be  cleared of the illegal rubbish by the end of October. I am involved in ongoing  conversations between the Department and club representatives to try to ensure  that the topsoil on the adjoining pitch, which has been removed so that other  soil can be moved to fill in the holes that will be left when the illegal waste  is removed, is replaced by the end of October so that the pitch can be reseeded  and be available for football next season.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">I compliment the members of Ballymartin GAC, for whom there  has been great inconvenience and disturbance to their sporting activities, and  the local community, which has suffered greater inconvenience and disturbance  from the illegal dump. There has been a very close working relationship between  the NIEA, club members and the club generally to ensure that the matter is  handled. Inevitably, given the level of disturbance and inconvenience, there  are still some matters that give rise to comment or to my involvement, but I am  determined to ensure that the football pitch is available for reseeding by the  end of the month and that the inconvenience, the loss of opportunity and the  financial cost to the club is mitigated under the agreement as far as is  reasonably possible.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his statement. He indicated that the clearances at  Slattinagh and Trillick had been completed. Will he publish the total cost of  cleaning those sites? I ask because 20% of the cost is met by the Northern  Ireland Executive and cannot be spent on education, health or, indeed, other  environmental matters.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  I will publish and forward an interim report to the Environment Committee on  all the costs to date, detailing the money that has come from the public purse  in the North and the public purse in the South. I will ensure that that is  published.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">The Member&rsquo;s question is very well timed. The scale of the  damage and the scale of the cost to the public purse resulted in a loss of  opportunities for other priorities for public expenditure this year. The same  applied last year, and it will apply next year and every year until the 17  sites are cleared. In the fullness of time, the sites may cost a little bit  less because costs have come down. Alternatively, they might cost a little bit  more. Until you dig into the ground, you are never quite sure what you will  find and you are never quite sure about the risk.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">I will publish and circulate the cost of all this so that  the people on this island, North and South, realise what criminal gangs and  criminal individuals have done to damage the environment and to damage the  public purse.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dallat</strong>:  This statement clearly illustrates the absolute need for close co-operation  between North and South on environmental policy. From the short time that he  has been in post, does the Minister think that we are achieving the maximum  potential in cross-border co-operation on environmental policy?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  I thank the Member for his question. It is self-evident that issues of the  environment lend themselves fully to co-operation on an all-Ireland and  all-island basis.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">In June, I was at a conference of the British-Irish Council  in London, where John Swinney, a senior member  of the Scottish Government, remarked that renewables, green energy and green  technology are the single biggest economic opportunity for Scotland. I  have sympathy with that remark where Ireland  is concerned, because I believe that they are arguably the single biggest  economic opportunity for the island   of Ireland. That is why,  going forward, it is so important that environmental issues are dealt with on a  North/South basis. Not only does the environment not recognise borders but  environmental issues create huge economic opportunities for the people of this  island in a wide range of areas.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Although various Ministers and the Executive have done  great work on all-Ireland energy and environmental initiatives and although  this and previous reports display and demonstrate the scale of that work, I  have to say that I find it increasingly frustrating that the St Andrews review  of North/South co-operation, which was commenced in 2007, is still not  published in the year 2011 and that phase 2 of the review to identify new  opportunities going forward has not even started. Given the integration of our  economies and the fact that 5% of NAMA assets are in the North and given that  40% of our exports go to the Republic of Ireland and we have common banking, it  seems to me that, now that we are on the far side of the Assembly election and  may have a period of settlement over the next three or four years, we need to  take that work forward urgently. We need to do that not for party reasons but  for the common good of the people of the island of Ireland.  The sooner we accelerate and grasp that, the better for the Irish Government,  our own Government and the people of the island.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his statement. Given that an all-island recycled  plastic waste arisings study, which looks at the generation and fate of  recycling plastic waste across the island of Ireland, is expected to be  published, will the Minister tell us what work is ongoing and whether he hopes  that there will be a vast improvement in the cross-border recycling of plastic  when that study is eventually published?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  I thank the Member for his questions. As I indicated, the report was actually  published last Thursday, and I presume that it is on the NIEA&rsquo;s and the  Environmental Protection Agency&rsquo;s websites. However, I will lodge a copy in the  Library, because it is a compelling document. It reveals that 70% of plastics  on the island of Ireland go into landfill. Only 30% is  recycled, and, of that 30%, only 30% is recycled on the island of Ireland.  The remainder, which is the greater part, is exported for recycling. Those are  startling figures: 30% of the 30% that is recycled is recycled on the island of Ireland. The purpose, intention and  ambition behind the arisings study was to interrogate the information and  evidence in an effort to identify how we could create a greater internal market  on the island of Ireland for the disposal of plastics, to reduce the amount  that is exported and to maximise the volume of plastics that are currently not  recycled but could be.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">It is a difficult business. The next time you are drinking  from a bottle of water, if you look at it, you will see that there are three  different plastics in it: the plastic strip that names the bottle, the bottle  itself and the cap. They create various technical, scientific and other  difficulties. The purpose of this report is to identify how we are taking work  on that forward, and Phil Hogan and I agreed on 1 July so to do. We will try,  first, to build up information and communication about what the opportunities  may be; secondly, we will identify new opportunities for the gathering and disposal  of plastics on the island   of Ireland; and, thirdly,  we will look at how we will deal more effectively with bulky items such as  fridges, furniture and mattresses. It is a startling fact that there is only  one machine on the island   of Ireland, down in Wicklow,  that will cut up a mattress to recycle all its contents, save the fire-retardant  cover. Very few councils in the North are taking forward that opportunity for  recycling.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">The opportunities are enormous. Ten years ago, only 8% of  domestic waste was recycled; in the North, the figure is now 34%. I believe  that it can be more than 60% by 2020. Not only is that good for the environment  but it is a key economic driver. As Phil Hogan and I said at the all-Ireland  environment conference at Croke Park last Friday, our Governments need to  recognise the scale of the opportunity, grasp it and take it forward in a much  more accelerated way.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his statement. He rightly identified the key issue of  repatriation of waste from illegal sites, and we are aware just how large those  sites are. He referred to the early sites and, in response to an earlier  question, to specific time frames for the first four sites. He also indicated  that the other 13 sites would effectively be looked after by the group setting  up in Newry from January, if I picked him up correctly. I appreciate that it is  a very big problem. Will the Minister give an indication of any projected time  frame for the completion of the repatriation from those 13 remaining sites?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  I apologise for overlooking that question earlier. The answer is five years,  subject to what people find when they go on site to remove the illegal waste  and given the scale of what we think is on the remaining 13 sites. The time  frame is also subject to legal, technical and other issues, including NIEA  operators and contractors receiving full co-operation and not being subject to  any adverse reaction when they go on site. I want to put down that marker. I do  not want our staff to require PSNI protection when they go onto one or other  site to do important work on behalf of people in the North of Ireland. I want  to put down that marker very clearly. We have had the intolerable situation of  the illegal dumping of waste from the South, and it would be intolerable if  people who are trying to rectify and correct that problem on behalf of the  people of Ireland  end up requiring the protection of the PSNI. Subject to all those caveats &mdash; I  need to put down some caveats &mdash; the intended time frame is five years.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Boylan</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s  statement. The Minister is obviously aware that new protocols are in place  outlining the roles and responsibilities of the NIEA and local authorities.  Does he foresee a role for local authorities in the removal or disposal of  waste from any of the other 13 sites?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  I thank the Member for his question. The Member is right that new arrangements  for councillors&rsquo; powers and responsibilities on illegal dumping are being implemented.  However, in respect of those matters, the answer is no. There is a framework  agreement between the Irish Government, the authorities in Dublin, the Northern Ireland Executive, the  DOE and the NIEA that scopes out how the past sites, the current Ballymartin  site and future sites will be managed, the costings involved, the discharge of  the necessary moneys and the awarding of contracts. Obviously, everything has  to be done in a proper and open manner, unlike some other things that are going  on this week.<span class="SectionMarker"><span style="font-size:14.0pt; "> </span></span></p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">All of that is governed by current arrangements, and,  subject to further advice from officials, I do not expect that a requirement  for involvement will fall to councils. The matter will be dealt with at  government level.</p>
		<p class="TimePeriod">12.30 pm</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  Some of my questions have been answered, particularly in relation to the  timescale for the clearing of the 13 sites. It will greatly dismay the  community at large to hear that it is going to take five years to clear up that  mess. Surely somebody has failed in their duties, Minister? How can it be that  we have 15 identified sites? I do not know whether that means that there are  some that are not identified. In the Minister&rsquo;s opinion, who should stand tall  and say that they have failed? Will the Minister assure the House that this  will never be repeated? Furthermore, the fact that 15 sites could be  contaminated with waste from another jurisdiction without anyone being held  responsible shows that cross-border co-operation is not working.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  I thank Lord Morrow for his question. Given that the matter has been under  government management for a number of years, I am tempted not to say that none  of the previous DOE Ministers failed in their duties. In one way, I have  sympathy for the Member, which is why I think that Anna Lo was right, as Chair  of the Committee, to go to Ballymartin. It would be right for people to go to  Ballymartin or to any of the other sites to see the appalling state of ground  conditions and their potentially adverse impact on the lives of local  individuals and communities.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">There has been, if you like, a failure in that the  situation arose; it was not brought to the attention of the authorities at the  relevant time, and, despite illegal dumping happening over years, no one got a  grip of what was happening to mitigate the risk and reduce future occurrences.  I am sympathetic in that respect, because there has been a failure, and the  existence of 17 illegal dumps of that nature and scale suggests that something  was not working in the way in which it was intended.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">At the moment, I cannot give a guarantee that it will not  happen again. In the past two years, only one report of illegal dumping in the  North of material from the South has been made to the NIEA. That report was of  the dumping of a trailer full of waste. As I outlined to one of Lord Morrow&rsquo;s  colleagues during last week&rsquo;s Question Time, officials and others have told me  that one reason for that is that variations in the cost of landfill mean that  it is not as worthwhile for people to take waste from the South and dump it in  the North. There could, however, be a situation in future when the state of the  economies and variations in the cost of waste might make it worthwhile for  individuals who are criminally minded to restart that sort of work.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Given the scale of what we experienced; the vigilance of  Governments and other authorities against the threat; the need to bear down on  criminal activity on the island of Ireland; the fact that we now have an  environmental crime unit that does difficult work well; and the even tighter  working relationships than heretofore between the police, the garda&iacute;, the  Department and the EPA in the Republic, including potential live operations,  one would like to think that the community, the authorities and the political  leadership will be more vigilant than in the past to reduce the risk in the  future.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs McKevitt</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his statement. Most of my questions have been  answered. I particularly thank him for the update on the situation in the  Ballymartin and Newry and Mourne areas. Will any of the cost of removing the  illicit waste be imposed on local councils? If that is not the case, who will  pick up the bill?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  I thank the Member for her question. As I indicated, 100% of the disposal costs  and 80% of the removal costs are being covered by the authorities in the  Republic, with 20% of the removal costs falling to the Northern Ireland  Government. That is all being covered by the Northern Ireland Government. It  will not pass to the councils, although, in my view, our councils need to step  up to the mark in respect of the failure, or otherwise, of Northern Ireland  to live up to environmental standards.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">That is why, in the context of local government  reorganisation, if, for example, there are infraction proceedings against the  Government of Britain and Northern Ireland for their failure to live up to  recycling, emissions or other targets, there will be a power to transfer the  costs of that infraction from central government to local councils. In the  future, if we do not live up to environmental standards, whatever they might  be, local councils will have to pay the cost of any infraction.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms P Bradley</strong>:  Minister, I thank you for your statement. Will you give us some indication of  the timescale for the planned tender for the feasibility study on waste  management that you mentioned in your statement?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  I thank the Member for her question. There is an ongoing review of the Northern Ireland  waste management strategy. There will be further details in respect of that in  the near future. My counterpart in Dublin,  Phil Hogan, confirmed on Friday that he is undertaking the exact same strategy  and that there is a review of the Republic&rsquo;s waste management strategy going  forward.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">In the context of this report of the North/South  environment sector, it seems to me that, if the Republic&rsquo;s Government and the  Northern Ireland Government are on parallel paths in reviewing waste management  strategy, we should, consistent with the mandate given to both of us in the  North/South Ministerial Council and the sectors therein, be looking to see  whether we can align policies in order to identify and maximise opportunity &mdash;  for example, for municipal waste disposal &mdash; and join up, not just how we make  assessments, not just statistical evidence and not just having common standards  to measure all of that, which is ongoing work. I hope that that work will get  over the line by 2012 with the publication of essentially agreed standards to  measure waste on the island   of Ireland in order to  help us to go forward in a more joined-up way.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">I hope &mdash; Phil Hogan and I are certainly inclined towards  this outcome &mdash; that there will be an understanding that, as we join up the  intelligence and evidence base around waste management and as we create common  standards to measure waste and waste management, that should then bounce us in  a positive way into having a much more joined-up waste management strategy. Mr  Hogan and I are determined, given that we are on the same parallel path, to  create some level of convergence in the future by integrating and aligning  waste management strategy, policies and priorities.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Aire as a  fhreagra. I thank the Minister for his previous answers. What anticipated ideas  or strategy development does the Minister have for the North/South market  development steering group?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  As I said in a previous answer, I encourage Members to read the arisings study  report, which captures the opportunities for the steering group and the  potential for recycling initiatives and developments on the island of Ireland.  To answer the question, some things can be done on a voluntary basis, others  more strategically. For example, work is being done to move forward sectoral  voluntary agreements on food waste disposal by the hospitality industry. I do  not know whether anyone listened to &lsquo;Good Morning Ireland&rsquo; this morning; it  reported that the estimated loss of revenue in the hospitality sector in the  Republic of Ireland due to the disposal of food waste into landfill, rather  than being avoided in the first place, amounts to &euro;120 million a year. That,  apparently, is the cost of not managing food waste in the hospitality and  hotels sector in the South in a way that avoids landfill, or of not being able  to avoid the disposal of food waste in that way in the first place.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">We are looking at opportunities, through the Republic of Ireland&rsquo;s  green hospitality scheme and the Northern Ireland hospitality and  food industry, to prevent food waste and identify better mechanisms for the  disposal of food waste in order to reduce the amount of it and improve the  efficiency of the process. I am minded to escalate that further. That is why,  as I said in my answer to a previous question, there are huge business and  green opportunities on the island of Ireland in recyclates &mdash; plastics and other  materials that can be recycled &mdash; both to develop the internal market and, as I  said earlier, to reduce the amount of exports going to sustain jobs in other  parts of the world where the recycling industry is more advanced. I commend the  arisings study report to Members who have an interest in those matters.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Byrne</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his statement. Will he outline the current state of  North/South co-operation on research and development, particularly in waste  management technology? Does he agree that there have been great advances in  that technology, particularly those which have been developed by Northern Ireland  heavy engineering industries? What benefits might those advances accrue to the  waste management strategy, given that local authorities&rsquo; waste management  groups are considering the way forward?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  As I said earlier, it is arguably the case that renewables, green technology  and green innovation are Ireland&rsquo;s  single biggest economic opportunity. The reason is self-evident; the quality of  our wind and wave, given that we are Atlantic-facing, is the best for those  purposes in Europe. The consequences of that  for making the island   of Ireland  self-sufficient in energy, with the potential to export significant volumes of  energy into the national grid elsewhere, will create enormous economic opportunities.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">The central EU fund for research and development and  innovation, known as FP7, is, as I said earlier, a &pound;50 billion fund. It is,  however, deeply frustrating that the island of Ireland and the Northern Ireland  Executive have not had much more success in drawing down moneys from that fund.  The Irish Government have a notional drawdown figure of &euro;600 million over the  six-year lifetime of FP7. If I remember correctly, 18 months ago the total  drawdown by the Northern Ireland Executive under FP7 was, according to the  Minister of Finance and Personnel, &pound;25 million.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Given that we have a &euro;50 billion fund over six years and  given that our sister Government in Dublin have a notional drawdown of &euro;600  million, it seems to me that, in the latter period of FP7 funding, which runs  until 2013, we should still be identifying opportunities and developing  proposals for projects involving companies, universities and other  jurisdictions that might be funded from FP7.</p>
		<p class="TimePeriod">12.45 pm</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">There are two points to be made about that. First, there  will be a successor to the FP7 fund, known as FP8. Two weeks ago, at a  conference in Dundalk, an EU official said  that FP8 is likely to comprise an &euro;80 billion fund for R&amp;D and innovation  across the EU between 2014 and 2020. If our Executive and our economic agencies  are to step up to the plate and address the economic threats and challenges  that we face, we must dedicate ourselves to preparing for FP8 going live in  2014, not least because the relevant EU commissioner, M&aacute;ire Geoghegan-Quinn, is  a former Member of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann. Although she will, of course, perform her  duties in a balanced and fair manner, I am sure that she will be inclined to  assist appropriately the island   of Ireland.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">The second intervention is that, in the latter days and  years of FP7, officials in the EPA and the Irish Government in the South and in  DOE and the NIEA in the North are attempting to identify projects to bid  jointly for moneys for research, technology and innovation. I will not break  the confidence of what those projects might be, but we are trying to  fast-forward projects, working especially with the universities, in an effort,  at this later stage, to draw down FP7 moneys.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  The Minister outlined cross-border waste movements, particularly those involving  illegal dumping. However, I am sure that he will be aware that, in recent days,  concerns have been raised about the cross-border dumping of the waste  by-product of illegal fuel laundering. Was cross-border, cross-agency  co-operation between the police on both sides of the border a subject of  discussion?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  The Member is right to identify that issue. Even though there appears to have  been little illegal dumping of waste from the Republic in the North in the past  two years, the consequences of illegal fuel laundering continue to be a serious  threat to moneys going to the Exchequer and to fuel quality. Moreover, assets  are going into the hands of illegal organisations, criminal gangs and  individual criminals, never mind the consequences of the by-products of illegal  fuel laundering potentially getting into the water chain and having other  adverse environmental impacts. Therefore, the Member is correct to identify the  issue.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">The Member will also be aware of the scale of cross-border  co-operation between the relevant agencies, and, crucially, between an Garda  S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI. It appears that not a week goes by when there is not  further success by the respective authorities, including the police services on  the island, in their efforts to bear down on those involved in fuel smuggling.  As I indicated earlier, although the environmental crime section in DOE is  small, I will try, if I am able, to enhance its resource capability so that we  send a message to all those who may be tempted to involve themselves in  criminal activity &mdash; be it illegal waste, illegal fuel laundering or other  smuggling activities &mdash; that the authorities will bear down on all that.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">It is not an easy process, as we have learned from illegal  waste dumping, to turn illegality into evidence, evidence into prosecution and  prosecution into conviction. It is not a straightforward undertaking, but I  assure the Member that, when it comes to the environmental crime unit, the NIEA  or DOE, I am very vigilant and will ensure that they apply all their resources  and capacity to get those prosecutions over the line.</p>
		<p class="H3SubHeading"><a name="c"></a>Private Members&rsquo; Business</p>
		<p class="H4StageHeading">Fuel Poverty</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Principal  Deputy Speaker</strong>: The Business Committee has agreed to allow up to one hour  and 30 minutes for the debate. The proposer of the motion will have 10 minutes  in which to propose and 10 minutes in which to make a winding-up speech. One  amendment has been selected and published on the Marshalled List. The proposer  of the amendment will have 10 minutes in which to propose and five minutes in which  to make a winding-up speech. All other Members who wish to speak will have five  minutes.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D McIlveen</strong>:  I beg to move</p>
		<p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly recognises the serious problem of fuel  poverty, especially amongst older people; acknowledges the adverse impact that  rising fuel bills are likely to have on the ability of older people to keep  warm and healthy; and calls on the Minister for Social Development to make  representations to Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government to continue to support Age Sector  Platform&rsquo;s call to maintain this year&rsquo;s winter fuel payment at its current  level of &pound;250 for pensioner households where someone is aged between 60 and 79,  and &pound;400 where someone is aged 80 and over.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the opportunity to move the motion. Last Tuesday,  the House voted on a motion concerning the part-time RUC Reserve gratuity  payment. In the course of that debate, I and many others made reference to the  fact that the payment was to reward and recognise those who have spent their  lives serving us. The concept behind today&rsquo;s motion is exactly the same. We  ought to view the winter fuel payment as sending out a message about how we  treat our older people. We must not forget that they represent a generation of  people who built up our country in exceptionally difficult and challenging  circumstances. Indeed, it is a generation of people who went out to work every  day even when it was dangerous and often life-threatening to do so. Therefore,  I urge Members to keep those concepts firmly in their minds throughout the  debate.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">By way of context, Northern Ireland has what has been  described as a unique fuel poverty landscape. There are three main factors  behind fuel poverty: low incomes, high fuel prices and significant energy  inefficiencies in our homes. Those three factors together mean that families in  Northern Ireland  now have to make some very difficult choices about their budgets. According to  the DSD (Department for Social Development), we spend twice as much of our  disposable income on energy as people living in London, for example. However, our average  earnings in 2010 were &pound;365 a week, compared with &pound;404 a week in the rest of the  United Kingdom.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">A further difficulty in relation to fuel poverty in Northern Ireland  is the fact that 70% of Northern Irish households depend on oil heating. As we  are all aware, the oil market is extremely volatile at the moment, and oil is  much more expensive than gas. The Consumer Council has estimated that using oil  will cost a household &pound;1,000 a year more than if it were using gas. It will  come as no surprise to the House that Northern   Ireland has a colder climate than the rest of the United Kingdom.  However, what may surprise the House is that, to meet World Health Organization  standards, we would need to heat our homes for more than 310 days of the year.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">In my capacity as a member of the Committee for Enterprise, Trade and  Investment, I know that there has been significant discussion surrounding the  possibility of fuel price regulation, social tariffs, energy brokering and  efficiency savings. Although I welcome the ground that is being made in those  areas and the extensive work that is being done by the Department for Social  Development through the warm homes scheme, we need to do more right now to  protect the most vulnerable against the effects of fuel poverty. Ultimately,  the impact of those Northern Ireland-specific issues is felt most by our older  generation.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">I have used many facts and figures in this speech, and I  thank the Assembly for its patience in allowing me to go through them. I truly  believe that, on the figures alone, there is a solid case for maintaining the  winter fuel payment at last year&rsquo;s level. However, there is one figure that the  Assembly should be especially concerned about: in 2009 and 2010, there were 950  deaths during winter, over and above the usual annual average. Those are what  the statisticians call excess winter deaths. Eighty per cent of them were 65  years of age and over.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">How can the coalition Government in Westminster justify cutting the payment when  there is already an appalling number of unnecessary deaths in the winter  months? Recent research from the University   of Ulster suggests that,  besides the uncaring and penny-pinching nature of the cut, it does not make  sense economically. For every death from the cold, there are eight hospital  admissions and over 100 visits to GPs and health centres. For the benefit of  those who, like me, are a little mathematically challenged, that means that,  for the 950 deaths during the winter of 2009-2010, there will have been 7,600  extra hospital admissions and 95,000 extra visits to GPs and health centres. In  addition, for every pound that we invest in tackling fuel poverty, 42p is saved  in health costs.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>: I  declare an interest as a member of Ballymoney Borough Council. Five years ago this  September, that council introduced an affordable fuel stamps scheme. There have  been such schemes previously in Northern    Ireland, but that was the first to be  implemented by a local authority. Will the Member agree that that is one  example of a practical measure that could be introduced across the board? Will  he join me in calling on the Minister to look at that scheme as a way of giving  practical help to the people whom he eloquently described as being caught in  that situation?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D McIlveen</strong>:  I thank the Member for his intervention. I am aware of that scheme, which is to  be welcomed. It is good to see that north Antrim is leading the way, as usual.  I encourage the Minister to take away that suggestion and look at it in more  detail.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">I will bring the discussion back to a more personal level.  Every day, people come into my constituency office and sign the &lsquo;Fight the  Winter Fuel Cut&rsquo; petition. Every day, they come in with concerns about how they  will afford to heat their homes this winter and, every day, people come in to  see whether they meet the criteria for the warm homes scheme or the boiler  replacement scheme. In some cases, those people are genuinely having to make  the decision of whether to keep warm or to buy food. Without exaggeration, the  Assembly needs to consider the situation on the basis of whether we are content  to allow our most vulnerable people to be put in the position of whether to  heat or eat.</p>
		<p class="B3SpeakerinChair">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr Dallat] in the Chair)</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Recently, I met representatives from Age Sector Platform at  my constituency office. Both they and I feel that the decision not to retain  last year&rsquo;s level of payment is an absolute outrage. When the payment was first  introduced, it accounted for a third of the winter fuel bill that pensioners  were paying. It now accounts for much less. Indeed, I am sure that, in future,  Age Sector Platform will be campaigning for the fuel payment to be linked to  energy prices. The team at Age Sector Platform has been inundated with calls  and concerns from the community, and it reports that pensioners are coming to  it in their hundreds with genuine concerns. To date, around 7,400 people have  signed the petition, and I am sure that all Members will recognise from their  constituency offices the story of people coming in with similar concerns.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">The unavoidable truth is that we now have an ageing  population, and we must be prepared to support our older generation  accordingly. At the Northern Ireland Pensioners Parliament in June, the primary  concern of pensioners was about keeping warm in winter. I am not comfortable  with the revelation that older people are now more concerned with the basic  right of keeping warm than they are with even the fear of crime. Ultimately,  the winter fuel payment may be a short-term solution for older people, and, as  such, I more than welcome the development of a comprehensive fuel poverty  strategy in Northern Ireland.  However, our older constituents have to get through this winter, and we must do  what we can now to help them through it.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">We have no issue with the amendment, but my concern is that  this is an urgent issue that needs sorted out this winter. Although we have no  issue in principle with the green new deal, even the most optimistic people in  the Assembly will agree that it will not happen by this winter. The issue needs  to be addressed right away, and we urge the Assembly to consider that.<span class="SectionMarker"><span style="font-size:14.0pt; "> </span></span></p>
		<p class="TimePeriod">1.00 pm</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Allister</strong>:  I suspect that everyone in this House empathises with the Member&rsquo;s  disappointment at the reduction in the winter fuel allowance, which, of course,  had been foreshadowed for some time since it was introduced in 2008. The focus  of the motion is to invite the Westminster Government to reinstate it, and all  to the good if they do. However, given the budgetary process at present, some  might doubt whether that will happen. In those circumstances, is he calling on  this Executive to make up the difference? Why was that not factored into the  Budget that went through this House before he and I were Members? At that  stage, it was known that the reduction was coming.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D McIlveen</strong>:  I thank the Member for his intervention. This motion is to call on our Minister  to lobby Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government on the issue. The reduction has come about as  a result of penny-pinching by the coalition Government, not through the Budget  from this House. I am sure that the Minister will want time to speak on that,  but I do not see it as an issue that the Executive can sort out. It is a matter  for the Treasury and Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government to sort out.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">I urge the Assembly to appreciate that, right now, in  consideration of your constituents and with the possibility of another cold,  hard winter ahead, we must support last year&rsquo;s level of winter fuel payment. I  ask the Minister to lobby Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government to that end.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">In closing, I reiterate my sentiments from the beginning of  my speech. Northern Ireland  has often been famous for all the wrong reasons &mdash;</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Will the Member bring his remarks to a close, please?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D McIlveen</strong>:  However, we have always been known for treating our older generation with  dignity and respect, and, in my opinion, the Assembly should pass this motion.  Therefore, I commend it to the House.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Agnew</strong>: I  beg to move the following amendment: At end insert</p>
		<p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;; and further calls on the Minister to increase  funding for the green new deal to provide the energy efficiency measures  required to tackle fuel poverty in the long-term.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">I welcome today&rsquo;s timely debate on fuel poverty, and I  thank the Member for proposing it. I also thank him for his comments on my  amendment. We all noticed the recent dip in temperatures at the end of what,  ultimately, was a cold summer even by our standards, and all predictions  suggest that we face another harsh winter. As the proposer of the motion said,  44% of people in Northern    Ireland are described as fuel poor, using  the original definition that 10% or more of their income is spent on fuel. That  amounts to over 300,000 people, and, given that those stats were produced  before the recent rise in electricity prices, I suspect that that number may  well have increased.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">The proposer of the motion also mentioned the number of  deaths caused each winter. Again, that is on the rise, and many of those deaths  &mdash; estimated to be up to 1,000 last winter &mdash; can be directly attributable to the  effects of fuel poverty. Older people suffer particularly badly during the cold  weather due to their having fixed and, in many cases, relatively low incomes,  and 61&middot;5% of our over-60s live in fuel poverty. That figure increases with age,  and a staggering 83&middot;2% of lone older people are estimated to be in fuel  poverty. We should be concerned about those figures and should look to address  that issue.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">The proposer of the motion paid much attention to the older  generation when debating the issue, as is generally the case when the issue is  discussed, but we must look also to the impacts on the other end of the  spectrum. Infants who live in fuel poverty have a 30% greater risk of admission  to hospital or primary care. Children face their own &ldquo;heat or eat&rdquo; battle in  the sense that much of the energy from food that should go towards children&rsquo;s  development growth is instead used to produce heat. Again, that has future  health impacts and may have impacts on cognitive development and future  education achievement. There is a direct link between fuel poverty and mental  ill health in adolescence. All those factors combined serve to reiterate Mr  McIlveen&rsquo;s call on the UK Government by highlighting the issue&rsquo;s severity and  the need to retain the winter fuel payment.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">However, there are things that we can also do in Northern Ireland.  I outlined the costs to society. It is estimated that fuel poverty costs the  NHS &pound;859 million a year, UK-wide. If we take our population into account &mdash; the  higher proportion of people in Northern    Ireland who suffer from fuel poverty and our  particularly high energy costs &mdash; it is likely to cost our Health Department  more than &pound;50 million a year. Yet, research shows that &pound;1 spent on alleviating  fuel poverty can save 42p in health service provision. Therefore, I welcome the  Minister for Social Development&rsquo;s attendance at today&rsquo;s meeting and his  interest in that area, but, given those statistics, the issue is not one solely  for his Department, or, for that matter, Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government; it must be  worked on on a cross-departmental basis.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">As the proposer of the motion said, income, energy costs  and energy efficiency are factors that influence the rates of fuel poverty.  That is why we need to see a cross-departmental working group that includes the  Social Development Minister, perhaps as lead, but also the Enterprise, Trade  and Investment Minister, the Minister of Finance and Personnel and the Health  Minister, so that we can see how each can play their part in alleviating fuel  poverty.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">The winter fuel payment is a welcome addition in  supplementing old people&rsquo;s income, which is at the crux of the motion. However,  with the rate of energy inflation, that payment becomes less valuable every  year. In fact, were older people to receive the &pound;250 this year, it would be  worth the equivalent of &pound;140 compared with 2005 energy prices. That shows that  we need other measures to tackle the problem. We can do little to stop energy  prices, certainly those in oil and gas, but I welcome the measure in the  departmental strategy, Warmer Healthier Homes, to look at brokering and the use  of purchasing power to reduce fuel prices for those in social housing and  Housing Executive homes.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">That will not tackle the fuel poverty that is also suffered  by many people in private homes. Members may be interested to learn that a  number of energy co-operatives have sprung up in England. I hope that we can look at  that and see how the Assembly can support those who wish to form energy co-ops  and perhaps encourage communities to do so. However, we in Northern Ireland  are very dependent on fossil fuels. We need to address that, and I know that  the Enterprise,  Trade and Investment Minister is looking at this, but we must look at what we  can do in other areas. I am conscious that, in 2007, the then Finance Minister,  Peter Robinson, dropped the mandatory renewables element from building  regulations. That needs to be addressed.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Energy efficiency is a key issue in the debate and in my  amendment, which I hope will be seen as friendly because I support the motion  as it stands. However, we should go further. Investing in the green new deal  and energy efficiency measures is the most cost-effective way in which we can  tackle fuel poverty. A &pound;72 million public investment will unlock a total  investment of &pound;253 million, with contributions from the private sector,  including energy companies. Fifty thousand homes a year could receive energy  efficiency measures, compared with the 9,000 homes a year targeted by the  current warm homes scheme. The costs for each home would also be reduced  because of the volume and the private sector involvement. It costs over &pound;2,000  a home under the warm homes scheme, but under the green new deal scheme the  cost would come down to around &pound;1,400. There would be added benefits, with  around 10,000 to 15,000 jobs created or sustained and over 300,000 tons of  carbon saved each year. We would be hitting a number of cross-departmental  targets through the development of the green new deal scheme.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">We must also ensure that all our newbuilds have minimum  energy efficiency standards. I am conscious that level 3 in the code for  sustainable homes must be met in all new social housing developments. I believe  that with advances in energy efficiency technology we could and should go  beyond that. However, we must see what can be done with private housing,  because there is no such requirement in the private sector to build homes to a  minimum energy standard. It is much cheaper to do that at the front end when we  are building our homes than to retrofit them once they have been built. We need  to get it right from the start to prevent people from being fuel poor in the  future.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Although we do not yet have a Programme for Government, it  is clear that the economy will once again be the overall priority. However, I  argue that fuel poverty, given its detrimental impact on human lives, should  feature highly in the Executive&rsquo;s priorities. Social and economic issues are  not separate. Investment in the green new deal will have economic benefits as  well as being a key strand in the battle to reduce and eradicate fuel poverty.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Will the Member bring his remarks to a close, please?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Agnew</strong>: I  hope that Members will see my amendment as a friendly amendment. I support the  motion, but I hope that people will accept my amendment as taking the issue  further.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maskey (The  Chairperson of the Committee for Social Development)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat,  a LeasCheann Comhairle. As the Committee has not had the opportunity to discuss  the motion or the amendment, it has not adopted a formal position. However, it  is appropriate to put on the record the developing context on behalf of the  Committee over the past few months, certainly since the beginning of the new  mandate. All Committee members are alive to the issue of fuel poverty and are  anxious to take forward some work on the issue. Members, including the proposer  of the motion, have outlined a number of concerns which are felt by all Committee  members.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">On 23 June, representatives from the Fuel Poverty Coalition  and the National Energy Action on fuel poverty made submissions to the  Committee. Although those groups stressed that they wanted to work  constructively with the Department and the Committee, they had several  criticisms, which I want to outline. They felt that the Department&rsquo;s fuel  strategy, which was launched in April this year, failed to provide targets or  road maps on how the vision for the eradication of fuel poverty would be achieved.  The delegation also questioned the effectiveness of the interdepartmental group  on fuel poverty, which is chaired by the Minister for Social Development. They  cited issues such as the lack of regular meetings and stressed the importance  of an immediate review of the effectiveness of the fuel strategy. They also  called for the resurrection of the fuel poverty task force and asked for  additional resources to be restored to the warm homes scheme. Following those  representations, the Committee wrote to the Department raising a number of  those concerns. A lot of the issues raised were shared by many Committee  members.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Other points raised by the Committee included further  information from the Department on the boiler replacement scheme and any other  plans or initiatives that the Department or the Minister might be involved in  with colleagues to address fuel poverty here, not least the fact that our  community has a high dependency on home heating oil.</p>
		<p class="TimePeriod">1.15 pm</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">As Chairperson of the Committee, I met again the Consumer  Council representatives who are involved in the Fuel Poverty Coalition. I spoke  to them about identifying and adopting some pragmatic steps that the Committee  could take. They came up with a number of positions, which they presented to  the Committee. Indeed, coincidentally and fortuitously, the Committee will take  a further briefing from departmental officials this Thursday on the issues of  concern that were raised with them, and it will consider those in some detail.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">As I said, Committee members are very concerned that they  take this matter forward and that they do what they can and work with the  Department, which has a responsibility to take the matter forward on an  interdepartmental basis. Members have been clearly articulating their concern  that we are coming into a very difficult and challenging climate &mdash; no pun  intended &mdash; with increased fuel prices and the so-called welfare reforms, which  we believe will lead to much greater cuts and rising unemployment. Those events  are coming together, and they are not making a very prosperous environment for  people who are vulnerable to fuel poverty problems. Our Committee is,  therefore, very much looking forward to hearing from the Minister and hearing  from the officials this Thursday and to trying to take this matter forward on  the basis of working with other Committees. I hope and expect that, following  this week&rsquo;s briefing, I will be able to speak to all Committees with a view to  trying to take some initiative to highlight the issue and, in fact, to taking some  very pragmatic and important steps forward on a collective basis.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Finally, I want to speak as a party representative. In  general, our party supports the intention of the motion and the amendment, but  I do not think the amendment adds anything precise. However, the motion does  not go far enough &mdash;</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Will the Member draw his remarks to a close?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maskey</strong>:  We need to have a more concerted effort to address our concerns to the British  Government, which placed people in this position in the first place.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Copeland</strong>:  I, too, thank the Members responsible for bringing the motion to the House this  afternoon. In assessing these matters, you can look at numbers and statistics  until you are blue in the face, or you can sit in front of a coal fire, a  radiator or a central heating system that you cannot afford to run until you  are blue in the face.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">The motion begins with the words:</p>
		<p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;That this Assembly recognises the serious problem of  fuel poverty&rdquo;.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">I ask myself, &ldquo;Do we recognise it?&rdquo; I also ask whether it  is something that we can raise and take along a particular route. The way in  which we recognise it appears to be confused, because in the rest of the United Kingdom,  you appear to be in fuel poverty if you burn or spend more than 10% of your  income. If applied to Northern    Ireland, that statistic would not give 13%  but somewhere in the region of 44%. If you take 44%, it comes out at 302,000.  That is not 302,000 people, as Mr Agnew said, but 302,000 households. Some  302,000 households could be half a million people.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Time after time I stand here and listen to people talking  about the waiting lists for housing. They say that there are 38,000 or 39,000  people on the waiting lists. However, it is not 38,000 or 39,000 people; it is  38,000 or 39,000 applications. It is not applications that send us here; it is  not applications that mandate us; it is not applications who have need: it is  people. We need to start seeing the tears that lie behind some of those  statistics.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Many houses in Northern Ireland are of poor  quality, and many are not properly insulated. We have a boiler scheme, which, I  think, has had only 200 applications. I would be grateful if, at some stage in  the future, the Minister could give me an update on the progression of the  pilot boiler replacement scheme.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">I am speaking in full support of the motion and the  amendment, as brought forward by both parties concerned.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">However, to truly get an answer, we are going to have to  perform a balancing act that allows people to be warm for the next 24 or 48 hours  and, at the same, finds money to invest or engineer out the difficulties that  are feeding the system and the problem. Fuel poverty does not solely apply to  people being cold in their own homes. As has been said, fuel poverty has  ramifications in education, the health service and a range of other areas.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Is it honest of us to say that we, here, can do nothing? We  can go to Westminster &mdash; the Minister would have the full support of any  right-thinking person in this room in dealing with Westminster &mdash; but Westminster  is liable to say no, despite the fact that the rises in fuel duty and gas and  electricity prices have all accumulated to a rise in value added tax, which is  taxing this distress and the people who suffer.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">In Northern    Ireland, it is very expensive to be poor. If  you use a power card to put electricity into your home, you will pay more, even  though you are paying for that electricity before you get it, as opposed to  people like me and, I presume, many others, who pay for their electricity after  they get it.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">No matter what we say in this room, unless we are prepared  to take money from one budget and put it into another to address this, we are  dependent on the good nature of a fiscally strapped Government in the United Kingdom.  I thank the Member for mentioning the coalition Government only twice. I  somewhat suspect that, no matter what the mix of political representation in Westminster or had we  been discussing this after the previous election, the results would,  unfortunately, have been pretty much the same.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">I support the motion and the amendment.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">I trust that Members will allow me one slight pictorial  episode. The house that I was born into had &mdash;</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Bring your remarks to a close, please.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Copeland</strong>:  &mdash; a fireplace in every room. Those were coal fireplaces; you lit it and it  burned.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Time is up.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Copeland</strong>:  Thank you for saving me.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>:  Given the ever-escalating number of people struggling with fuel poverty and the  prospect of another harsh winter, we very much welcome and support the motion  and its amendment and their desired intention of alleviating the hardship faced  by so many older people in our society due to unaffordable fuel costs.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Aiding the most vulnerable in society has always been a  priority for my party, and it remains so today and particularly over the coming  cruel winter months. We must ensure that we do not have a repeat of last  winter&rsquo;s sheer human cost of fuel poverty, which saw the deaths of almost 1,000  people due primarily to freezing temperatures.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Pensioners face the situation in which they have to choose  whether to heat or eat. We must do all that we can in this regard. Not only  must we adopt the motion and support the Social Development Minister in his  endeavours to protect winter fuel payments, we, as a functioning institution,  must take our own proactive steps to tackle fuel poverty.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">The social protection fund was envisaged as a tool with  which to protect our most vulnerable citizens from the most severe of cuts from  Westminster.  However, it in itself has been sufficiently cut in our Budget as to render it  virtually negligible.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">The previous Social Development Minister&rsquo;s initiatives to  tackle fuel property were to be applauded and welcomed, but, with the  continually growing need for assistance with heating costs, we need to go  further. It is not enough either to maintain payments, as fuel prices continue  to soar. Ideally, payments would reflect costs.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">As stated in Mr Agnew&rsquo;s amendment, more money needs to be  allocated to the provision of energy efficiency measures, and projects such as  the warm homes and boiler replacement schemes must be properly resourced and  properly rolled out.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Yes, these are hard times for government, but they are  impossible times for many citizens. We must protect the most vulnerable, and  human need must prevail. Statistically, as a few Members have highlighted, fuel  poverty is more acute here in the North than in Great Britain. I wonder whether it  is a coincidence that nowhere has a more fragmented approach to tackling the  issue of fuel poverty than here. That underlines the need for a single  Department or agency to be responsible for energy, or, in the absence of that,  at least increased and improved cross-departmental working.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, it is not ideal or even satisfactory that  winter fuel payments are made only to the elderly, not all of whom live in  poverty. That has to be underlined. One can think of other vulnerable groups  across our constituencies, such as families with young children and people with  serious health problems. As a member of the Committee for Health, Social  Services and Public Safety, I know that the extension of winter fuel payments  will help to alleviate the huge burden on the health service, which is  exacerbated by very cold temperatures. Indeed, I am sure that a cost-benefit  analysis would demonstrate that the significant investment involved in  developing a robust strategy to address fuel poverty would be repaid by the  savings realised in primary and secondary healthcare.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">As already stated, the most cost-effective and sustainable  way to tackle fuel poverty is to introduce energy efficiency measures.  Increased focus and funds must be placed on that. In the meantime, we must act,  urge the Minister to act and support him when he does. We must urge Westminster to act to  ease the suffering of so many older citizens this winter.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">My party supports the motion and the amendment.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Cochrane</strong>:  Fuel poverty has reached crisis levels. As Mr Agnew said, more than 60% of  older people and 83% of lone older people in Northern Ireland live in fuel  poverty. Fuel poor households simply do not have enough money to heat and power  their homes adequately. The consequences are debts, the forgoing of essential  needs, excess winter deaths, ill health and mental stress due to the difficulty  of paying bills and living in cold homes.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">We all remember last winter and the unprecedented freezing  temperatures that lasted for such a long period. Many people faced financial  difficulties when it came to heating their homes and preventing pipes from  freezing. Even those who can usually comfortably heat their homes found that  they had to make choices. Those choices may have included whether to eat out in  a nice restaurant, but, for so many others, the choice was whether to eat or  heat.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">A report today from the National Association of Citizens  Advice Bureaux shows a desperate picture of fuel poverty in Northern Ireland,  particularly in rural areas. It highlights the fact that one third of elderly  clients have had to make a choice between heating and other essential items  such as food. It also shows that 59% of disabled respondents have had to choose  between food and heat. The number of households in fuel poverty is fast  approaching 50%. The main reason for its rapid growth is the 12% rise in fuel  prices since 2003, and fuel prices will continue to rise in the medium to long  term because of the investment required to replace an ageing infrastructure and  the impact of high oil prices. Unfortunately, benefit rates, pensions, tax  credits and the minimum wage have not kept pace with fuel price inflation, and,  realistically, they are never likely to.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Higher fuel prices drive up fuel poverty. However, improved  energy efficiency can bring it down. Large amounts of energy and money are  wasted trying to heat and power poorly insulated homes. By bringing the homes  of the fuel poor up to the energy efficiency standards of new homes, we could  reduce fuel bills by an average of 52%, thereby taking the vast majority out of  fuel poverty. Tackling energy efficiency in homes should, therefore, be a key  priority for the long term, whether through loft and cavity wall insulation or  whatever. Although I appreciate that DSD has invested money in making homes more  energy efficient, it has not gone far enough.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">For example, of the 500,000 homes that use oil, around  400,000 have old, inefficient boilers, yet the recent funding is aimed at  replacing less than 1% of those.</p>
		<p class="TimePeriod">1.30 pm</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  I thank the Member for giving way. She touches on a very important point about  energy efficiency in homes. However, to date, the amount of money that the  Government have allocated to the green new deal is &pound;12 million, which,  incidentally, her party supported in the Budget. Surely that is inadequate to  deal with the extent of the problem that she rightly identified.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Cochrane</strong>:  I thank the Member for his point. It is inadequate. Furthermore, it is not an  issue for DSD alone. As Mr McIlveen said, the Department for Health, Social  Services and Public Safety (DHSSPS) must also recognise the serious health  implications of fuel poverty, given the strong link between fuel poverty and  cost to the NHS. For every &pound;1 invested in alleviating fuel poverty, 42p is  saved in health costs.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">The Citizen&rsquo;s Advice survey, to which I referred, reports  that a significant number of people not only attributed their problems to poor  insulation and heating but claimed that they would benefit from  energy-efficiency advice. That is something on which we should focus. Something  similar to the energy assistance package that is being delivered in Scotland could  be considered.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">There are four key steps to that package. First, it offers  tariff advice. Although I appreciate that we do not have as much choice as  people in the rest of the UK,  we do have some options to seek better tariffs with alternative providers.  Secondly, the package provides energy efficiency advice to help people to  become more energy-wise. Thirdly, it brings together the various energy  efficiency initiatives into one programme so that all the options for home  improvements can be accessed through a one-stop shop. At present, there is a  lot of confusion about which schemes are still running and what their  eligibility criteria are. Finally, it aims to ensure income maximisation; that  is, it offers assistance in obtaining all the relevant benefits and sources of  income. That sort of joined-up approach could focus our efforts to truly deal  with fuel poverty.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">At present, the winter fuel payments are of significant  benefit to older people, and I urge the Minister to do all that he can to  ensure that they will continue to be paid at last year&rsquo;s rate. Although not a  long-term solution to the overall problem, income is one of the key factors  that influences whether a household is in fuel poverty. Until such times as  other factors &mdash; namely, fuel prices and energy efficiency &mdash; are adequately  tackled, we cannot realistically expect our older people to manage without that  income.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">It is clear from the debate that fuel poverty is a huge  challenge, and, as other Members highlighted, the green new deal, if we invest  enough in it, can make significant inroads into tackling it in the long term.  The key proposal for that in the green new deal would be the insulation scheme  to refurbish tens of thousands of existing homes, including the 137,000 homes  that currently fail to meet the decent homes standard. Therefore, I urge the  Minister &mdash;</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Draw your remarks to a close, please.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Cochrane</strong>:  &mdash; to address the problem of fuel poverty in the long term and, in the short  term, to do all that he can to ensure that the winter fuel payments are  reinstated at last year&rsquo;s level.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Easton</strong>: I  support the motion. Last winter was one of the coldest and most prolonged for  some time. It came at a time when families and friends met for Christmas in the  comfort of their homes to enjoy their holidays. Temperatures dropped to record  levels, leaving many people cold and having to keep their heating on  constantly, at huge cost to their families. Many people, however, were unable  to maintain heating their homes owing to the cost, and that left them open to  frozen pipes and having to live in what can only be described as arctic  conditions.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">I know of many oil companies that sought to take advantage  of the situation, and the price of a litre of fuel rose from 50p to 75p. Many  people were left with no choice but to pay it, and many others could not afford  to pay it.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">The recently published &lsquo;Northern Ireland House Condition  Survey 2009&rsquo; shows that 44% of households in Northern Ireland have to pay more  than 10% of their income for energy. The World Health Organization defines a  satisfactory heating regime as being 21&deg;C in the living room and 18&deg;C in other  areas, although households with specific needs may require different levels of  heating.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">The number of people living in fuel poverty in Northern Ireland far exceeds the number in other  regions of the UK,  which is most concerning. Those who are more likely to feel the effects of fuel  poverty or more likely to suffer health problems as a result of the cold  weather are the elderly population, which is rising fast. A Northern Ireland  Statistics and Research Agency (NISRA) report in 2009 stated that people over  60 years of age accounted for 16&middot;9% of the total population of Northern  Ireland. That presents a major challenge to the Government in seeking to  maintain the levels of funding provided for our elderly population, especially  with the cuts made to our block grant by the Tory-led coalition in London. Therefore, I  support the motion and the maintenance of the current level of winter fuel  payment, which has gone some way to eradicating fuel poverty and to limiting  the effects of cold weather.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Mr Agnew&rsquo;s amendment is well meaning and has some good  ideas for more profitable times; however, in the current economic climate many  of them are probably not affordable. I welcome DUP Minister Nelson McCausland&rsquo;s  boiler replacement scheme. It is targeted at people over 60 years of age who  live in private accommodation and who may not qualify under other Government  efficiency schemes. It will benefit many in my constituency, which has one of  the highest aged populations in Northern    Ireland. I hope that it will go a long way  to increase boiler efficiencies and result in savings, which are becoming more  difficult due to the soaring price of electricity, gas and oil.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brady</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I, too, support the motion and have  no disagreement with the amendment, but I think that it is a different issue,  as it is about taking on broader, longer-term efforts.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Over the four years that I have been in the Assembly, fuel  poverty has been debated umpteen times. Therefore it is time that a determined  effort was made to do something effective because a lot of lip service is paid  to the relief of fuel poverty but not a lot has actually been done. Fuel  poverty has been an issue and received policy attention here in the North only  since the publication of DSD&rsquo;s 2004 report &lsquo;Ending Fuel Poverty&rsquo; and the more  recent 2010 review &lsquo;Warmer Healthier Homes&rsquo;. The situation has also continued  to worsen because of escalating fuel prices. The main causes of fuel poverty  have already been mentioned: household income; fuel and energy costs; and the  energy efficiency of homes, particularly in rural areas. There are more than  300,000 people of retirement age today in the North, which is over 17% of the  population. Forty-four per cent of households here suffer fuel poverty compared  to Scotland with 33%, Wales with 20% and England with 16%. The problem is  much more acute here.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">There was an item in &lsquo;The Irish News&rsquo; on Saturday, by a  journalist who has obviously not been in the benefits system, about the Fuel  Poverty Coalition talking to the Minister about his new fuel poverty measure.  He said that the Fuel Poverty Coalition told the &lsquo;Belfast Telegraph&rsquo; that it  wants to see targeted support for all households in fuel poverty; but how can  you target support when you insist on a definition that covers almost half the  population? That shows an inherent ignorance of the problem. In Britain and in  the North we have the meanest pension scheme in the developed world. There is  almost &pound;2 million of unclaimed pension credit every week, which is something  that needs to be addressed. Perhaps more education is needed, particularly for  some of our journalists.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Although efforts have been made to alleviate the problem,  the situation has gotten much worse since the introduction of the fuel poverty  strategy in 2004. The Minister introduced the pilot boiler replacement scheme,  which was allegedly targeted at the most vulnerable, with the aim of improving  energy efficiency. It has proved to be confusing and difficult to claim, and it  appears to have missed those who are most vulnerable and in need of help. We  are faced with the stark reality for older people here that in 2004-05 there  were 293 excess winter deaths. That statistic was mentioned by several Members.  By 2009-2010, that figure had increased to approximately 900. That is an  appalling statistic, and we cannot repeat it enough to get the message home.  The message about excess winter deaths has certainly been repeated many times  before in the Assembly.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">There also is evidence that cold housing is linked to  diminished resistance to respiratory infection, hypothermia, bronchospasms,  ischaemic heart disease, myocardial infarction and strokes. As was mentioned,  the overall annual cost to the National Health Service in 2009 was almost &pound;900  million. Not enough has been done in the fight against fuel poverty; the  strategy is not working and needs urgent review.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Increasing older people&rsquo;s incomes will help them to deal  with the burden of energy bills. Several provisions could be introduced: the  automatic payment of pension credit, for example, could help to address low  incomes. I mentioned the fact that almost &pound;2 million in pension credit is  unclaimed weekly. Given the higher fuel poverty levels here, the Department of  Enterprise, Trade and Investment (DETI) must take a more proactive approach and  introduce a compulsory scheme by which energy suppliers must ease the burden  for vulnerable people.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">The warm homes scheme has certainly helped. However, there  is concern that reductions have been made to that successful scheme, given that  capital allocations are being cut. It is inconceivable that winter fuel  payments are being cut by &pound;50 for people aged between 60 and 80 and by &pound;100 for  those over 80. That is despite spiralling fuel prices and the fact that &mdash;</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Will the Member bring his remarks to a close?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brady</strong>: &mdash;  last December was the coldest in over 100 years. It seems that the Government  have not addressed the seriousness of the situation, which is set to increase,  given our increasing ageing population and energy costs. It is time to do something,  and we need to do it now.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Douglas</strong>:  I apologise; I am a bit hoarse. I was at a cross-community event in Glasgow yesterday.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">I fully support the motion, which, for me, is about  supporting the Age Sector Platform and its endeavours to maintain winter fuel  payments. It has been said many times before that the Assembly will be judged  not on how much talk there is at debates or on how many questions we ask but on  how we deliver actions that support the people of Northern Ireland, and indeed, how  we support the most vulnerable, particularly older people. We are talking about  people who have been the backbone of society and who have worked all their  lives and paid their taxes. Surely we should be supporting those older members  of our society in the twilight of their lives.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Like many Members, I have been in the homes of older people  who often have to choose between, as we have said before, food or fuel, or  where they switch off their electricity and sit in the dark and cold purely to  pay the bills that they are struggling with. We are talking about a generation  of older people, many of whom were brought up in poverty and who had to learn  the harsh realities of budgeting and dealing with the scarce amounts of money  coming into their homes. We are not just talking about a few extra bob in  people&rsquo;s pockets and wallets; we are talking about helping people to live their  lives just like the rest of us in normal society.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">If we rewind to last winter, which was the coldest that I  can remember, we will recall that there were problems with freezing and burst  pipes. Many people have outdated heating systems.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  I thank the Member for giving way. I hear what the Member is saying, and I am  sure that he is well intentioned, as indeed are many of the other Members who  spoke. However, what will the Member do or what will he urge the Government to  do other than what is contained in the motion about benefits? What does the  Member suggest the Government do about the green new deal, which is one of the  best mechanisms for introducing, on a comprehensive basis, energy efficiency in  homes and which would, in fact, reduce the level of dependency on antiquated  heating systems?</p>
		<p class="TimePeriod">1.45 pm</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member has an extra minute added to his time.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Douglas</strong>:  Thank you very much. That is a good question. I support many of those issues.  Our difficulty with the green new deal is that it seems disparate and lacks  co-ordination. I suppose that we will have the opportunity to debate those  issues in the future. Therefore, for me, the jury is out.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">As I said earlier, the reality is that many people,  particularly those who own their homes, have outdated heating systems.  Recently, I visited such a home. I am not talking about homes in areas that are  recognised as disadvantaged; I am talking about areas where people have worked  all their lives in decent jobs and have bought their own homes. However, as  people get older, particularly if their partner has died, they find it  increasingly difficult to pay their bills. They may have paid off their  mortgages. However, often, those people end up in poverty, never mind fuel  poverty. I am talking about a fair section of our society.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">This morning, I found out that between August 2009 and  August 2011, oil prices increased by some 63%. Something like 70% of homes in Northern Ireland  are heated by oil. I welcome the review into oil industry pricing that will be  published, I believe, in October 2011. Hopefully, we will see an opportunity to  encourage regulation of that industry.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">As other Members have said, we need to take seriously the  difficulties that will result from another harsh winter. One Member stated that  last year, there were 1,000 deaths because of the harsh winter.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Bring your remarks to a close, please.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Douglas</strong>:  We can research, raise issues and discuss fuel poverty. However, at the end of  the day, it is about doing something. Therefore, let us show our support for  the most vulnerable people in the community. I fully support the motion.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Swann</strong>: I,  too, support the motion. I have engaged with Age Sector Platform&rsquo;s chief  executive and board. They are keen to ensure that the motion and their campaign  to fight cuts to winter fuel payments receive full cross-party support. I hope  that that is achieved today.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">The motion states that the Assembly calls on the Minister  for Social Development to make representations to Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government to  continue to support Age Sector Platform. As DSD is the lead Department with  responsibility for tackling fuel poverty, I would have hoped that the Minister  had already raised that issue with Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government. However, I thank  the two Members for bringing the matter to the attention of the House and the  Minister.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">As has already been said, a society should be judged on how  it treats its most vulnerable people. We have heard a great deal of statistics  in the debate, particularly with regard to excess winter deaths. I remind the  House that when we talk about an excess winter death statistic, we are talking  about an individual; a person with family and friends. That is why we in the  House and society need to do more.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">When we reflect on DSD targets to eradicate poverty in  vulnerable households by 2010 and in all households by 2016, we should consider  that had those targets been met, it would have negated the need for the topic  to be raised in the House. In fact, the House has failed to meet any target  that has been set for the eradication of poverty in any sphere of society.  Indeed, further difficulties and problems are faced.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">The previous Programme for Government has also failed. I  think it was Lord Morrow who, when talking earlier, said that we have failed  here. Surely, the statistics demonstrate that we have failed here, particularly  given the number of debates that have taken place in this House on fuel  poverty.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">It was mentioned that 61&middot;5% of old people are living in  fuel poverty in Northern    Ireland, which is an increase from 47% in  2006. It was also mentioned that 83&middot;2% of lone older people are living in fuel  poverty, which is a staggering 21% increase since 2006. So, we seriously need  to take measures that can be adopted in this House and that our own ministerial  teams can work on.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">There has been mention of the green new deal and its lack  of co-ordination. I can also see a lack of co-ordination in and a fragmented  approach to the fight against fuel poverty. I reiterate the calls that have  already been made for a cross-departmental working group involving DSD, DETI,  the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (DARD), the Department of  Finance and Personnel (DFP) and the Department of Health.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Ladies and gentlemen, this is an issue that we can credibly  do something about and credibly fight for the sake of all our constituencies.  However, we also need to commit to educate people in our society. They need to  avail themselves of every penny that they are entitled to, and DSD must assist  them in doing that. It is up to better education systems to do that.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Over 40% of pensioners are in fuel poverty, and 13% are in  extreme fuel poverty, which means that over 25% of their annual household  income is spent on heating. More can be done to increase energy efficiency in  our homes. The warm homes scheme has a target of 9,000 households. I do not  think that that is an adequate response, because if it is a matter of ticking a  box for one household to achieve one of those 9,000 targets, we have failed  many in society who did not make it into that box.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Today, I received a copy of the Citizens Advice report,  which was issued ahead of the debate. One third of elderly clients in the  Citizens Advice survey have had to make the choice between heating and buying  other essential items such as food. We use the phrase &ldquo;heat or eat&rdquo; too  flippantly. It is just tripping off people&rsquo;s tongues, and we should take into  consideration what it actually means. It is not about deciding whether to eat  in a nice restaurant; it is about deciding whether to live.</p>

		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Will the Member bring his remarks to a close?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Swann</strong>:  OK. I hope that this debate is credible and realistic and that people want to  achieve honest outcomes from it rather than make headlines and get photo  opportunities.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCausland  (The Minister for Social Development)</strong>: I am grateful for the opportunity to  respond to the debate, and I thank the Members who contributed to it. I note  Members&rsquo; concerns and comments, and I particularly welcome the opportunity to  debate this aspect of fuel poverty. If my response fails to address any  specific points, I will, of course, write to Members separately.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">The motion recognises the serious problem of fuel poverty  among older people and the adverse impact that rising fuel bills are likely to  have on older people&rsquo;s ability to keep warm. I welcome the opportunity to  respond to the motion, which calls on me to make representations to Her  Majesty&rsquo;s Government for the rates of this year&rsquo;s winter fuel payment to be  paid at the same rate as that of the past three years, that is, &pound;250 for  pensioner households where someone is aged between 60 and 79 and &pound;400 where  someone is aged 80 or over.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Winter fuel payments are made to people who are over the  age of 60, with a higher rate paid to people over the age of 80. The payments  are not income related, nor are they linked to individual circumstances. They  do not take account of fuel poverty needs. They are paid to everyone who has  reached the qualifying age. For the coming winter, the standard rates of winter  fuel payments will be paid: &pound;200 for households with a pensioner aged under 80  and &pound;300 for households with anyone aged 80 or over.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Members will be aware that those aged under 80 will receive  &pound;50 less, and those aged over 80 &pound;100 less, than in the previous three years.  The increased rates for the past three years were temporary increases. No  increase was announced in the Budget, and the temporary increase will not be  continued for this winter.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">As Members are aware, the issue of fuel poverty is one that  cuts across Departments, and I have and will continue to engage with Executive  colleagues on this matter. A number of Members raised the issue of the  importance of a cross-departmental approach. I can assure Members that I have  raised issues in relation to this and have engaged with Ministers in other  Departments.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">At a time of rising gas, oil and coal prices, the issue of  fuel poverty is a real one for many people, and the focus should be on helping  those most in need. In addition to winter fuel payments, support is available  through cold weather payments for areas that suffer particularly cold weather.  Those payments are made when the temperature is, or is forecast to be, zero  Celsius or below for seven consecutive days. The temporary increase of this  payment from &pound;8&middot;50 to &pound;25 has been made permanent and is paid per cold weather  period.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">I would like to give Members some details of the wider  package, in addition to social security provision, that my Department has to  tackle fuel poverty. In April 2011, the Department launched its new fuel  poverty strategy entitled &lsquo;Warmer Healthier Homes&rsquo;. The strategy set our vision  for the future as:</p>
		<p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;a society in which people live in a warm, comfortable  home and need not worry about the effect of the cold on their health&rdquo;.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">The strategy places significant emphasis on the partnership  approach required to tackle fuel poverty and the cross-departmental nature of  the whole area of poverty.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">At a time of economic recession, rising unemployment and  cuts in welfare expenditure, more and more people are finding it difficult to  meet their energy costs. The strategy takes forward energy brokering, calls for  action on the price of oil imports, introduces a pilot boiler replacement  scheme and develops a range of other initiatives. I encourage everyone in the  Assembly to read the strategy carefully and to ensure that they are well  informed about it and that they encourage others to be better informed about it  so that people are aware of the various opportunities to tackle fuel poverty  and address the problem.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">The Department continues to fund the warm homes scheme,  which offers a range of insulation and heating measures to vulnerable  householders. Under the scheme, in excess of 80,000 households have been helped  with insulation and/or heating measures since it started in 2001. The Northern  Ireland Housing Executive administers an annual heating replacement scheme that  improves energy efficiency within the social housing sector.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Recently, the University  of Ulster launched a report entitled  &lsquo;Defining Fuel Poverty in Northern    Ireland: A preliminary review&rsquo;, and its  findings and recommendations will generate much debate. The report reaffirms  that, using the UK definition of fuel poverty, which is twice the median income  spend on energy &mdash; that is, 10% &mdash; Northern Ireland continues to show the highest  levels of fuel poverty in the United Kingdom. The report also recommends that,  to assist targeting of resources and initiatives, a regional target should be  developed based on twice the median regional spend &mdash; that is, a spend of 18%.  Using that approach would mean that 13% of households in Northern Ireland,  which equates to 75,000 households, will experience fuel poverty at that level.  This provides the Department with a very useful tool that will help to focus  initiatives on those most in need.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">I attended the launch of the report, and it was useful to  have there not only those who carried out this report but also the lady who was  the originator of the whole concept of fuel poverty and the 10% figure to get a  better understanding of the background to the statistics. One thing that I  picked up on was that the whole process of localisation or regionalisation with  regard to figures is not unique to Northern Ireland. It is happening  across the United Kingdom  with Scotland and Wales and in other regions of Europe.</p>
		<p class="TimePeriod">2.00 pm</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">The Social Security Agency has promoted a benefit uptake  programme since 2005. It has resulted in 337,000 older people being contacted  and additional benefits totalling &pound;27&middot;1 million being paid to those aged 60 and  over. I stress that point because a number of Members emphasised the need to  make older folk, in particular, aware of the opportunities for benefit  assistance.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">My Executive colleague Minister Wilson announced funding of  &pound;12 million for the green new deal concept over the comprehensive spending  review period 2011-14. My Department&rsquo;s permanent secretary is chairing a cross-departmental  group to examine the potential of the green new deal for Northern Ireland.  The group is working with the Green New Deal Group to help it to formalise a  business plan that can inform any economic appraisal on the best approach to  allocating the &pound;12 million identified by the Executive. The Green New Deal  Group was hoping to have the business plan with us by mid-September, but I  understand that it is now expected to submit the business plan by the end of  September. I have been working closely with my Executive colleague Minister  Foster on the development of the green new deal. I have asked officials to  consider all the current strands of work that support energy efficiency, carbon  reduction and renewable technology. All those initiatives display my  Department&rsquo;s commitment to helping older people to cope with their winter fuel  bills.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Allister</strong>:  I do not want to take the Minister off course, but I want to make this point  before he finishes dealing with the winter fuel allowance and the cutting thereof.  The House is saying today that many people depend on that full allowance. If it  transpires that the full allowance of the past &mdash; the &pound;250 and &pound;400 &mdash; is not  available, what consideration will the Minister give to the Executive funding  it? Has he costed it? If so, what would it cost, and is it possible? As the  Member for East Belfast said, if the House is  to be about anything, it has to be about delivery. Is there a prospect for  that? Has he costed what is asked for in the amendment, or is that just an  unimaginable, indefinable figure?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCausland</strong>:  The Member raised that point in an intervention earlier in the debate, and it  is one that I will address in due course.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Alex Maskey talked about the fuel poverty strategy and the  need for the road map. The new fuel poverty strategy outlines specific actions  that we believe are achievable. Officials will brief the Committee on Thursday  22 September. In advance of that, officials have provided an update on each of  the 14 actions that are detailed in the strategy. I am very keen to work with  the Committee in addressing these issues.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">A number of other points were raised by Members. I am sure  that Mr Allister is aware of the announcement that OFMDFM is looking at what  can be done to address fuel issues over the winter period. I understand that  that work is ongoing, and I am sure that there will be an announcement in due  course. The Member should take note of the fact that that was announced several  weeks ago.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">I met the Age Sector Platform to discuss the issue, and I  took on board its concerns. We suggest that more could be done, maybe with its  assistance and co-operation, to help older folk to become more aware of the  benefits that are available. It has a very good network of age sector  organisations and takes it down to the level of local senior citizens&rsquo; groups.  There is a marvellous opportunity there, and that is a good way of getting  information out to older people.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Michael Copeland asked for an update on the pilot boiler  replacement scheme. Some &pound;2 million has been set aside for a boiler replacement  scheme. The scheme offers a grant of up to &pound;1,500 towards the cost of  installing a new energy-efficient boiler. The rationale for the scheme was to  offer assistance to those who had previously missed out on government  assistance. All those potentially eligible applicants have been contacted, and  we have resources available to assist approximately 1,330 householders. If  there is scope left within the budget, we will look at assisting other  vulnerable groups.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">I will pick up on some other points that were raised. Mr  Copeland asked whether we were serious. I can assure him that we are serious.  In fact, I am surprised that he even posed the question. Of course we are  serious about it: it is a serious issue for many homes right across the  Province. He also asked whether it was honest to pose the question in the  motion or to say that we can do nothing, as Westminster is liable to say no. Westminster is indeed  liable to say no. His colleague Mr Swann said that he had hoped that I would  have raised the issue with the coalition Conservative-Liberal Democrat  Government at Westminster.  I could say that I would have hoped that he, as a member of a party that  campaigned as Conservatives and Unionists, would have raised the issue with his  Conservative colleagues already. He said that the response was inadequate. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span> It is obviously important for some people  down there to do more listening. He said that it was an inadequate response.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">It is true that we would like to do more, but, as one of my  colleagues mentioned, we have had &pound;4 billion taken out of the Northern Ireland  Budget over the four-year period of the comprehensive spending review by the  Conservative and Liberal Democrat coalition Government. There are, therefore,  limitations on what can be done but, within the limitations, we will certainly  do all that we can and make it a priority.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Alban Maginness said that &pound;20 million for the green new  deal was not enough. He is not here any more. In a sense, that is true, but,  again, there are financial constraints with &pound;4 billion taken out of the Budget.  If he is suggesting that perhaps his party colleague in DOE is happy to  surrender more money so that we can put more into those schemes, I would be  happy for Alban &mdash; perhaps colleagues would pass the message on to him &mdash; to  lobby his colleague Mr Attwood. If more money were available, we could  certainly make good use of it.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Mrs Cochrane raised the issue of better technology. In  recent weeks, I have visited a number of firms in Northern Ireland that are at the  forefront of energy efficiency technology. It is good to know that we have  companies that are not only helping to address issues of fuel poverty through  technology but are helping Northern Ireland to increase employment by exporting  that technology to many parts of the world.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Will the Minister bring his remarks to a close, please?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCausland</strong>:  I think that I have covered most of the points, and I am happy to leave the  matter.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Agnew</strong>: I  welcome the Minister&rsquo;s comments on the work to date on the green new deal. I  will speak a bit more about that later in my speech, but I dare say that he  will not be surprised that I hope that more can be done and more money can be  put into the green new deal programme. I also thank Mr Copeland for his  correction: it is, of course, over 300,000 homes, not people, in Northern Ireland  that suffer fuel poverty. I appreciate him pointing out that I got that one  wrong.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Mr Copeland also highlighted the fact that there are two  different definitions of fuel poverty. I warn against the more recent  definition, which looks at the regional prices and the current prices of  energy. If we keep moving to where the median is, no matter how high fuel  prices go &mdash; even if they go as high as 100% of someone&rsquo;s income &mdash; according to  the recent definition, that would mean that families who spend all their money  on fuel may not be classed as living in fuel poverty, which seems to me  somewhat bizarre. I appreciate the Minister&rsquo;s point that it helps us to see  where the most severe instances of fuel poverty are, but we should work with  the wider definition.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Robin Swann highlighted the important fact that what we are  doing is clearly not working. Fuel poverty is on the rise, and we need to do  something more or something different. As I pointed out earlier, each year, as  energy prices go up, the winter fuel payment has less and less value to  householders as the amount of oil, gas or other fuel that they can purchase  decreases. Without energy efficiency measures, the winter fuel payment  literally sends money up in smoke.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">I appreciate the fact that the Minister highlighted the  work that is taking place. However, we need not only cross-departmental working  but the finance to back it up, in what I refer to as pooled budgets. It is fine  and well that Ministers have input to what should be done, but, if money &mdash; or  at least initiatives &mdash; does not come from the Departments, that  cross-departmental working will just be lip service. Pooled budgets are  necessary across a number of areas in the Assembly and are certainly necessary  on the issue of fuel poverty.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">I will move to the green new deal, which is the focus of my  amendment. As Judith Cochrane pointed out, we have many initiatives to tackle  fuel poverty, but they are disparate. The green new deal will provide a  one-stop shop where people can find all the advice that they require in one  place to help to address their difficulties in meeting fuel payments.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">I will answer Mr Allister&rsquo;s question about how much it will  cost. The Green New Deal Group&rsquo;s original business plan highlighted the fact  that &pound;72 million of public spending would invite &pound;181 million of private sector  spending. I know that the group is revising the plan to meet the Department&rsquo;s  standards. The same people who say that we cannot afford that also say that we  should cut corporation tax, which would mean upwards of &pound;300 million coming out  of the public sector spend. My argument is that we should scrap the idea of  cutting corporation tax and put the money in invest-to-save schemes to prevent  problems such as fuel poverty, which has such a detrimental effect on the  health of our society.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">By investing in the green new deal, we can create thousands  of jobs, reduce carbon emissions and, most importantly in this debate, tackle  fuel poverty. We cannot afford to pass up this opportunity to make an  investment that will create extra private sector support, boost the economy and  have beneficial social impacts. I call on the House to support the amendment  and thank Members for giving me this time.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Frew</strong>:  Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for the opportunity to speak on the motion. I  thank Members for their general support. The debate has addressed the wider  issues around fuel poverty, and rightly so. At this time, it is an important  issue in our country and for our people.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">The Member for North Antrim Mr McIlveen and I tabled the  motion: it is simple in nature and targeted. Many times in the past year, I  have sat in the Chamber and heard motions being debated that represent what  could be described as Utopia, somewhere we would like to be or aspire to be but  cannot really get to. We are asking the Minister to perform a simple task on  behalf of the Assembly for the people of Northern Ireland, which is to lobby  and persuade Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government to reverse their decision on winter fuel  payments.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">The motion is simple and specific because, at the recent  pensioners&rsquo; parliament, the most popular motion relating to energy prices was,  in fact, to do with the winter fuel cut. Almost 97% of those who attended those  events asked the Government to reverse their decision. We are talking about  cuts of only &pound;50 and &pound;100, but that is how desperate the most vulnerable in  society are. In the greater scheme of things, they could have asked for  something that would be very hard to adopt, but they are simply asking for the  decision to be reversed. Of course, &pound;50 and &pound;100 will not solve many issues,  but, for one or two people, it might be the difference between life and death,  which is a point that I want the Minister to take across to Westminster.</p>
		<p class="TimePeriod">2.15 pm</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">I acknowledge the Minister&rsquo;s commitment to tackling the  serious issue of fuel poverty. Mr McIlveen and I invited the Minister to come  to Ballymena last Thursday, when we talked about issues such as town centre  regeneration and social housing areas. The Minister saw at first hand the  deprivation that there can be in a highly successful town such as Ballymena,  where people drive in and out along main thoroughfares to shop and for  employment and recreation yet sometimes drive by deprivation on the grandest  scale without seeing it. It is fair to say that Ballymena has some well-kept  secrets, one of which is the scale of deprivation in some areas. I am sure that  the Minister&rsquo;s eyes were opened to Ballymena. He represents North   Belfast, which also has those issues, but he saw at first hand how  Ballymena could also come into that category. I thank him for his time last  Thursday. His visit will be very useful when I go to him about such issues,  because he has seen what I am talking about. I warn him that my visit is just  round the corner.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">I acknowledge the action taken by DSD, the Minister for  Social Development and his predecessor on the &pound;2 million boiler replacement  scheme, which will benefit 1,300 successful applicants. I should also mention  the capital funding for the warm homes scheme of &pound;15 million, &pound;15&middot;5 million,  &pound;16 million and &pound;16&middot;5 million over the next four years, which will be spent on  private sector houses. In addition, this year, the Housing Executive will spend  &pound;16 million from its maintenance budget on fuel poverty measures, including  heating adaptations, heating replacements and thermal comfort improvements. All  of that adds up to helping people. People will say that we could do more, and, of  course, we could, but I remind Members that we underwent a very difficult  Budget process, during which we debated those same issues. There is no  one-size-fits-all approach. We have to think of the full spectrum of government  and of the Province as a whole. Therefore, I commend the Minister and his  Department for their work to date.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">In fuel poverty, we face a dangerous and fast-moving enemy.  In the past two years, the cost of heating oil has risen by over 63%. On 1  October, electricity prices will rise by 18&middot;6%. In greater Belfast, gas prices have risen by 39%, and,  in the 10 towns area, which I represent, they will rise by 28% on 1 October.  Coal prices are also set to rise this month by up to 10%, and the price of LPG  rose by 9% in August. All that while annual salaries have been frozen or,  worse, cut by up to 15% in some households and, worse still, people have lost  their job. I know that the motion refers specifically to the elderly, but we  must also remember that the issue affects those at the other extreme &mdash; the  young and their families. Of course, when families are supported, they will, in  turn, support their elderly and loved ones.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">I cannot understand Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government&rsquo;s decision to  cut the payment. It is not logical to cut &pound;50 from the payment of those in the  age range 60-79 while the over 80s are to expect a cut of &pound;100. That just does  not add up. Her Majesty&rsquo;s coalition Government have used twisted logic to  implement that cut. We can argue about the standards of fuel poverty, the bar  set and the criteria used. However, it does not matter whether the  qualifications change from one day to another: the people, the householders and  the elderly folk affected by fuel poverty will still be in the same scenario.  There should be logic in the Government&rsquo;s decision and in the measurement of  fuel poverty. That would mean that we would be able to target the 13% of people  who will be affected most by fuel poverty and for whom it could well mean the  difference between life and death.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">From talking to elderly folk in my constituency, I know  that they have been extremely worried over the summer months. However, they are  not worried about what they are going to spend their money on or what they are  going to buy their grandchildren for Christmas. They are not worried about  dipping into their savings or about their mobility once the frost comes or  whether they will damage a hip or break a leg. Those are the things that  elderly folk normally worry about, but they are not worried about those things  any more. They are worried about whether they will see March. That is the  important issue on which the Assembly must focus its mind. Many Members spoke  about how many people die each year because of the cold in the winter months.  My colleague Mr McIlveen and I tabled the motion to ask the Minister to do a  simple task.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">I acknowledge the amendment proposed by Mr Agnew. I  understand, from his policies and politics, why he moved it. It does not fit  well with the motion because it targets a specific task, but I understand why  he has put it forward, and I understand about the green new deal. We will, of  course, be sympathetic to it and its long-term strategy. However, things have  to move in that regard. Mr Agnew knows that I come from the construction  industry. I know that things have to change, even in that industry, to make  that work. Simply asking any Minister or Department to throw more money at it  will not achieve the objectives of the green new deal. That is what concerns me  most: we must make sure that the vehicle is in place to make those objectives  workable. It is with grave concern that we are at this point, but I am not sure  whether the green new deal has got that far yet. He talked about equipment  going into households, but it is not affordable for ordinary people.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member should bring his remarks to a close.</p>

		<p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question, That the amendment be made, put and agreed  to.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Main Question, as amended, put and agreed to.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
		<p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly recognises the serious problem of fuel  poverty, especially amongst older people; acknowledges the adverse impact that  rising fuel bills are likely to have on the ability of older people to keep  warm and healthy; and calls on the Minister for Social Development to make  representations to Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government to continue to support Age Sector  Platform&rsquo;s call to maintain this year&rsquo;s winter fuel payment at its current  level of &pound;250 for pensioner households where someone is aged between 60 and 79  and &pound;400 where someone is aged 80 and over; and further calls on the Minister  to increase funding for the green new deal to provide the energy efficiency  measures required to tackle fuel poverty in the long term.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: As Question Time commences at 2.30 pm, I suggest that the House  takes its ease until that time.</p>

		<p class="OralAnswers-H2DepartmentHeading">Finance and Personnel</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Question 4 has been transferred to the Office of the First  Minister and deputy First Minister and will receive a written answer. Question  13 has been withdrawn and requires a written answer.</p>
		<p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Civil Service: Equal Pay</p>
		<p class="OralAnswers-Question">1. <strong>Mr &Oacute;  hOis&iacute;n </strong>asked the Minister of Finance and Personnel to outline what  discussions he has had with trade unions and other representative groups in  relation to equal pay settlements for civil servants. (AQO 309/11-15<a name="AQO309/11-15" id="AQO309/11-15"></a>)</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wilson (The  Minister of Finance and Personnel)</strong>: In the run-up to the determination of  the final settlement of the equal pay issue, I met with the Northern Ireland  Public Service Alliance (NIPSA) representatives on two occasions, in October  and November 2009, and my predecessor met with NIPSA in May 2009.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr &Oacute; hOis&iacute;n</strong>:  Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Will the Minister ensure that  the Department engages in genuine negotiation with representatives of all  groups affected to reach a satisfactory outcome? Can he give us an idea of a  cut-off point at which this no longer is an issue?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wilson</strong>:  All the groups that were affected under the Civil Service scheme have been met,  and, as far as we are concerned, the remit of the Department of Finance and  Personnel was to deal with members of the Civil Service who had an equal pay  claim. That has been dealt with. The lump sum has been paid and the new pay  grades have been introduced. Some others have put in equal pay claims. That is  an issue for their employer, which will be either the Department of Justice or  an arm&rsquo;s-length body. It is for them to determine whether there is a pay claim.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  How many civil servants, including retirees, are involved in the equal pay  claim? If he is not able to provide the figures today, perhaps he will give an  undertaking to provide them at a later date.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wilson</strong>:  The retirees were not part of the agreement. Those who retired six months  previous to when the equal pay claim was lodged would not have been eligible  under the law. I have made it clear on a number of occasions in the Assembly  that that issue is closed. I know that some who left the Civil Service six  months before the claim was lodged feel that they are entitled to it, and some  MLAs agree. I have not been told how far back one would go. Secondly, there  would be an issue with the details of those particular individuals, and, thirdly,  the further back one went, the more it would cost. How would we deal with the  cost? It is one thing for Members to say that retirees should generally be  covered by it, but we can deal only with pay claims that have some legal  standing. The legal advice is very clear: those who left six months before the  claim was lodged are not eligible.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Copeland</strong>:  Will the Minister comment on the current situation, particularly on the  breach-of-contract cases being taken by civil servants employed by the Police  Service of Northern Ireland?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wilson</strong>:  PSNI staff, we believe, are and should be excluded from the Northern Ireland  Civil Service pay claim. Their pay delegation went to the NIO in 1996. PSNI  staff are now under the Department of Justice, and the responsibility for their  pay rests with their current employer. My officials and I have had discussions  with the Department of Justice and the PSNI to explain the situation. In their  own organisation, there may well be grounds for an equal pay claim. However,  staff have to justify that by the determining whether there is a difference  between those at Administrative Assistant and Administrative Office grades and  those at some other technical grade and, if so, whether that difference  constitutes an equal pay claim. If that is the case, it is for the Department  of Justice and the police to deal with, but the Civil Service scheme was clear:  it covered only those whose pay the Department of Finance and Personnel was  responsible for &mdash; that is, members of the Civil Service.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Allister</strong>:  On another, different dimension of equal pay: a pay freeze is supposed to be in  operation across the Civil Service. Why then, on 18 July, did the Minister pick  out one section of supposed civil servants &mdash; political special advisers &mdash; and  give them a freeze-busting increase of &pound;7,500 at the upper end of band B? Why  did he do the First Minister&rsquo;s bidding in that regard and wreak havoc with the  pay freeze that is supposed to apply to civil servants?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wilson</strong>:  The Member seems very interested in everybody else&rsquo;s pay. I could take that  from some other Members. He does not like this: but, this is the Member who  goes to court to keep his own pay &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. The Minister has been asked a question and is giving his  reply. May we have order in the Chamber, please?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wilson</strong>:  You see, the Member does not like the truth being told. He loves to point the  finger. He loves to posture. He loves to blame everybody else and to identify  what he believes are the faults of everybody else. He would have a bit more  credibility if he were prepared to show some transparency about the money that  he gets from the public purse, instead of looking at the money that other  people get or he believes that they get.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Allister</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Will the Member take his seat? No points of order are taken during  Question Time. You may raise the matter later, if you wish. I call Alasdair  McDonnell with the next question.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr McDonnell</strong>:  Thank you very much, Mr Deputy Speaker. I will be a bit more restrained than  heretofore.</p>
		<p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Infrastructure Funding</p>
		<p class="OralAnswers-Question">2. <strong>Dr  McDonnell </strong>asked the Minister of Finance and Personnel what consideration  his Department has given to issuing bonds to fund essential infrastructure.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 310/11-15<a name="AQO310/11-15" id="AQO310/11-15"></a>)</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wilson</strong>:  OK. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span> I thank the Member, and we know of  his customary restraint, although I am sure that he will not be as restrained  in his battle for the leadership of the party. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span> I am sure that he will be fairly robust when it comes to that. I was going to  wish him all the best, but that may be the death knell for him, so I will not. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span> I will refrain from that.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">The issue of issuing a bond has come up time and time again  and has been looked at by officials as part of schemes to try to identify ways  of bringing additional spending into the public sector for projects that have  not been financed through our departmental expenditure limit allocation or the  sale of assets.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">I have explained the difficulty with this issue to the  House on a number of occasions. The difficulty is that, if the Executive borrow  money, the Treasury takes that to be part of the borrowing for the whole of the  United Kingdom, and, if  borrowing targets are set, the Treasury simply reduces the money that is given  to Northern Ireland  in accordance with the amount borrowed. That would not benefit us. In fact, if  anything, it would be detrimental, because money that we get in for capital  spending as part of the block grant, with no interest attached, would be  replaced with borrowing on which we would have to pay interest. That is the  difficulty around the bond issue. So, it really would not be of any benefit to  us. Although, I have no doubt that, were it possible to issue bonds that do not  have such an impact, we could raise additional capital because people would be  prepared to invest in them.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr McDonnell</strong>:  I thank the Minister for that answer. As I look out there, I am frustrated  because the whole construction industry is paralysed. Yet, a lot of essential  infrastructure could be put in place at current rates if we could borrow money  to do so. Let us look, for instance, at schools. We need a number of schools.  We could probably get them at 20% of a discount on what they may cost in five  years&rsquo; time.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr McDonnell</strong>:  Are there other ways? If we cannot raise money at Executive level, could the  education and library boards, local councils or others find ways and means of  doing so?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wilson</strong>: I  thought that when the Member said that he was &ldquo;frustrated&rdquo;, he was inviting me  to give an answer similar to that of the Prime Minister, but I assure him that  I will not.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">The Member is right. I have had discussions with the  Construction Employers Federation. I am still waiting for a paper from the  federation on alternative ways in which it could bring additional funding to  the table. The Member rightly identified that, at this time, many of the  infrastructure projects that we know must be undertaken &mdash; schools, investment  in the Health Service, roads, or whatever &mdash; could be done much more cheaply  today than in two or three years&rsquo; time when the economy picks up. One way of  looking at the situation is to determine whether we can, through private  investment initiatives, get building done for the public sector. Can the  construction industry itself find ways of raising money? Indeed, and this will  be a painful choice for the Assembly, are there ways in which we can divorce  from the public sector some of the bodies that need capital spend to get the  required work done, so that we could use the revenue streams that they would  generate? In housing, for example, we could increase rents, which could provide  an income stream against which borrowing could be obtained. However, we would  then have to move housing out of the public sector and into some arm&rsquo;s-length  body.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr G Kelly</strong>:  Will the Minister provide an assessment of the cost to the Executive of issuing  bonds? You said earlier that you were against that option, but have you made  that assessment?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wilson</strong>:  It would depend on the rate of interest on the bond market at that time. That,  in turn, would depend on our credit rating as an Executive and what rate of  interest UK  bonds in general would attract. At present, because of the United Kingdom&rsquo;s AAA rating, the rate of  interest for UK Government borrowing is very low compared with that for the  Republic, Italy  and other places. Some might say that that is the result of the budgetary  policies that the Westminster  Government are following. However, at any particular time, the market will  determine that.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Overend</strong>:  I want to pick up on a point raised by Dr McDonnell. Will the Minister advise  whether local authorities have the necessary powers to raise similar bonds or  mortgages to assist their development?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wilson</strong>:  Yes, local authorities have the power to raise money and borrow in that way,  and that does not score against our departmental expenditure limit or become  part of the total borrowing sum that the Treasury set down. Of course, their  problem is that they have a limited range of things on which they can spend the  money. Also, some of them may be more cautious about doing that than others,  because the repayment of interest over the period would, of course, have a  revenue consequence for ratepayers. However, local authorities are one set of  bodies that could borrow, and their borrowing would not score against our  departmental expenditure limit.</p>
		<p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Small Business Rate Relief Scheme</p>
		<p class="OralAnswers-Question">3. <strong>Mr Lyttle </strong>asked the Minister of Finance and Personnel for an update on the small  business rate relief scheme.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO  311/11-15<a name="AQO311/11-15" id="AQO311/11-15"></a>)</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wilson</strong>:  The Department has been consulting on the proposals to expand the main scheme  of the small business rate relief scheme. Given the constrained public finances  at present, we believe that that increase can be funded only from something  other than public expenditure. That is why we proposed a levy on larger retail  premises. That levy requires new legislation, and if we are to have it in place  by April 2012, which is the aim, it will require accelerated passage. The  scheme is designed to last for three years. It is a recession response from the  Executive. It is not something that we see as going beyond the three-year  period.</p>
		<p class="TimePeriod">2.45 pm</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lyttle</strong>: I  thank the Minister for the update on the scheme. What other mechanisms is the  Minister pursuing to assist small businesses at this time?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wilson</strong>:  We already have the rate relief scheme for small businesses. The proposal that  we have out for consultation, which will finish on 18 October, will double the  number of businesses brought into the scheme. However, a number of other  schemes and initiatives are being introduced to help small businesses. For  instance, the Department for Social Development is promoting a lot of  regeneration schemes for town centres, and the Department for Regional  Development is doing work to enhance street landscapes to improve such areas.  Of course, we still have the manufacturing rate relief for many of the small  manufacturing businesses, which is capped at 30%. That is designed to reduce  the overheads of some of the smaller manufacturing businesses.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Campbell</strong>:  Given that a number of small businesses are just starting out in some towns and  are trying to compete with large businesses located at the edge of town or out  of town, will the Minister outline the type of business that might benefit from  the scheme? Will he indicate the level of support that might be provided?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wilson</strong>:  We have not restricted the scheme to any particular type of business. It is  designed to capture businesses that have a rateable value of &pound;10,000 or less.  Some people have argued that it could be better targeted and that we should be  selecting particular types of businesses. However, since this is to be a  three-year scheme, since we had wanted to keep the administration costs to an  absolute minimum, because we want the money to go to businesses and not to an  expensive administration system, and since there is always a difficulty if the  onus is on a business to apply rather than having an automatic deduction of  money from the business&rsquo;s rates, we have gone for what some people might  describe as a fairly blunt instrument. We believe it is the quickest way of  getting help to small businesses. It provides 20% rate relief for businesses  with a valuation between &pound;10,000 and &pound;5,000 and 50% for those with a rateable  value of &pound;5,000 or less.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  Although I am sure that all Members welcome the sentiments the Minister is  expressing in the Chamber, does the Minister accept that, ultimately, we will  have to be a lot more radical about addressing some of the significant  structural issues facing many small businesses? Will the Minister express an  opinion on whether it may require the option of a rating model that is related  to the turnover of the business rather than to the rental income or value of  the property?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wilson</strong>:  In the proposals, we have invited businesses to make other suggestions that  they believe would be more effective than the suggestions that I have made in  the policy document. I am not wedded to one particular idea merely because it  came from me. If someone comes up with a different or better idea, or one that  is more effective or cost-effective, it will be considered. The difficulty with  the suggestion that the Member for South Belfast  has made is that it is difficult to get a clear picture of the turnover of some  businesses. It would be much more open to manipulation. At least there is an  objective database of the valuation of a business. Turnover can be manipulated  in different ways. For that reason, we have not considered that suggestion.  However, we are looking at any credible suggestions that come forward for the  short term and, more importantly, for the longer term, and we will continue to  do so.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Swann</strong>:  Have the major retail outlets responded positively to the consultation process?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wilson</strong>: I  have met all the major retailers &mdash; Tesco, Asda and Sainsbury&rsquo;s &mdash; and the  British Retail Consortium, and, to be fair, I think that they have not been  madly enthusiastic about the scheme. However, I will point out that the  proposal affects about 100 businesses across Northern   Ireland, which account for about 1% of the total number  of retailers in Northern    Ireland. The levy will work out at about  0&middot;25% of their turnover. It is, of course, a temporary measure for the next  three years. When it is explained in those terms, it becomes and is seen to be  less onerous than perhaps some of them have depicted it. However, nobody votes  for an extra increase in any tax, so you would expect the major retailers to  have been fairly critical of the proposal.</p>
		<p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Corporation Tax</p>
		<p class="OralAnswers-Question">5. <strong>Mrs  Dobson </strong>asked the Minister of Finance and Personnel for an update on the  discussions he has had with Her Majesty&rsquo;s Treasury on the devolution of  corporation tax.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 313/11-15<a name="AQO313/11-15" id="AQO313/11-15"></a>)</p>
		<p class="OralAnswers-Question">12. <strong>Ms  Boyle </strong>asked the Minister of Finance and Personnel for an update on the  discussions he has had with Treasury regarding the devolution of corporation  tax. (AQO 320/11-15<a name="AQO320/11-15" id="AQO320/11-15"></a>)</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wilson</strong>:  With your permission, Mr Deputy Speaker, I will answer questions 5 and 12  together.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">The Government consultation closed early in July, and there  have been over 700 responses to it. I cannot give the Assembly the breakdown of  those responses at present. The Chancellor has indicated that the Government  will respond some time in the autumn, and we are currently considering the  responses that the Treasury has received. Of course, there is a lot of work to  be done in determining the amount that this would cost, as well as in  determining other factors that might help to mitigate the cost.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Dobson</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his answer. What is his opinion of whether full  control over corporation tax should be devolved to Northern Ireland or whether our  involvement should be limited to setting the rate of tax?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wilson</strong>: I  do not think that there is any point in our replicating the administrative  arrangements that are already in place. We had a couple of meetings with  Treasury Ministers at which representatives of business and accountancy firms  were present. They indicated that that really would not be to their advantage  and, indeed, that most firms would probably resist having to deal with a separate  administrative arrangement in Northern Ireland as well as with the Treasury,  especially those firms that may have outlets here and in the rest of GB. So, it  is my view that the administrative arrangements should still be carried out by  Her Majesty&rsquo;s Treasury and that we then pay for that. What the cost of that  administration should be is an area for negotiation. Currently, we have been  given a figure that I think is ridiculously high, and we have to look at that.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">As far as the devolution of the rate is concerned, that  will be a decision for the Assembly.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Boyle</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Can the Minister give an indication  as to whether the North will be designated an enterprise zone for that?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wilson</strong>: I  assume that the Member means Northern    Ireland.<span class="Italic"> [Interruption.]</span></p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">The Government have designated a number of areas in other  parts of the United Kingdom  as enterprise zones. I am still not quite clear as to what exactly they mean by  an enterprise zone in relation to Northern Ireland. At one stage, the  Secretary of State felt that the whole of Northern Ireland could be an  enterprise zone. I do not think that that is really a practical proposition,  but we will look at what is happening with enterprise zones in other parts of  the United Kingdom  and at what allowances there are for planning and capital and so on. Whether  that is an appropriate model in a place such as Northern Ireland, I do not know.  Our past experience of enterprise zones has been that they do not generate  additional employment; it is more a case of displacement, with firms moving  from one side of the line to the other. I am not so sure that that would be a  satisfactory way forward.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr I McCrea</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his answers so far.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">The Minister has outlined as best he can, without giving  too much detail, the outcome of the consultation. Will he outline what other  fiscal measures, other than an adjustment to the rate of corporation tax, would  make Northern Ireland a more attractive area for investment?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wilson</strong>: A  number of things have been discussed time and again in the Assembly. Businesses  come to me all the time to talk about the cost of regulation. We really ought  to look at that. One of the things that heartens me about the current problems  in the euro zone is the prospect that we may well be able to renegotiate our  relationship with Europe and get rid of many costly regulations that are very  often irrelevant, tie the hands of business in Northern Ireland, and about  which the Assembly can do nothing because they are passed down to us. That is  one thing that could be done.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Arlene Foster is already looking at tax credits for  research and development, and investment allowances. Firms in Northern Ireland  are already benefiting from the reduction in National Insurance contributions.  I asked a question of the Treasury Minister the other week and I was pleased to  find out that about 20 firms in my own constituency benefit from that. That  brings down the cost of labour.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">There is another big issue. I hope that the Minister of the  Environment will not be diverted by his pursuit of the leadership of the SDLP,  but will get down to doing something about the planning system. I am sure that  the Minister will look at what can be done to reduce that burden and enable  business decisions to be made much more quickly as a result of quicker planning  decisions.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Agnew</strong>:  When alternative proposals are put to the Minister in Budget debates, he is  often heard to ask how we are we supposed to pay for them. Given the huge  expense of the deduction from the Northern Ireland block grant if devolution of  corporation tax were to take place, will he please outline how he proposes to  pay for that? Will it be by top-slicing? If so, will that include health,  education and justice? Will we get to a level of top-slicing that is more like  cutting the middle right out of our Government Departments?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wilson</strong>:  The Member raises a good point. I have been at the forefront in saying that we  cannot accept the devolution of corporation tax if it will have a massive  impact on our current spending. One of the reasons why there have to be very  hard negotiations with the Treasury over the autumn is to make sure that we do  not get a bill for the devolution of corporation tax that is totally  unsustainable. No provision has been made in the current four-year Budget for  the devolution of corporation tax, so even if we got the bill down to a  manageable figure, there would still be an impact, unless it is phased in or  deferred.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Many people argue that the certainty that the tax rate will  be down to a certain level by a certain time will influence investment  decisions. As there is a long lead-in for investment decisions, I do not  believe that we will see a reduction in the rate of corporation tax within the  lifetime of this Assembly. It will come after that.</p>
		<p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">DFP: Procurement</p>
		<p class="OralAnswers-Question">6. <strong>Mr  Elliott </strong>asked the Minister of Finance and Personnel for his assessment of  whether the procurement system currently used by the Central Procurement  Directorate is of benefit to small and medium-sized enterprises.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 314/11-15<a name="AQO314/11-15" id="AQO314/11-15"></a>)</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wilson</strong>: I  thank the Member for the question. It is best answered by citing some of the  statistics. Between May 2008 and November 2010, 73% of all contracts issued by  the Central Procurement Directorate went to small and medium-sized enterprises.  I am not complacent about that. Small and medium-sized enterprises are usually  the kinds of firm that are based in Northern Ireland, and we want to  encourage them.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">The Member will understand that, again, our hands are tied  by European directives about competition, etc. We see many judicial reviews of  procurement processes. However, we seek to maximise the procurement  opportunities for smaller businesses and we have implemented, for example, the  eSourcing single portal, which small businesses can log onto and which lists  all government opportunities worth over &pound;30,000, so that businesses can see if  there is an opportunity for them. We have looked at how we can simplify the  process and the paperwork involved in tendering.</p>

		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: For Members&rsquo; information, question 4 has been withdrawn and will  require a written answer.</p>
		<p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Community Pharmacies: Remuneration</p>
		<p class="OralAnswers-Question">1. <strong>Mr Boylan </strong>asked the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety whether he  has any plans to review the drugs tariff formula used to pay pharmacies. (AQO 324/11-15<a name="AQO324/11-15" id="AQO324/11-15"></a>)</p>
		<p class="OralAnswers-Question">11. <strong>Mrs D  Kelly </strong>asked the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety for  his assessment of whether there will be a detrimental impact on service  delivery as a result of the proposed 30% cut in the community pharmacy budget.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 334/11-15<a name="AQO334/11-15" id="AQO334/11-15"></a>)</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots (The  Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety)</strong>: Mr Deputy Speaker,  with your permission, I will answer questions 1 and 11 together.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">The Department recognises the fact that it has an  obligation to provide fair and reasonable remuneration for community  pharmacies. In January 2010, the High Court found that arrangements in place at  that time did not meet that obligation. Thereafter, the Department and the  Health and Social Care (HSC) Board engaged in extensive negotiations with  Community Pharmacy Northern Ireland (CPNI) in an attempt to reach agreement on  community pharmacy arrangements in 2011-12. However, agreement could not be  reached.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">New arrangements were introduced with effect from 1 April  2011 to meet my Department&rsquo;s ongoing statutory obligation to provide fair and  reasonable remuneration. CPNI has brought a further judicial review challenge  to the new remuneration and reimbursement arrangements, and, against that  background, it would be inappropriate for me to comment further on community  pharmacy remuneration in case it would have any prejudicial effect on the  hearing, which is scheduled for 20 and 21 September. I do not accept, however,  the assertions that are being made by CPNI, and I assure Members that I am  committed to providing &mdash; indeed, I am required by law to provide &mdash; a fair and  reasonable system of remuneration to community pharmacists in Northern Ireland.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Boylan</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for his  answer. Does he accept the fact that pharmacies play a crucial role in  providing healthcare and advice in rural communities?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  Absolutely. Very often, they are in the front line, and I therefore remain  committed to ensuring that we have strong, community-based pharmacies. I should  say that we are dealing with something that was brought about under the  previous Administration. The judicial review was sought under the previous  Administration, and leave for it was granted in that period. Therefore, I have  been somewhat constrained in dealing with the issue, which causes me some  concern. I appeal again to the community pharmacists&rsquo; organisation to withdraw  its judicial review and allow negotiations to take place.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  If we accept that there will be a detrimental impact on pharmacy services  across Northern Ireland,  will the Minister undertake to maintain a geographical spread of pharmacies so  that the impact of any reduction is not borne by rural communities in  particular?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  Currently, in Northern Ireland,  per head of population, there are 100 more pharmacies than in any other part of  the United Kingdom.  We have 30 pharmacists for every 100,000 head of population, whereas in England there are 21, in Scotland there are 23, and in Wales there are  24. Clearly, we have a considerable number of pharmacists. It is important that  we continue to have pharmacists in our rural villages and in deprived areas,  which is why I am happy to negotiate with pharmacists. However, I cannot  negotiate in circumstances in which a judicial review is pending.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Craig</strong>:  Does the Minister find it appropriate that people can get prescriptions for  drugs that are commonly commercially available over the counter to anyone who  wishes to purchase them?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: I  have concerns about that. We intend to look at that issue because there is a  problem. People are getting prescriptions for drugs such as antihistamines,  Anadin and Brufen, which can easily be bought over the counter at a low cost.  We have already issued guidelines on the use of glucosamine, for example. We  can make considerable savings by ensuring that people do not get those drugs on  prescription but buy them over the counter without causing huge pain to the  public purse.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">I should make it clear that this Executive, this Assembly  and this country spend around &pound;460 million a year on pharmaceuticals. That is  almost as much money as is spent by the entire Department for Regional  Development. Therefore, we need to achieve better efficiencies in the system.  We need to get value for money. We need to eradicate a lot of the waste of  drugs that we buy and to maximise the amount of generics that we use. There is  a lot of work to be done on that issue, and a lot of savings could be made.  Community pharmacists perform an important role in the delivery of the health  service in Northern Ireland.  We do not want to make them the fall guys, but we need to make considerable  savings in the budget.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  The Minister will know as well as everybody else in the Chamber that community  pharmacists are anxious to get round the table and, as he said, to develop  methods of discouraging waste. However, the Minister must acknowledge that  allowing some pharmacies to close will undoubtedly put extra pressure on local  GPs and on A&amp;E units, which are already under threat. Can the Minister not  recognise that that will be a consequence of closing pharmacies?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: I  am not sure whether the Member has actually listened to anything that has been  said thus far. The Minister can do nothing about the situation because a  judicial review is pending. Therefore, the Minister cannot negotiate the deal  that was brought about by the previous Minister in the previous Administration,  and the leave was sought in the previous Administration. If I could engage with  pharmacists, there would be potential to move the situation forward; however,  while I am constrained by a judicial review, I cannot move this situation  forward.</p>
		<p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">IVF Treatment</p>
		<p class="OralAnswers-Question">2. <strong>Ms  Gildernew </strong>asked the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety whether  he has any plans to extend the IVF treatment cycle to three treatments.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 325/11-15<a name="AQO325/11-15" id="AQO325/11-15"></a>)</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: Northern Ireland  aspires to provide three full cycles of fertility treatment as recommended by  NICE; however, financial constraints make that unachievable. I am aware that in  some areas of the UK  the number of cycles available is increasing. However, it is worth noting that  in many of those areas the NHS criteria for treatment are much more restrictive  than those that we apply in Northern    Ireland. Therefore, fewer couples receive  any publicly funded treatment.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">An additional &pound;1&middot;5 million of recurrent funding for  fertility services was made available in 2009. That, in addition to an  investment of &pound;800,000 in a waiting list initiative, means that no patient now  waits for more than 12 months for treatment from the time that they are placed  on the waiting list. With that funding, it is hoped that it will also be  possible to introduce a cycle of frozen embryo transfer in addition to the  currently funded stimulated cycle of treatment where that is appropriate.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Gildernew</strong>:  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s answer; the news about waiting lists is good. However,  does he agree with statistics that indicate that there is a 60% chance of  conceiving with a three-cycle approach? Notwithstanding financial constraints,  it ultimately offers better value for money for the taxpayer.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: We  recognise that. NICE has made its recommendations on the basis of its research,  and we seek to follow the guidance from NICE as far as we can. However, the  funding that has been set aside thus far does not allow for that. We are  looking at the opportunity of introducing the second cycle treatment through  frozen embryo transfers, which is a cost-effective way of achieving it. I  recognise that we have come some distance, but we have not gone the full  distance. However, at the moment I cannot make any promises, given the funding  constraints.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Overend</strong>:  Has the Minister considered the use of DuoFertility, which is a system based on  detecting high fertility cycles in the body? It was developed by Cambridge  Temperature Concepts and was outlined on the Cabinet Office website in May  2011. It has been shown to achieve the same pregnancy rate as a cycle of IVF in  the same patient population at a cost of &pound;500, compared to a typical NHS cost  of &pound;5,000 per cycle.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  What the Member says is very interesting, but we normally operate under NICE  guidelines. That is the protocol under which we operate. If the system is as  good as the Member indicated, I trust that NICE would recommend it to us. It  would certainly alleviate our problems.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  I am sure that the Minister, like the rest of us, will want to acknowledge the  huge emotional impact and stress placed on couples who do not get access to a  third cycle. How many patients in this region are awaiting treatment?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: We  do not have the figures for how many are on the waiting list. I will seek to  ascertain that, provided that it can be done for a reasonable cost.</p>
		<p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Hospitals: Missed Appointments</p>
		<p class="OralAnswers-Question">3. <strong>Mr  Nesbitt </strong>asked the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety  what measures he intends to introduce to reduce the level of missed hospital  appointments. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 326/11-15<a name="AQO326/11-15" id="AQO326/11-15"></a>)</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: In  the previous financial year, 171,740 outpatients missed their hospital  appointments without cancelling in advance. They simply did not attend. It must  be acknowledged that, to avoid such a waste of resources, the public have a  responsibility to ensure that they cancel hospital appointments in advance when  they cannot attend.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Between 2008-09 and 2010-11, a reduction of some 13,000  missed appointments has been secured. However, there remains room for  improvement. The trusts have therefore implemented key initiatives to reduce  the number of missed and cancelled appointments. Those initiatives include  setting local &ldquo;Did not attend&rdquo; targets for locations and specialities with high  non-attendance rates; introducing partial booking across all outpatient  specialities and extending that to patients who are waiting for review  appointments; developing pathways that reduce unnecessary follow-up  appointments; and the production of an annual report by the trusts providing an  analysis of the root causes and demographics of non-attendance, together with  performance against local &ldquo;Did not attend&rdquo; targets. The Department and HSC  Board will review those reports and take further follow-up action as necessary.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Nesbitt</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his answer. On the issue of key initiatives, I wonder  whether the Minister has considered the use of modern communication techniques,  such as mobile phone texting and e-mails. I understand that the health  authority in Fife has pioneered that and was  saving something like &pound;110 for each missed appointment. If your figure of  171,000 for missed appointments is correct, we are talking about a potential  saving of &pound;17 million.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: A  pilot system was in place in the Belfast Trust between April and June, but I  have to say that it had limited impact and was not particularly successful.  However, I am keen to have another look at that and to maybe attempt another  pilot. I recognise that an awful lot of groups with a large user base use text  messaging to get messages out there, and I know that many dentists use it with  their clients. So, it is something that I am prepared to look at again. There  was a pilot, but it was not successful. However, perhaps we need to look at how  that was implemented to see why it was not successful. I should add that there  is a degree of overbooking, because hospitals know that there will be fallout  and that not everybody will turn up. So, the cost of missed appointments  probably is not as much as the headline figures might suggest.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Newton</strong>:  My concern is very much the same as that which Mike Nesbitt raised in his  supplementary question. Can the Minister tell us whether the situation with  missed appointments is worse in Northern Ireland  than in other parts of the United    Kingdom?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: We  do not have figures for the number of missed appointments in the rest of the United Kingdom.  However, the headline figure out today showing that over 170,000 appointments  are missed is not satisfactory, and we need to look at what we should do about  that. I think that, if you are going to attempt to do something about it, you  would have to use a carrot and stick approach. We would therefore need to  ensure that the public were well informed, on the one hand, about appointments  and the proper use of electronic mail and text systems and, on the other, about  the potential for being fined if they did not turn up. That is how dentists  operate: if you do not turn up, you pay at your next appointment. If we were to  challenge this, we would have to take those routes.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Boyle</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. In introducing these measures, will  you take into account particular circumstances and cases, such as people with  bad eyesight? Is it standard for appointment cards to have large print?</p>
		<p class="TimePeriod">3.15 pm</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  Those issues do exist. I accept that, sometimes, when people do not turn up, it  is not necessarily their fault. However, 61% of people who did not turn up for  an appointment had forgotten; 16% felt embarrassed about going to the  outpatient clinic; 13% did not think that it was important; and 10% tried to  cancel by telephone but could not get through. Members can take from those  figures that the core problem is people who fall into the categories of either  forgetting that they have an appointment or not thinking that it is important.  That is not good enough.</p>
		<p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Ulster Hospital:  Accident and Emergency</p>
		<p class="OralAnswers-Question">5. <strong>Mr  Hamilton </strong>asked the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety  what actions have been taken to ensure that the closure of Belfast City  Hospital&rsquo;s accident and emergency unit  will not have an adverse impact on patients of the Ulster Hospital.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 328/11-15<a name="AQO328/11-15" id="AQO328/11-15"></a>)</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: I  wish to emphasise that changes in the configuration of emergency services in  the Belfast Trust are operational matters that have been taken on the grounds  of patient safety and the sustainability of services. In my statement to the  Assembly on 13 September 2011, I acknowledged that the temporary closure of the  Belfast City  Hospital emergency department on 1  November 2011 would impact on hospitals in other trusts, including the Ulster Hospital.  That hospital has a busy emergency department. It is anticipated that it may  have an additional 10,000 attendances per annum as a result of the change. The  South Eastern Trust is instigating a number of measures to address that  challenge. They include recruitment of an additional three emergency department  consultants, two of whom will be in place on 1 November; an increase in  observation bed capacity; and the provision of additional nursing, allied  health professional and support staff. Some minor works are also in hand at the  Ulster Hospital. Those works include upgrading  and bringing back into use a disused ward and creating a clinical decision  unit. All those measures will help to accelerate patient flow to meet the  current and anticipated increase in demand.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  I know that the Minister appreciates that the Ulster Hospital&rsquo;s  A&amp;E department is already a busy unit. As he said, it is expected to get  much busier as a result of the closure of the City Hospital&rsquo;s  A&amp;E department. Will he assure me, the House and people in the South  Eastern Trust area that the trust&rsquo;s ongoing work at the Ulster Hospital  will ensure that any resulting impact on other services in the hospital, such  as surgery, is also addressed?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  The South Eastern Trust is well aware of those matters. That is why it has  appointed new emergency department consultants quite early. The creation of the  clinical decision unit will help to determine where people go after their  initial assessment in the emergency department and will assist us in service  delivery. As things stand, the Ulster   Hospital has the largest  emergency department, based on turnover of patients and admissions. It is  important that it continues to operate effectively. Therefore, it is important  that the entire hospital system operates effectively, because a ward closure  can lead to all sorts of problems in the emergency department. That would be an  unsatisfactory situation.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr McDonnell</strong>:  The Minister seems to have the Ulster Hospital reasonably well programmed for the closure  of the City Hospital&rsquo;s emergency department.  However, has the Minister considered the sheer implications for the Royal  Victoria Hospital (RVH)? The RVH already deals, I am told, with 70,000 patients  each year in a temporary building. The new critical care building will not open  for at least 18 months &mdash; possibly two years &mdash; so you can anticipate some 30,000  extra patients coming to the Royal as a result of the closure of the City Hospital&rsquo;s  emergency department. Has he made any provision, or can he give the House any  comfort or reassurance that there will be plans in place to ensure that people  are not queuing for hours?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  Yes. I thank the Member for his question. We have identified that the Royal Victoria   Hospital will experience  stress as a result of the additional number of patients. To deal with that,  there will be a completely new nine-bed short-stay unit in the emergency  department. It will be open 24/7 for patients who require interventions with a  length of stay that is less than 24 hours. In addition, there will be an acute  medical admissions unit that operates 24/7 for patients who need 24- to 48-hour  lengths of stay. There is also a plan to relocate the eye casualty to  alternative accommodation, which will create more space for A&amp;E. Those  changes, together with the enhanced arrangements for ambulatory care, will  assist in meeting the additional pressures on the system at the Royal Victoria   Hospital. In addition,  the fact that staff are coming over from Belfast City   Hospital will allow a  much more effective decision-making role to be taken at that hospital, with  people being dealt with more quickly.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">One thing that we are looking at, although it has not been  finalised, is the introduction of a GP to assist with triaging. That has happened  in Manchester,  and 20% of the people did not require A&amp;E services. That helped  considerably to deal with backlogs.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms S Ramsey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I am interested in what the  Minister said about the new, nine-bed short-stay unit in the Royal. He said  that it will operate 24 hours a day, seven days a week. There is currently one  that closes on a Friday afternoon.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  There are actually two facilities. The one you are referring to is for 24- to  48-hour stays and is really for people who have suffered head injuries,  concussion and so forth. That facility means that the patients can be observed  for a reasonable length of time and be allowed to go home without full  admittance to hospital. It is the intention that that will become a 24/7  facility as well.</p>
		<p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Cancer Treatments</p>
		<p class="OralAnswers-Question">6. <strong>Mr  Buchanan </strong>asked the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety  for his assessment of the number of cancer treatments available for use in Northern Ireland compared to the rest of the UK.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 329/11-15<a name="AQO329/11-15" id="AQO329/11-15"></a>)</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  Cancer prevention and early intervention access to appropriate and effective  treatment continue to be our biggest challenges, and they remain a high  priority for my Department. Although around &pound;22 million recurrently is spent on  a range of cancer medicines here, I acknowledge that further improvement in the  availability of NICE-approved medicines applicable to Northern Ireland  is required.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">In Northern    Ireland, the drugs and therapeutics  committee, led by the Northern Ireland Cancer Network, has a regional process  for the prioritisation of new drugs and therapies. The committee includes  clinical representation from oncology and haematology departments and offers  clear advice and guidance to the Health and Social Care Board on priorities for  the commissioning of cancer drugs. A new, revised process to speed up the  applicability of NICE-approved drugs in Northern Ireland will be effective  from 28 September 2011. In addition, I am exploring other options to increase  the resources available to fund access to specialist medicine.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Buchanan</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his response. Can he tell the House any more about his  plans for making more money available for cancer drugs in Northern Ireland?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  Under NICE guidelines, we do not buy all the drugs for cancer that we could and  that NICE recommends we should. The shortfall in funding is around &pound;5 million,  to cover drugs for cancer, cystic fibrosis, Crohn&rsquo;s disease and anti-TNF drugs  for people who are suffering from arthritis.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">What are we going to do about that? First, my intention is  to bid in the monitoring round for funding for those drugs, because the current  situation is inappropriate. I have been receiving correspondence from people  who have cancer but are not getting treated with drugs that could have a  life-saving impact. As an Executive, we need to respond to that. Secondly, if  we were to fund it in the long term, given the funding pressures that we are  under, we would need to introduce new and additional funding. I am looking at  how that might be achieved. It is wrong that we are not treating everyone for  cancer when the relevant drug is available. We are not buying those drugs, and  I would like to be in a position to change that.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McMullan</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Will the Minister give an  assessment of some of the new cancer drugs that are due to be licensed?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  The figure involved for all the drugs that are approved by NICE is &pound;5 million a  year.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Cree</strong>: As  the Minister will know, Northern Ireland  does not have an equivalent of England&rsquo;s  cancer drugs fund. I am reliably informed that there are now 19 treatments that  are denied to Northern Ireland  patients, because, on grounds of cost-effectiveness, Northern Ireland has no mechanism  for accessing treatments that are not recommended by NICE. When will the  Minister take action to address that, given that it would cost an estimated  &pound;5&middot;8 million to help some 279 patients?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  Even treating the people who should be getting NICE-approved drugs would be good  start. The last Assembly, the last Executive, the last Minister decided to  offer free prescriptions. The cost was apparently to be &pound;13 million; I think  that it was closer to &pound;30 million. We are not buying drugs at the cost of &pound;5  million, and people are potentially losing their life as a result. That is why  I am determined to investigate this thoroughly and to try to reach the point  where we treat these people appropriately and with adequate care.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Ramsey</strong>:  Minister, I acknowledge your role in promoting helping people with cancer. It  is clearly a very emotive subject and one that we all have to face in the  constituency office. Will the Minister outline to the House the number of  people across Northern    Ireland who are on a waiting list for  treatment? Have the targets been met?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: We  are dealing quickly and effectively with people on the waiting list for cancer  treatments. For example, the radiotherapy unit and cancer centre at Belfast City Hospital  has made a remarkable difference to the treatment that is offered, and people  are being responded to in appropriate times. That facility needs to have more  lines installed. I announced at the outset that investment would take place in  the Belfast City Hospital  cancer unit and we would then extend that to the north-west. So, we have a task  to ensure that that continues to be the case, and that is why it was important  that we made the investment at Altnagelvin.</p>
		<p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Prisoners: Medication</p>
		<p class="OralAnswers-Question">7. <strong>Mr  McCartney </strong>asked the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety  whether he is aware that 80 per cent of prisoners are on medication.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 330/11-15<a name="AQO330/11-15" id="AQO330/11-15"></a>)</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: At  5 September 2011, 67% of all prisoners were on prescribed medication. The  levels of prescribing at the three Northern Ireland prison  establishments were HMP Maghaberry, 80%; HMP Magilligan, 58%; and HMP Hydebank  Wood, 38%. Those levels of prescribing reflect the fact that prisoners tend to  have poorer physical and mental health than the population at large. The South  Eastern Health and Social Care Trust provides healthcare service at the three  prison sites and is continually seeking to improve medicines management and to  ensure that prisoners&rsquo; assessed medical needs are appropriately met.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCartney</strong>:  Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Aire as an fhreagra sin. I thank the Minister for his  answer. I understand that there is obviously doctor/patient confidentiality,  but does the Department have any view or put in place any monitoring process to  ensure that the high percentage of people on drugs in prison is monitored and  we are assured that it is not a sort of medicine of first resort instead of  last resort?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: I  have to say that I am shocked by these figures, so I welcome the fact that the  matter has been brought to our attention. I certainly will ask whether this  high level of prescribing drugs to people in prison is necessary or whether it  is suitable because prisoners are calmer as a result. In my view, however,  prisons are reform institutions, and, if people are coming out of prison having  received large quantities of prescription drugs as opposed to overcoming their  problems, there is some degree of failing.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hilditch</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his answer thus far. Having given a guarantee to  monitor, what will be the next steps in trying to reduce prescribing levels in  our prisons?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  Having already posed the question, I am told that 90% of prisoners have a  diagnosable mental health problem, substance misuse problem or both, and 27%  have some other form of chronic disease. If 90% of prisoners have a mental  health issue or a substance abuse issue already, it gives you an indication of  why we are ending up with the figures we have. However, if we have reform  institutions that are meant to bring people out of prisons better than they  were when they went into them, we need to challenge this and how we are  currently doing things.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Members, that concludes Question Time. Thank you. I ask Members to  take their ease for a few moments while we change our support staff.</p>

		<p class="H4StageHeading">Office of the Police Ombudsman</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. Two amendments to the motion have been selected. Up to one hour and 45  minutes will be allowed for the debate. The proposer of the motion will have 10  minutes in which to propose and 10 minutes to wind. The proposer of each  amendment will have 10 minutes to propose and five minutes to wind. All other  Members who wish to speak will have five minutes.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr G Kelly</strong>:  I beg to move</p>
		<p class="Q1QuoteIndented">That this Assembly welcomes the Criminal Justice  Inspection report into the Office of the Police Ombudsman; and calls on the  Minister of Justice to take the necessary measures to ensure that full  confidence is restored in the office.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Ba mhaith liom  labhairt ar an &aacute;bhar seo. I propose this motion on behalf of Sinn F&eacute;in.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Let me say at the outset that we, in tandem with everyone  else in the Assembly, are very much for an ombudsman&rsquo;s office. However, it has  to be an ombudsman&rsquo;s office that does its job, because it was at the centre of  the very long negotiations on policing and accountability, and it is a crucial  part of that. We are talking today not about the existence of the office but  about confidence in the office. If there is no confidence, the office  diminishes very fast.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">We have now had three separate reports: the Committee on  the Administration of Justice (CAJ) report; the Tony McCusker report, which the  Minister called for; and the latest one, the Criminal Justice Inspection (CJI)  report. All of those reports are damning. In the latest report, which is from  the CJI, the lowering of independence is central to the findings. There was a  lack of consistency, prioritisation and contact with families. Changes were  made to reports at the last minute that were believed to deal with a lowering  of criticism of the RUC at the time. We are told that the critical review team  did not get all the information. We have found that there is mistrust in the  senior management team and that senior members of staff disassociated  themselves with reports that they were integral in producing on the basis that  they were being changed at the last minute.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">This is not personal, but Al Hutchinson was at the helm  during the period that the reports deal with. It is not a short period &mdash; three  years. Therefore, the buck stops with him. When he appeared before the Justice  Committee, he said that, in 44 years of public service, he had not seen  anything like these difficulties. Yet, he decided not to go. As my colleague  Raymond McCartney said at the same Committee meeting, there is no point in long  goodbyes, because they do not work. Some people have used the term &ldquo;lame duck&rdquo;,  but I do not think that it is appropriate in this case. In the Committee  meeting, the ombudsman blamed everyone but himself. He is at the core of the  difficulty, so it is worth saying that, the longer he stays, the more damage is  done to the ombudsman&rsquo;s office. We want the ombudsman&rsquo;s office restored to what  it should be. The difficulty is that he can and will contaminate all those who  work and will have to continue working in the office.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">I have met a number of families in the past week or so.  After years of waiting, they are now left with more questions than they had  before. Were intelligence reports withheld? Were the changes to reports made to  protect people involved? Who can they turn to now? Their message to me was that  they certainly could not turn to Al Hutchinson.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">The motion is not about party politics; it is in the public  interest and the interest of all of those who have a vested interest in the new  beginning to policing. That is why we tabled the motion. It is an alert to the  Assembly and its Members, and it is a challenge to the Minister of Justice. The  Minister reports to the Committee for Justice and the Assembly on the  day-to-day affairs of the Office of the Police Ombudsman. However, after  listening carefully to all that he has said on the matter so far, I must now  ask: what is he waiting for? For six months, we have been watching the Office  of the Police Ombudsman spiral deeper into controversy, and, with every day,  public confidence in the effectiveness of the office has been and continues to  be eroded.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Yet, we now know that, at the beginning of this month, the  Minister met the Police Ombudsman to discuss his position. What was the result?  The Police Ombudsman decided that he would stay in office and collect his, if I  may say so, very substantial salary for another nine months. Let us be clear:  that is one year and three months after the former chief executive had to  resign to bring the scandal to public attention. That was a very big thing to  do. I wish that the Police Ombudsman could follow in those footsteps. In all  that time, the Minister has yet to state unequivocally that the person whom he  pays so handsomely every month should quit.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">There is an argument that we cannot create a vacuum and  that the present ombudsman should wait for nine months. That, of course, is  nonsense. It was argued that that is based in law, but that is also untrue. He  should go for the sake of the office, and he should go now. Of all the measures  that could be taken to restore public confidence in the Office of the Police  Ombudsman, nothing is more important than having confidence in the person who is  the Police Ombudsman. Every day that Al Hutchinson remains in post does damage  to that office.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">I will briefly deal with the SDLP&rsquo;s proposed amendment. We  are in favour of it. I have just called on the Police Ombudsman to resign and  have done so publicly before now. The DUP&rsquo;s amendment starts by stating that  it:</p>
		<p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;notes the damage caused to the office by the  investigation of historic cases&rdquo;.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That is not the problem. The problem is that the  malpractice in the ombudsman&rsquo;s office will affect everything in that office.  Frankly, the shifting of historical cases to somewhere else without dealing  with the problem of malpractice will shift the problem as well.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">The time is always right to do what is right, and it is  past time for Al Hutchinson to leave. It is the right time for the Minister of  Justice to call on him to leave. We have heard from practically everyone else.  Listen to the families who have lost all faith in him and to the public. I  appeal to the Minister: for once, do not take the advice of your officials,  many of whom slipped seamlessly across from the Northern Ireland Office. I  commend the motion to the Assembly.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: I  beg to move amendment No 1: Leave out all after &lsquo;Ombudsman&rsquo; and insert:</p>
		<p class="Q3Motion">&ldquo;; notes the damage caused to the office by the investigation  of historic cases; and calls upon the Minister of Justice to permanently  suspend any new historic investigations by the Office of the Police Ombudsman  and bring forward proposals to create public and police confidence in the  ombudsman&rsquo;s office, including independent oversight.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">The three aspects to the debate are the original motion,  our proposed amendment and the SDLP&rsquo;s proposed amendment. On the basis that it  is difficult to deny that there have been problems in the ombudsman&rsquo;s office,  we do not have a major problem with the wording of the original motion. Indeed,  when I and other members of the Committee for Justice had the opportunity to  hear from representatives of Criminal Justice Inspection, we found that we  could live with the broad thrust of their recommendations. So, in that sense,  there is no doubt that there is valid criticism of the ombudsman&rsquo;s office. Our  concern is that, in providing solutions to the problems, the motion does not go  far enough.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Although valid concerns have been expressed about the  ombudsman&rsquo;s office, there are two key distinctions to be drawn. There has been  some revisionist history that says that all the problems of public confidence  in the ombudsman&rsquo;s office emanated from Al Hutchinson&rsquo;s time. I placed on  record at the time that many of us did not have full confidence in the  ombudsman&rsquo;s office, even during the days of the blessed Baroness O&rsquo;Loan.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr G Kelly</strong>:  I do not think that the argument is that the ombudsman&rsquo;s office was always  perfect. However, the Member will recall that although a review took place in  Nuala O&rsquo;Loan&rsquo;s time and a number of recommendations were brought forward, Al  Hutchinson did not implement those recommendations.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: The  Member may or may not have read the transcript of the Justice Committee  meeting, which highlighted the fact that the previous investigations of the  ombudsman&rsquo;s office concentrated purely on current and ongoing cases rather than  historical cases. Indeed, it became abundantly clear that, when Michael Maguire  gave evidence to the Committee on behalf of the CJI, the problem was purely on  the historical cases side. He did not have any problems with the 80% of current  cases. There was no like-for-like comparison to be made. Indeed, when it was  put to Dr Maguire by members of the Committee that if, on his way home from the  Committee, an incident happened to him about which he felt that he had to make  a complaint against the police, would he have full confidence that such a complaint,  as a current issue, would be dealt with perfectly well, he indicated that he  would. There are endemic issues in the ombudsman&rsquo;s office that go beyond the  individual or just a widespread attack on the office.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Historical cases are at the heart of the matter. The Police  Ombudsman himself, who agreed that looking at historical cases had put a  certain amount of poison in the system, showed that that is undoubtedly the  case. Our amendment deals with three aspects. There are concerns about the way  in which the ombudsman&rsquo;s office operates. Concerns have been expressed by, for  example, the Northern Ireland Retired Police Officers&rsquo; Association, that in  many ways the office is still a law unto itself. It does not have sufficient  independent oversight. If, as part of this process or of any implementation of  recommendations, there is an overhaul of the ombudsman&rsquo;s office, there must be  some way in which the office is held accountable.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">There are two main reasons behind the thrust of our  amendment. There is a poison in the system. If we detach the historical cases  from the ombudsman&rsquo;s office, there is an opportunity for confidence to be much  more readily restored to the office. Dealing with the past is the poison that  is at the heart of the matter. We accept that, because of European rulings,  there has to be some level of investigation of the past.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">However, the other aspect, which we find profoundly  disturbing, are the double standards from the party opposite in particular. At  times, that party will say that we should draw a line under the past. Indeed,  the events of the past few days have shown that the Member for Mid Ulster who  is bidding for high office in the Republic   of Ireland wants to  concentrate on the past few years of his activities and not look further into  the past.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Some of the Members opposite propagated a similar attitude  when in 1998, for example, they were strongly in favour of opening up the jails  and letting out those who had committed crimes. However, when it comes to the  mistakes that the RUC made in the past in carrying out its work, a very  different attitude prevails. In those cases, the RUC is to be nailed to the  mast and every action is to be scrutinised. The point that we are making is  that, if we are going to have investigations into events in the past, they  cannot simply be one-sided or focused on one aspect. We cannot have a situation  in which the police are persecuted for everything that they did or did not do  during the Troubles, while others disappear in the hazy mist of the past.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">The problem with the present structures is that, on the one  hand, there is an ongoing investigation at the ombudsman&rsquo;s office while, on the  other, there is no justice for those who have suffered at the hands of  terrorism. We accept that, as a result of the European ruling, there needs to  be some level of investigation into the past, but let us at least do it on a  fair and equitable basis. Consequently, it is our belief that the ombudsman&rsquo;s  office is not the right repository for that type of behaviour.</p>
		<p class="TimePeriod">3.45 pm</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">I suspect that the real gripe across the Chamber with the  current Police Ombudsman is not to do with the flaws in the office, which go  beyond an individual, but with a concern that the reports produced by the  office have not been written in the way in which some Members opposite would  have us believe that they should have been. As they would see it, they have not  got the right responses to the questions they asked. They have not got the  reports that they wanted, which would point the finger at the securocrats of  the army and the RUC. I believe that, ultimately, that is the real gripe that  some people have with Al Hutchinson.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">I turn briefly to the SDLP amendment, which we reject for a  number of reasons. First, it is simplistic to pin the blame on one individual. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">I see the honourable Member for South   Belfast gesticulating. I am not sure whether it is an amendment or  an audition. In the SDLP&rsquo;s &lsquo;The X Factor&rsquo; to see who gets the leadership,  today&rsquo;s entrant is obviously Mr McDevitt.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  I have no interest in it.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: I  appreciate that. The honourable Member for North Belfast  is one of the few people not running for the SDLP leadership or deputy  leadership. I look forward to his remarks.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">To single out an individual is to get it wrong. From the SDLP&rsquo;s  point of view, the biggest crime of the current incumbent of the ombudsman&rsquo;s  office is not being Nuala O&rsquo;Loan, and that strikes at the heart of the SDLP.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">If we are to move forward in the ombudsman&rsquo;s office,  creating a further vacuum at the top will not help. The ombudsman has indicated  that, following a timely process, he will depart in June next year, which will  allow for a proper recruitment process to find somebody suitable for the post.  I am not sure why anybody in their right mind would want to be the Police  Ombudsman, but, in a general sense, this will at least allow for the  opportunity.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">It has been said that another issue is the dysfunctionality  at the top of the system, yet, as has been indicated, the ombudsman&rsquo;s office is  clearly not the only body of that nature to face such problems. There have  clearly been personality clashes between senior figures in the ombudsman&rsquo;s  office, resulting in the departure of the chief executive and the chief  investigating officer. Indeed, when faced with direct questions at the Justice  Committee, the people who filled those posts indicated that they envisaged the  ombudsman carrying on. If you are to have continuity or any confidence in the  office, to have a situation in which everybody at a high level has been removed  would be simply irresponsible.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP amendment is a form of witch-hunt. It makes a  scapegoat of an individual, and it does not deal with the flawed process, which  is the one-sided nature of dealing with the past encapsulated in the  ombudsman&rsquo;s office and, indeed, the inherent belief that the only people who  need to be investigated and held up to scrutiny for the historic situation in  Northern Ireland is the RUC. That is simply not sustainable. Consequently, we  will support the DUP amendment and oppose that of Mr McDevitt and his  colleagues. Like Gary Barlow, I am waiting to see the audition tape from Mr  McDevitt in the next few seconds.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  I beg to move amendment No. 2: At end insert:</p>
		<p class="Q3Motion">&ldquo;; and further calls on the current Police Ombudsman to resign  with immediate effect.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">I apologise to the House for my hoarseness, which is the  inevitable consequence of a fantastic Saturday morning and a splendid Sunday  afternoon celebrating the triumph of the underdog in Irish sports.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: Do  you mean Rangers?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  Rangers? Although Mr Barlow is not present in the Chamber, in a previous life,  before going on to hang out with Robbie Williams and the men of Take That, he  may have taken an interest in the law. If he had, as I know that Mr Weir did as  a once learned gentleman, he would understand that the gentleman who holds the  office of Police Ombudsman is a corporate sole: he embodies that office.  Therefore, the call for the resignation of the individual who holds the office  of Police Ombudsman is quite appropriate when the public&rsquo;s confidence in that  office has been, in my opinion, properly and fundamentally challenged.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">The background to our having a Police Ombudsman is worth  acknowledging and formally recording in the Chamber. As colleagues will know,  the office was created before the Patten recommendations, but it is an integral  part of the architecture of a new beginning to policing. Having an independent  office headed by a corporate sole to act as arbiter and adjudicator on issues  of contention in the today was an important part of breaking with an unhappy  and contested past in policing. In the SDLP&rsquo;s view, it is regrettable that the  office is also practically the only vehicle through which issues to do with the  past can be properly investigated. In fact, it is not just regrettable. If we  are honest with ourselves, it is a shameful failure of the House that we have  left it to others to carry the burden of the legacy and discovery of some of  the terrible deeds in our past. That is something that you, Mr Speaker, will  recall that I have commented on previously,</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Mr Weir makes an interesting point. As I hear it, it is  basically that if we cannot do everything right about the past, do nothing.  That is not a solution either; it does not fix anything. When we debate the  Office of the Police Ombudsman and the person who embodies that office, we are  also, if we are honest about it, acknowledging our failure as an Executive and  Assembly. However, is our failure made any better by ignoring the failures that  may take place in the Office of the Police Ombudsman? It certainly is not. Are  the lives of many thousands of people who were victims of agents of the state  or who have issues with how the state conducted itself during the Troubles made  any better by choosing to do nothing, just because we cannot do everything? Of  course they are not. That is why it is so important that we have a proper and  informed debate about how important the Police Ombudsman&rsquo;s office is and how  important it is to have someone of standing in the post, with objective  independence at the office&rsquo;s heart and helm.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Colleagues have referred to the previous Police Ombudsman,  Dame Nuala O&rsquo;Loan. She was someone who, in my opinion and, I think, in the  opinion of many inside and outside the House, objectified that type of  independence. She was someone who was not afraid to annoy everyone.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Spratt</strong>: I  hear what the Member says about the former ombudsman being objective. That does  not surprise me, coming from his party. That was certainly not the view of the  police staff associations and others that failed to co-operate with her because  of her very clear lack of independence in the investigations of complaints  against the Police Service.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  I acknowledge Mr Spratt&rsquo;s opinion. Indeed, I respect it. Mr Spratt has a  declaration of interest to make in that regard, which we must acknowledge and  respect. It is important that we understand that, in being objective, one will  invariably find oneself on the wrong side of many people&rsquo;s subjectivity. It is just  not possible to be properly and truly independent without seriously ruffling  the opinions of the state and those of individuals who may have a vested or  passing interest in your work. Mr Hutchinson has done something different: he  has fettered his objectivity. That is not my opinion but the informed opinion  of several reports. It is not that we are debating the motion in the context of  just a single report on the conduct of the Police Ombudsman but that we are  debating it in the context of three: one by Mr McCusker, another by Criminal  Justice Inspection and a separate report by the Committee on the Administration  of Justice. All conclude, in different ways, that there are fundamental issues  with the ombudsman&rsquo;s ability to maintain public confidence in his office.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Indeed, an editorial in a local paper on 17 June put it  succinctly, and it may be worth reading a little of that to try to sum up some  of the arguments. It noted:</p>
		<p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;When someone is held in such high regard it is always  difficult for their successor to put their own stamp on a job.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">That was a reference to Ms O&rsquo;Loan and the new ombudsman. It  continued:</p>
		<p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;It would have been unfair to expect Al Hutchinson to  be as forthright as Baroness O&rsquo;Loan. They are clearly different personalities  and entitled to adopt different approaches to the role. However, it is fair to  expect that whoever is in the office is fiercely protective of its  independence.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">That is the fundamental issue at the heart of the debate:  the ability of an individual who is a corporate soul to defend fiercely,  robustly and absolutely his or her independence. The confidence issues that we  have are not to do with his character as a gentleman. Indeed, individuals on  all Benches will find him to be a warm and friendly gentleman. The issues  relate to his ability to defend fiercely his independence.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Another important point of policy and principle on which we  need to reflect is the relationship between the Police Ombudsman&rsquo;s office and  article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights. Under article 2,  complaints against the police relate to violations of the right to life.  Article 2 upholds the police&rsquo;s duty to uphold the right to life. The British  Government take the view, and it has never been contested, that the person and  body responsible for upholding article 2 obligations to the PSNI and,  previously, the RUC is the Police Ombudsman. However, the Police Ombudsman  himself contests that duty. He argues that he is not responsible and that  article 2 is someone else&rsquo;s business. We trawled the statute book and asked the  experts, who can point to no body in this jurisdiction other than his that has  a duty to uphold article 2. How can we have confidence in an individual who  will not uphold a fundamental article on which his office is built?</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">I do not wish to take the argument very much further except  to say that our amendment contains a simple proposition: stand by the  independence of that which we created to create confidence in our policing, and  you stand by the future of this state. Allow that to be fettered, interfered  with or compromised, and you compromise the potential of this state to be  reborn.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I declare an interest as a previous chair of the human rights and professional  standards committee of the Northern Ireland Policing Board. In that capacity, I  had the opportunity to discuss many issues with the ombudsman and his office,  and it is a bit regrettable that, such is the way that we do business here, I have  but five minutes to impart my knowledge, whereas other Members had 10 minutes.  Perhaps I should have tabled an amendment. Nevertheless, I will be able to say  what has to be said in the time allotted.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">The reputation of the office of ombudsman has been completely  and utterly trashed by the recent revelations. I stress that it is the office  of the ombudsman, not the ombudsman himself.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">The attitude, the way that things went on with the chief  executive and the senior investigating officer and all the issues that came out  cannot do anything other than undermine the public&rsquo;s confidence in the office.  The fact that we are discussing this motion in this way means that it is  irrevocable. We will not be able to change the people in the ombudsman&rsquo;s office  and say to the people of Northern    Ireland that we now have confidence in it.  It cannot be done. There will have to be a new way of dealing with it.</p>
		<p class="TimePeriod">4.00 pm</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">For the record, I do not like the way people direct a  witch-hunt at an individual who has been found to have done a good job in many  aspects of his business. If we collectively have failed because we cannot  confront the issues of the past, we should face up to our own responsibilities  and not try to push them off on someone whom we asked to do our dirty work for  us. We in the Assembly, this political institution, have failed to deal  properly with the issues of the past. I do not think that it is possible for  any one individual to deal with this. We need to look at it ourselves.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">I want to make a point about article 2. It is absolutely  right that article 2 defends the right to life. It also says that, in certain  circumstances, Governments and police forces have the right to take life, but  they must be independently investigated. It does not say that individuals, armed  groups, revolutionary conclaves or anybody else has the right to take life.  That is the issue: there is no recourse in law for one side.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  Does Mr McCrea accept that the British Government&rsquo;s opinion is that it is the  job of the Police Ombudsman for Northern    Ireland to conduct article 2 investigations  in the context of the PSNI?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member has a minute added to his time.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Therein lies the conundrum. The Government may well have said that that was the  case then, but they do not say that that is the case in the future. All that  the article requires is that somebody independent looks at the issue. We can  create any body we like, and we can say that there is a different way of  looking at this as long as there is some way of doing it. However, my central  tenet is that, on the other side of the equation, there were those who took  life and thought that they were fighting a good fight for a cause that they  believed in. However, they have not been brought to justice, and that is what  is wrong with our society. We have left things unsaid, undone and unfinished.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">No matter what way we look at things, when we look at the  past, there will always be an issue about whether we can have access to  security information and who should ask for access to it. Should it be former  police officers or somebody completely new? The real issue is that we still  face a threat from dissident republicans and others, and that security  information is extremely sensitive. When we look at how we move forward, we should  put the past behind us and genuinely accept that we have to find a way forward  for the sake of our children and for other generations. That is not what I hear  or see. I see people standing for the presidency of Ireland and saying, &ldquo;Do not  judge me as a 22-year-old wearing a beret and carrying a gun, because I have  moved on&rdquo;. I may well be one of the few people on this side of the House who  might be prepared to listen. However, you cannot have inquiry after inquiry to  pick off the scabs of the past and to try to do people down. If you really want  to find peace and move forward, you have to find a way to do it together. I  reject the amendment and the original motion, and I am still thinking about the  DUP amendment.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dickson</strong>:  I will, hopefully, not raise my voice but will try to bring some reason to the  debate. I am certainly not standing for the leadership of either the Ulster  Unionist Party or the SDLP &mdash; or the Alliance Party.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the debate. It is an important part of the  process of restoring confidence in the Office of the Police Ombudsman, and I  think that that is what the community desperately wants the Assembly to do. I  support the unamended motion because it gives us the opportunity to think  seriously and hard about the series of events, particularly given the  Minister&rsquo;s acceptance of the recommendation in Dr Maguire&rsquo;s report and his  commitment to support the Office of the Police Ombudsman through the work that  needs to be undertaken to put things right. That is particularly difficult for  an organisation that is what Mr McDevitt described as a sole corporate body.  Perhaps that is another area that needs further investigation.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Our united and primary objective, as an Assembly, must be  the securing of public confidence in the arrangements for the oversight of  policing. A stable, effective and independent Police Ombudsman&rsquo;s office is  critical to securing that confidence. Indeed, like other Members, I welcome the  fact that reports have shown high community satisfaction in respect of the  investigations conducted by the ombudsman into recent events involving the  PSNI. I do not think that there has been much dispute about the outcome of  those reports.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Clearly, however, we are faced with a difficult situation,  and there is a need to address the governance issues raised in the McCusker  report, which refers to serious internal divisions in that office. The chief  executive has left the ombudsman&rsquo;s office, the senior director of  investigations is on long-term absence, and both posts are being filled on an acting-up  basis. Serious concerns were raised about the handling of historical cases in  the CJINI report. Furthermore, we are faced with the reality that the process  for appointing a new ombudsman will take a long time, and that is not in the  hands of the Minister of Justice.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Given all those difficulties, the immediate departure of  the ombudsman, as proposed by the SDLP, may satisfy its short-term demands for  action but, in reality, will not solve the problem. The SDLP&rsquo;s approach to this  is, perhaps, short-term; however, I do not believe that it would benefit the  office of the ombudsman in the medium or longer term. The absence of an  ombudsman from an office in which the two most senior staff beneath are acting  up would not allow that office to operate properly. Those are the serious  things that we need to take into account. The situation would be even more  difficult, given the good work that is, as I said, being done in investigating  current cases and the difficult task of bringing about the necessary processes  to restore confidence in that office.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">I am opposed to the DUP amendment because it would be  unsatisfactory to suspend the investigation of historical cases indefinitely.  In fact, we should look at the language used in the amendment proposed by the  DUP. Somebody will need to explain to me how you &ldquo;permanently suspend&rdquo;  something. Suspension implies something temporary; permanent is something very  different. The use of the two words in the one sentence is a bit of a problem.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  Will the Member acknowledge that the legislation relating to the Police  Ombudsman was deliberately amended to bring about the investigation of  historical cases and that introducing any change, such as that in the DUP  amendment, would require primary legislation?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member will have a minute added to his time.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dickson</strong>:  Thank you, Mr Speaker, and I thank Mr Maginness, whose point I entirely accept.  Until this community can find some other means and mechanism of investigating  historical cases, until we can address those issues, this community expects  that the ombudsman&rsquo;s office will fulfil that role to the best of its ability.  Therefore, I oppose the DUP amendment because Dr Maguire&rsquo;s report recommended  suspension not termination of those investigations. He said that the approach  was to, &ldquo;stop, fix&hellip;and&hellip;move forward&rdquo;.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">We have a duty and a responsibility to those who have spent  years campaigning for answers to provide them with those answers. Frankly, it  is reckless to call for the cessation of historical investigations without  political agreement on an alternative. That would lead to a long and endless  delay and further pain and heartache for those who have lost family and  friends. Nor do I agree with the creation of an oversight mechanism for the  ombudsman&rsquo;s office. That would lead us into what could be described as a spiral  of accountability where, as I said in Committee, we are in danger of an  ombudsman for an ombudsman for an ombudsman.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">This is a particularly dangerous situation for Northern Ireland,  given our failure to deal with the past and the resulting context wherein there  will always be disagreement about the outcome of investigations.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Will the Member bring his remarks to a close?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dickson</strong>:  Given all the steps that have been taken and taking all things into  consideration &mdash;</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dickson</strong>:  I believe that the path we are on is the one we need to take, and that is to  support the motion as it stands.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Anderson</strong>:  I will speak to amendment No 1, which was tabled by my party. There is a  problem in the ombudsman&rsquo;s office &mdash; that is stating the obvious. However, the  key issue is not personalities but the very nature and remit of that office.  That is where the nub of the problem lies. Our amendment is a genuine effort to  address that problem.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Although the office was set up in 1998 to provide scrutiny  and accountability in the whole area of policing, it has, for a variety of  reasons, wandered down a number of other paths. If we are to move forward, the  office needs to focus on its key objective. Until it does so, it will continue  to face the sort of difficulties it now finds itself in.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">As I look at the substantive motion and the SDLP&rsquo;s  amendment, I question the motives behind them. Are those who proposed them  genuinely interested in making real progress on the back of the McCusker report  and the Criminal Justice Inspection report? I very much doubt it. The Sinn F&eacute;in  motion is more significant for what it does not say than for what it does say.  However, it is clear from previous public statements by Sinn F&eacute;in and from what  we have heard today in the Chamber from Gerry Kelly that it wants the same  outcome as the SDLP does with its amendment: they want Al Hutchinson out. The  calls for Mr Hutchinson to go are mischievous and misplaced. They say more  about those who make them than they do about the ombudsman. I find it ironic  that when Al Hutchinson was Oversight Commissioner during the Patten reforms  that brought about the key nationalist demand for the disbandment of the RUC he  was seen by those opposite as a great man. Now, they cannot wait to get rid of  him.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">What role do nationalists see for the ombudsman&rsquo;s office?  Are they only interested in using the office to pursue their deep-seated  vendetta against former police and other security personnel? Since its  inception, the ombudsman&rsquo;s office has not functioned properly. The first  ombudsman, Nuala O&rsquo;Loan, hardly covered herself in glory. In her determination  to extend her powers of investigation she lost the confidence of the unionist  community and the police. Al Hutchinson inherited her legacy and, I believe, is  being used as a scapegoat to mask fundamental failings not of his own making.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">We welcome the Criminal Justice Inspection report, but, as  outlined in our amendment, we feel strongly that the chief cause of the current  problems in the ombudsman&rsquo;s role is the investigation of historical cases. That  ought never to have been part of the remit of the office. In his 2007-08  report, the ombudsman said:</p>
		<p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;In taking stock of the pressures in the Office, I  came to realise quickly that our staff were coping with immense pressure in  maintaining and focusing resources on the current and immediate work of the  police complaints system while at the same time responding to the very complex  complaints rooted in the conflict and atrocities from &lsquo;The Troubles&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">He also warned that the quality of work was  beginning to suffer. More recently &mdash; just a week or two ago &mdash; he told the  Justice Committee:</p>
		<p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;the Office of the Police Ombudsman was not set up to  be a proxy for resolving the wider unresolved legacy issues, yet it finds  itself cast in that role and driven in that direction by a lack of an agreed  resolution on how to deal with the past.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That is what we need to tackle. Unless the HET  issue is resolved satisfactorily, Mr Hutchinson&rsquo;s departure will not make any  difference. The problems will not simply disappear with him.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">It is vital that the Justice Minister urgently bring  forward proposals to tackle the key issues. The ombudsman must be able to get  on with the job of dealing with current complaints about the police without  interference from anyone. Until that happens, it will be very difficult to  achieve widespread public and police confidence in that office. I support my  party&rsquo;s amendment.</p>
		<p class="TimePeriod">4.15 pm</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms J McCann</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I support the motion and the SDLP  amendment, not the DUP amendment. I do not think that anyone, even in the  Chamber, can dispute the view that the Office of the Police Ombudsman is in  disarray. There are causes and consequences of the scandal. At the heart of my  concern are the people whom that office was intended to serve. Many of them are  watching the debate and listening to Members. Their sense of outrage at what  has been done to the Office of the Police Ombudsman is one that my party and I  share. The office was set up to serve the public, but it has been totally  compromised by those who are paid from the public purse.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">The Criminal Justice Inspection report was one of three  damning reports that were critical of the Police Ombudsman&rsquo;s office. It said  that reports had been changed, that there was no agreement between senior  members of staff and that the lowering of independence and the effectiveness of  the office were affected. Those are serious issues that should concern the  Assembly.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">It is an affront to the institutions that we represent that  Al Hutchinson remains in office. The fact that he continues to be paid and to  hold an office that he has brought into such disrepute is an insult. The Police  Ombudsman&rsquo;s conduct is in marked contrast to the dignity and restraint of the  families who have asked for his help. I am talking about families with whom I  have worked in the past, such as the families from Loughinisland, whose loved  ones were killed in the bar in Loughinisland, and of young Damien Walsh from  west Belfast. I  have had meetings in the ombudsman&rsquo;s office. Those families were never  consulted about the time it would take for reports to be completed. They were  not consulted or brought up to date as the issue was being investigated.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">During the debate, a lot of effort has been invested in  blaming past and historical cases. You also have to look at some of the more  recent cases in the ombudsman&rsquo;s office that the report criticised. Criticism of  the ombudsman lies not only in historical cases but in newer cases that he had  been asked to investigate and which his office had been investigating. I want  to touch on that point: there are only very limited circumstances in which the  Police Ombudsman&rsquo;s office can invoke its special powers of investigation; they  have to be &ldquo;grave and exceptional&rdquo;. It is not the fault of the victims of the  past, as some Members are saying, or of the families who went to the ombudsman  for help. I do not think that Members should blame those people or those  families.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">The ombudsman has never been asked to investigate every  killing in the conflict. We should make that very clear. The claim that the  past is to blame for the present problems of that office is arrant nonsense; it  is the nonsense that is peddled when we look at the past in any constructive  way.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Al Hutchinson went into that office with his eyes wide  open. He knew exactly what was expected of him. He publicly declared his  objection to the responsibility for exercising special powers for incidents  that had occurred more than 12 months earlier. The problems that have come to  afflict those investigations during his term of office have become a  self-fulfilling prophecy. He wanted to get the so-called historical  investigations stopped, and now they have been suspended.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">There will be efforts by some to ensure that the Office of  the Police Ombudsman is never properly resourced or empowered to fulfil the  duty that it has in the future, but our party will work to save the Office of  the Police Ombudsman. It is not perfect; nothing is perfect. However, we are in  a new era of policing, and people are looking for accountability. They are  looking to see that mechanisms as important as the Police Ombudsman&rsquo;s office  are fair and independent and that it has the confidence of communities. It  needs to have that, and the only way in which confidence will be restored is if  Al Hutchinson goes.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Craig</strong>: I  find myself at odds, because we find ourselves in agreement with some of the  sentiments of the original motion: we should ensure that confidence is restored  in the ombudsman&rsquo;s office and that the independence of that office is ensured.  However, I hear a lot of talk from the other side of the House about how that  confidence and independence seem now to be lost. That is very strange, because,  on this side of the House, there was never any confidence in the office of the  ombudsman, and there certainly was very little assurance of the independence of  that office under the present ombudsman&rsquo;s predecessor.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">The simple truth &mdash; I think that we all know it on this side  of the House &mdash; is that this body was set up under the Labour Government in 1998  to bash, demonise and criticise the lawful forces of law enforcement in  Northern Ireland. It was set up to destroy the reputation of the former RUC,  and it has done critical damage to that organisation in many respects. What do  we see being done with regard to those who perpetrated violence against that  organisation over 30 years? Little or nothing. I hear Members opposite talk  about the falsehood of how we have asked for other things to be investigated.  The ombudsman&rsquo;s office and the HET have been asked to investigate a series of  atrocities down through the years of the Troubles. As yet, we have seen little  or no result from those investigations. Why is it that only the RUC is held to  account? Why is it that the men in hoods are let off scot-free by this  organisation?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr T Clarke</strong>:  And women.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Craig</strong>:  And women. That is part of the issue. It was good to see in the report on the  ombudsman&rsquo;s office that there was criticism of how the HET inquiry system  works.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Others talked about our failure as a society to deal with  the past. I agree: we have failed to deal with the past. There is certainly a  past in my family that has never been dealt with by the system. I have never  seen justice for my family members who were murdered while part of the security  forces, but I have a sneaking suspicion that the perpetrators of that violence  may not be that far away. Is that why there is total silence on the issue?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Campbell</strong>:  The Member is drawing out the problems of the HET and dealing with the past.  Does he agree that part of the bigger problem that we face in Northern Ireland  is that some people want a partial examination of the past? They do not want to  look at what they did in the past or at the violence, murder and slaughter that  they engaged in. They want to engage in a partial examination of what the  security forces did by way of response to what they did. Some of them even  refuse to co-operate with the HET with regard to the murder of Joanne Mathers  and other murders and will not reveal their part in those.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member has an extra minute added to his time.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Craig</strong>:  Unsurprisingly, I find myself in total agreement with that. That is part of the  bigger problem that we have in Northern    Ireland &mdash; those with a past who do not wish  that past to be examined in any way, shape or form. It is wrong that we  investigate only what the lawful security forces of this country did. That is  part of the reason that I fully support our amendment to suspend that aspect of  the HET investigations and to find an alternative. Other Members talked about  resources &mdash; there are resource implications in all this &mdash; but, more  importantly, there is a huge issue of justice. I certainly see no justice for  my family.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr T Clarke</strong>:  I thank the Member for giving way. I appreciate that he referred to the cost of  this matter. However, another element that begins with the letter &ldquo;c&rdquo; is  co-operation. There are Members on the Benches opposite who do not want to  co-operate. If we had co-operation from all sides, everyone could seek justice.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Craig</strong>:  That is absolutely true.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">The one thing that I do not like in all this is the  hypocrisy. I have heard attack, attack and attack again on Al Hutchinson. Why  is he being attacked? He is being attacked because he produced a report that  did not agree with the version of history that one side of the House prefers.  Was the report wrong, right or indifferent? Let me tell you something: the  report was accurate. So, if it is accurate but does not suit your view of  history, the man has to go. We all know that that is a witch-hunt.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I ask the Member to bring his remarks to a close.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Craig</strong>: I  pay tribute to Al Hutchinson for having the bottle to stand up and say what is  correct.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I listened to the debate, and there are several things that it is important to  put right. In her contribution, Jennifer McCann suggested that people are  blaming victims. I have not heard anyone blame any victim. We believe and other  parties collectively believe that something should be put in place that  reflects the hurt that has been caused to victims in all this. The failure of  the Executive and Assembly to properly address and deal with the past is  probably why we are having this debate.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">The report rightly said that there was no problem with the  new cases that the ombudsman had been looking at. That side of the ombudsman&rsquo;s  work has been progressing well and without contention, and that is to be  welcomed and acknowledged. In the office of the ombudsman, the failure has been  in dealing with the past, yet we keep adding to its workload and looking for  someone to handle it. The Assembly has not got to grips with how to deal with  the past. The Assembly has not tackled how we deal with victims or help them,  and it has not dealt with any of the issues that come out of the past. It has  not tackled how we should face those who want to rewrite some of that history,  who want reports to reflect their version of the past and who are unhappy when  they do not do so.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>: I  thank the Member for giving way. Is it not the case that one of the problems  that we face is that the former deputy First Minister said when he attended the  Saville inquiry, for example, that he could not tell the truth because there  was something called a code of honour in the very organisation that had  slaughtered our people for 40 years?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  It now appears that, by that stage, he had perhaps even left the organisation;  we are not sure. Of course, he is now off to seek employment in other parts.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">That is one of the issues: how do we get that information  from groups? The problem in dealing with our past has been that it has been so  one-sided. We have to find a way of addressing it, and that has to be a  cornerstone of any CSI strategy or anything that is produced in that regard.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">I will be interested to hear whether the Minister has any  suggestions for how we can address historical cases. How are we to deal with  them? How are we to address them and fix this problem? That is where all the  issues in the ombudsman&rsquo;s office have arisen. They are not related to its  workload. The office was not designed to deal with those, but it has had to  deal with them, struggle on and then face criticism.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">We hear from some parties that that office should be, of  course, fiercely independent, yet we are standing here today criticising it and  demanding that the head of that office resigns. That is not helpful to the  debate. That is why we have to reject that amendment.</p>
		<p class="TimePeriod">4.30 pm</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">I will be interested to hear from the Minister. We are  minded to support the DUP&rsquo;s amendment, but the bit that we are most concerned  about is the phrase:</p>
		<p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;permanently suspend any new historic investigations  by the Office&rdquo;.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">We would like to hear the Minister explain how he  would deal with or progress that.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  I thank Mr McCallister for letting me intervene. I am curious, because Mr  McCallister says that it is improper to question whether an office that was  established to be independent is, in fact, being independent. It is not just  the opinion of some in this House that the ombudsman has failed in his duty to  be so; it is the opinion of three separate, outside, independent bodies. If  this House is not the place to debate and form judgements on the basis of  advice from experts, where is?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member will have a minute added to his time.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  That will be three added minutes. Thank you, Mr Speaker.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">The point that I was making was that Mr McDevitt said that  the office should be fiercely independent, and here we are, debating it today  and calling for the head of that office to resign. That is what the SDLP  amendment calls for. That is a conflict: they want, because the report did not  suit some of their needs, some sort of rewrite.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">We have made it quite clear that the problem in the office  is with the historical cases side. Yet you are giving that office something to  do that it was not created for. You are giving it that work because there is no  way of dealing with it. The Assembly has collectively failed to agree on how to  deal with the very important historical cases, many of which would help to  bring closure to many families who have waited for many years, and not rewrite  that history or make any changes. That is what we are saying: it is a failure  on the part of this Assembly to deal with the past.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  It is important to restore confidence in the Office of the Police Ombudsman,  which is an important part of the new policing architecture. I speak to my  party&rsquo;s amendment. The Chamber will not need reminding of the hurt and anger  that was caused by the Police Ombudsman&rsquo;s report into the Loughinisland  atrocity. As a public representative and someone who lives in the community  that was directly affected by that massacre, I can say, without equivocation,  that confidence in the Police Ombudsman is at an all-time low.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">The failure of the Police Ombudsman to reach the conclusion  of collusion in relation to the Loughinisland massacre has piled more grief and  hurt on to the families of those murdered and, indeed, on to the community that  has lived with that atrocity and its effects and impact.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">I remind the Chamber that when we speak of the ombudsman&rsquo;s  office and inquiries, we speak of human tragedies; tragedies for those murdered  and their families and for the wider community. I want to read a short extract  from a letter written on 19 June 1994 in response to the Loughinisland murders:</p>
		<p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;What can anyone do &mdash; nothing but weep, and send my  love and sympathy, as another human being. The people who performed this  monstrous act were not acting on my behalf. Before Christmas after the Shankill  fish shop and Greysteel I really felt People Power &mdash; and the surge of revulsion  which united both communities would really prevail in bringing peace. We must  carry on working for peace and harmony together&rdquo;.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Only part of what that lady hoped for in 1994 has been  realised by us. We have brought about the peace but not the harmony and the  uniting of communities that that lady spoke about in the wake of the  Loughinisland murders.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Since the beginning of the peace process and the ongoing  political process, the SDLP was steadfast in its belief that policing reform  should be central. We led on that, took the difficult decisions and were proven  right. In light of the recent failings of the Police Ombudsman&rsquo;s office, we are  now in a situation where the strengthening of that office is central to the  process of uniting our communities by bringing us to a position of  reconciliation on the past. On reading the report on the Loughinisland  massacre, we find time and again that there is evidence not only that police  failed to conduct a proper investigation, but that officers involved appeared  to actively usurp it. I simply look to the recommendations from the Police  Ombudsman as evidence of that. However, he does not arrive at the most logical  conclusion: collusion.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">The Police Ombudsman refused to work with Judge Cory&rsquo;s  definition of collusion, which includes collusion by omission: the authorities  turning a blind eye. Despite the Police Ombudsman&rsquo;s office being governed, as I  understand it, by 38 separate pieces of legislation, he has a free hand to  decide what definition of collusion will be applied to any inquiry. If we are  to deal with the past, if we are to have an equal playing field for all  victims, and if we are to have continuity in our approach to the pursuit of  justice for those who have been murdered and their families, I believe and  contend that we must have an agreed definition of collusion.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Restoring confidence in the ombudsman&rsquo;s office can be done  only by strengthening the office in a manner that will copper-fasten its  independence through proper resourcing, staffing and finance in order to  expedite all the outstanding inquiries and to bring justice and relief to the  families. An agreed definition of collusion, perhaps legislated for, would be a  major step in safeguarding future police ombudsmen from the potential of  interference and political pressure.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">In conclusion, we will not have a united community unless  we have confidence that the tragedies and questions that hang over our past are  being dealt with in an independent, equal and just manner.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lunn</strong>: Like  others, I welcome the debate and hope that it will turn out to be a  contribution towards restoring confidence in the office of the ombudsman, which  the motion calls for. That confidence has been severely diminished by a  sequence of events, which were virtually all to do with the investigation of  historical cases, such as the tragedies at McGurk&rsquo;s Bar and Loughinisland and  the reports thereon, the resignation of the chief executive, and the  allegations made by Mr Pollock that Department of Justice officials had  interfered with the governance and functioning of the ombudsman&rsquo;s office. If I  have read the report correctly, those allegations were not upheld.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">The reports issued by Dr Maguire and Mr McCusker are  forthright and demanding in the actions required. Mr McCusker rightly demanded  that governance issues be addressed and internal divisions in the ombudsman&rsquo;s  office be dealt with. However, given the fact that there is neither a chief  executive nor a senior director of investigations in place, would it help or  hinder the need to address those problems if Mr Hutchinson were forced from  office or feels that it is appropriate to vacate his office immediately? If  Sinn F&eacute;in is so determined that he should go, and, if I have heard its Members  right, go immediately, why did the party not include that in the original  motion?</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Sinn F&eacute;in now seems to be piggybacking on the SDLP&rsquo;s  amendment, but we do not agree with it and we cannot support it. That is not to  say that we agree that Mr Hutchinson should be allowed to fulfil his timetable  and be allowed to continue until June 2012. If he can be replaced in an orderly  fashion and do his job in the meantime, fair enough, but he has issued a strong  defence for his position. He has acknowledged the problems caused by the historical  investigations, and he has accepted all the recommendations of the Maguire  report, which does not actually contain a recommendation or demand for his  demise. As many other Members said, it is generally accepted that the office&rsquo;s  performance in dealing with current cases &mdash; probably the most important ongoing  work &mdash; is satisfactory. So, given all the circumstances, we do not feel that it  is necessary to call for immediate resignation.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">The DUP amendment goes further than Dr Maguire&rsquo;s  recommendation in calling for the Minister of Justice to &ldquo;permanently suspend&rdquo;  any new historical investigations by the office. Again, that goes further than  recommendations 1 and 2 of the Maguire report. It also asks for another  oversight body to oversee what is evidently already an oversight body, which is  a point that my colleague Mr Dickson made. That just does not seem necessary.  Both demands cause us problems, and we feel that a more measured approach is  required. The suspension of historical inquiry activities, except those being  pursued jointly with the PSNI pending the full operation of the strategic plan  for the historical enquiries directorate, is enough, and another layer of  oversight does not seem realistic or necessary. So we will not be supporting  the DUP amendment either.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Byrne</strong>: I  thank the Member for giving way. Does he accept that it is crucial that the  public have confidence in the ombudsman&rsquo;s office and in the way in which it  works, and that the ombudsman&rsquo;s report into the Omagh bomb inquiry did gain  credence, particularly among the victims&rsquo; families? It is very important that  victims feel that an ombudsman&rsquo;s office works in their interest.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member will have an extra minute added to his time.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lunn</strong>: I  will not need it, Mr Speaker. The Member makes a fair point. There are  different views, as evidenced today across the Chamber, about the validity or  honesty of various historical inquiry reports. I prefer to dwell on the  present. What is the best thing for the ombudsman to do in the coming months?  What is the best thing for us to do? Is it to demand his resignation or to  accept the fact that, given the circumstances, cutting off the head of an  organisation that has already lost its two most senior personnel is not really  the way to go? I am not making a judgement on Mr Hutchinson&rsquo;s performance. He  is the man in post and, as we all know, it is not unknown for leaders to linger  for a while as their successor is sorted out.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">We support the original motion and look forward to the  Minister&rsquo;s comments on what he considers necessary to restore full confidence  in the Office of the Police Ombudsman, and his view, if he cares to give it, on  the future position of the current incumbent.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford (The  Minister of Justice)</strong>: First, I congratulate Gerry Kelly and his colleagues  on securing today&rsquo;s debate on the very important topic of restoring confidence  in the Office of the Police Ombudsman. I welcome the terms of the motion, which  should gain widespread support, and am grateful for the opportunity to address  the issues that have been raised.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">As I said when I addressed the Justice Committee on 8  September, I remain firmly of the opinion that the Office of the Police  Ombudsman is central to the policing architecture of Northern Ireland and I am  committed to ensuring that the office is able to perform its responsibilities  in a full and effective manner, capable of securing widespread public  confidence. I recognise that, on foot of the recent Criminal Justice Inspection  report and Tony McCusker&rsquo;s report to me in June, there is essential work to be  done to improve the operation of the Police Ombudsman&rsquo;s office and to ensure  that it is capable of securing widespread public confidence. The ombudsman and  I have accepted all the recommendations made in Dr Maguire&rsquo;s report. The  ombudsman and his senior management team have outlined in their action plan how  they propose to address the issues, and progress is already being made on  those.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">I want and expect a full implementation process that is  capable of independent validation so that the ombudsman&rsquo;s office will once  again fulfil its functions with the confidence of the public. I also accept  that there are areas where I can and should, with my Department, provide  support, work co-operatively and deliver the finance needed to build up  capacity on historical cases. I support the original motion, as tabled, subject  to one important caveat. That caveat is that there are proper boundaries that I  should not go beyond as Minister in ensuring that the right steps are in place  in the ombudsman&rsquo;s office.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">The ombudsman has an independence of action in respect of  the investigation of cases that I am bound to defend. I do not, however, speak  to or agree with the proposed amendments from the DUP and the SDLP. With regard  to the DUP amendment, although the reputational damage that was caused to the  ombudsman&rsquo;s office by the investigation of historical cases is acknowledged, it  would be wholly inappropriate to permanently suspend any new historical  investigations.</p>
		<p class="TimePeriod">4.45 pm</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">On 8 September, I emphasised to the Justice Committee that  the decision regarding historical cases was a suspension and not a cessation.  Our article 2 compliance with the European Court of Human Rights requires us to  have a mechanism for the independent investigation of those cases. The Police  Ombudsman still has critical responsibilities in that area. In proposing his  amendment, Peter Weir talked about different ways to deal with the past. Unless  and until a political agreement on a new mechanism is in place, that would be a  recipe for unlimited delay. There is no consensus at this stage. Currently,  there are no alternatives to the work that is being done. To permanently  suspend historical investigations &mdash; whatever &ldquo;permanently suspend&rdquo; means &mdash;  would be a direct breach of our article 2 obligations.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">I note in passing that the amendment also calls on the  Minister to take action to direct the ombudsman&rsquo;s office as to how to carry out  those duties. It is not the Minister&rsquo;s role to direct any part of the work of  the ombudsman&rsquo;s office. Therefore, on those two grounds, whatever one might  think about the sentiments behind the amendment, it is unacceptable as it  stands.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">I cannot support the SDLP&rsquo;s amendment either. It calls for  the current Police Ombudsman to resign with immediate effect. It is incumbent  on the Assembly to seek to maintain and support the policing architecture,  which has secured widespread public confidence in policing. That includes not  only the continued existence of the Office of the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland,  but the post of ombudsman and the independence and integrity of that office. No  one disputes the regrettable position in which the Office of the Police  Ombudsman finds itself at present nor underestimates the difficult period that  lies ahead as it seeks to regain public confidence in the adequacy of the  processes and the robustness of the conclusions that have been reached by the  ombudsman in respect of historical cases.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">However, there is a real need to preserve the business  continuity of the office so that current complaints &mdash; the vast bulk of  complaints against the PSNI &mdash; continue to be effectively investigated. Dr  Michael Maguire made it clear that he would have confidence in reporting any  grounds for complaint to the Office of the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland  at present.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Of primary importance to me, as I know it will be to the  Assembly, is the need for an action plan that is capable of independent  validation. That is why I welcome the ombudsman&rsquo;s commitment to seeking  independent validation from CJINI that the necessary programme of work has been  successfully completed. Al Hutchinson will invite Michael Maguire and his team  back once he considers that the recommendations have been implemented. They  will, once again, conduct a thorough inspection and provide an honest appraisal  of the situation as they find it at that stage.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">The ombudsman has properly accepted the chief inspector&rsquo;s  recommendation that no historical cases should be commenced or completed until  Criminal Justice Inspection has indicated that the recommendations are  essentially complete and the way is free to resume. I express that view  recognising that it should not be my decision any more than I should decide  which cases should be considered first or how long it should take to investigate  them. Let us not make the critical mistake of allowing what are proper and  serious concerns about the work of the ombudsman&rsquo;s office in respect of  historical cases to damage wider confidence in the policing architecture and  institutions in which I believe Northern    Ireland has every reason to have confidence.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">In that respect, I have to disagree with points that were  made by Jennifer McCann. All of the evidence shows that the office&rsquo;s current  work is being done well. The CJINI report substantiates that. However, I must  say that I have been surprised by the efforts of some people to denigrate all  aspects of the office&rsquo;s work. We cannot and should not just take those aspects  from reports that we like and ignore the bits that do not fit with the  pre-prepared narrative.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maskey</strong>:  I appreciate the Minister&rsquo;s giving way. I will try to be brief. A lot of  attention has been directed, rightly, to the past. However, does the Minister  not agree that, on a number of relatively recent occasions that are absolutely  nothing to do with the conflict, the ombudsman&rsquo;s office has been shabby?  Indeed, one such occasion was the subject of a serious report by Sam Pollock  himself; the Taylor case in Coleraine, which resulted in a Public Prosecution  Service member of staff being suspended for up to four years. That is not  conflict-related. It is not the past. It is recent. It is very current. At  present, certain families feel aggrieved by the shabby treatment of their  complaints against the police by the ombudsman&rsquo;s office. Some of that has been  written up in substantial reports by Sam Pollock and has been acknowledged by  the current ombudsman, Al Hutchinson.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  accept the Member&rsquo;s point. The CJINI report highlighted a couple of issues with  current cases. However, against the backdrop of something like 3,000 cases  every year, the reality is that the vast majority of cases are being dealt with  well. If we accept Michael Maguire&rsquo;s critical assessment of how the office  conducts and reports its investigation in historical cases, we must also accept  his endorsement of the way in which it carries out its investigations into  current cases.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Many Members concentrated on the issue of dealing with the  past. I think every Member from the Ulster Unionist, SDLP and Alliance parts of  the Chamber who spoke mentioned the issue of the past. The absence of a  political consensus about the past makes it hard to envisage the early creation  of any alternative mechanism to address these cases. The ombudsman is clear  that, in the absence of an alternative and all-encompassing approach to the  past, contention about the adequacy of the investigation of historical cases  will always feature where the outcome does not fit with an existing point of  view, and I agree with him.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">I restate my view on the need for a discussion on how we  tackle the past and in particular on how we avoid focusing on a small number of  the most contentious cases becoming a major problem for the overall justice  system. I also reiterate my call for a public debate on these issues and urge the  Secretary of State and the First Minister and deputy First Minister to consider  how that debate can most effectively be taken forward. That is an issue for all  of us. The past simply cannot be left to the Historical Enquiries Team, the  ombudsman and the Coroners Service conducting legacy inquests.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Conall McDevitt said that it was a shameful failure of this  House in not dealing with the past and John McCallister said that it was a  collective failure. In response to John&rsquo;s request for me to say something about  my views as to how to deal with the past: this debate is not where we should be  discussing the past entirely. However, I believe that the Eames/Bradley  Consultative Group on the Past produced what should have been a starting  position for discussion. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: The  fact that certain Members have concerns about the one particular issue, namely  the payments, should not damage the other good work done by that group. As I  said, this is not an issue for today; it is an issue that requires significant  discussion and perhaps should be conducted at a rather more serious level than  the one that greeted my reference to Eames/Bradley.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">There has been much debate about when Al Hutchinson should  resign. Let us be clear and practical: an office with no ombudsman, no  permanent chief executive and no senior director of investigations would not be  a properly functioning office. That was a point made by the two next most  senior officers when they went to the Justice Committee. It does not make sense  to operate in that way, and I question those who believe that it does, whatever  their misgivings about historical cases.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">The process for appointing a new ombudsman is one for the  First Minister and deputy First Minister. I wrote to them last week in light of  their responsibility for the process and the necessity to proceed with it as  soon as possible. I also made it clear in my correspondence to them that the  appointment process should not be delayed to allow time to address the wider  concerns that exist about the ombudsman&rsquo;s office.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">As he made clear to the Justice Committee, the current  ombudsman is open to leaving earlier than the date he specified &mdash; 1 June 2012 &mdash;  if a new appointee is ready to take up office before then. That is a practical  and common-sense approach, which, frankly, leaves the responsibility where it  correctly lies, which is with the First Minister and deputy First Minister.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">In conclusion, the existence of an effective and  independent complaints system is something that the public and the police have  a right to expect. That is a key part of the policing architecture in Northern  Ireland and is intended to secure public confidence in the Police Service. It  must be our aim to get public confidence in every respect.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">The system for current complaints is fully functioning.  What we now need is comprehensive action to fix the problem with governance and  historical cases. I and my Department will take the steps that we properly can  to enable and support that whilst respecting the operational independence of  the office. I am clear about the proper limits of intervention. I accept the  motion as tabled, but, for the technical reasons that I outlined, I cannot  accept either of the amendments.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  There is no witch-hunt as far as the SDLP is concerned in relation to Al  Hutchinson. We respect him as an individual. However, we believe that he got  things very badly wrong. Three reports substantiate that: one by the Committee  on the Administration of Justice, one by Mr Tony McCusker and one by the CJI.  All were independent, and all indicated difficulties in the office. Indeed, by  showing dysfunctionality in that office, the McCusker report prefigured what  was contained in the Criminal Justice Inspection&rsquo;s report. That  dysfunctionality does not arise from the flaws of individuals in the office; it  arises from the Police Ombudsman&rsquo;s lack of leadership when organising, dealing  with issues, supervising and making sure that his office had a critical edge.  The fact that he did not create a situation in which management was able to  cope, work together and develop systems and protocols for dealing with the  issues involved &mdash; highly critical issues for all of us in the House &mdash; is his  personal responsibility.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">It is with some sadness that I and my party ask for his  resignation. We believe that a new leader is needed at the top of the  ombudsman&rsquo;s office. If there is no new leadership, and soon, the damage already  caused to that office will simply be exacerbated. We want to limit that damage  and rebuild the office. That requires a new leader at the top, and this Police  Ombudsman should, therefore, go as quickly as possible.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">The ombudsman&rsquo;s office is a bulwark for the PSNI and for  policing here in Northern Ireland. We need a good, efficient and effective  office, which has the confidence of the community. We do not have that at the  moment.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">There has been much talk about lopping off or removing  historical cases from the purview of the office. That simply cannot be done,  because the legislation says that there is an obligation and requirement for  that office to investigate those historical cases. That is because, under  article 2 obligations of the European Convention, it is necessary for those  historical cases to be investigated. That is a legal obligation. Indeed, as the  Minister of Justice said so robustly in the House today, you cannot possibly  remove historical cases from the ombudsman&rsquo;s office without having an  alternative, and, quite simply, no such alternative has been established.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Will the Member give way on that point?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  Do I get another minute?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Yes. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  You did not want to hear it just in case it was good.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Surely the Member understands that the matter has been  settled and that, for the purposes of investigating issues of the past, the  PSNI is not the RUC, so an alternative way could be found. In fact, the HET was  also referred to in Government submissions as a body looking after the past. It  is not specified who shall do it, only that, under European legislation, there  should be another body, and we could set up another such body.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  I am grateful for those comments, but I re-emphasise the Minister of Justice&rsquo;s  point that there is no alternative. Currently, we have a mechanism whereby the  actions of the RUC and, indeed, the actions of the PSNI in relation to article  2 obligations can be thoroughly investigated. There is no alternative, and it  would be absurd for the ombudsman&rsquo;s office to be expanded to include people  from outside the police.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That is the substance of the argument put forward  by unionists, in particular, today. The argument is that, because there is no  investigative process in relation to the past, which we as a political party  want to see, you throw the baby out with the bath water. In other words, you do  not have a mechanism to investigate the RUC and past failings that have been  proven by the Police Ombudsman&rsquo;s office.</p>
		<p class="TimePeriod">5.00 pm</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">We should commit ourselves once again to supporting the  Office of the Police Ombudsman. However, the only way to do that &mdash;</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member should draw his remarks to a close.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  &mdash; and remedying this situation is to replace the current Police Ombudsman and  replace &mdash;</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Time is up.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  &mdash; weak leadership with strong leadership that reconstructs the office.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wells</strong>: We  have to remember exactly why the Office of the Police Ombudsman was created.  Those of us who have been around for a very long time will recall the period  when, if you made a complaint against the conduct of an individual RUC officer,  that complaint was considered by a more senior RUC officer. Some made the point  that that indicated a conflict of interest. One of the recommendations was to  establish an independent ombudsman or ombudsperson &mdash; whatever you want to call  it &mdash; that would be totally detached from the RUC or the PSNI, as it is now.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">I have noticed that throughout all the contributions, even  those made by Members who clearly have some agenda against Al Hutchinson, there  was very little complaint about his work in carrying out the day-to-day role of  investigating individual complaints lodged by members of the public or their  representatives. That was the main principle that established the Office of the  Police Ombudsman, and Al Hutchinson seems to get a very high mark for that  aspect. It is interesting that he has carried out that role without the  controversy that surrounded his predecessor. We all remember just how  controversial the office was under Nuala O&rsquo;Loan. It seemed that not a week went  by when she was not embroiled in some issue that brought controversy to her  door. Al Hutchinson has got on with that work in a low-key but effective  manner, and many of us who have used him have found him to be extremely  efficient.</p>
		<p class="B3SpeakerinChair">(Mr Principal Deputy Speaker &nbsp;[Mr Molloy] in the Chair)</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">The difficulty is that, in the middle of all this, the  poisoned chalice of historical inquiries and the past has been foisted on the  office. No one in the House would believe for one moment that that is not a  terribly difficult issue. The theme has emerged in this debate time and time  again. The problem for the Members opposite is that Al Hutchinson and his team  have looked into some of those issues and not come up with the reports that  they would have liked. It is as simple as that. Rather than suggest for one  moment that he may have come up with a balanced argument, they demand his head  on a plate. I have great concerns about politicians demanding the head of  someone who is meant to be independent from both the police and other  institutions. That worries me. It means that every time whoever succeeds Mr  Hutchinson does something that Sinn F&eacute;in or the SDLP do not like, those parties  will immediately rush to demand that he must be removed and &ldquo;off with his  head&rdquo;. The reality may be that they simply do not agree with what he said.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Mr Weir talked about the selectivity of the demand for  inquiries, which was one of the strongest points made in the debate. Let us be  honest: there are individuals in the Chamber who have a terrorist past. Indeed,  there are individuals who spoke in the debate who have a very difficult and  bloody terrorist past. We know whom we are talking about. The proposer of the  motion, for instance, has been convicted of it. It is OK to demand an inquiry  into the activities of the lawful forces of the PSNI or the RUC. That is fine &mdash;  they can be held up to ridicule &mdash; but woe betide anyone who asks for an inquiry  into the activities of MLAs who have a very seedy past; that is not allowed.  Equally, in the Loughinisland case, which affects my constituency, it seems to  me that it is not a question of Mr Hutchinson&rsquo;s incompetence. It is quite  simply a question of not agreeing with the outcome of the report that seems to  be the issue. I must say that alarm bells ring in my head about allowing the  ombudsman to be held up as a sacrificial lamb because his reports do not agree  with the preconceived prejudices of certain nationalist MLAs.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Let us say that the amendment proposed by the SDLP were to  be made here today, and Mr Hutchinson decided, &ldquo;Yes, they are absolutely right.  I have listened to the pearls of wisdom and Conall McDevitt&rsquo;s leadership  speech. It was wonderful, and I will support what he said and resign in the  morning.&rdquo; Where does that leave us? The Justice Minister put it absolutely correctly,  and so did Mr Lunn. It leaves us without a Police Ombudsman and without several  senior officers. That is a recipe for chaos. Even party leaders, when they  resign, give at least several months&rsquo; notice so that their position can be  replaced.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>:  Does the Member agree with me that the situation as highlighted there just  shows the sheer folly of the position of the SDLP on the issue?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wells</strong>:  Absolutely. On Thursday, Mr McDevitt sat all day at the Policing Board  appointing a senior police officer. That is an important task. He knows how  long it took to advertise that position, to trawl through those who applied and  to go through the interview procedure. You simply cannot replace a high-powered  position such as that overnight. The SDLP is saying that we should leave the  Police Ombudsman&rsquo;s office completely headless for the next eight or nine months  while that is going on. That is no way for an individual who has a concern  about the activity of the police or the conduct of an individual police officer  to go forward. That is no way to leave that organisation.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Al Hutchinson, under considerable pressure, has agreed to  step aside in June 2012. That is the honourable thing to do. He has given  sufficient time for his replacement to be appointed. I do not think that we, as  an Assembly, have the right to demand that he goes and when he goes. We need to  give him and the office the time to have a smooth transition to a new  ombudsman. That is the best way forward for all the people of Northern Ireland.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCartney</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Ba mhaith liom bu&iacute;ochas a  thabhairt do achan duine a labhair inniu. I want to begin by reminding Members  of the rationale of the motion that we put forward after examination of the  Criminal Justice Inspection&rsquo;s report into the Police Ombudsman&rsquo;s office,  particularly around independence and the public confidence in that office. Core  to that is the statutory requirement that the office has to be independent for  it to comply with article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">The CJI report &mdash; this has perhaps been missed by a lot of  the people who spoke this afternoon &mdash; came about because the ombudsman asked  for it. It was not Sinn F&eacute;in, the SDLP or any other political party; it was the  ombudsman himself. The reason it came about &mdash; the ombudsman himself accepts  this &mdash; is that the chief executive brought the inner workings of his office  into the public domain. Tony McCusker was in front of the Committee and gave a  particular insight into the relationships within the office. It was the  ombudsman who asked for the report and no one else.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Peter Weir made the observation &mdash; I think that other people  have made the same observation &mdash; that there are people who think that the  current ombudsman is not doing a good job, people who think that he is doing a  better job, others who think that Nuala O&rsquo;Loan did that type of job and that  someone did a better job, or whatever. The most important thing is that, when  you have competing or contrasting views, you establish an independent body,  which is then tasked to tell us what it thinks of the workings of the  ombudsman&rsquo;s office.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">In 2005, the Criminal Justice Inspection did a report into  the office of the ombudsman, and it stated that it found an effective,  efficient organisation. It also went on to state that it was:</p>
		<p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;delivering on its stated aims and objectives with  public confidence in the system increasing&rdquo;.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">When Michael Maguire was in front of the Committee, he was  asked if he could say the same about the ombudsman&rsquo;s office in 2011, and he  said that he could not. That is the independent view, which is telling us that  the ombudsman&rsquo;s office is not effective and efficient. That is what we &mdash;</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCartney</strong>:  No, I am not giving way. You had your chance.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Michael Maguire articulated that to the Committee. He was  in no doubt &mdash; I have not heard a dissenting view today contradicting him &mdash; that  the independence of the office was lowered. I have not heard a dissenting  voice. Not one person contradicted Michael Maguire when he said that.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>A Member</strong>:  Are you not giving way?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  He will not give way.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCartney</strong>:  It is not a matter of giving way. You had your opportunity.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Bear in mind that, when he was asked about the state of his  office, the Police Ombudsman told the Committee that it was unprecedented in  his 44 years in public office. It is not just Michael Maguire, Sinn F&eacute;in or  anyone else saying it. The Police Ombudsman himself said that the flaws in his  office were unprecedented in his 44 years in public office.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCartney</strong>:  No, I am not giving way.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">He went on to say that not only did he accept that but that  he was in charge and was the person responsible. We are being asked by Members  to accept that a person who tells us that his organisation is inefficient and  ineffective &mdash; in his opinion, an unprecedented situation &mdash; should continue in  that office. We have said that he accepts that he is the person responsible and  that he was the person at the wheel who drove the machine to where it is. We  all accepted &mdash; there were no dissenting voices &mdash; that the organisation&rsquo;s level  of independence has been lowered. When the Minister appeared before the  Committee, Stewart Dickson made the point that, in any other public authority,  the incumbent would be asked to go. He was right when he said that.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Other Members have itemised some particular cases. However,  this is not about individual reports but about the office as a whole. The  Minister must have that in mind when he takes the matter forward to restore  public confidence. There was a clash of views. Michael Maguire stated very  clearly that reports were altered to lessen criticism of the police, but Al  Hutchinson denied that that was the case. There was a conflict, which was to do  with the fact that the independent voice must be listened to. When Michael  Maguire was asked to continue, he said that the status quo was no longer  acceptable. In fairness to him, when he was asked whether that meant that the  status quo could take us forward, he said that he was not in a position to say  that. However, I think that we all arrived at the same conclusion.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">The Minister said today that we have to accept Michael  Maguire&rsquo;s assertion that he is fine about the non-historical cases. Some Members  on the other Benches made the case that Michael Maguire did say that he would  go to the Police Ombudsman with an ordinary complaint. However, Dr Maguire also  said that the status quo could not take us forward. That is the most important  point in this debate.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">I want to deal with a couple of things that Members said.  Basil McCrea said very clearly that when it comes to public confidence, the  Police Ombudsman&rsquo;s office is &ldquo;completely and utterly trashed&rdquo;. We have to ask  who is responsible for that. I heard Members say today that we cannot call for  a person who holds public office to resign. That is incomprehensible. If the  person is accountable, he or she can be asked to resign. We were told that we  cannot ask people to resign in case there is no one to replace them. If someone  makes a hames of a job, we cannot call on that person to resign because he or  she can say that no replacement is available. That amounts to a very  short-sighted public office.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Stewart Dickson and Trevor Lunn made an important point about  the way forward. To me, the way forward is not what the Minister outlined  today; rather, it is a very simple explanation. The incumbent Police Ombudsman  has accepted that he is the person responsible for the mess. It was the Police  Ombudsman himself &mdash; not me &mdash; who said that the situation had come into the  public domain only because the chief executive resigned. It is important that  we acknowledge that.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Jonathan Craig asked why this debate was taking place today  and why we were challenging the Police Ombudsman&rsquo;s view. We are challenging it  because he asked for it, in the shape of the report. The Ombudsman invited the  CJI to produce a report, the findings of which are damning. In my opinion, the  Police Ombudsman&rsquo;s position is totally and absolutely untenable. John  McCallister talked about people rewriting history. We can all say, do and feel  what we like about that particular statement, but in this instance it is very  topical. Reports were rewritten, and Michael Maguire made it very clear in his  report that reports were altered to lessen criticism of the police. He stated  that in full view of the Committee, and I did not hear anyone challenge him. In  fact, he verified it on a number of occasions. Every member of the Committee  was present. It is very important to make the point that, to have confidence in  the independence of the ombudsman&rsquo;s office, we cannot allow a situation to  arise in which people rewrite reports willy-nilly.</p>
		<p class="TimePeriod">5.15 pm</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">The clinching point, to which the Minister needs to provide  an answer, is that two senior members of the ombudsman&rsquo;s team went to him and  said that they wanted to distance themselves from the report.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Spratt</strong>:  Were they independent?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCartney</strong>:  It is not a matter of whether they were independent. They went to the ombudsman  and told him that they wanted to distance themselves from the report, and the  ombudsman conceded. Therefore, two people set out to carry out an  investigation, their findings went to the senior team in the ombudsman&rsquo;s  office, and the report that was sent out had a different complexion. They then  went back and said that they would not stand over it, and the ombudsman  accepted that. Why would anybody accept a piece of work, alter it, and then,  when two senior people go back to him, say, &ldquo;OK, you were not part of that.&rdquo;?  We put that to Michael Maguire, who has long years of service in holding public  officials to account. We asked him whether he had seen or experienced anything  like that before in his life, and he said no. Two senior members of his team  were there when he was asked what sort of place it would be if they wished to  distance themselves from a report being put in front of us, and they all  laughed. That laughter told us the state of the ombudsman&rsquo;s office.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Principal  Deputy Speaker</strong>: The Member should bring his remarks to a close.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCartney</strong>:  We ask Members to support the motion. We will support the SDLP amendment and  reject the DUP amendment. Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.</p>
