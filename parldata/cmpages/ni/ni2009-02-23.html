        <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The Assembly met at 12.00 noon (Mr Speaker in the  Chair).</p>
        <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Members observed two minutes&rsquo; silence.</p>
        <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="1"></a>Assembly Business</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P J Bradley</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Speaker. I was told that the Minister of Agriculture  and Rural Development would be making a statement in the House on the  farm-modernisation programme. Has the Minister been in touch with your office  about making such a statement?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  It is up to individual Ministers whether they wish to make a statement in the  House on any matter. I have not had a request from the Minister of Agriculture  and Rural Development to make a statement.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Maskey</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Speaker. Last week, while making a point of order, Rev  Willie McCrea spent a couple of minutes questioning whether a Minister should  resign. Given that the Speaker has made a ruling that such matters are clearly  not points of order, was it right for the Member to have been allowed to waste  that time? Go raibh maith agat.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  On more than one occasion in the House, I have brought the abuse of points of  order to Members&rsquo; attention. Points of order must be relevant to the business  that is being discussed in the House. I have not checked the Hansard report for  the incident that the Member mentioned, but I am happy to do so. Occasionally,  Members on all sides of the House abuse points of order. Nevertheless, in that  instance, it would have been better had the Member raised his point of order  after the debate. Points of order should not be abused in any shape, form or  fashion. Points of order should relate to the business that is taking place in  the House at that time.</p>
        <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="2"></a>Executive Committee Business</p>
        <p class="H4StageHeading">Financial Provisions Bill</p>
        <p class="H4StageHeading">First Stage</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel (Mr Dodds)</strong>: I beg to introduce the Financial  Provisions Bill [NIA 6/08], which is a Bill to confer absolute privilege on  certain reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General for Northern Ireland; to  enable the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment to incur expenditure  for certain purposes; to provide for the costs of district rates collection to  be charged on and issued out of the Consolidated Fund to the Department of  Finance and Personnel; and to repeal the requirement on the Department of  Finance and Personnel to prepare finance accounts.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Bill passed First Stage and ordered to be printed.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Bill will now be put on the list of future business until a date for its  Second Stage is determined.</p>
        <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="3"></a>Private Members&rsquo; Business</p>
        <p class="H4StageHeading">Closure of Residential Care Homes</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Business Committee has agreed to allow up to one hour and 30 minutes for  the debate. The proposer of the motion will have 10 minutes to propose and 10  minutes to make a winding-up speech. All other Members who are called to speak  will have five minutes. One amendment has been selected and published on the  Marshalled List. The proposer of the amendment will have 10 minutes to propose  and five minutes to make a winding-up speech.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: I  beg to move</p>
        <p class="Q3Motion">That the Assembly expresses its opposition to the proposed  closure of residential care homes by a number of Health and Social Care Trusts;  and calls on the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety to  intervene and listen to the concerns of the community and take appropriate  action to minimise the pain, stress and anxiety that this uncertainty has  created among elderly care home residents, their families and health workers.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I have no pleasure in moving the motion, because we should  not be in this situation. During the debate, I suspect that some Members &mdash;  including the Minister in his response &mdash; will state that the Minister&rsquo;s hands  are tied and that due to the requirement on him to make efficiency savings, he  has no option but to consider closing residential care homes. Let me put that  notion to bed; it is inaccurate.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The spend per head in the Department of Health, Social  Services and Public Safety (DHSSPS) is 10% higher than it is in England, and  there are 23% more jobs in the Health Service here than there are in England.  Furthermore, there has been an 11&middot;9% increase in the health budget from 2007-08  to 2010-11. Therefore, the health budget has increased by 11&middot;9% over three  years; it has not been cut. Some 51% of additional allocations throughout the  Northern Ireland Departments went to the Department of Health, Social Services  and Public Safety, as against the existing budget of 48%.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">By 2010-11, spending in the Department of Health, Social  Services and Public Safety will rise to &pound;4&middot;3 billion. That is more than double  the amount spent on health in 2000-01. Let us be honest with the people: there  are efficiency savings to be made. That should not be seen as an opportunity to  make cuts in the Health Service; it has more money now than it had &mdash; not less.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">We are aware that staff productivity is 11% less. In the  past five years, staff numbers in the Health Service have risen by 21&middot;4%, but  hospital activity has increased by only 6&middot;3%. Although I sympathise with the  Minister in that regard, he has a challenging job to do. People who have been  engaged in administration for a long time intend to hold onto their jobs, by  hook or by crook. They will provide the Minister with 101 reasons why their  jobs are so important, when, in fact, those jobs are of minimal importance to  the Health Service when compared with the issue that is being debated today.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">If you do not want to take my word for it, why not take the  word of Professor John Appleby, who was brought in to look at the Health  Service. He identified that the unit cost of hospital procedures in Northern  Ireland is 9% higher than those in England; hospital throughput is 26% less;  consultant productivity is 7&middot;4% less; public-health habits relating to diet,  alcohol and exercise are worse; GP lists are 10% shorter; spend per head on  prescriptions is 29% greater; and the ratio of our nurses, vis-&agrave;-vis  qualified/unqualified, is greater.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Let us be honest and identify that the cuts &mdash; or the efficiency  savings &mdash; need to be made in administration, not in the front line services.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Having posed nine questions on that issue to the Minister  of Health, I am disgusted that I have not received answers to the vast majority  of those. Those simple questions asked, for example, how many statutory homes  in the 15-mile radius surrounding Dromore are closing or have closed, and how  many bed places have been lost in the past five years. Answering those  questions should not be very hard to do, but Mr McGimpsey says that the  information is not available in the format requested and could only be provided  at a disproportionate cost. That is rubbish, yet the same response has been  given to a number of questions that have been asked of the Minister.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I am deeply disappointed that the Minister refuses to  answer the questions. The same situation applies when the people on the Skeagh  House committee ask questions of the local health trust &mdash; they cannot get  answers either. Clearly, the health trusts and the Department of Health are  clamming up and are not prepared to talk to people.</p>
        <p class="B3SpeakerinChair">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr McClarty] in the Chair)</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Skeagh House is a care home in my constituency. We are  deeply concerned about the closure of that home, as the service that is  provided there is second to none. However, I am only a politician; people do  not believe politicians. Perhaps they will believe the professionals in the  health field, the doctors in Dromore, who say:</p>
        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;we have visited the home, often on a weekly basis,  almost since it opened and were delighted to celebrate the 25th anniversary  recently. During those years we have been in a position to observe the quality  of the service provided by the staff at the home to the residents. We have  consistently observed what a high quality service is provided at all times. It  is interesting to observe that many of the Southern Board officers leading the  closure campaign have only been in post for less than two years.</p>
        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">All the doctors and practice staff, as well as the  district nurses hold the Staff and personnel working in Skeagh House in the  highest esteem. The facilities offered by the home are modern, safe and  effective. There is a &lsquo;home away from home&rsquo; atmosphere and all staff hold the  residents, who are frequently in later life or have other physical or mental  challenges, in the highest respect. &hellip;</p>
        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">We are being consistently told by relatives of the  inconvenience that would result from having to travel to neighbouring towns by  public transport, to visit their family who might be residents elsewhere.  Residents benefit from remaining in their own locality and being in contact  with old friends and neighbours.&rdquo;</p>
        <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That is what the doctors &mdash; the health professionals  &mdash; say.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Never mind what I, or the doctors, say: let us hear what  the residents have to say, because they are the most important people. I will  read an extract from a letter that I received from a lady, who, for the sake of  anonymity, I will call Annie. Annie says:</p>
        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;I had the privilege of working in Skeagh House for 12  happy years, but had to leave because I had a major heart attack in October  2004 and a defibrillator implanted. During this time, I was caring for my  90-year-old mother &hellip; a frail lady who has muscular degeneration. Being blind in  one eye and partially sighted in the other, she also walks with aid of a  rolator. She is now 94 years old and when I took ill so suddenly, she was  admitted to Skeagh House as an emergency admission, as there was no one to care  for her. I still care for my mother 24/7 and she would go to Skeagh House every  6 weeks for respite for 2 weeks, which is greatly needed on advice from my  consultant, in the Belfast   City Hospital.&rdquo;</p>
        <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That is one case.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I will read a letter that describes the case of another  lady, whom I will call Mary, who:</p>
        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;lived alone in Portadown after her husband died and  she retired from her job in the library when she was 60. She was registered  blind on 16 October 1992 and received the services of a home help as it was  unsafe for her to cook. When pouring a cup of tea, she placed the cup in the  sink as a safety measure. Then she received a liquid leveller which made a  noise when the correct amount was in the cup.</p>
        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">It was obvious that as her sight loss was a big  handicap, residential care was necessary and almost nine years ago she came to  Skeagh House after her family had considered a number of options. Skeagh House  appealed to them because of the layout and the friendly staff. She now looks on  Skeagh House as her home and is happy and feels secure there. She would have  great difficulty in adapting to new surroundings because of her poor eyesight.</p>
        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">The news came as a great shock and has left her  broken-hearted and her family very unhappy. Due to uncertainty, it spoiled  Christmas for them all.&rdquo;</p>
        <p class="TimePeriod">12.15 pm</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I give Members another example:</p>
        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;My mum &hellip; has worked, lived in the Dromore area all  her life, drove her own car and lived alone since my father died. Following his  death, my mum&rsquo;s home was broken into and items stolen &mdash; still she didn&rsquo;t give  up and soldiered on independently. Later she was diagnosed with osteoporosis and  also suffered a stroke. She was hospitalised at this time for nine months in Lagan Valley   Hospital, Lisburn. She  was then advised that it would be unsafe for her to return to her own home and  independent living; residential care had to be her future.</p>
        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">After my sister and I had taken mum to see several  residential homes, her choice was Skeagh House. We were united in our opinion  as to the warm and comfortable surroundings and very friendly staff. This has  been mum&rsquo;s home since August 2000 and she feels happy and secure there.</p>
        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">My mum will be 89 years of age in April and could I  ask how at this age she can go looking for a new home? Some of the other  residents are much older and some have failing eyesight.&rdquo;</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">That is the situation in case after case in that Southern Trust  home, where 102 people are in statutory residential care. Minister, those are  102 human beings, not 102 units, 102 vehicles in a fleet or 102 pallets in a  warehouse. Those are 102 human beings &mdash; people who served our community for  years, in grim times. Many of them lived through the Second World War, and they  all came through the worst excesses of the Troubles in Northern Ireland.  They have worked to create a better environment for us. What are we going to do  for them? Are we going to turf them out of the home that they have come to love  over the years, or are we going to support them?</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister must find efficiency savings where he can. I  have identified that he has additional money and that he can make those  efficiency savings elsewhere. I have a volume of signed petitions, and there  are more to come. The public are deeply angered by the proposal &mdash;</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I ask the Member to draw his remarks to a close.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: I  am thankful for the opportunity to bring this serious matter before the House  today.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs O&rsquo;Neill</strong>:  I beg to move the following amendment: At end insert</p>
        <p class="Q3Motion">&ldquo;; and further calls on the Minister to ensure that any  proposals coming from Trusts are equality proofed so that services are  available for those most in need.&rdquo;</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I commend the  Members&rsquo; opposite for tabling the motion. I hope that they can accept Sinn  F&eacute;in&rsquo;s amendment, because it enhances the motion&rsquo;s sentiments.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Members will be aware that the Committee for Health, Social  Services and Public Safety brought a motion to the House last week that called  for the protection of the most vulnerable in society. Many Members contributed  to that debate and expressed concern around a number of issues, which included  front line job cuts and home-help services. Few Members failed to mention the  closure of residential homes, yet those closures affect all trust areas.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">As we all know, efficiency savings are a controversial issue.  We are all aware that the purpose of those savings is to cut out waste and to  deliver the same service in a more efficient and effective way. However, those  health-sector savings appear to have impacted on the most vulnerable in  society. Staff, patients, residents and their families have all been  experiencing anxiety and concern over recent months. We must do all that we can  to protect the most vulnerable in society.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The trusts&rsquo; decisions to close residential homes have  caused widespread concerns in the wider community. The Western Trust told the  Health Committee that it had received more than 4,000 signatures opposing the  closure of one nursing home. That demonstrates that it is not just the  residents of the nursing home who are affected but wider society.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I fully support care in the community, and people should be  supported to live independently in their own homes. However, we must also be  realistic, because services are not in place to allow people to do that. People  are aware of the situation concerning home helps. Some people are allocated 15  minutes of support, which is insufficient and inadequate to help people to live  independently. If we are serious about moving towards people living  independently, we will have to address that issue. Services are already  stretched and unable to deal with people, and if many more people are to be  discharged from residential homes, I do not know how those people will manage.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">In Mid Ulster, many families depend on the services that  Cherry Lodge offers. It is a respite facility for disabled children, and it is  a lifeline for the families who use it. Often, those children have complex  needs. They must go into respite care for their security and for their family  to have a rest. A campaign has been mounted in Mid Ulster to retain Cherry  Lodge, and I support the calls from the families to keep the facility open. My  colleague Francie Molloy and I recently visited the Northern Health and Social  Care Trust&rsquo;s headquarters, where we spoke to its chief executive and  chairperson to put the case for that residential home and other challenging issues  in its proposals.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">At that meeting, the chief executive gave a commitment that  no change will take place until people and their families are content and  satisfied that any new system or service will continue in the future. We will  continue to monitor that emerging situation very closely.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">As Mr Poots said, a number of people took time out of their  schedule this morning to come to the Assembly to present Members with a list of  names in a petition. It is clear from the pile of papers that Mr Poots showed  us this morning that there is genuine concern in the community about the  proposed closure of the homes. Our amendment calls on the Minister to ensure  that any proposals to emerge from the trust are equality proofed so that  services will be available for those most in need. We have a moral obligation  to protect the most vulnerable in our society. We must ensure that there is  equality of outcome for all in relation to access to services, but, in  particular, for the elderly, the disabled and the young.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I am aware that the proposals were equality proofed when  they were initially published, but if real consultation takes place and the  trusts take on board what the communities are telling them, any changes and  decisions will have to be equality proofed.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">We can all accept that the pocket money that the British  Treasury has allowed us is inadequate, to say the least. Even if we had a  massive pot of money for health, I do not believe that it would ever be enough.  There will always be demands on the Health Service, but we must accept reality;  we have to live with the resources that are available, and we must target them  at those who are most in need. Efficiencies need to be achieved where they can,  but they should not be focused on the services for the most vulnerable in  society. I urge Members to support the motion and the amendment. Go raibh maith  agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  This subject is very important and emotive, and there is a recognition that it  has certainly caused concern and alarm in communities throughout Northern Ireland.  I am quite sure that the issue has been brought to the attention of each and  every MLA in their constituency work.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Care homes provide a valuable service in looking after our  elderly people who have contributed so much to society throughout their lives.  Many people who live in care homes are extremely vulnerable. For those people,  care homes become their homes, and their fellow residents and carers become an  extension of their families.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Care homes are also of great benefit to families who do not  have the ability, or facilities, to care for their loved one. Local care homes  allow people to live close to their families, friends and communities. Of  course, health trusts span various constituencies, and some cater for people in  my constituency and in neighbouring constituencies. Mr Poots mentioned Skeagh  House care home in Dromore, and I must also mention the Grove House in  Ballynahinch and Slieve Roe House in Kilkeel.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>:  Does the Member agree that the matter is widespread across Northern Ireland?  In my constituency of East Antrim, there is the Lisgarel residential care home  in Larne, Greenisland House in the Carrickfergus area, and Clonmore House  residential care home in the Newtownabbey  area, which is also a concern for my colleague for North Belfast Mr Cobain. All  those homes are central to service provision in the East   Antrim area, which has already suffered years and years of  diminution of its health services generally. Does the Member agree that the  centrality of those homes &mdash; right at the heart of the communities &mdash; adds to the  value of the excellent work that is taking place there?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I thank my colleague for that intervention. When I think of homes such as Slieve  Roe House in the isolated Mourne area, I realise that it is essential that, as  we move forward, we strike the right balance. We must keep people near their  communities and value the health benefits that derive from that.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">However, we must face reality; this situation is not of the  Health Minister&rsquo;s making. The fact is that the health budget is clearly  inadequate. There is a funding gap of &pound;600 million between provision in Northern Ireland and England. That is the figure with  which the Department of Finance and Personnel (DFP) agrees. I am not sure what  figure Mr Poots referred to earlier, but the figure that I have just quoted is  from the Department of his colleague, the Minister of Finance and Personnel. I  must point out that no decisions have been taken on the future of those care  homes and that the consultation is still very much ongoing.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  Does the Member agree that where a residential home, such as Ard Cuan in my  Strangford constituency, is under pressure from the trusts &mdash; I must emphasise  the trusts&rsquo; consultation on proposed closures &mdash; the legal definition of the  word &ldquo;residential&rdquo; must be determined. The families and residents whom he talks  about in his area, just like the families and residents in my area, believe  that living in a residential home involves a contract of tenure. Therefore, we  need to assess the legality of the word &ldquo;residential&rdquo; and what it means to  those people.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  Absolutely. My honourable friend raised several points, not all of which  related to the definition. Everyone wants their loved ones to live  independently, or to live with them, for as long as possible, but there will  always be a need for residential care provision, and appropriate levels of care  must be put in place. During Committee evidence sessions, officials from some  trusts said that they did not have sufficient care packages in place, which was  worrying, and it raises the question of how they will cope.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The implications for the Budget were that the 3% efficiency  savings were rock solid. That was imposed, and supported, by the DUP. Now,  suddenly, the DUP seems to want to distance itself from that.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Tut-tut.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  Some Members can tut-tut all they want, but the DUP nailed its colours to the  mast regarding the 3% efficiencies.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I am running short on time, and I have already given way twice.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Consultations are being carried out with trusts, care homes  and communities. That is a necessary step, but no decisions have yet been  taken. Although recognising the potential ordeal involved in moving elderly  people from their established homes, this is also part of the long-term  strategy of implementing the relevant aspects of the Appleby Report, which Mr  Poots referred to, and facilitating and supporting more elderly people to live  in their own homes in the community.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The current strategic direction is to maintain people  living independently in the community for as long as possible. I do not think  that anyone will object to that, providing the appropriate support is in place,  but we need residential homes as back-up care facilities.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The DUP is constantly championing the Appleby Report, and  no one has promoted Appleby&rsquo;s findings on the public-health agenda more than  the current Minister.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Will the Member draw his remarks to a close?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  The motion is worthy of support, but people must champion more money for the  health budget.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Hanna</strong>: I  support the motion, and I thank the Members who proposed it. However, I wish  that they had talked to their leader and the Finance Minister and thought  through the detail and impact of the 3% cuts. The proposal by a number of  health and social care trusts to close statutory residential homes is  ill-advised and is being driven primarily by the unending pressure on them to  cut costs and make savings at the sharp, or delivery, end. The constant  pressure for cost saving, when engaging with our elderly population, is  counterproductive, and, in the long run, may increase the burden on the  taxpayer unnecessarily.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Over the past few decades, the trend has been to close  statutory care nursing and residential homes for the elderly, and for the  elderly and mentally infirm. The motive for the great majority of closures has  been financial. They are being closed by stealth. Some homes are in a state of  disrepair and need to be modernised, but that is also the case for other  healthcare facilities. Although there are some not-for-profit homes run by  religious institutions, charities and the like, we are now dependent on the  private-for-profit sector to look after about 85%, or 17 out of 20, of our  elderly population.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I am not hostile to private-for-profit providers of  residential care. I acknowledge that most homes are well run and have  twice-yearly inspections by quality impact assessors who look at staff,  accommodation, building fabric, etc. However, the fact must be faced that the  primary objective of those homes is to make a profit and a return on capital on  the often very significant investment that private residential homeowners have  to make. That means that they must ensure that income exceeds cost, and there  may be an inevitable temptation to do the minimum necessary to pass the  inspections.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The owners of some residential homes are already under  financial pressure, but what other area of healthcare for the very vulnerable  is expected to make a profit?</p>
        <p class="TimePeriod">12.30 pm</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">It is more feasible for statutory homes to set standards of  excellence and innovation. Because the private sector must make a profit each  year, it will inevitably be driven to be more selective in the type of elderly  resident it accepts. It will be more reluctant to accept people with more  complex needs, because such elderly people need more care in certain matters.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Often, an elderly person with a particular need may  otherwise be very independent and mentally alert and need no nursing care. Such  care would detract from that person&rsquo;s independence and autonomy, because he or  she would mix with other, frailer and more dependent people. It would also cost  the taxpayer &pound;100 per week more if that person were to go into a nursing home  because there was no residential care home.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">If we close down the statutory residential homes, we will  leave a gap in the spectrum of care between, at the lower end, the fold-type of  residence with a warden, which provides care in the community for the  able-bodied and independent, and, at the upper end, nursing care. Residential  homes are also used for patients who may be &mdash; to use an awful phrase &mdash; bed  blocking, or whose discharge has been delayed. They may need rehabilitation,  physiotherapy or occupational therapy before they can be sent home.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">We are told that the best option for elderly people is that  they stay in their own homes for as long as possible &mdash; care in the community &mdash;  and I agree with that. However, domiciliary care, on a one-to-one basis, can be  very difficult to deliver. I did it for ten years and, believe me, it can be complex  and difficult. However, if there are residential homes, people can be kept more  active; they can enjoy craft, music and dance, rather than move into a nursing  home before they require it.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  Does the Member agree that, when a trust asks an elderly person whether he or  she would prefer to live in his or her own home or in a residential care home,  the question is loaded? It will almost always elicit a response in favour of  living in one&rsquo;s own home. For many people, who are not ready for a nursing home  but who cannot stay at home, residential care is the only real and practical  choice. If we go down the route of doing away with statutory residential care,  we could end up with a situation similar to that in England, where care in residential  private nursing homes is of a much lower standard than we would expect for our  elderly people.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Hanna</strong>:  Yes. That is exactly what I have said. Only the statutory sector will maintain  standards of excellence. Some elderly people do not have a choice: they do not  need nursing care, but they cannot stay at home. We need a level of residential  care.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">However, the current proposal is more about efficiency  savings than about choice and quality of care. I cannot stress that strongly  enough. It is hasty, and a bad move. Of course, we should keep people at home  if at all possible, but there will always be those who need residential care.  Some people are now planning for the future, which is not as secure as it was  10 or 20 years ago, and they are already looking at residential homes. Those  people are still mentally alert and fit, but they know that, a few years down  the road, they will need that sort of care.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Does the Member agree that not only is that the case, but that respite  provision for those who have to care for elderly people living at home is at  least as important an issue and ought to be taken into consideration?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Hanna</strong>:  The Member has just stolen my next point and made it well.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">This decision has to be about choice and quality. Removing  the level of statutory residential care will be financially counterproductive.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  I am glad that the Minister is present. Unfortunately, his response to some of  our questions may be limited because consultation is ongoing.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The proposed closure of a number of statutory residential  care homes in order to save money, as Members have said, has caused much  anxiety among residents and their relatives. Consultation with the public has  been ongoing for some time. As we have heard, there is great opposition to  these, and any, closures. Let us not forget that we are dealing with elderly  human beings who deserve to be treated with respect, to have their needs met  and to be as comfortable and content as is humanly possible.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Many of the residents of nursing homes have lived there for  some time. They consider their present provision to be a long-term requirement  and do not wish to move to some unknown location.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">They have made friends in their existing home, and have  experienced a first-class service from the staff in that home. The last thing  that they need is uncertainty, a change of environment, or a change in the  people who look after their needs.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I attended a public meeting with officials from the South  Eastern Health and Social Care Trust and relatives of residents of the  now-threatened Loch Cuan House residential home in Newtownards. At that  meeting, total opposition to the home&rsquo;s closure was expressed by the relatives  and the public representatives. We hope that the trust&rsquo;s officials got the  message of that evening loud and clear, and will acknowledge the wishes of the  residents and their relatives. It would appear that, because of a gradual  running down of Loch Cuan House over a period of time &mdash; and I presume that that  is happening all over &mdash; there are now, I understand, some seven residents, and  no more admissions of new residents seem to be planned for Loch Cuan House.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  The Member is describing closure by stealth, because I am sure that those  places could adequately be used by other people who have respite care needs.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  That would appear to be what is happening; and, certainly, it is what has been  happening at Loch Cuan House for some time, which is unfortunate for the people  who require its services. The least that the trust can do is to allow those  seven residents of Loch Cuan House the choice to finish their days in a place  that they call home. Certainly, before any change can be made, the residents&rsquo;  individual needs should be assessed. I am sure that that situation is  replicated across other boards in Northern Ireland. Loch Cuan House  was also used as a respite facility and was greatly valued and appreciated by  all who needed that service.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  The Member has outlined the case for Loch Cuan House, and, very clearly, a risk  assessment should be carried out before anything happens with regard to the  home&rsquo;s future. Does the Member agree that the age group of those residents &mdash;  between the ages of 88 and 98 &mdash; indicates that a risk assessment should be the  first priority before anything is done in relation to the future of the home?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  I agree entirely with what the Member said; he was at the same meeting that I  attended, at which, as he will remember, a commitment was given that there will  be an assessment. We hope that that will be carried out before there is any  change, and that those seven people get their day in Loch Cuan House.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Supported housing was due to replace Loch Cuan House on the  same or a nearby site. That was an option that could have allayed residents&rsquo;  fears. Now, even that has been kicked into touch, and, for one reason or  another, is not going to happen. The Executive have made much comment on how  they regard our senior citizens, to even the point of almost providing a  commissioner for older people; that has not been done, but I understand that it  is in the offing. What way is it to treat our older dependent citizens by  throwing them out of statutory residential homes with a very uncertain future?  Surely, they deserve better.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Of course, everyone supports efficiencies, and if there are  more efficient ways of providing care for our elderly people, which &mdash; and this  is the important aspect &mdash; have the consent of those same elderly people, it  would make sense to provide care in that way. However, the Health Service has a  statutory duty to make that provision; it must not all be left to the private  sector. Care in the community has its advantages, particularly as it allows  elderly people to stay in their own homes for as long as they wish.  Unfortunately, we are all too aware that community-care packages are not always  readily available.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">There must be no closures of any kind of those homes while  there is a demand. With an ever increasing elderly population, I have no doubt  that that demand will continue to exist.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Will the Member draw his remarks to a close.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  The need for respite care for newly discharged hospital patients is another  issue that has to be considered. I support the motion and the proposed  amendment.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>: I  do not have any difficulties with the amendment, but I am not sure that it is  entirely necessary, given the legal measures that have to take place anyway.  Over the past six months, few issues have generated as much public concern as  the proposed closure of residential care homes. As Ken Robinson said, three  homes are earmarked for closure in my constituency of East Antrim: Lisgarel,  Greenisland Residential Home and Clonmore House in Newtownabbey.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I have received hundreds of emails, letters and phone calls  about the proposals, and, although there is public anger at all the proposed  closures, the case of Lisgarel has provoked more anger than the others,  especially given the fact Larne already suffers from a lack of healthcare  provision when compared with elsewhere in Northern Ireland. The level of  public outrage is not only gauged by the volume of correspondence that local  representatives have received but by the fact that some 500 people turned up to  the Clarion Hotel and, similarly, hundreds of people packed out public meetings  that were held by local clergy in Larne.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I have met residents, their families and carers, all of  whom are scared, angered and upset that the trust appears to want to close the  residential homes in East Antrim. Indeed, this  morning, on the steps at the front of this Building, I was handed a petition  that has been signed by thousands of people from my constituency, all of whom  are outraged by the proposals to close care homes. Accompanied by my colleagues  Alex Easton and Jonathan Craig &mdash;</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>:  Will the Member agree that, particularly in the East   Antrim constituency of which he, I and other Members know, the  issue has raised public concern to an extraordinary level? That was witnessed  in the meetings in Larne and in the meeting in the Clarion Hotel in  Carrickfergus that the Member and I both attended. I have visited the three  homes and spoken to staff, relatives and residents. The issue goes right to the  core of care &mdash; not only care in the home but the feeling of care that the whole  community has towards those residents.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>: I  agree wholeheartedly. On previous issues to do with healthcare, all the MLAs  who represent East Antrim have worked  together. I look forward to that happening again and all of us putting pressure  on the Minister to ensure that the closures do not happen. I will deliver the  petitions to the Minister&rsquo;s office later this afternoon.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>: I  will not give way again, because I will have only one extra minute to speak,  and I have a lot to get through.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Healthcare provision is not a new argument for East Antrim. Previously, I led an Adjournment debate in  the House on the matter, and I highlighted the fact that the over 65s  population in Larne is 10% greater than elsewhere and that the town is  underprovided for in comparison with other trust areas. Every week, the  Minister refers to efficiency savings, and he pledged that those would not  affect front line services. Over the past number of weeks, the Assembly has  debated motions about the cuts in the Health Service that are proposed by the  Minister. The Health budget is, in fact, the biggest ever budget for health in  Northern Ireland, and it received over 50% of additional funding in the &mdash;</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>: I  will not give way, because I have already said that I do not want to give away  any more time. I am sure that the Member&rsquo;s colleague will comment on that.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The re-provision of the trust residential homes document  and the closure of the five statutory residential homes, including Lisgarel,  will have a massive impact on the elderly population, particularly in Larne.  Closing residential homes and effectively telling residents to go elsewhere is  hugely traumatic for them and their families and leads to distress, which, as  we know, leads to premature death. Research in GB has shown that, in areas  where care homes have been closed, the life expectancy of the residents  decreases.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I have been contacted by one constituent whose mother is a  resident of Clonmore House, and she is at pains to say that her mother sees  Clonmore not as an institution but as her home. She sees her carers and her  fellow residents as friends, and she is very happy there.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Over recent weeks, I have been slightly encouraged by the  change of tact by the trust, which now says that the original document was  badly worded.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>: I  have already said that I will not give way to the Ulster Unionist Party, so I  will be consistent and not give way.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The trust has made many statements in the local papers  saying that it wants to replace Lisgarel rather than closing it. That is  welcome, but it is of limited value to people who have parents or loved ones in  other homes in the area. Other Members have said that elderly people do not  want to live in residential homes, but living at home without 24-hour  assistance is not always appropriate or available. There comes a time in most  people&rsquo;s lives when independent living is just not suitable.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">People are vulnerable, frail and have been neglected or are  unable to cope with living on their own, and that high level of dependency  requires 24-hour help, not just the 15 or 20 minutes that community care often  leads to. Some weeks ago, the Minister said that he did not recognise the claim  that 15 or 20 minutes a day of care takes place, but I assure him that many  families in my constituency certainly recognise that.</p>
        <p class="TimePeriod">12.45 pm</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Today, many people from Larne have made the trip to  Stormont and are present in the Public Gallery. I want to mention Lisgarel  residential care home specifically, because it is a fantastic facility. It is  situated in a complex that is tucked in off the road in the centre of Larne.  The complex contains a day centre and a number of chalets for sheltered  accommodation. It is close to a local health centre and Inver House. Lisgarel  was underrated by the criteria that are used to judge various care homes  because due regard was not given to its existing sheltered accommodation,  health centre or day centre.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The consultation document also states that Lisgarel is  situated on the outskirts of Larne. In fact, it is situated within one third of  a mile from Larne&rsquo;s town centre. People who live there, and, indeed, those who  live in other residential care homes, not only have 24-hour care but  companionship, mental stimulation, support, and they live in a protected  environment.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Discussion on cutting services at Inver House took place on  the basis that Lisgarel would be retained and enhanced. The Department must  live up to that.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member should draw his remarks to a close.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>:  Finally, although Members understand that, because consultation is ongoing, the  Minister cannot comment on the matter in any detail during the debate, I appeal  to him to listen to the debate and to ensure that he does not take any  decisions that will put the lives of care home residents in East Antrim and  elsewhere in Northern Ireland at risk.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brady</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. In any debate about the elderly  population, the valuable contribution that older people have made, and continue  to make, to society must be recognised. There must also be recognition that  negative attitudes to ageing have prevented the development of policies and  structures to deal with poverty, ill health and the isolation of older people.  The Assembly must pledge to support and pursue actively the political and  legislative changes that are necessary to establish a decent standard of  living, full access to services and the right of senior citizens to participate  fully in the community, regardless of whether they live in residential care  homes or not. It is vital that mechanisms are developed to value and recognise  properly the lifelong contributions of older citizens.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Unfortunately, older people are often seen as a commodity.  The number of private residential care homes has increased dramatically during  the past number of years. Those residential care homes are commercial  enterprises and are in business to make money and profit. In contrast, the  number of residential care homes that are run by trusts has diminished. Recent  proposals to close more of that type of accommodation do not bode well for the  future provision of those homes.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Many of the issues that must be addressed in order to  promote social inclusion relate to the provision of quality services and access  to those services. Just because older people live in residential care does not  mean that they should be forgotten about and not included in society.  Unfortunately, many people who live in residential care homes become  institutionalised quickly. That must be factored into any decision on closure  of residential care homes.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">There should always be an adequate level of nursing care in  residential accommodation. As care recipients, older people need support for  independent living, particularly in their own homes. It is important to  maintain independence. However, that requires a sufficient provision of support  services. My mother, who, fortunately, lives independently at home &mdash; and who  will be 100 years of age on 3 March 2009 &mdash; receives what could be considered  minimum care support from the trust. Much more work is needed in order to put  effective planning and support resources in place to enable health and social  care services to respond to older people&rsquo;s needs.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Elder abuse is another issue that must be addressed. A  recent study shows that 3% of older people in the North suffer elder abuse in  their own homes. Only 4% of older people here live in residential care homes;  yet 23% of calls to elder abuse helplines are from residents of such homes.  That problem certainly must be addressed and awareness of it raised among the  public.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Provision of supported and sheltered accommodation for  older people must not be isolated but situated in the wider community, which  will enable senior citizens to participate fully in the community. It is  incumbent on the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety to take  all those factors into account when he considers the closure of any residential  care home. Full and proper consultation is essential in order to take into  account the feelings of elderly care home residents, their families and the  healthcare professionals who are involved.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, I call on the Southern Health and Social Care  Trust to consider carefully its proposals to close Slieve Roe House in Kilkeel  and Mullinure Hospital  in Armagh. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Easton</strong>: I  apologise for not being present earlier in the debate: I was speaking at an  event in the Long Gallery.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">In expressing opposition to the closure of residential homes,  I will make a number of general points that apply across the range of  residential care homes. I will also focus specifically on Ravara House in my constituency  of North Down. Indeed, this debate is especially relevant to North Down, given  that the size of the elderly population there has increased at a higher rate  than in any other constituency in Northern Ireland; that increase will be about  13&middot;4% by 2011.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister refers to the costs of residential homes, but  does he realise that the proposed closure of homes will carry significant  costs, and not only financial ones? He was kind enough to come to my  constituency and listen to the anxieties of friends and family whose loved ones  reside in the excellent Ravara House. He must not allow himself to fall into  the trap of knowing the price of everything and the value of nothing.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I want to address the issue of our elderly living in safe,  secure environments that enhance their quality of life. We want residential  environments to provide added value for residents. Families who have a loved  one living in a residential unit need reassurance that their loved one is  comfortable and happy and that the physical environment and quality of care  that he or she receives is satisfactory. Those general principles apply to all  residential homes that are under consultation for closure. Those principles are  very well followed at Ravara House, so I tell the Minister &mdash; if something is  not broken, do not fix it.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I learned a great deal from speaking to residents of Ravara  House and, indeed, to their friends and families. I learned that Kilcooley &mdash; an  area identified under the targeting social-need criteria &mdash; has a facility that  has demonstrated caring excellence as a matter of course. Ravara House is a  place where residents feel genuinely safe, secure and comfortable. I saw its  staff and volunteers demonstrate practically the level of care and vocational  commitment needed in order to provide a high quality residential environment  that clearly meets the needs of vulnerable elderly people.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I wish that I could end my contribution there, but, sadly,  I cannot. This debate has been made necessary by the proposed closure of Ravara  House and other homes across Northern    Ireland. Residents of Ravara told me of  their pain at the proposed closure of the facility in which so much of their  lives is invested. That pain was not only expressed in their words &mdash; it was  etched on their faces. Those residents regard Ravara House as simply  irreplaceable.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister must appreciate the benefits that such homes  bring for residents, their families, local employment and, thereby, the local  economy. He must also realise that that value goes beyond the accountant&rsquo;s  bottom line on financial accounts. This debate is being watched keenly from the  Public Gallery by vulnerable elderly people and their families. It creates an  opportunity for consideration of, and deliberation on, the closure plans. I  fear that if the Minister acts in haste &mdash; and homes are closed &mdash; he will repent  at leisure. Sadly, that will be too late for vulnerable elderly people.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Our residential homes are of greater value than any words  of mine can afford them. I ask the Minister to give due regard to the needs of  our valuable and vulnerable people and reverse the closures that have been  proposed by the trusts.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gardiner</strong>:  Caring for the elderly is an important aspect of the Department of Health&rsquo;s  work. The number of elderly people, as a proportion of our society, is  increasing and, therefore, the nature and extent of the healthcare and  residential care afforded to them is a major issue for the Assembly. The number  of people who are of pensionable age is projected to increase by around 9% in the  next five years and by around 40% over the next 15 years. This is clearly an  important strategic issue as people live to a greater age.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">It is important that we remember the human aspects of this  issue rather than being driven simply by statistics. However, we must consider  the significant budgetary constraints that have been placed on the Health  Minister by a DUP Minister of Finance.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gardiner</strong>:  Despite continually pointing out that the Health Service needs more investment,  the DUP insisted on a draft Budget that would have seen a reduction in health  spending.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>:  Does the Member agree that we need a long-term policy for care services for  older people? Moreover, does he agree that we should ask the Finance Minister to  find money for that and find the money that the boards are trying to find in  respect of efficiency savings, so that older people do not have to be evicted  from their homes?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gardiner</strong>:  I thank the honourable Member for her intervention, and I have no problem with  her suggestion.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Thankfully, the Health Minister saw through the  smokescreen, and, with the public&rsquo;s help, the draft Budget was defeated.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Nonetheless, the DUP proposed the efficiency savings  process, supported it at Executive meetings and voted it through the House.  Indeed, Mr Poots, who proposed today&rsquo;s motion, sat at the Executive table and  agreed to the efficiency savings process. Therefore, the DUP&rsquo;s cynical attempt  to blame others smacks of hypocrisy.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gardiner</strong>:  Health spends such vast amounts &mdash;</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>A Member</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gardiner</strong>:  No, I will not give way.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Health spends such vast amounts of money because of need. Northern Ireland&rsquo;s need has, time and again,  been greater than that in other parts of the United Kingdom. The DUP is  exercising power without responsibility, and its behaviour has the hallmark of  extreme cynicism, which is the mark of the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s cosy relations.  The DUP lights the touchpaper and then criticises others for the consequences  of its financial actions.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>:  Does the Member agree that there are major flaws, including financial flaws, in  the trusts&rsquo; consultation process? Initially, they spoke of closing homes  including Lisgarel, Greenisland House and Clonmore House, which would affect my  constituents. However, they spoke latterly of replacement. In addition, a major  plank of the trusts&rsquo; proposals is for supported housing. However, no social  housing association has committed to providing that funding.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gardiner</strong>:  I thank my honourable friend for his intervention, and I agree that there are  major flaws.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I have recently been involved in the plight of the  residents of Skeagh House in Dromore, County Down.  I was accompanied on a visit by my honourable friend George Savage. Although  the home is not physically in my constituency of Upper Bann, many of the  residents that will be affected by its proposed closure &mdash; and I emphasise the  word &ldquo;proposed&rdquo; &mdash; are from Upper Bann.  Therefore, it is a major concern to George Savage and me.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Does the Member agree that Skeagh House is one of the best, most professionally  run and homely of all homes? Does he agree that Members should ask the DUP and  others to support the Health Minister by providing the finance that is required  to keep worthwhile facilities throughout Northern Ireland together, rather  than party political posturing?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gardiner</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I pay tribute to the management and staff of Skeagh House  for the upkeep of that home, which was built only 30 years ago. During my  visit, I met a lady who is blind. If she is moved from that accommodation into  a two-bedroom flat or a bedsit, she will get no exercise, compared with the  standard of care that she receives in Skeagh House. Moreover, the equipment at  Skeagh House is second to none.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member must draw his remarks to a close.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gardiner</strong>:  The Minister has yet to make a decision on this matter and related matters, and  I encourage him to look favourably on elderly people. Government must try,  wherever possible under the regime of DUP financial cuts, to protect the weak  from the strong.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
        <p class="TimePeriod">1.00 pm</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  Like other Members, and elected representatives elsewhere, I have been at a  number of public meetings in my constituency to hear the public anger and  outcry over the trusts&rsquo; plans to close residential homes, and to go further and  cut day-centre provision. We know that that initiative follows on from the  Budget that was passed by the Assembly some time ago.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I noted the phrase used by Alex Easton, a member of the  Health Committee, when he said that the Minister knew the price of everything  and the value of nothing. It seems to me that that label is more fitting for  both the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in; Members from those parties went through the Lobbies  that day and voted in favour of the Budget.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  I am not giving way.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Some of us in the House on that day said that they had got  it wrong, and that it was a market-forces Budget, which prioritised economic  efficiency and paid no attention to the needs of the elderly, the weak and the  vulnerable in society. Today we see the consequences of that.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I support the motion and the amendment, even though,  bearing in mind the Budget, I find it difficult to understand how the motion  was tabled by the DUP and the amendment by Sinn F&eacute;in.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  I am not giving way.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I want to speak about my constituency, as other Members  have highlighted pressing matters in theirs. In the Western Trust area, there  are four residential homes earmarked for closure. It is certainly the case that  the weak and the vulnerable are bearing the brunt of the budgetary decisions.  Some time ago, there were threats to take away the rewards scheme from the  learning disabled in the Western Trust. In the face of public outcry, and the  comments from the Health Minister, the trust had to back down and do a U-turn  on that initiative.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">As I have said, in addition to the proposed closure of the  residential home at Drumhaw, there will be cuts to day-care provision in the  most rural and isolated parts of the west &mdash; in Belcoo, Garrison and  Newtownbutler. There is a very strong campaign running in opposition to the  proposal to close the residential home at Drumhaw. It has already gathered  4,200 signatures in Lisnaskea, in east Fermanagh &mdash; I do not know how many  signatures are on the petition brought here by the DUP. The campaign to oppose  that closure also has the support of all the elected representatives there, and  it appears that, by the time of the next meeting of Fermanagh District Council  at the beginning of March, it will also have the full support of the council.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The residents and their families have expressed a high  level of satisfaction with Drumhaw residential home; they speak about the  friendly staff and the caring and supportive environment, which are regarded as  very important assets. Most of the home&rsquo;s residents expected to remain there  for the rest of their lives. Their fears have been heightened, because it is  evident, not just to them, but to everybody in the local community, that no  alternative provision is being made available. The alternatives suggested by  the trust &mdash; and, I note, other trusts that have appeared before the Committee &mdash;  involve supported living and sheltered accommodation. However, those  initiatives exist only in theory. They have not been put in place on the  ground.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">As I said, it is the elderly and the frail who are being  hit by the cuts. A couple of weeks ago, the Minister appeared before the Health  Committee and said, if I remember correctly, that he will not approve closures  unless there is equal or better accommodation in place. I hope that I have  recollected what he said correctly. If so, I welcome that, and I hope that the  trusts will re-examine their plans.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I call the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety (Mr McGimpsey)</strong>: I am grateful for  the opportunity to respond to this debate. I fully appreciate that many people  are anxious about proposals for residential homes. As Members are aware, those  proposals &mdash; I emphasise the word &ldquo;proposals&rdquo; &mdash; have been put forward by trusts  after the decision that all Departments must achieve 3% efficiencies. For the  Department of Health, that equates to some &pound;344 million by 2011 and some &pound;700  million over the three-year comprehensive spending review (CSR) period.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">That decision was made by all the parties at the Executive  table, including the DUP. That enormous sum, which is the largest that has been  asked of any Department, must be found in a budget that is already stretched to  its limit. Since becoming Minister, I have repeatedly stated how difficult that  task will be, and I do not for one minute apologise for insisting that more  money must be invested in our Health Service.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The additional money that I secured for health and social  care services was won only after a hard-fought battle, and I have no doubt that  that money will save lives. It has helped to introduce a range of vital,  life-saving service developments, such as bowel-cancer screening, which will  save up to 70 lives a year; the human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccination against  cervical cancer, which kills about 40 women a year here; access for up to 5,000  patients to remote monitoring; an additional 2,000 units of respite and community-based  care; and the extension of breast-cancer screening for women from the age of 65  to the age of 70. Those are a few of the measures that we have been able to  bring forward.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">If I had accepted the original Budget allocation &mdash; which  the DUP insisted that I should have done &mdash; the situation for hundreds of  patients would have been much worse. Members are aware that because many of the  trusts&rsquo; consultations on proposals to produce those efficiency savings are  ongoing, it is not appropriate for me to discuss the matter in any detail, nor  can I discuss individual proposals. When the consultation processes have  finished, I will look in detail at all the proposals, and I will give careful  consideration to the views that have been expressed.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">It is, therefore, disappointing that some Members have  attempted to use this debate as a political point-scoring exercise. Let us be  clear: a DUP Finance Minister proposed the efficiency savings process, and the  DUP supported it in the Executive &mdash; including one of the Members who proposed  the motion, and who was a Minister at that time. Furthermore, every Member of  the DUP Assembly team trooped through the Lobby in support of the process.  Indeed, some Members criticised me for not commencing the efficiency exercise  earlier. Therefore, any attempt to distance the DUP from this process smacks of  hypocrisy.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">We all know that our older population is increasing  rapidly. Over the next 50 years, the number of people over 65 years of age will  double from 250,000 to 500,000. Our health and social care services must be equipped  and ready to deal with the enormous demands of caring for that vulnerable group  of people. We already spend approximately &pound;630 million in supporting our  elderly people; only acute care gets higher funding. I am committed to  improving services for our older people, which is why I will invest a further  &pound;60 million over the next three years to support an additional 1,500 older  people in the community. However, if we are to continue to meet the needs of  our growing elderly population, we need to ensure that we are using those  resources as efficiently and as effectively as possible.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Through a range of schemes, our Health Service provides a  diverse range of options to support elderly care. One such option is supported  living, and in October 2007, I was delighted to open Barn Halt Cottages in  Carrickfergus &mdash; a scheme that provides accom&shy;modation, care and support to  frail and older people, and can house up to 36 residents in 26 cottages. The  scheme is designed to enable people with complex care and support needs to  maintain their independence and keep links with the community. That is the type  of development that I wish to see rolled out across the Province as an example  of how we can maximise independence while providing reassurance that help is at  hand.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Domiciliary care and supported living have featured heavily  in trust consultations as potential alternatives to statutory residential care.  I recognise, however, that residents in our care homes are unsure and anxious  about where their needs would continue to be met.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I wish to provide absolute clarity on this matter: if a  decision is taken to proceed with a home closure, there is no question of  existing residents being evicted. Any suggestion that residents will be put on  to the streets, without a roof over their heads, is bogus and is scaremongering  at its worst. It is important to remember that many of our statutory facilities  are old and not fit for purpose. It is estimated that it will take approximately  &pound;8 million to bring those facilities alone up to an acceptable standard.  Members are well aware of the limited capital budget that is available to me.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I listened carefully to the concerns and issues that  Members raised over the trusts&rsquo; current proposals. Some Members suggested  alternatives to those proposals, including cutting down on postage and travel  expenses. Other Members have been keen to remind me that I have the largest  share of the Budget and that I should live within my means.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Indeed, another favourite topic for Members has been the  Appleby Report, and I will deal with some of the myths that they presented. I  accept fully that Professor Appleby made some challenging recommendations for  my Department. We have tackled that challenge head on by working in  collaboration with the Department of Finance and Personnel to agree actions to  meet the recommendations. Some Members conveniently quoted selective abstracts  from the report in an attempt to portray a failing Health Service, and that is  most unhelpful.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">However, some Members conveniently overlooked the  recommendation that centred on need. Professor Appleby concluded that health  services in Northern Ireland  receive 7% more funding than the UK  average, but that those services receive considerably less than Scotland.  However, independently verified research has showed that &mdash; allowing for current  spending &mdash; Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  need for health services is 10% greater than that of England. That research also showed  that Northern Ireland&rsquo;s need  for social services is more than one third greater than that of England.  Combining the two, that means that Northern   Ireland is between 14% and 17% &mdash; &pound;250 million and &pound;300  million &mdash; worse off than England.  On top of that, there is a further &pound;300 million gap between us and England,  because of the difference in extra spending up to 2011. Northern Ireland has &pound;600 million &mdash; 15% of my  overall budget &mdash; less than England  to deliver a health and social care service.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Huge changes have taken place since the Appleby Report was  published in 2005. In the report, Professor Appleby highlighted the fact that  we could do better with the money that we have, and he recommended that we  focus more on improving performance. I have focused relentlessly on improving  performance since I took up office. For example, in April 2006, nearly 74,000  patients were waiting more than six months for a first outpatient appointment.  In the same period, almost 6,500 patients were waiting more than six months for  surgery. One year later, those lists had disappeared, and there were dramatic  reductions in waiting times for surgery and outpatient appointments.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Professor Appleby said that an extra &pound;55 million of  efficiencies can be derived from the drugs budget. In fact, my Department  delivered those efficiencies and a further &pound;20 million of savings over and  above those in the latest CSR period, despite some Members criticising such  efficiencies. Those are tremendous achievements, and I pay tribute to staff,  from all disciplines, across Northern    Ireland.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Professor Appleby pointed to many good examples of new and  innovative practices in the area of community care. His view was that we are  going the right way, but that we should be doing more to change the way in  which community care is delivered. He also pointed out that Northern Ireland used 10% more nursing and  residential home care than England.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Professor Appleby also recommended significant budget  rises, which, curiously, was a point that did not feature in the contributions  of Members who raised the issue of the report today. Professor Appleby  concluded that an increase of at least 4&middot;3% above the rate of inflation each  year up to 2013 was needed in order to maintain and improve services. Some  Members ignored that key recommendation when they insisted that I accept the  draft Budget. Furthermore, as I said, there is a &pound;300 million gap between Northern Ireland and England, because of the  differential between CSR settlements. Compared with the 4&middot;3% that Professor  Appleby recommended, England  received an increase of 3&middot;7% above the rate of inflation, and we received an  increase of only1&middot;2% above the rate of inflation.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">It is right that people are concerned about the damaging impact  that efficiency savings might have on the Health Service. Once again, it is  heartening to hear so many Members express their grave concerns about proposals  to change services. However, it is sad that some Members did not recognise that  independent assessment of need.</p>
        <p class="TimePeriod">1.15 pm</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  Does the Minister agree that it is highly irresponsible and very bad politics  for Members of this House to raise people&rsquo;s concerns and emotions &mdash; and to  heighten their fears &mdash; about this issue without supporting the provision of  proper resources for the Health Minister?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Several Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I agree entirely with Mr  Kennedy. I do not receive enough money to do the job, and then the job is  criticised because we are short of money. Who controls the purse strings?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Easton</strong>:  Will the Minister give way?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: No; the Member had his chance.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Some Members of the Assembly would do better to realise  that the issue of health and social care services being under-resourced has  been independently assessed, with no political agenda. It is saddening that  some people still insist on playing politics with health.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I have heard many complaints that I am not doing enough to  tackle administration costs. Again, that is total nonsense. The facts speak for  themselves: my Department has already begun to reduce Health Service  administration costs, with a three-year target of &pound;53 million from a total  administrative budget of &pound;250 million &mdash; a 25% reduction in back-office staff  and a 15% reduction in other managers. The number of senior executives will be  reduced from 170 to 58, which is a reduction of two thirds. I am content that  that is a sustainable reduction for health and social care. I look forward to  other Departments matching that reduction when they eventually move forward with  the review of public administration (RPA) as the Health Department has already  done.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">As for achieving efficiencies from travel expenses, postage  and phone bills, trusts are already making and planning savings in those areas.  Indeed, there are plans to make around &pound;140 million &mdash; 40% of the total  efficiencies &mdash; through working practices, locums, energy efficiency and phones.  Each year, for example, we spend around &pound;70 million on locums and agency and  bank staff, which is 4% of our total pay cost. I accept that that is a  considerable sum of money. For that reason, I welcome trust plans to reduce  that figure by 15%. Having said that, we have an obligation to maintain patient  safety and to keep our wards properly staffed &mdash; even if that means using more  expensive locum or agency staff in the short term.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Postage and telephone expenditure concerns some Members  greatly. How else are staff supposed to contact patients and clients to advise  them of appointments and to confirm test results? We must also ensure that  staff are reimbursed for reasonable travel costs that are incurred in the  course of doing their jobs. Do some Members really suggest that we reduce our  contact with patients, or that social workers and community nurses should not  be reimbursed for travelling to bring care to the population? Nonetheless,  current trust proposals are targeting some &pound;3 million of savings per annum from  reduced transport and travel costs.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">With regard to the amendment, all proposals must, of  course, be subject to appropriate equality impact analysis. Four of the five  trusts are still engaged in consultation, and none of the five has arrived at a  final view. I am monitoring the consultation closely, and all final decisions  about major proposals are mine to take.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I conclude by giving a simple commitment to the public,  residents, their families and staff: trust proposals are not a done deal. No  decisions have been made. As Minister, I will listen carefully to their views.  No one will be thrown out on the street. If there is to be any change, it will  be managed carefully and sensitively. Viable alternatives must be in place to  provide an equivalent or better standard of care. Our health and social care  services are undergoing immense change that needs to happen if we are to  deliver a world-class Health Service for everyone. However, I have given my  commitment that there will only be change if it is for the better.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I am in the business of looking after the most vulnerable  members of society, including our elderly population. They have the same rights  to health and social care services as everyone else. I will continue to improve  and invest in those services to ensure that those people have access to the  very best that our Health Service can provide.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Several Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs McGill</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I believe that the House is united  today. I know that there are some differences of opinion about the CSR and who  did and did not vote for what, but I welcome the contributions made in the debate  on the motion, which Sinn F&eacute;in, as a party, obviously supports. I welcome, too,  the references made to the amendment and the issue of equality.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister supported Mr Ross&rsquo;s view that the amendment  was, perhaps, not necessary. However, as far as the Western Health and Social  Care Trust is concerned, it is necessary to mention equality proofing. I have  here the consultation document from the Western Health and Social Care Trust. I  studied the document and what was said about the EQIA. I have some concerns  about the responses to that, but there will probably be an opportunity in the  future to raise those with the trust.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">With regard to the CSR and efficiency savings: DHSSPS  commissioned an audit, probably around 2005 or 2006, the final report of which  was published in 2007. I have a revealing quote from that document to  demonstrate that the change to residential care happened before the period of  the CSR:</p>
        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Our review has identified high levels of satisfaction  with the quality of care provision and the staff delivering that care in the  statutory residential care sector. However, the costs associated are far in  excess of the benchmarks indicating that the statutory sector is costing more  than the independent alternative in Northern   Ireland and UK residential costs.&rdquo;</p>
        <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">I quote that excerpt because several Members  pointed out that the proposed closures relate entirely to efficiency savings. I  am not against efficiency savings, but I again want to make the point that the  changes to residential care began some time before the period of the CSR.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">In case anyone thinks that I am not going to mention  Strabane, I am. I see the number of petitions in front of Mr Ross, and I heard  other Members talk about the meetings that they have attended. The same is  happening in West Tyrone. A meeting is due to take place on Wednesday to  discuss the Greenfield  residential care home, and Gortmore House is also scheduled for closure. The  issue has, as Mr Robinson, I believe, said, galvanised the community, and it  has done so in my constituency. The business community, the print media, the  local press, the &lsquo;Strabane Weekly News&rsquo; and particularly the &lsquo;Strabane  Chronicle&rsquo; &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs McGill</strong>:  All those papers have carried articles on the subject, particularly the  &lsquo;Strabane Chronicle&rsquo; and the Strabane &lsquo;Herald&rsquo;.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  The &lsquo;Ulster Herald&rsquo; has commissioned an online petition at  www.ulsterherald.com/petition to highlight the importance of Gortmore House  residential care home in Omagh, which, if the trust&rsquo;s proposal goes ahead, is  due to close in September. The home employs 30 people and has 25 full-time  residents. Their relatives say that those residents are likely to be dispersed to  other privately run homes, but families fear that many will not survive the  transition. Therefore, I would greatly appreciate the support of Members for  the petition.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs McGill</strong>:  A degree of rivalry is evident here: it was, in fact, Conor Sharkey a journalist  on the &lsquo;Strabane Chronicle&rsquo; who initiated the campaign.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">By closing four of, I believe, eight homes in the Western  Health and Social Care Trust area, &pound;1&middot;5 million will be saved &mdash; that is not a  lot of money.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  Does the Member recognise that this is not a real saving to the Health Service?  It is a saving to the trust, but that money is merely transferred over to the  social services side. There is no net saving for the public, because elderly  residents will have to be put into the private-care sector in any event. There  is no real saving to be made.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs McGill</strong>:  I thank the Member for his intervention. Of course, when all this is worked  out, we will see what the savings will be.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I come now to the matter of alternatives. There are no  satisfactory alternatives in place at this stage. That was raised at a meeting  of the Western Health and Social Services Council by Ms Reilly. Nobody is  against alternatives &mdash;</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member has 10 seconds, and there is no alternative.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs McGill</strong>:  Only 10 seconds, Mr Deputy Speaker?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. The Member&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>:  This is an issue of great importance, and I suspect that it is not just the  Member who spoke previously who could speak about it all day. A range of  Members, from different parties, who, because of the significance of the  debate, wanted to speak but have been unable to do so.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The debate today has been quite reasonable and reasoned. It  is natural that when we speak about the most vulnerable in our society, there  will always be an element of high emotion. Members have conveyed that well and  kept that emotion in a reasonable amount of check.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">We have seen the impact of these potential changes across  the country from Fermanagh to Larne, from Ballynahinch to Omagh, from Bangor to Dromore, and,  lest we forget, Strabane as well. The issue affects all of Northern Ireland.  It is important to place on record the range of these residential homes and to  express the gratitude of Members, and particularly of the families who have  relatives in those homes, for the hard work and selfless dedication among the  staff, many of whom provide a level of service well beyond their duty and what  they are paid to do.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Although we expressed the view that we feel the motion to  be adequate, we do not have a major problem with the amendment and have no  desire to divide the House. We, therefore, will support the amendment as well.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I will start by dealing with some of the more contentious  points that arose during the debate. With regard to efficiency savings, the  Minister said that he did not want to see point-scoring. He and some of his  colleagues then seemed to indulge in a degree of point-scoring on that subject.  Efficiency savings apply across all Government Departments across all of the UK. They have  been agreed by all parties, as has been indicated. From that point of view, we  have no intention of &mdash;</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: The  Member&rsquo;s Minister agreed that in the Executive as well as everyone else. I am happy  to agree with the Health Minister that efficiency savings are something to  which all parties signed up. It is an issue that affects people across all of  the UK,  and all Government Departments.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: I  will give way briefly.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Will the Member join with us in making sure that the Minister of Health, Social  Services and Public Safety has all the finance that he needs to protect these  very vulnerable services?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>:  Certainly, I believe that the Minister should have that finance. He said:</p>
        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The final budget allocation is a good news story for  the health service&hellip;in light of the financial circumstances facing the  Executive, I believe it is the best outcome possible.&rdquo;</p>
        <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">There is a great difficulty in improving on &ldquo;the  best outcome possible&rdquo;. The point is that we want to see efficiencies. The DUP  stands four-square behind efficiencies, as every party in the House should. The  problem with that is that it is inflicting front line service cuts rather than  efficiency savings. That is fundamentally wrong.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Department of Health is allocated more than half the  Budget, and I do not want to castigate the Minister. The cuts that have been  suggested &mdash; and I note the Minister&rsquo;s comment that these are proposals &mdash; come from  the various trusts. I believe that the trusts have got this badly wrong. I will  return to that point, but, at this stage, they are just proposals.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: I  will give way in a moment.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I appreciate the position that the Minister is in today; he  cannot give individual commitments to the various residential homes, and I  accept that.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Consequently, I will not criticise the Minister on that  front today. However, if he goes down the line of agreeing to a range of cuts,  people will wish to revisit the matter, and there will be high levels of anger  in the community. Therefore, until I hear what he has to say after the  consultation period, I will suspend my judgment.</p>
        <p class="TimePeriod">1.30 pm</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I take note of the Member&rsquo;s concerns. When KPMG investigated the costs of  keeping Loch Cuan House open, it said that there would have to be a change to  independent accommodation and to what it referred to as a &ldquo;supported housing  scheme&rdquo;. Subsequently, the trust informed the home, residents, elected  representatives and staff, and expectations were raised. Does the Member agree  that to change things now would be paying lip service to that consultation?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: I  agree with the Member. If expectations have been raised and promises made, it  is important to deliver on them.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister said that approximately &pound;8 million of capital  costs would be required. However, in response to questions for written answer  from me and from other Members, he said that, in the past few years, the South  Eastern Health and Social Care Trust has spent approximately &pound;50 million on  capital works. That was just one trust. Indeed, the trust is due to receive  further resources of approximately &pound;53 million.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">My colleague Alex Easton referred to Ravara House  residential care home, which is in my constituency. Approximately &pound;250,000 a  year, and in the region of &pound;500,000 for capital works, is required to keep that  home going. Given that the South Eastern Health and Social Care Trust, which is  proposing those closures, has a capital budget that is more than &pound;50 million a  year and is due to receive &pound;53 million in additional resources, it ought to be able  to find &pound;250,000 a year and &pound;500,000 for capital works in order to keep Ravara  House going. Throughout Northern    Ireland, trusts have fallen down on their  duties.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Several Members highlighted the fact that the elderly  population is growing. Indeed, Michelle O&rsquo;Neill and Carmel Hanna said that,  although there have been moves to support independent living, such provision is  not yet in place, and the complexity and flexibility of needs must be  considered. However, although there may be greater moves towards independent  living and nursing homes, the growing elderly population means that there will  always be a gap in provision. Moreover, supporting more people in their homes  for as long as possible will place a greater burden on respite care, so, in the  future, increased respite care provision will be required in Northern Ireland.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Many trusts claim that the number of people in residential  homes is declining. I believe that that is an artificial claim. For several  years, the intake in many homes, including Ravara House, has, in effect, been  zero, so we must question the extent to which some of those homes have been  managed in order to prevent people from coming in. Nevertheless, if the number  of people in residential homes continues to decline, there will surely be a  greater burden on respite care, and that is the area in which the slack must be  taken up.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Although we can all quote statistics &mdash; and several Members  have &mdash; there are human stories behind those statistics. I welcome the  Minister&rsquo;s confirmation that no one will be thrown onto the streets &mdash; no one  would expect that to be the case. However, concerns go beyond that eventuality;  people have a right to live in dignity in the homes in which they are already  resident.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">If we were beginning afresh, there would be an argument for  reconsidering where to build new residential homes. However, we are where we  are, and people have been in homes for many years. Therefore, in addition to not  being thrown onto the streets, people want to live for as long as they can in  those homes, and that should not be too difficult to achieve. If the trusts  reconsider, a way forward can be found for residential homes.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The finances are available to provide that. We must ensure  that efficiency savings do not become front line cuts, and we must stand beside  our elderly. I hope that the Minister will take on board what has been said  today. If the unfortunate situation arises in which the trusts rubber-stamp  their own proposals &mdash; and many Members question how genuine the trusts&rsquo;  consultation processes were &mdash; it is hoped that the Minister will stand up to  them and ensure that people have the dignity and the opportunity to remain in  their residential homes.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I support the motion, as amended.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question, <span style="font-style:normal; ">That the  amendment be made</span>, put and agreed to.</p>

        <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly expresses its opposition to the proposed  closure of residential care homes by a number of Health and Social Care Trusts;  and calls on the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety to  intervene and listen to the concerns of the community and take appropriate  action to minimise the pain, stress and anxiety that this uncertainty has  created among elderly care home residents, their families and health workers;  and further calls on the Minister to ensure that any proposals coming from  Trusts are equality proofed so that services are available for those most in  need.</p>

        <p class="Q3Motion">That the Assembly calls on the Prison Service to implement in  full the recommendations made by the Prisoner Ombudsman in the report into the  death of Colin Bell in Maghaberry Prison on 1 August 2008.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. &Eacute;ir&iacute;m leis an  r&uacute;n seo a mholadh, agus t&aacute;imid ag lorg taca&iacute;ochta d&oacute; trasna an Tion&oacute;il. Fuair  Colin Bell b&aacute;s ar 1 L&uacute;nasa na bliana seo chuaigh thart, agus d&rsquo;fhoilsigh an  Prisoner Ombudsman a thuairisc ar 9 m&iacute; Ean&aacute;ir na bliana seo. Seo na ruda&iacute;  at&aacute;imid a phl&eacute; sa Tion&oacute;l inniu.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">This is an important motion, and one that should be  supported by all Members. The death of Colin Bell in Maghaberry Prison on 1  August 2008 has been investigated by the Prisoner Ombudsman. Its report,  findings and recommendations were published on 9 January 2009.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Although Colin Bell took his own life, one will see from  reading the report that the death could have been avoided and that a series of  failures in the system allowed him to die as he did. The circumstances of his  death serve to highlight the failings of a system which, if adhered to  properly, should have prevented any person in custody from taking their own  life in the way that Colin Bell took his.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I commend the office of the Prisoner Ombudsman for the  report and the thorough and appropriately sensitive manner in which the death  was investigated. The Prisoner Ombudsman ensured that the most comprehensive  report possible was brought into the public domain. If implemented, the  report&rsquo;s recommendations &mdash; of which there are 44 &mdash; will ensure that a death  similar to Colin Bell&rsquo;s can, and should be, avoided in the future.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The report and its recommendations point to the failings,  which ran throughout the prison system. The report mentions the mindset that  produced Colin Bell&rsquo;s behaviour and his cry for help. It seems that something  of a power struggle developed, and the prison administration took the view that  Colin Bell had to be taught to accept that he cannot be the &ldquo;winner&rdquo;.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">There was a failure in the system which ignored its own  guidelines, and that permitted Colin Bell to be naked, without bedding, in his  cell for a number of days. The system also failed to recognise &mdash; or chose to  ignore &mdash; the needs of a man who had a history of self-harming and that he  wrapped his feet in toilet paper in order to protect himself from the cold.  Furthermore, the system failed to supervise those charged with monitoring Colin  Bell in his cell. When I say that the system failed, I mean that it failed.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Rather than watch Colin Bell on closed-circuit television  (CCTV), prison staff chose to watch television, play computer games or make use  of a makeshift camp bed and go to sleep. The system failed because the warder  charged with watching the watchers followed the set example and practice and  did not do his job.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">This was not a one-off, single event; such behaviour was  endemic. To fully understand why the recom&shy;mendations in the report need to be  implemented, one need only recall the response to the report of a senior member  of the Prison Officers&rsquo; Association (POA). He told the BBC that, rather than facing  disciplinary investigation, the two governors should be complimented for  keeping Colin Bell alive for as long as they did. Thankfully, the response of  the Prisons Minister, Paul Goggins, and the director of the Prison Service,  Robin Masefield, is in stark contrast to that view.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Paul Goggins accepts that Colin&rsquo;s death &ldquo;should not have  happened&rdquo; and should have been avoided, and Robin Masefield also accepts that:</p>
        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;the standard of care &hellip; was below the standard that we  set ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Goggins said that the death of Colin Bell &ldquo;will be a  watershed&rdquo;. If we are to have a watershed &mdash; and the Assembly will have a role  in ensuring that that happens &mdash; we must reverse the mindset expressed by the  senior member of the POA. We also have to reverse the thinking that sees the  prison regime setting out with the purpose of showing a vulnerable prisoner  that there is only one winner.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The report by the Prisoner Ombudsman must be the first step  in that process. It is regrettable that there is no Minister here today to comment  on it; however, today&rsquo;s motion should act as a signal that the Assembly will  ensure that, in the weeks and months ahead, the 44 recommendations in that  report will be implemented, and that similar situations can be avoided in the  future. Mar sin de molaim an r&uacute;n seo.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Paisley Jnr</strong>:  The circumstances surrounding the death of Colin Bell while in prison, in the  custody of our state, are disgraceful. It should be said that the circumstances  that led to his being in jail were also quite disgraceful. I welcome the fact  that there is a Prisoner Ombudsman and that we have this report. We must all  feel content that those who are detained in custody are properly and safely  detained, protected from each other and also &mdash; particularly in this case &mdash; from  themselves.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">There have been numerous cases of prisoners and prison  staff being murdered. One MLA has previously indicated the role that his  organisation played in the murder of a prison officer. There are numerous  examples of prisoners being murdered by other prisoners while in custody &mdash; the  most noteworthy is the murder of Billy Wright. There are also many examples of  prisoners, for a variety of reasons, harming themselves and posing a  significant and very real danger not only to themselves but to other prisoners and,  at times, prison staff.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">As has been said, Colin Bell was a self-harmer &mdash;  notoriously so, according to the ombudsman&rsquo;s report. He ultimately and  tragically took his own life in circumstances that could have been prevented. I  agree with many of the recommendations in the report of the Prisoner Ombudsman  &mdash; many of them are practical and many of them have been, or are beginning to  be, implemented. That kick-start to reform is a welcome and very good result  from what were very tragic circumstances.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I want to draw attention to two of the recommend&shy;ations  which highlight the very difficult circumstances of this case. Recommendation  11 is that the use of makeshift beds to relax or sleep during night shifts must  be strictly forbidden. That tells its own story &mdash; prison officers are there to  do night duty, not to sleep. Recommendation 13 states that televisions that  have been brought into protective units should be removed. Once again, prison  officers are there to do duty, not to watch television. Those recommendations  highlight some of the significant failings that led to this particular case.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">My concern is that the overall support for the ombudsman&rsquo;s  report suggests that the ombudsman got it right &mdash; she did not, and we should  face up to that. The report does not go far enough, as it fails to put blame  where it ought to be and instead scapegoats prison night staff, governors, and  people who, quite simply, implemented policy that was put in place by the  Northern Ireland Office.</p>
        <p class="TimePeriod">1.45 pm</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Six years ago, Northern Ireland Office policy-makers took a  decision to save money, and the consequence of that decision was to put in  place non-trained prison officers to do night duty, which is a difficult job.  It involves looking after vulnerable people and people who, at times, can self-harm.  Those policy-makers decided to install people who were not properly trained to  do that job. Through no fault of those individuals, penny-pinching savings were  made, which had consequences. One of the consequences was that people who were  not trained to do a particular job were held responsible and accountable for  something that started at the Northern Ireland Office.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The report should have gone further and pointed out that it  was a policy decision taken by a Minister, implemented by officials, and pushed  on to governors and prison staff. The prison officers and prison staff whom I  know do not want to go into jails and harm people &mdash; they want to do their job.  The report falls short, in that it draws a line and says that it was that group  of staff that was solely, absolutely and completely responsible for the death,  when the Northern Ireland Office should be taking its share of the blame.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I ask the Member to draw his remarks to a close.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Paisley Jnr</strong>:  The report should lay the blame where it really rests, which, in this case, is  with the political masters.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Cree</strong>: I  commend the Prisoner Ombudsman, Pauline McCabe, and her office for the  timeliness and diligence with which they have exposed the reality of Colin  Bell&rsquo;s life and death. They have pursued transparency, and we must pay heed to  the recommend&shy;ations that are outlined in the report. It is shocking to see  that many of the recommendations appear, to a lay person, to be basic good  practice. I am disappointed that those common-sense proposals are not in place  already, or have not been adhered to strictly. This time, we must ensure that  those best-practice recommendations are implemented in full.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I recognise that it is a difficult job for prison staff to  prevent a prisoner who is intent on taking his life. I commend the actions and  the hard work of many of the prison officers and prison staff who are dedicated  to helping all those in their care, amid a thorny, and often charged,  environment.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">However, in that case, in the 30 hours before Colin Bell&rsquo;s  death, there certainly appears to have been no due care demonstrated among the  night staff for the highly troubled, vulnerable and strictly distressed  prisoner. Many opportunities arose for the night staff to intervene, if they  had simply been doing their job. We must ask ourselves what is the right thing  to do, and then do it.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Pauline McCabe has told us what needs to be done to improve  the situation for vulnerable prisoners in Northern Ireland. We must ensure  that the Northern Ireland Prison Service does what it should. My party is  committed to law and order, and I want us to be tough on people who go into  prison. I want recidivism to be reduced, and I want prisoners to be challenged,  to be educated and to be forced to take responsibility for their crimes. I do  not want a system that breaks further the lives of those who need to be  robustly rehabilitated.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">My party is about responsibility: we must make the offender  responsible for his or her actions and address the root causes of the crime.  However, I also advocate responsibility, not merely for the offender but for  those in charge. We need to take this man&rsquo;s death, and the systematic failures  that led to his death, seriously. To do less would be wrong.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">On 9 January, the Prisoner Ombudsman published 44  recommendations. The implementation of those recommendations will be reviewed  in six months&rsquo; time. I hope that we will not merely see a series of further  reviews by the Northern Ireland Prison Service but a comprehensive and resolute  implementation of the recommendations. I recognise that the Prison Service has  a difficult role to play in managing our offenders. However, we must do more  and demand much more. We have placed the Prisoner Ombudsman in a key position,  and, therefore, we must take heed of her recommendations and put them into  practice. I support the motion.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  I welcome the motion and Mr McCartney&rsquo;s speech. I do so for a number of  reasons, not only because of the importance of the Prisoner Ombudsman&rsquo;s report  but because the motion brings the Assembly&rsquo;s attention back to general issues  involving prisons and prisoners.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Whether devolution of policing and justice happens sooner  or later, it will happen, and when it does so, it will fall to a Minister and  to the Chamber to deal not only with the report&rsquo;s recommend&shy;ations but the  policy and financial implications of the creation of the Parole Commissioners  and of a new prison in the North, as well as the implications of various  reports from the Criminal Justice Inspection. Consequently, the debate is  timely, because it makes us more fully aware of the policy and financial  responsibilities on a wide range of prisoner matters that will fall to the  Chamber and to a Minister in the event of devolution and justice.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">When the report was published, the SDLP simply said that  the recommendations should be accepted in full and should be responded to  quickly. Given that there is a high level of political agreement, subject to  one or two comments from the Member for North Antrim Ian Paisley Jnr, that  should be the standard against which we judge how Minister Paul Goggins  responds to the report, to which, I believe, he is well intentioned.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">As other Members have already said, the narrative of the  report is disturbing, the findings are damning, and, worst of all, the  conclusion must be drawn that Colin Bell&rsquo;s death was avoidable. In  acknowledging the report, we must also acknowledge the work of the Prisoner  Ombudsman. She has brought the same rigour, exhaustive inquiry and evidence  base to that investigation and report as she has brought to her other  contributions to public service in the North.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">We must also acknowledge that the Prisoner Ombudsman has  flagged up issues concerning her ability to investigate the deaths of prisoners  in custody. Up until 2005, the Prisoner Ombudsman would not have investigated  such a death: it was only in 2005 that her remit was expanded to include deaths  in custody. There have been 17 such deaths up to January 2009, 10 of which are  still under investigation. The Prisoner Ombudsman has said that, if she is to  be able to do her job &mdash; which involves investigating deaths, including  avoidable deaths &mdash; she needs to have the necessary budget line. As was the case  with this report, there are clear cost implications to providing the legal  framework and the clinical input required to enable her to determine whether a  death was avoidable or to investigate the general circumstances of the death.  We must take that advice on board.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The report highlights cultural issues not only in the Prison  Service but in the Prison Officers&rsquo; Association. We must deal with all those  who manage prisoners &mdash; those who work on the front line and with prisoners in  cells, those who work in offices and who serve as governors, and, as Ian  Paisley Jnr mentioned, those who set policy directives. My concern is that,  unless we deal with all the issues of culture and conduct that are manifest in  some of those places, we will be unable to implement fully the report&rsquo;s  recommendations.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">That said, I am reassured, not only because Paul Goggins is  the Minister involved but because the current director of the Prison Service  has demonstrated that he is up for change and reform. He has demonstrated that  not only in his work in the Prison Service but in other areas of his  public-service career to date. If we can draw conclusions from him and from  other people, not least from the Prisoner Ombudsman, it may be that there will  be no repeat of this case in the future.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I ask the Member to draw his remarks to a close.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: At  the outset, I thank the proposers of the motion, and, like others, I pay  tribute to the Prisoner Ombudsman, Pauline McCabe, for her commitment to, and  quality of, the report. Like Mr Attwood, I wish to highlight the importance of  proper funding and of ensuring that her office is placed on a proper statutory  footing, so that a proper watchdog is in place to oversee what is happening in  prisons.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Colin Bell belonged in prison. I am familiar with the crime  that he committed in Bangor  in 2003. It was an arson attack, which led to a murder. However, the duty of  protection, which Mr Cree outlined, works both ways. There is a duty on the  Prison Service to protect society as a whole from people who have committed  crimes and who are at risk of committing further crimes. Equally, there is a  duty of care on the Prison Service to protect prisoners, particularly those who  are in a very vulnerable situation. We need to be very conscious of the sheer  number of vulnerable prisoners at this time.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The report from the Prisoner Ombudsman is extremely  serious, and it points to major systemic failures in the overall system, at an  individual level &#8213; although perhaps we should not go into too much detail about  that, because disciplinary proceedings will, undoubtedly, be unfolding &#8213; and at  a managerial level, which, again, may be addressed through formal procedures  elsewhere.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">We also need to be conscious of the mental health and  personality disorder aspect behind this case. The report does, I believe,  accept that, on balance, the direct decisions that were taken at a clinical  level were correct, and I think that the input from Professor Roy McClelland  bears that out. However, it recognises that there is an importance in bringing  a wider range of psychological or psychotherapeutic inputs to the table,  particularly in very complex cases such as that of Colin Bell.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">We need to be mindful that there is a much higher incidence  of mental-health problems in the prisoner population than in the population as  a whole. Even beyond that, there is a very strong incidence of personality  disorder issues in the prisoner population than in the population as a whole.  That whole issue of how to address personality disorders, as opposed to direct  depressive or psychotic aspects of mental health, is a challenge right across  the board with regard to Bamford and the current consultations in the  Department of Health. However, it is an extremely acute issue in prisons.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The report is a watershed for the Prison Service, and for  those who manage it, and I take comfort from the response from the Minister of  State, Paul Goggins, and the director general of the Prison Service, Robin  Masefield. However, the report highlights some broader issues to which we need  to face up in relation to our prisons. We need to look at the working practices  of prison officers. Clearly, we are still suffering from the legacy of the  Troubles when prison officers had to adopt a particular approach to managing  the situation in prisons. We must also recognise how our prison officers  withstood actual violence and the threat of violence during the Troubles,  including that which was directed at their families on the outside.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">On Friday, I attended the funeral of a gentleman from my  constituency who was extremely badly beaten during the Maze breakout, and who  was retired from the Prison Service as a consequence. Furthermore, when I was  Mayor of North Down in 2007, I also had the privilege of hosting a freedom of  the borough ceremony to recognise the contribution of the Prison Service.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">We need to have a change in culture and a move away from  simply guarding prisoners to protecting prisoners and actively working towards  their rehabilitation.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Paisley Jnr</strong>:  Does the Member accept that that issue goes right to the heart of what I said?  If there is a situation whereby prison staff do these things off their own bat,  then yes, they are ultimately to blame. However, if there is a policy directive  and a political impetus behind that policy, the blame ought to go to the heart  of where it rests, which is with the political masters and the people at the  NIO, instead of simply saying that it is about the governor or the deputy  governor and the staff. It is much more problematic than the report allows us  to believe.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  am grateful to the Member for his intervention. We need a twin-track approach  to the issue. A clear policy decision has to be taken at the top level, with  co-operation from those who are in a delivery position in the Prison Service at  a managerial level and from those who are on the prison floor with regard to  moving the issue forward.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">That points to the wider challenge of resources. The  running costs per prisoner in Northern Ireland  are significantly greater than those of England  and Wales.  We do not enjoy the economies of scale that exist elsewhere. There is a need  for further capital investment in our prisons, whether they be women&rsquo;s prisons  or open prisons. We need improvements to Maghaberry Prison, in addition to the  plans that exist for Magilligan Prison. Things may have to be done differently  in the Prison Service in order to better manage the scarce resources that are  available.</p>
        <p class="TimePeriod">2.00 pm</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">It is also important that the debate on policing and  justice does not focus too much on policing, to the neglect of what happens  after people are arrested, go to court and to prison. In particular, there  should be a focus on mental-health issues. Much more resources must go into  prisons to ensure that we do not leave people vulnerable.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: I  am concerned that the issue is being looked at in a simplistic light and,  therefore, I am concerned about the motion and the report from the Prisoner  Ombudsman. The motion clearly levels blame at the Prison Service and the  governors of prisons.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I find the whole affair very sad. It is sad that Colin Bell  has died, that he was in prison in the first instance and that another family  suffered as a consequence of Colin Bell&rsquo;s actions. That family still grieves  for the loss of its loved one &mdash; we should never lose sight of that.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Nonetheless, the Prison Service has a responsibility, when  members of the public are found guilty of crimes and incarcerated, to look  after those individuals while they are in its care and under its authority. I  recognise that there are many Members in the Chamber who have much more  experience of prison than I have. Nonetheless, I represent the constituency in  which the prison in question is located.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Many of the recommendations of the report are practical,  sensible and acceptable. However, I take issue with the recommendation that  picks out the governor and deputy governor and suggests that they go through a  disciplinary process. The governor and deputy governor have had to go through a  process imposed on them by the Northern Ireland Office. If we had a Minister  for justice in the Chamber, we could challenge him as to why he imposed  policies on the Prison Service. One cannot blame the governor and deputy  governor for introducing night custody officers at a considerably lower cost  than prison officers; they had no choice. They had to implement the policy of  the Northern Ireland Office, which was to bring in people on the cheap to carry  out that duty. Therefore, because the Prisoner Ombudsman has gone after the  governor and deputy governor and absolutely missed the Northern Ireland  Office Minister who brought that policy about, the report is fundamentally  flawed and we cannot accept the motion.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Colin Bell&rsquo;s death is something that we all regret. We can  apply the recommendations so that nothing like it happens again. However, we  must not use the Prison Service as a scapegoat in this situation. The Prison  Service does its difficult job to the best of its ability. A sizeable number of  prisoners wish to have political status. All sorts of problems exist in that prison  &mdash; not because of the workings of the Prison Service or the staff, but because  of external influences.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Members need to state that they support the Prison Service,  that they support prison officers in doing their difficult task and that they  will not go down the route of putting the boot into the Prison Service because  of this event. This was a problem that was handed to it; it was not of its  making.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms J McCann</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I apologise for not being here for  the beginning of the debate. I welcome the opportunity to take part in this  very important debate. As previous Members have said, it is very clear that  Colin Bell was a very vulnerable person and that when he needed the help of the  prison system, that system failed him. His death in custody highlighted how the  system fails most prisoners.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">He is not the first person to die in prison custody;  throughout the years, quite a number of people have died in custody, such as  two women, Annie Kelly, who died in September 2002, and Roseanne Irvine, who  died in 2004. There were several reports into prison conditions at that time,  and there needs to be a root and branch change to the prison system and prison  conditions.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I want to speak about the vulnerability of some women  prisoners in particular. Last year, I visited Hydebank Wood and saw, at first  hand, the conditions that women prisoners there were living in. They were being  locked up for long periods of time; they had the humiliation of strip searches;  and there was a lack of contact with family and friends. Those women were in an  all-male prison and, therefore, their movements were very restricted. As a  former political prisoner, I empathise with those women, as I also experienced  those degrading conditions at first hand. The conditions were unacceptable then  and they are unacceptable now. People in prison have rights, and those rights  need to be respected.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the ombudsman&rsquo;s report, which is very clear and  concise. The ombudsman makes a number of recommendations, which, if implemented,  would improve prison conditions. The mental and physical health of prisoners is  important, but their emotional health is of particular importance, and the lack  of constructive programmes to assist personal or social development is a core  problem.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Prison Service has been referred to, and, I have to say  that &mdash; root and branch, from the administration staff to the staff on the wings  &mdash; there has been no change in the Prison Service since the time when people  such as me were in prison. The same attitude is visible now. Change is needed,  and the recommendations must be implemented. Therefore, I support the motion,  Go raibh maith agat.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Prison is not supposed to be a holiday camp. I listened to the Member who spoke  previously, talking about injustices and about how things are not right. I have  to say, the world has gone mad. Victims of crime are the issue; the people who  are in prison are there because they have done wrong. I am all for looking  after people&rsquo;s human rights and for making sure that those are not abused  unnecessarily; however, we must not lose sight of the fact that society has a  right to rid itself of people who are trying it do it wrong.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms J McCann</strong>:  Does the Member agree that there are a number of people in prison who really  should not be there? Their mental, emotional and psychological health is at  risk in prison, and they could be in other community-based systems. I am  talking about the non-payment of fines. There are a number of women who are in  Hydebank Wood because of non-payment of television licences and non-payment of  the resulting fines. Does the Member agree that not everyone in prison should  be there in the first place?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  It may astonish the Member to hear that I agree with her about the reasons why  certain people are in prison. However, the point that I was reacting to is that  the primary role of the criminal justice system is to protect society from  people who cause damage to life or limb.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I have had the privilege of attending the graduations of  newly qualified night custody officers. An illuminating part of that was to  understand the real challenges that they face.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Some Members have raised the issue of the cost of prisons.  Prisons used to be &mdash; and probably still are &mdash; very dangerous places in which to  work, not only for the people who work there but for their families. If costs  are to be reduced, and if we are to get things right, we have to become a  normal society in which everyone supports the rule of law and order.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Along with my party colleagues, I am prepared to support  the motion, but only in the context that we want to see the Northern Ireland  Prison Service at its professional best. There are working processes that no matter  what way one looks at them, are not satisfactory. There are also issues for  which there is no defence. We do not defend those issues, and we have taken the  strong position of saying that they should be addressed. DUP colleagues have  asked who was to blame, but I do not seek to highlight governors or deputy  governors. There is systemic failure, and people need help to address it. The  simplistic notion of pointing fingers at particular people will not fix the  system and is not correct. I want to find a way of making it better.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Paisley Jnr</strong>:  Does the Member agree that by accepting the report in full, he is limiting the  responsibility and the changes that are possible? The report does not ask the  Northern Ireland Office, the policymakers or Ministers to be responsible and  politically accountable for their actions.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I understood the arguments made by Mr Paisley and Mr Poots. Although the Ulster  Unionist Party accepts those arguments, ultimately, we are supporting the  report because we recognise that there have been serious failings. In doing so,  we do not think that the buck stops with the governors or with those who have  been identified. We take the DUP&rsquo;s argument in the context of what we are  voting on; we want to find ways of improving the Prison Service for the whole  of society.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I find it strange that in a previous debate on another  subject, we were looking at saving money on postage, whereas in other areas  being debated, there is massive underinvestment and people are being asked to  do things that are simply not right.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">There are dangerous prisoners who try to abscond, and they  use hospital wings as their way out. In addition, some prisoners need to be  moved securely from one area to another. Those people know what they are about,  and they are not the people to whom Ms McCann referred earlier. There are issues  about the withdrawal of privileges and the management of the system. Many of  the recommendations outlined by Mr Poots contain aspects that we can support.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Ulster Unionist Party supports the recommend&shy;ations; we  want the Prison Service to fix its working practices. We wholeheartedly support  the brave men and women who act as prison officers. However, shoddy work,  Spanish practices, and people not doing the jobs that they are paid for are not  acceptable to us or to anyone else in the Assembly. Therefore, we support the  motion with the caveats that we outlined.</p>        
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  If there is one thing that this disturbing report highlights, it is the need  for the Assembly to have confidence and control over the Prison Service as soon  as possible. Therefore, I reiterate the argument that the SDLP has made many  times from these Benches: policing and justice powers should be transferred to  the Assembly as soon as possible.</p>
        <p class="TimePeriod">2.15 pm</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Paisley Jnr</strong>:  Does the Member accept, therefore, that if policing and justice powers had been  devolved at the time of the report&rsquo;s publication, the person who would be held  to account would not be the prison governor, deputy governor or night-duty  clerk? The Minister would be held to account. The person who would be  responsible, yet who is left out of the report, would be the Minister, and  thereby the NIO.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  I certainly accept that. That is the nature of democratic accountability. In  fact, it should be the standard that is applied in dealing with a situation  that happens on a justice Minister&rsquo;s watch.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I re-emphasise the point that it is important that the  Assembly expedite the devolution of policing and justice powers to Northern Ireland.  In some ways, the debate is futile, because the Assembly does not have direct  responsibility. It is simply an observer &mdash; a bystander &mdash; when it should be a  participant in the control of the Prison Service.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I will direct my remarks to the report in particular.  Colleagues have mentioned several aspects, which I will not re-examine.  However, I will comment on the narrative of that unfortunate man&rsquo;s death. For  more than three years, he had been a conforming prisoner. Indeed, he had shown  few signs of disturbance. The fact is that in March 2008, he was dealt with for  stealing a photograph frame. The incident triggered something in the man&rsquo;s  behaviour. It caused him to misbehave. I wonder whether the original decision  on his stealing the frame was the correct one. Should the man not have been  dealt with on a different level? Was the reaction to the man&rsquo;s misdemeanour  disproportionate? I ask that question of people who examine such issues.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, the man seems to have suffered not from mental  illness but from a personality disorder. That is an important distinction.  Professor McClelland makes that plain in his report to the Prisoner Ombudsman.  In his report, he talks about a power struggle between the prison authorities  and the prisoner. Is that the correct way for the prison authorities to conduct  their relationship with a prisoner who has offended? Is it a matter of beating  the man down, so to speak, and showing him who is boss? I am not convinced that  that is the right way in which to proceed with a prisoner who may be suffering  from a personality disorder.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  I cannot give way, because I will run out of time.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  The Member would get an extra minute.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  I would not, because I have already been given an extra minute.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, the man manifested his disturbance by talking  about what he deemed to be paramilitary threats, which were assessed to be  non-existent by the prison authorities. He was moved 30 times. I wonder whether  that action was appropriate.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Paisley mentioned the night-custody officers. My  understanding of the Prison Service is that night-custody officers are  specially trained for those duties. Obviously, they failed in respect of that  man &mdash; manifestly so. Everyone can acknowledge that. I wonder whether that was  due to penny-pinching and saving costs.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  I cannot give way. At present, in the Northern Ireland Prison Service, costs  per prisoner are excessive compared with those of any other part of the UK or, I  believe, the Republic.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">We have to examine that, because we cannot keep ploughing  excessive amounts of money into the Prison Service. I do not want the service  provided for prisoners to be undermined in any way, but we must examine the  whole cost base of the Prison Service and the prison estate.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Anderson</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Ba mhaith liom taca&iacute;ocht a  thabhairt don r&uacute;n.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I support the motion. I am grateful for the opportunity to  bring the motion before the Chamber, and I thank all the Members who  contributed to the debate.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">There has been a huge deal of concern throughout the  community about Colin Bell&rsquo;s death and the findings of the Prisoner Ombudsman&rsquo;s  subsequent investigation. I am extremely conscious of the feelings of the  family of Colin Bell&rsquo;s victim. They cannot and should not be forgotten, and all  of us must acknowledge their hurt and be conscious of their ongoing grief and  anguish throughout this process.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Nevertheless, the fact remains that the ombudsman&rsquo;s  investigation was a damning indictment of the Prison Service. Wardens were found  to have been sleeping on duty, and Colin Bell&rsquo;s repeated attempts to take his  own life were not observed, despite the fact that CCTV footage of his cell was  supposed to be monitored constantly. Members have recognised those concerns in  the Chamber today.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">My colleague Raymond McCartney spoke of the failings of the  prison system and said that Colin Bell&rsquo;s cry for help went unheard. He also  talked about the lack of care shown in the behaviour of prison staff and  recommended the full implementation of the Prisoner Ombudsman&rsquo;s report; I fully  endorse those views.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Ian Paisley Jnr spoke of the circumstances that led to  Colin Bell&rsquo;s death and those that led to him being in prison, and he said that  those were equally disgraceful. He said that although he agrees with many of  the recommendations, he has issues with some of them and would have preferred  the ombudsman&rsquo;s report to have gone much further. He also talked about prison  warders on night duty not being properly trained. I do not know what training  one needs to do night duty when one is being paid to do night duty as opposed  to being asleep.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Leslie Cree mentioned the shocking nature of the report and  said that there appears to have been no duty of care on the part of the night  staff on duty on the evening of Colin Bell&rsquo;s death and spoke of the need for  the recommendations to be implemented in full.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Alex Attwood spoke about the devolution of policing and  justice and how that Ministry will fall to someone in the Chamber. Therefore,  the consequences of this incident and the ombudsman&rsquo;s report will have to be  considered by a local Minister. Mr Attwood also said that the Prisoner Ombudsman  needs a budget line to carry out her work fully; we endorse that view.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Stephen Farry also endorsed what Mr Attwood had said. He  said that the Prisoner Ombudsman should not only be properly funded but put on  a statutory footing; once again, Raymond McCartney and I concur with that  feeling. Mr Farry spoke about the issue of mental illness and how it related to  the case of Colin Bell. He also said that there is a higher incidence of  mental-health problems in the prison population as a whole. All MLAs know  constituents who have ended up in prison but who should have been placed in  mental-health units. My colleague Jennifer McCann spoke about that issue.  Indeed, one governor told me that the prison was full of prisoners who should  be in mental-health units instead.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Edwin Poots expressed concerns about many of the  recommendations. Although he views many of the recommendations to be practical  and sensible, he took issue with the one relating to the governor and deputy  governor. He focused on the NIO&rsquo;s policy of bringing people into prison to  perform a duty on the cheap.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">My colleague Jennifer McCann spoke of Annie Kelly and  Roseanne Irvine, two other prisoners who took their own lives, and the fact  that the reports and recommendations that followed their deaths had not been  fully implemented.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Basil McCrea said that prison is not supposed to be a  holiday camp. As one who has been there, I assure him that it certainly is not.  He said that he will support the motion in order to ensure that the Prison  Service is at its best, and he discussed the systematic failures and said that  help is needed to address those failings.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Prisoner Ombudsman&rsquo;s 44 recommendations must now be  implemented fully. Some Members made points about policy, but the motion does  not limit the scope of holding those responsible to account, and DUP Members  who spoke should take that into account. Sinn F&eacute;in supports any examination of  prison policy that will ensure that the issues outlined during the debate are  addressed.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The issue goes much further than the Colin Bell case: there  were 11 jail suicides between 1996 and 2008, 10 of which occurred in  Maghaberry. In many cases, the inquest coroner&rsquo;s recommendations have gone  unheeded and unheard. Indeed, the Ombudsman&rsquo;s investigation is the latest in a  line of similar reports in recent years that have expressed grave concerns  about the prison system.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Unfortunately, the warnings have been ignored,  recommendations have not been implemented and vulnerable prisoners will  continue to die. A fundamental sea change is needed in the prison system. As we  emerged from conflict, there was no Patten-style reform of the prison system.  That must happen. The long overdue transfer of policing and justice &mdash; as some  Members referred to &mdash; will help to overhaul the system&rsquo;s failings. However, we  can make a start now by ensuring that the Ombudsman&rsquo;s recommendations are  implemented fully.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights states  that authorities have a positive obligation to protect life, which arises when  they know, or ought to know, of a real and imminent risk to a prisoner&rsquo;s life, even  if the threat comes from the individuals themselves.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Prison Service policy on self-harm and suicide  prevention aims to identify prisoners at risk of suicide or self-harm and  provides the necessary support and care in order to minimise the harm that an  individual may cause to himself or herself. That policy has obviously not been  implemented fully, because in a 30-hour period before his death, Colin Bell  tried to contact the Samaritans 73 times via a link-up facility in his cell.  Sixty-three attempts were unsuccessful because of technical difficulties.  Prison staff lay on a makeshift bed, watched TV, drank tea and coffee and  smoked, while ignoring Colin Bell&rsquo;s suicide attempts.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">As Raymond McCartney said, for two days, Colin Bell wrapped  toilet paper round his feet to stay warm. That is absolutely appalling. He  killed himself at the fourth attempt, but for almost 40 minutes, officers did  not realise that he was dead. Three days before Colin Bell&rsquo;s death, prison  staff assured his mother that his life was not under threat.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">In the North, there are more prison staff than inmates;  there are approximately 2,300 prison staff, about 1,800 of whom are prison  officers. That amounts to a higher number than the prison population. Therefore,  a failure to implement the policy of self-harm and suicide prevention cannot be  blamed on understaffing or lack of training. Although it is regrettable that  policing and justice powers have not been devolved, I acknowledge the British  Minister&rsquo;s comments that &mdash;</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. As Question Time begins at 2.30 pm, I suggest that the  House take its ease until that time. The debate will continue immediately after  Question Time, when Ms Anderson will continue her winding-up speech.</p>

        <p class="H3SectionHeading">office of the first minister and deputy first  minister</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Questions 1 and 2 have been withdrawn.</p>
        <p class="H5StageHeading">Post-Primary Transfer</p>
        <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">3. <strong>Mr D  Bradley </strong>asked the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister  when the proposals of the Minister of Education on the future of post-primary  transfer were last discussed at an Executive meeting.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO2108/09>(AQO 2108/09)</a></p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister (Mr M McGuiness)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. It is  not our practice to disclose details of Executive business. The contents of  Executive papers are confidential, as are all aspects of Executive business.  The Member will be aware of the statement made to the Assembly by the Minister  of Education on 2 February.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Does the deputy First Minister agree  that, in the light of the chaos surrounding the future of post-primary  education, including an unregulated system of transfer and the unions&rsquo; threat  to instruct their members not to prepare children for potential tests, the  Executive should hold a special meeting with a single-item agenda &mdash; namely, the  future of our children&rsquo;s education &mdash; as proposed by my party colleague Margaret  Ritchie, as long ago as last May?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: The issue of post-primary transfer reform was raised at a number  of Executive meetings in 2007 and 2008, but no agreed Executive position was  reached. The Minister of Education submitted a draft Executive paper on  post-primary transfer arrangements for the Executive meeting of the 17 January  2008. It was agreed that consideration of that paper would be deferred and that  a dedicated meeting of the Executive should be scheduled to address the issue.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister of Education submitted a draft Executive paper  on post-primary transfer reform for the Executive meeting on 15 May. At that  meeting, there was detailed discussion of the process that could be put in  place to consider the Minister&rsquo;s paper, but the content of the paper was not  considered by the Executive.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">At the Executive meeting of 15 January 2009, the Minister  of Education indicated that she would shortly submit a memorandum to the  Executive. That paper was circulated on 27 January but was not tabled for  discussion at the Executive meeting on 29 January. The Minister of Education  wrote to the First Minister and me on 30 January to inform us that she intended  to make a statement to the Assembly on transfer 2010; that statement was made  on 2 February.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. First, does the deputy First Minister  share my surprise that the Member who spoke previously does not welcome the  fact that teachers are refusing to prepare children for transfer tests?  Secondly, is it not the case that the Minister of Education can, and does,  issue guidelines from time to time?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: In her statement of 2 February, the Minister of Education advised  that she was issuing guidance on post-primary admissions under article 30 of  the Education Order 2006, which states that:</p>
        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The Department may issue, and from time to time  revise, such guidance as it thinks appropriate in respect of the arrangements  for the admission of pupils to grant-aided schools&rdquo;.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I assure the Minister that I know who he is and what he is. How many papers has  the Education Minister circulated to the Executive since assuming office? How  many of those papers related to post-primary transfer? Were there any key  differences between those various papers?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: In the answer that I gave previously, I gave a clear and detailed  rundown of the number of papers and requests that were submitted by the  Minister of Education to the Executive.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  Does the deputy First Minister believe that the decisions that were taken by  the Education Minister fall under the definition of a &ldquo;significant or  controversial&rdquo; item that is outside the context of the Programme for  Government, which, under the ministerial code, would therefore require an  Executive decision?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: The Minister of Education, acting as the Minister of Education,  has made her position absolutely clear, and she has, on a number of occasions,  submitted to the Executive clear indications of how she intended to proceed. I  have given a full answer today in relation to all of the contributions made to  the Executive by the Minister.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">We all clearly understand that, as a result of the decisions  that were taken by those who were responsible for putting an Executive agenda  in place, we now have a situation in which the Minister of Education has  decided that she must issue guidance. Given her responsibility as a Minister,  and the fact that the debate has being going on for quite some time, we must  see the outworking of that situation. There may be a determination on whether  decisions are significant or controversial at a later stage in the process.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Question 4 has been withdrawn.</p>
        <p class="H5StageHeading">Single Equality Bill</p>
        <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">5. <strong>Mr  McCarthy </strong>asked the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister  to detail the timetable for the single equality Bill.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO2110/09>(AQO 2110/09)</a></p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: We continue to legislate in order to provide legal protection  against discrimination and to promote equality of opportunity. Since the restoration  of the institutions, we have introduced legislation to strengthen and improve  the rights of individuals in a number of different areas. We have introduced  several changes to disability discrimination legislation in order to improve  the lives of disabled people here. For example, we have amended the definition  of disability so that people with progressive conditions are deemed to be  disabled from the point of diagnosis. We have made it unlawful to treat a  disabled person less favourably than others for a disability reason in the  disposal or management of residential, commercial and other premises. We have  also imposed new duties on public authorities and private clubs to make  reasonable adjustments for disabled people.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">In the area of gender equality, our law was amended in  order to give effect to the European gender goods and services directive. We  also brought forward regulations to amend the Sex Discrimination Order 1976 in  order to ensure that we fully complied with the European equal treatment amendment  directive. We are currently consulting on the removal of the transport  exemption that pertains to the right of access to goods, facilities and  services contained in the Disability Discrimination Act 2005 in order to make  it unlawful for transport operators to discriminate against a disabled person.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Following the close of the consultation period, we will  move quickly to amend the law. In addition to strengthening the framework of  equality legislation, the Executive have agreed the policy approach that is  intended to reduce inequalities further in the areas of age, gender and race,  and the inequalities that result from poverty and exclusion. The Executive will  soon consider proposals to tackle the inequalities that are experienced by  people with disabilities, in line with their statutory section 75 duty.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">We are aware that the European Commission has produced a  draft directive to extend protection against discrimination on the grounds of  religion, belief, disability, age or sexual orientation in the area of goods  and services. We must ensure that our citizens enjoy the same protections as  others do across the European Union. We will therefore consider the  implications of those developments in deciding the future direction of equality  legislation here.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Minister, before I call Mr McCarthy to ask a supplementary question, we were  informed that you were going to answer questions 5 and 11 together.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: That is news to me.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  Given the horrendous delay by the Office of the First Minister and deputy First  Minister in making progress on the single equality Bill &mdash; which was the subject  of my original question &mdash; is it not abundantly clear to any observer that the  Bill has, in effect, been abandoned by that Department?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: We will continue to keep the broad spectrum of equality  legislation under review. Our Department is committed to the principle of  equality for all people here. Policy proposals on equality legislation will be  considered in consultation with the Committee for the Office of the First  Minister and deputy First Minister and the Executive. It would not be  appropriate to comment on timescales until policy decisions have been taken.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Our officials continue to assess the situation and keep us  informed of developments in Britain  and Europe on proposals for equality  legislation. Work on equality legislation continues in order to deliver on our  Programme for Government commitments, EU obligations, case law requirements and  emerging issues. It is a mistake to say that all possible avenues have been  closed down by the Executive &mdash; they clearly have not.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his reply. Is this not another example of Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s  surrendering of a vital political issue, this time on equality legislation, to  the whims and fancies of the DUP, in the same way that it did on the  Irish-language Act, the Maze and education?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: That is wishful thinking on the Member&rsquo;s part. The reality is  that we are part of a coalition Government. If a member of the SDLP were the  deputy First Minister, he or she would have to deal with the same issues and  difficulties that I do. Clearly, it is quite easy for one to seize on issues if  one wants to score political points and be involved in one-upmanship. However,  that does not work for the simple reason that we &mdash; and I speak as a member of  Sinn F&eacute;in and as the deputy First Minister &mdash; have accomplished something that  the SDLP failed to do, which was to bring about a fully inclusive Executive. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP, and its two deputy First Ministers, never managed  to bring about a situation in which all parties sat at the Executive table, but  Sinn F&eacute;in did, and that is important. Of course, the Democratic Unionist Party,  the First Minister and I have said that being in Government together is not  easy. It is difficult. However, the political situation in the North of Ireland  has been transformed by the decisions &mdash;</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  Paralysis.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: The situation has been transformed as a result of the decisions  that both the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in have taken. The SDLP finds that hard to take,  because it told everyone, prior to the restoration of the institutions, that  there would never be an agreement between the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  Never.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: That is absolutely true. The Member can shake his head for as  long as he likes, but it is on public record that the SDLP told the world and  his mother that the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in would never come to an agreement. That  party was, therefore, confounded when we did.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">A Cheann Comhairle, the next toot from the SDLP was that,  although we had managed to get the institutions up and running, it would never  last. Through our recent efforts and work, we have clearly shown that the  process is sustainable, that it is lasting, and that it has produced results in  the interests of all of the people that we represent. That does not mean to say  that we agree on everything; there are issues on the agenda that remain to be  resolved. However, rather than giving up, Sinn F&eacute;in works day and daily.  Members of the SDLP can heckle, mutter and moan as much as they like on the  sidelines, because the reality is that Sinn F&eacute;in and the DUP accomplished  something that the SDLP and the Ulster Unionists failed to do.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Maskey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. The Member has the Floor.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Maskey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat. When some parties do not get their own way, they try to  butt in, shout and heckle; however, that gets them nowhere.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Can the Minister outline the main pieces of equality  legislation that have been enacted since the restoration of the institutions?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: Since May 2007, our Department has made seven pieces of equality  legislation: the Disability Discrimination (Premises) Regulations 2007; the  Disability Discrimination (Service Providers and Public Authorities Carrying  Out Functions) Regulations 2007; the Disability Discrimination (Private Clubs,  etc.) Regulations 2008; the Disabilities Discrimination (Questions and Replies)  Order 2007; the Disability Discrimination (Guidance on the Definition of  Disability) (Appointed Day) Order 2008; the Sex Discrimination Order 1976  (Amendment) Regulations 2008; and the Sex Discrimination (Amendment of  Legislation) Regulations 2008.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">In addition, we launched a consultation on the draft  Disability Discrimination (Transport Vehicles) Regulations in December 2008.  That consultation will run until 13 March.</p>
        <p class="TimePeriod">2.45 pm</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Burnside</strong>:  I hate to intervene in the nationalist/republican debate. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">With the depth and extent of the equality and human-rights  legislation that exists in Northern Ireland, is there no time in the future  that the deputy First Minister envisages this Assembly evolving into the same  formation of a Government and Executive as every other democratic country in  the world, whether that be a voluntary coalition or a weighted majority?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: It is quite clear that the Member wishes to draw me into a  revision of the speech that I made during the course of last weekend. Clearly,  the answer is no. We have to work with the institutions and the agreements that  have been made over the course of recent times. Those have been hugely beneficial  to all of the people whom we represent. As a result of the Good Friday  Agreement and the St Andrews Agreement, we clearly have a responsibility &mdash; as  an Executive and as an Assembly &mdash; to continue to work those institutions.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The future is unquantifiable for all of us. Over the course  of recent times, people have failed to predict the future as regards the  economic situation. People are now trying to predict what will happen  economically over the course of the next while. From our perspective, we want to  work the institutions that currently exist. The people who hanker after changes  to the situation surely know that change can only come about as a result of  agreements that are forged among the main parties that receive mandates from  the electorate.</p>
        <p class="H5StageHeading">Fuel Poverty</p>
        <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">6. <strong>Mrs M  Bradley </strong>asked the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister  (OFMDFM) on what date the Minister for Social Development made it aware that  her Department did not have legislative authority to make payments from her  proposed fuel poverty package.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO2111/09>(AQO  2111/09)</a></p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: It is not our practice to disclose details of Executive business  or to divulge the content of correspondence among Ministers of the Executive.  However, the Member will be aware that the First Minister and I were required  to respond on this matter during the passage of the Financial Assistance Bill.  Our responses are available in the record of those debates, and we have nothing  further to add.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Rather than seeking to revive an old argument, it would be  better to focus on the positive developments since then. The Financial  Assistance Act 2009 is now law, and the Executive have approved our proposal  for the first determination and designation under its provisions. We made that  determination and designation on 17 February, and it will enable the Minister  for Social Development to introduce a scheme for financial assistance in  respect of fuel payments. We expect that that will be discussed and agreed at  the Executive meeting this coming Thursday.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>:  I am disappointed that the Minister cannot properly answer the question. I take  it that what was said in the House on 13 January was wrong.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: I disagree with the Member.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>:  I listened carefully to the deputy First Minister&rsquo;s response. Will he indicate  whether OFMDFM has any plans to expand the power, legislative authority and  policy remits that are under its control during the next session of this  Assembly?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: That question clearly flows from the debate that we had in the  House about the contents of the Financial Assistance Bill. During the course of  countless contributions, the First Minister and I made it absolutely clear that  the Bill had a specific purpose. All sorts of expletives were used,  particularly by SDLP members, to describe how dangerous the Bill was.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The First Minister and I did not cook up any plan  whatsoever to use the Financial Assistance Bill for anything other than the  purposes that we explained to this House.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brady</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Will the Minister tell the House when the  payments for those living in fuel poverty will be made?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: As the necessary legislation has now passed through the Assembly,  the Executive will discuss the scheme on Thursday. We are committed to making  the payments as soon as possible after the regulations setting out the scheme  come into operation.</p>
        <p class="H5StageHeading">North/South Ministerial Council: &nbsp;Single-Issue Meeting</p>
        <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">7. <strong>Mr  McElduff </strong>asked the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister  what plans it has to seek a single-issue meeting of the North/South Ministerial  Council to discuss the economic challenges on the island of Ireland.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO2112/09>(AQO 2112/09)</a></p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: The economic crisis affects the entire island of Ireland  and, indeed, the world. It was discussed in detail with the Taoiseach and Irish  Government Ministers at a plenary meeting of the North/South Ministerial  Council on 23 January 2009, and at a meeting of the British-Irish Council in Cardiff on Friday 20  February 2009.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Members will be aware of the high level of daily  cross-border economic activity on the island. It is therefore essential to  address the current economic challenges. The North/South Ministerial Council  website www.borderpeople.info is the central access point for all cross-border  mobility information on the island   of Ireland.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Working groups that were set up by the North/South  Ministerial Council are examining in detail the issues of cross-border banking  and the transfer of public-sector pensions. Over the coming months, sectoral  meetings will provide further opportunities for the relevant Ministers to  discuss how the North/South Ministerial Council&rsquo;s work can contribute to  addressing the serious effects of the economic downturn.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Ba mhaith liom mo bhu&iacute;ochas a ghabh&aacute;il  leis an Aire as a fhreagra.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the deputy First Minister for his answer. Will he  assure Members that the particular difficulties being experienced by the  construction industry and in the engineering and manufacturing sectors will be  discussed and that the two Governments on this island will engage in joined-up  working to address those problems at future meetings of the North/South  Ministerial Council?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: At the meetings in Derry and Cardiff, we had broad discussions on the  economic difficulties facing many Governments in this part of the world, not  least the crisis in the construction industry, which exercises and concerns  everyone.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The merits of the private sector versus the public sector  have been debated for many years. I have made it clear that the size of the  public sector has assisted the North, where unemployment currently stands at  about 5%. That figure is too high, and it is unacceptable to OFMDFM, but the unemployment  figure in the South is approaching 10%. As I told the House in the past week or  so, when the First Minister and I were in Brussels, senior officials told us  that they feared that the level of unemployment in Spain, for example, could  reach 20% by the end of the year.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">That illustrates the extent of the crisis that we face. It  is incumbent on everyone, through the North/South Ministerial Council and the  British-Irish Council, to ensure that, during our deliberations and at the  cross-sectoral meetings, we address how we can work together to mutual benefit  to combat the worst effects of the extremely serious worldwide economic  downturn.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  Will the deputy First Minister tell the House when he and the First Minister  are next scheduled to meet the Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, to address the  economic challenges? Will he undertake to take that opportunity to raise the  plight of the Presbyterian Mutual Society?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: The First Minister and I, together with the First Ministers of  Scotland and Wales, will  meet the Prime Minister in Downing Street next  Wednesday, and we intend to raise the plight of investors in the Presbyterian  Mutual Society on the margins of that meeting.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  I thank the deputy First Minister for confirming that, despite my hope &mdash; and  that of Mr McElduff &mdash; that a single-issue meeting of the North/South  Ministerial Council would be held on economic challenges, no such meeting is  planned. That is another example of Peter Robinson saying no and Sinn F&eacute;in saying  OK.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I ask the deputy First Minister &mdash;<span class="Italic"> [Interruption.]</span></p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. The Member has the Floor.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  Can the deputy First Minister confirm that, until today, not only the First  Minister and the DUP; not only the deputy First Minister and Sinn F&eacute;in, but the  Alliance Party, have had prior sight of the Northern Ireland Bill, which deals  with the devolution of justice, and which is being introduced today at Westminster? Will the  deputy First Minister explain why he, Peter Robinson, and the Alliance Party  should have that information?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. I have said on many occasions in the House that the supplementary  question should relate to the original question. That supplementary question  was in no way related to the substantive question. I will move on.</p>
        <p class="H5StageHeading">Expenditure Plans</p>
        <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">8. <strong>Mr  Moutray </strong>asked the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister  what expenditure plans it has in relation to victims of the Troubles in the  next financial year.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO2113/09>(AQO 2113/09)</a></p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: A total of &pound;36 million has been allocated to the sector over the  three-year period 2008-2011, and &pound;12 million is earmarked for the 2009-2010  financial year &mdash; an increase of approximately &pound;4 million over this year&rsquo;s  allocation. We hope to make an announcement on funding for victims and  survivors soon.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Themes 1 and 2 of the European Union&rsquo;s Peace III programme  are dedicated entirely to work with victims and survivors. Those themes have  set aside &euro;50 million over the period 2006-2013. Although Peace III has taken  time to become established, projects totalling approximately &euro;20 million have  now been approved for funding the victims and survivors theme within the  programme. As part of its initial work programme, the Commission for Victims  and Survivors has undertaken to advise OFMDFM on spending priorities in the  next financial year, and we look forward to receiving those views.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Moutray</strong>:  I thank the deputy First Minister for his answer. Will he indicate what  measures will be taken to ensure that the many victims who are not represented  by victims&rsquo; groups will be treated fairly in respect of funding?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: All of us absolutely sympathise with the substance of that  question. There is a responsibility, and I think that we have the mechanisms  and the organisational structures to deal with that.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">All of us clearly understand the importance of ensuring  that the strategy for victims and survivors brings benefits to everyone in  society. The consultation on the draft strategic approach for victims and  survivors closed on 31 October 2008. The Committee for the Office of the First  and deputy First Minister has discussed the responses to the consultation paper  with officials, and I understand that, given the relationship between the  strategy and the service, the Committee is currently awaiting a copy of the  draft consultation paper on the victims and survivors&rsquo; service, which was  proposed in the draft strategy, before making any response on the strategy  itself.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">We look forward to hearing comments from the Committee, which  will no doubt encompass the question that was asked, in the foreseeable future.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>:  Will the deputy First Minister explain whether the work programme for the  victims&rsquo; commissioners has been signed off and agreed between himself and the  First Minister &mdash; and if not, why not?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: Although the commission&rsquo;s work programme has been approved by the  First Minister and myself, our approval of the programme is a fundamental part  of our accountability relationship with the commission &mdash; in particular, the  budgetary dimension. We are now satisfied with that aspect, and have approved  the draft work programme.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The commission has recently appointed a secretary. That is  a key appointment that will accelerate many procedural matters for the  commission, and I have no doubt that the Member will be disappointed that I was  able to give him an answer that involved an agreement between the First  Minister and myself. His party has been very critical in its comments on the  actions of the First Minister, given that it attempted to form an alliance with  the Democratic Unionist Party and the Ulster Unionist Party against Sinn F&eacute;in  last year, at a time when its Minister was sandwiched between two leading  Members of both of those parties. That was not that party&rsquo;s position just a few  short weeks ago.</p>
        <p class="TimePeriod">3.00 pm</p>
        <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="6"></a>Employment and Learning</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I remind Members that supplementary questions must relate to the original  question. If a Member rises, knowing quite well that his or her supplementary  question does not relate to the original question, it will be a long time  before he or she will catch my eye again for a supplementary question.</p>
        <p class="H5StageHeading">Redundancies in Upper Bann</p>
        <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">1. <strong>Mr  Savage </strong>asked the Minister for Employment and Learning how his Department  has responded to recent redundancies in Upper Bann.&nbsp; <a name=AQO2126/09>(AQO 2126/09)</a></p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning (Sir Reg Empey)</strong>: The Department for Employment and  Learning (DEL) has provided information and advice to people who have been made  redundant in Upper Bann in order that they  might find alternative employment, or identify opportunities to retrain under  the Department&rsquo;s employment training or further education programmes.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">In several cases, local jobs and benefits offices were able  to deliver on-site clinics directly to those who had received notice of  redundancy, including those employed by Moy Park, Huhtamaki, Seagoe  Technologies, R A Irwin and Company, Ulster Weavers, NACCO Materials Handling  Group, and Woolworths in Banbridge. Further clinics have been arranged for  NACCO Materials Handling Group and Henry Denny and Sons.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Savage</strong>:  Does the Minister agree that priority must be given to training &mdash; especially in  Lurgan, Portadown and Banbridge &mdash; that would be likely to promote inward  investment and new business start-ups?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: Recently, I visited the Banbridge jobs and  benefits office, and I saw for myself the situation for unemployed people.  Sadly, very few vacancies were available.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Member is correct, and all indicators and commentators  point to the same thing; we must train people now for the anticipated upturn,  whenever it comes. For many companies, that is easy to say but difficult to  deliver, because they are attempting to conserve cash flow, and training,  maintenance and marketing are the sort of expenditures that get cut back. We  are urging companies to talk to us about those things in order to discover what  we can do to help them, what the colleges can do, and what other arrangements  can be made, particularly for apprentices, who are suffering job losses as a  result of the current cutbacks.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Simpson</strong>:  The Minister has outlined the position with respect to further education  colleges and apprenticeships. In the Upper Bann  constituency, approximately 400 jobs have been lost, and I understand from  phone calls today that more announcements will be made shortly, all of which is  a sad reflection of the economic situation. Will the Minister outline further  the help that his Department can give to companies with respect to  apprenticeships?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: We have been looking closely at the subject of  apprenticeships. Indeed, there is a question further down the list that refers directly  to this subject. We are continuously reviewing the help that we offer. The  situation is not static, and actions that were appropriate in October may not  be appropriate today. Therefore, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment (DETI), my Department and others must respond as flexibly as  possible.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The picture is improving for apprentices, in so far as they  now have several options. We have offered help in several areas, including the  motor industry and the construction industry, in which we were losing  significant numbers of apprenticeships. We are preparing to extend the range of  apprentice categories. Although we began by addressing the areas that are  suffering the greatest losses, they are not necessarily the only ones in which  we will act. If a case can be made for extending the special arrangements for  apprentices to other industries and sectors, I am prepared to consider it.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  Will the Minister agree to review the practice whereby apprentices,  particularly in the construction industry, who are undertaking a one-day-a-week  course and have now been paid off must choose between claiming jobseeker&rsquo;s  allowance and remaining on their course?</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">If an apprentice applies for benefit allowance, he or she  has to resign from his or her course. At this time of the year, some of them  are two or three years into their courses. Will the Minister, therefore, review  the students&rsquo; status and entitlement to benefits and courses?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: There is a menu of options from which individuals  can choose, depending on their age and circumstances. Individuals who are  prepared to join Training for Success can go into an assimilated work  environment; some take up full-time college courses; some are still in  outplacements; and some, depending on age, are still in receipt of benefits.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I will be happy to look at any particular case of which the  Member is aware. Our objective is to ensure that apprentices do not lose out if  they have put work into an apprenticeship. We do not want them to have done two  years&rsquo; work for nothing. If Members find that apprentices are struggling and  that cases are emerging in which people are losing out, I will be happy to look  at them.</p>
        <p class="H5StageHeading">Interpoint: University Site</p>
        <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">2. <strong>Mr  Neeson </strong>asked the Minister for Employment and Learning to provide a  timescale for the development of the university site at Interpoint. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO2127/09>(AQO  2127/09)</a></p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: Recently, the University  of Ulster announced proposals to  relocate some course provision from its Jordanstown site to a redeveloped Belfast campus. I  appreciate that the university has announced proposals for major capital  investment as part of its redevelopment plans. Some of that will require public  funding that has not yet been agreed with my Department, which is considering  the economic appraisal.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Neeson</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his answer. I am disappointed that such an important  facility is moving out of East Antrim, but it  is still an important campus site for the area. Can the Minister assure me that  the university will continue to develop its centre of sporting excellence,  along with other facilities?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: In mid-November, I received a proposal from the University of Ulster. The university has a master plan,  but we received only the part that refers to the Jordanstown campus. I have not  received any proposals in respect of the remaining University of Ulster  campuses. Consequently, there is a process of ensuring that the proposals that  we received match green book standards. Following completion of that process,  the proposals will be sent to the Department of Finance and Personnel for  consideration. If that Department is satisfied, the matter will come back to my  Department for a policy appraisal. However, that has not yet happened.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I understand that the Jordanstown campus is to continue  along the lines that the Member mentioned, but that has not been finalised. The  process is in its early stages, and I am not in a position to be definitive about  where it will take us. The Department will be in a better position to make a  judgement when it receives the entire master plan and is able to see the  overall picture.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Boylan</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Will the Minister clarify whether he  has had any discussions or consultations in relation to the development at the  Interpoint building? How does he feel about the recent media articles on the  proposals? Go raibh maith agat.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: As I said in my response to the Member for East  Antrim Mr Neeson, there was a media announcement, but I have received only the  part of the plan that is relevant to the Jordanstown campus. I have not  received the complete master plan that covers all the campuses of the University of Ulster. We will assess that master plan  on receipt of it.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">We will also have to establish what the capital availability  will be, because, at present, we can consider the plan only in respect of the  current comprehensive spending review period. Work arising from the master plan  will go on for over 20 years, so I have not yet been able to satisfy myself  that we have funding to deal with it. However, we are taking the issue  seriously. There will be a meeting with senior officials from the University of Ulster later this week, which will  enable us to come to terms with the proposals. The Department will give those  proposals a high priority.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>:  Does the Minister agree that the proposed move of a significant number of  faculties from the Jordanstown site by the University of Ulster will constitute  the loss of a neutral site and impact in a detrimental manner on the overall  third-level education package provided in East Antrim? Does he also agree that  the proposed move could have a damaging impact on the critical research and  development potential of the university and the high-tech firms in East Antrim?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: There is no doubt that moving a significant number  of faculties from East Antrim to another site  could create issues for local companies. However, I hope that if the proposals  are agreed, the university would put in place mechanisms to ensure that no  companies in Northern    Ireland or in the environments of its  campuses are disadvantaged, as that would not be in the interest of the  companies or the university. That is one of the issues that we will have to  address when appraising the plans. I cannot pre-empt that process. We must work  through the issues with the university, and that process has not happened yet.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his replies. Is there not a fundamental contradiction  between the University of Ulster proposing to move many of its courses and  students from Jordanstown to Belfast  and its decision to pull out of Springvale?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: The proposal is in the gift of the University of Ulster; it is the university&rsquo;s proposal.  We have received one proposal in respect of the Belfast campus, but we have not received the  total master-planning exercise. It is fair to say that Springvale did not work  out as had been hoped. The Department is conscious of that, and we must be  careful that we do not see any repeat performances. The issue was extremely  sensitive, and many people in west Belfast  were disappointed that that project did not go ahead. However, we are past that  point, and all I can say is that we will be looking at the proposals when we  receive them all. I have no doubt that the proposals will be discussed with the  Committee for Employment and Learning before any decisions are taken.</p>
        <p class="H5StageHeading">Apprentices</p>
        <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">3. <strong>Ms Lo </strong>asked  the Minister for Employment and Learning for an update on his Department&rsquo;s  monitoring exercise on apprentices who have been made redundant, and their  current training provisions. &nbsp; <a name=AQO2128/09>(AQO 2128/09)</a></p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: The Department introduced contingency arrangements  to allow apprentices who were made redundant from the construction, engineering  and motor-vehicle sectors to continue with training, because those were the  sectors most affected by the economic downturn. The Department is also  examining data on other sectors, and as I said to a Member previously, it will  introduce similar arrangements if that is shown to be necessary. Three hundred  and three apprentices were made redundant from those priority-skill areas: 205  in construction, 78 in engineering, and 20 in the motor-vehicle sector.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lo</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his reply. Will the Minister comment on the suggestion  that was put to the Committee for Employment and Learning that given the  downturn, contractors that have been awarded capital projects should be  required to take on a certain number of apprentices?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: Several Members raised that issue. I have been in  touch with the Minister of Finance and Personnel with regard to that because  the Central Procurement Directorate is under his Department&rsquo;s control, and he  is very sympathetic. I believe that such conditions can be applied to contracts  already, although I may be corrected if I am wrong. I am not sure at what point  that compliance has commenced, and I am happy to write to the Member to confirm  those details, but my understanding is that the Department of Finance and  Personnel is agreeable to that process.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his detailed response. The Minister said that 205  apprentices in the construction industry had lost their jobs.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I am concerned about those who have completed two years of  their apprenticeships and who may find themselves with no opportunity to  conclude them. All apprentices are important, but what help can the Minister  give to those particular apprentices?</p>
        <p class="TimePeriod">3.15 pm</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: As the Member points out, those key people are the  focus of our attention, and I will give him some details on what has happened  to the 303 apprentices who have, so far, been made redundant: 157 have been  referred to the Careers Service for advice and further training, they are still  being processed and have not been allocated an alternative; 51 are continuing  their training under Training for Success, which may mean that they are working  in a simulated work environment in a college; 26 are continuing their training  under Steps to Work, which means that they have placements with employers for  one day a week and come into college for four days a week; 43 have found  alternative employment, including continued apprenticeship training or a return  to their previous employer; 16 have entered further education; and the  remaining 10 apprentices have not maintained contacted with the training  supplier.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">A number of apprentices have been dealt with to their  satisfaction, quite a few have found alternative employment, and we are still  processing 157 out of the aforementioned 303.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I am interested the geographical  distribution of apprentices in the construction and engineering sectors. Will  the Minister provide more information on where those apprentices are located?  Will he also tell the House about the fostering programme?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: Dealing with the latter point, Michelin, Northern Ireland  Water, Phoenix Gas and Dale Farm have, so far, agreed to offer a fostering  service, which happens when we cannot place the apprentices in any other  scheme.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I do not have any information on the geographical  distribution to hand, but I am happy to write to the Member with more details.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Question 4 has been withdrawn.</p>
        <p class="H5StageHeading">Jobs and Benefits Offices: Staffing</p>
        <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">5. <strong>Mr Beggs </strong>asked the Minister for Employment and Learning what plans his Department  has to review staffing levels in the Jobs and Benefits Offices. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO2130/09>(AQO  2130/09)</a></p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: My Department has already increased the front line  resources available in the jobs and benefits offices through increasing the  hours of part-time staff, implementing overtime, and recruiting temporary and  permanent staff. At this stage, I have committed to recruiting up to 130  additional front line staff to meet the needs of the rising number of people  claiming unemployment-related benefits. I will continue to review staffing  requirements.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>:  Will the Minister confirm that the current review of the Social Security  Agency, and the handling arrangements for the proposal to remove some staff to  other district offices, is a matter for the Department for Social Development?  Will he continue to ensure the dispersal of his staff in the various offices,  such as those in Larne, Carrickfergus and Newtownabbey,  so that a service can be ensured?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: I am aware that a major reorganisation is going on  in the Social Security Agency, and my Department shares 25 offices with it. As  the Member said, that is a matter for my colleague the Minister for Social Development.  Nevertheless, DEL  staff are not moving from any of the offices that are on its books.  Regrettably, due to present circumstances, it is likely that we will be  increasing the number of staff in those offices over the coming months.  However, we have no plans to move staff from any of the existing offices.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wells</strong>:  The Minister will be aware that there is huge concern throughout the community  regarding the review of staffing in social security offices. I accept that that  does not fall within his bailiwick. Nevertheless, because there is an overlap  in 25 offices, it does concern his Department. Has he met the Minister for  Social Development to discuss that issue and to express his concerns about the  proposals?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: Yes. Senior officials are in constant  communication on the matter because it involves issues about premises.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">For example, staff from the Social Security Agency might  work on the upper floor of an office, while DEL staff work on the lower floor. If they  leave, are we left to pay the bills for the entire office? The consultation  with staff is ongoing, and I have visited a number of offices recently,  including some in the Member&rsquo;s constituency. I recently visited the Social  Security Agency office in Kilkeel. Indeed, a couple of MLAs brought a  significant delegation of staff to the Building, many of whom are based in  Kilkeel, and they told me about their concerns that they might be moved to  Newtownards. I have written to the Minister for Social Development on that  matter, and I am aware of the problem that the Member has raised.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">As I said, it is a matter for the Social Security Agency. I  have also received a letter from Banbridge District Council inviting the  Minister for Social Development and I to appear before it to discuss the issue.  We are not moving any of our staff out of any offices, and the offices will  continue to operate with DEL  staff in them. However, we must have help from the Social Security Agency; when  people enter an office, the first person whom they deal with is a staff member  from the Social Security Agency. Therefore, we must work together very closely.  We are doing so, but the back-office facilities are entirely a matter for the  Minister for Social Development.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">A consultation is ongoing, and many of the concerns that I  have heard &mdash; which are similar to those that the Member has heard &mdash; are being  referred to the Department for Social Development. I am sure that the Minister  for Social Development will deal with them in due course.</p>
        <p class="H5StageHeading">Jobs and Benefits Offices: Flexibility</p>
        <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">6. <strong>Mr  McClarty </strong>asked the Minister for Employment and Learning what plans his  Department has to review the flexibility that staff in the jobs and benefits  offices have when dealing with clients. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO2131/09>(AQO 2131/09)</a></p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: The Department is reviewing, on an ongoing basis,  operational matters in jobs and benefits offices and job centres in response to  demands arising from the economic downturn. That internal review is separate  from the Department for Social Development&rsquo;s strategic business review, to  which I have just referred. Personal advisers already have the flexibility to  alter the frequency of some interviews. Further discretion on the frequency and  duration of interviews is being introduced.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Along with the Social Security Agency, the Department is  implementing rapid reclaim arrangements for clients. Through the Steps to Work  programme, personal advisers have the flexibility to agree a tailored range of  provision for anyone who is unemployed or economically inactive, based on the  needs of the individual.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">To provide our personal advisers with the necessary skills,  we have developed an adviser core skills training programme based on our  training for Pathways to Work personal advisers, which won an award in this  year&rsquo;s national training awards.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McClarty</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his compre&shy;hensive response. Will he confirm whether  the Pathways to Work programme has been successful in encouraging many people  to get off benefits and into work?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: I can confirm that. For Members&rsquo; benefit, the  Pathways to Work programme is aimed at the former incapacity benefit claimant  count, of which there are about 113,000 in Northern Ireland. The last time that  I looked at the figures, approximately 3,000 people had been brought off that  list and into work.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">However, the Member will be aware that, in the current  economic circumstances, it is extremely difficult to find the opportunities  that were once available; things are much more difficult now. The interesting  point about the programme is that it involves staff training that is much more  intensive than the previous training. It involves six interviews with each  client, on a compulsory basis for those who were applying for incapacity  benefit at the time, and on a voluntary basis for those who were already on it.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The programme has been successful in getting people in both  categories back to work, but the fact remains that since the programme was  envisaged a number of years ago, and implemented throughout Northern Ireland  last year, circumstances have radically changed. It is true to say that it is  becoming an uphill struggle. Nevertheless, the principle is a good one, and I  strongly commend the staff for the efforts that they are making.</p>
        <p class="H5StageHeading">Review of Student Fees</p>
        <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">7. <strong>Mr  Elliott </strong>asked the Minister for Employment and Learning for an update on  progress on the review of student fees.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO2132/09>(AQO  2132/09)</a></p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: The review of variable fees and student finance  arrangements is under way.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Northern Ireland  is the first region in the UK  where variable fees apply, and a review of those arrangements has commenced. An  independent research project is considering existing data sources to provide  sound evidence for the review. A stakeholder steering group has been  established, chaired independently by Joanne Stuart. On 11 February 2009, she  briefed the Committee for Employment and Learning on progress. I anticipate  that an interim report will be produced for consideration in May. I will bring  that report before the Committee prior to it going out for public consultation,  which is scheduled for autumn 2009. The final report is expected early in 2010.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his reply. Now that we are ahead of the rest of the UK, what impact will that have on students from Northern Ireland who are studying in other parts  of the United Kingdom?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: It does not have any impact at this stage, but,  clearly, it is one of the factors that must be taken into account. As Members  know, there are a variety of mechanisms for dealing with fees in the United Kingdom.  Scotland  has its own system, and the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills  announced a review of its policy. It made announcements in the summer of 2007,  without consulting us, and it set targets for itself. However, it has had to  retract those targets, because it felt that they were unachievable. Therefore,  there is a danger that those different reviews will get out of kilter, causing  imbalances throughout the United    Kingdom.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">As the review has started and stakeholders are now taking  evidence &mdash; and they will be addressed by the Committee and others &mdash; it is  important that we take into account the current situation and the impact that  it will have. The early signs are encouraging in so far as student numbers  appear to be on the up, including for the current year, but the impact that  current circumstances will have on that remains to be seen.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Maskey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Will the Minister ensure that the  review is completely independent? Why will an interim report be published in  May? The Minister has already told the House that we would have to wait until  there are figures for three years. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: The review is independent. As I said, it is  chaired by Joanne Stuart, who is the chairman of the Institute of Directors.  That stakeholder group includes students, financial advisers to students, as  well as representatives from education and library boards, colleges and  universities. Therefore, a broad spectrum of people is represented on the  group. No one has criticised or complained about the number of people on it, or  about their independence.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I have asked for an interim report in May, but that is all  that it will be. Two years&rsquo; data has already been gathered, and a third year&rsquo;s  data will be available in January 2010. A fellow on the review team is working  on the analysis of that data. However, if any proposals were to emerge from the  review, which would require further public assistance, the Department of  Finance and Personnel would insist on a very rigorous database, and I am  advised that that requires at least three years&rsquo; figures to draw any significant  conclusions. Therefore, we will have the figure for the third year by January  2010.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Newton</strong>:  The Minister will remember that he pleaded with the House in December 2007, for  the sake of a year, to be allowed to carry out the review. He will also  remember that on his last visit to the House, when I asked him when the final  report might be available, he was unable to give a date. The Minister is now  indicating that the report will be available early in 2010. However, when  Joanne Stuart &mdash; to whom the Minister has referred &mdash; appeared before the  Committee on 11 February and was asked when the report would be made available,  she said she could not give a date for the report at that point.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Do I detect a question?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Newton</strong>:  Will the Minister confirm when the report will be available?</p>
        <p class="TimePeriod">3.30 pm</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: I cannot confirm a date, because I am not in  control of that; it is a matter for the independent review. I offer estimates  when Members ask when the report is likely to appear. The Member has asked me  that on a number of occasions. I have not tied the Committee to a particular  date. As the Member knows, when reports come in, they must be assessed by the  Department, and the Committee will want to look at it.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I have indicated to the Member that I will apprise the  Committee quarterly on how things are going and that I expect to receive an  interim report, probably in May 2009. That is at an early stage, and it will be  published just under a year ahead of the final report. It all depends on the  analysis, but I offer an indicative timetable. Throughout the process, I have  said that it would commence in the academic year 2008-09, and that exactly is  what has happened.</p>
        <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="7"></a>Finance And Personnel</p>
        <p class="H4StageHeading">Procurement Task Group</p>
        <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">1. <strong>Mr Weir </strong>asked  the Minister of Finance and Personnel for an update on the work of the  Procurement Task Group.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO2146/09>(AQO  2146/09)</a></p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel (Mr Dodds)</strong>: I announced the establishment of the  construction industry forum procurement task group in my statement to the  Assembly on 15 December 2008. The group held its inaugural meeting on 17  December 2008. It has met on three further occasions, and it will continue to  meet at two-weekly intervals until the end of March 2009.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">A key role of the task group is to monitor and report  progress on projects that are scheduled to go to the marketplace this financial  year. Departments have indicated that more than 60 projects, with an aggregated  value in excess of &pound;400 million, are to be advertised before the end of this  financial year or are already at various stages in the procurement process.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">In addition, Roads Service has already commenced  procurement of the new A5 western transport corridor, which runs from  Aughnacloy to Londonderry, and which has an  estimated contract value of &pound;600 million. As an interim measure, ahead of the  formal launch of the investment strategy website, the Central Procurement  Directorate (CPD) has, on behalf of Departments, provided the construction  industry representatives at the task group with a significant amount of  information on project progress.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: How  will the construction industry be kept up to date on the progress made in  rolling out those projects that are scheduled to come onto the market before  the end of this financial year and in forthcoming financial years?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: The Member raises an important point. Part of the  thinking behind the establishment of the procurement task group was to ensure  close liaison between Government and the construction industry in the private  sector. The construction industry forum is recognised as the appropriate and  established forum for the industry to discuss with Departments and Government  the roll-out of investment strategy projects. The Strategic Investment Board  (SIB) and the Central Procurement Directorate have established a  delivery-tracking system for major investment strategy projects.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">It is also intended that the investment strategy website,  which will be launched, will be of great benefit to the construction industry.  Ahead of the launch of that website, as an interim measure, Departments have,  through the CPD, provided the construction industry with a significant amount  of information about projects that are scheduled to go to the marketplace this  financial year.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Maskey</strong>:  Can the Minister tell us how the procurement task group will promote and access  good social impacts when contracts and work are undertaken in communities,  especially those in social need? Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I thank the Member for his question: the issue has  been raised on a number of occasions. As I have said, the task group has had a  number of meetings already and will meet fortnightly. Its terms of reference,  or principles, include not only delivering best value for money, taking account  of the needs of the local construction industry and keeping bidding cost low,  but delivering sustainable development. It is important that that is taken into  account with respect to the issues the Member has raised. The task group will  take account of it in its deliberations.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">As I have said to the House on several occasions, it is  essential that we ensure that small and medium-sized enterprises &mdash; which are  the vast majority of Northern    Ireland businesses &mdash; have the opportunity to  bid for projects and can compete properly for investment from the investment  strategy.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gardiner</strong>:  Has the Minister made any progress on making Government contracts more  accessible to smaller local companies? When does he envisage acting on that?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: As I said to the House previously, the vast majority  of projects &mdash; indeed all of them if they are categorised as being accessible to  small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) &mdash; are already going to small and  medium-sized enterprises, because the vast majority of companies in Northern  Ireland fall within that category. I assure the Member that that is happening  now; we must ensure that it continues.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Government clients are required to publicly advertise all  construction procurement opportunities estimated to exceed &pound;30,000 for  construction works, and &pound;5,000 for construction related services. As I  explained to the House before, centres of procurement expertise encourage SMEs  to join together as consortia and bid for contracts, or look for opportunities  within the supply chains that will be formed by a successful tenderer. The task  group is developing proposals for promoting equality and sustainable  development through sustainable procurement in construction. All that should  reassure the Member that the issue he raised is being very strongly addressed  as a result of the work that we are carrying out.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Aire as a  fhreagra. I thank the Minister for his answer. Given that processes have been  put in place to improve the procurement procedure and ensure good practice,  will he tell me why there are such long delays in the procurement of major  projects in the education and health sectors?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: We are keen to ensure that the process of working  through procurement is speeded up as quickly as possible. That is why I  announced in my statement to the Assembly in December in relation to the  Department of Education and some of the legal challenges to the frameworks that  those projects would be taken forward outside the framework; in other words,  that there would not be a delay to that. People want to see capital investment  speeded up, and the decision to work outside the framework was deliberately and  specifically made to ensure that there would not be any delay, or any further  delay, to those projects getting started and to work being done under them.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The total value of that work, following the removal of the  framework and proceeding on a project-by-project basis through normal  procurement methods, will be approximately &pound;115 million this year. Between  December and March, a further &pound;400 million will be taken forward into the  marketplace through procurement projects. That brings the total investment &mdash;  whether it be in education, health, roads, housing, and so on &mdash; to over &pound;1&middot;3  billion or &pound;1&middot;4 billion net this year; a considerable advance and increase on  the previous year, and on previous years under direct rule.</p>
        <p class="H5StageHeading">Efficiency Targets</p>
        <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">2. <strong>Lord  Morrow </strong>asked the Minister of Finance and Personnel what progress is being  made by Departments in achieving their efficiency targets.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO2147/09>(AQO 2147/09)</a></p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: As part of the 2007 Budget process, the Executive  unanimously agreed that Northern Ireland Departments would be set a target of  delivering 3% per annum in cash-releasing efficiency savings over the years  2008-09 to 2010-11. That was in the context of the slowdown in public  expenditure growth at the United    Kingdom level, as planned for in the  national comprehensive spending review.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">In order to ensure that sufficient funding is available to  priority front-line services for the people of Northern Ireland, the efficiency  savings programme will release &pound;1&middot;6 billion in resources over the Budget period  to be recycled back into departmental budgets. Primary responsibility for the planning  and the delivery of efficiency savings lies within each Department with each  individual Minister. The Department of Finance and Personnel&rsquo;s (DFP) role is to  monitor progress. The latest assessment by officials is that although good  progress has been made in meeting the 3% target, there is concern at the delay  in publishing efficiency delivery plans and about the level of detail provided  in some cases.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his reply; however, I want to hear from him further.  In his pre-Budget report, the Chancellor announced plans for further cuts in  2010-11 of approximately &pound;5 billion. I would like to hear the Minister&rsquo;s  assessment of how that will impact on Northern Ireland.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I thank the Member for his question, because he  raises an important issue, which I flagged up in last week&rsquo;s debates.  Discussion on that took place with the Scottish and Welsh Governments and  others at the British-Irish Council meeting in Cardiff last Friday. The issue affects all  Whitehall Departments, but it also affects all of the devolved Administrations  because it is, as the Chancellor of the Exchequer has indicated, a UK-wide  efficiency-savings target.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Of course, he describes them as efficiency savings, but the  difference, I think, is this: true efficiency savings release money to be  recycled and put back into budgets; what we appear to be hearing from the  Chancellor of the Exchequer are so-called efficiency savings that will not be  recycled back into spending plans. That is a very serious situation. That is an  issue on which, as I have indicated, we will fight with regard to its impact on  Northern Ireland.  The Assembly and the Executive were given a settlement under the comprehensive  spending review of 2007, and it is completely wrong and unjust that that level  of funding should be reduced at this time.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">As I have already flagged up, that is a serious issue,  because there is a clamour in Whitehall,  by not just the Government but by the Opposition as well, as to which of them  can cut deeper with so-called efficiencies and when that should happen, and not  in just 2010-11. Indeed, the Opposition at Westminster has said that the cuts should  happen from this April. One can imagine the impact that such cuts would have on  the Budget of Northern Ireland without any preparation or time even to plan for  that. Therefore, the situation is serious, and we are actively resisting it,  along with the devolved Administrations of Scotland and Wales.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>:  At the time of the last report, the only Department that had failed to submit  its efficiency plan was the Office of the First Minister and deputy First  Minister (OFMDFM). Did the Minister seek an explanation for that failure? If  so, what was that explanation, and has that efficiency plan yet been produced?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: In my answer, I drew attention to the delay in  publishing efficiency delivery plans and to the level of detail. Further work  will be required by Departments to provide assurance to the Assembly and to the  wider public that those efficiency savings are being made, because it must be  remembered that the money is already allocated in budgets.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Member mentioned OFMDFM. It should also be mentioned  that the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety published its  efficiency delivery programme at only the start of October, and the Department  of Education published only a summary at the start of November. Four  Departments &mdash; the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure, the Department of  Education, the Department of the Environment and the Department for Social  Development &mdash; have published only summaries of their plans. Therefore, this is  an issue in which all of those Departments are required to come forward with  more transparency and more detail on those matters. I thank the Member for  raising the issue, and he may wish to have a word with his ministerial party  colleague on that issue.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: In  light of the comments that have been made from all quarters of the House &mdash;  including those from members of the Minister&rsquo;s party &mdash; and the inability of  some Ministers to make proper efficiency savings rather than cuts, does the  Minister feel that lessons are to be learned at an Executive level about giving  guidance to Departments about what is meant by efficiency savings?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: The Member raises a good point, because each  Minister on the Executive agreed to the 3% efficiency targets overall and in  their own Departments. Therefore, in developing those plans, it is essential  that the impact on front line services is minimised, because the whole purpose  of the efficiency savings is to maintain front line services and to reduce  costs in the system so that the front line services can still be delivered, but  more efficiently. Therefore, it is absolutely right to draw attention to the  fact that Assembly Members and Committees will, no doubt, be seeking clear  guidance and information from Ministers that the efficiency cuts &mdash; to which  Ministers agreed &mdash; are implemented without the crude approach of cutting front  line services, which is not the real purpose of efficiency savings.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Obviously, the Assembly had a debate on the matter earlier  which highlighted some of those issues. I hope that that will be productive.</p>
        <p class="TimePeriod">3.45 pm</p>
        <p class="H5StageHeading">Treasury Financial Reporting Manual</p>
        <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">3. <strong>Mr  McLaughlin </strong>asked the Minister of Finance and Personnel to detail the  reasons why current regulations, as set out in the Treasury Financial Reporting  Manual, could not be changed, even on a temporary basis, to facilitate a proposal  by the Quarry Products Association Northern Ireland to offset job losses.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO2148/09>(AQO 2148/09)</a></p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: The rules are in place to ensure that Departments  are open and accountable to the Assembly and the taxpayer about how money is  spent. One key principle in preserving that transparency is to match reporting  of expenditure with the year in which the activity took place. To change the  rules in order to manipulate the timing of public expenditure, even with the  best of intentions, is not only wrong but, in fact, contrary to statute and  therefore illegal. It would, undoubtedly, result in criticism from the Northern  Ireland Audit Office.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McLaughlin</strong>:  I thank the Minister for that answer. I recognise that he has given much  careful consideration to this proposition and others in order to enable the  Executive to come forward with initiatives to help to tackle the economic  downturn.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Although I recognise that this proposition perhaps came too  late in the financial year to permit the Minister to respond in the way in  which he might otherwise have wished to do so, it was novel because that local  industry offered to do work in the here and now, as it were, but apply for  payment in the year in which payments were scheduled initially under the Budget  arrangements.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Minister consider whether that action might be  deemed worthwhile by the other regional Assemblies, so that a co-ordinated  approach could be taken to urge the Prime Minister to determine whether accrual  regulations and statutory obligations could either be relaxed or changed in  order to permit that to happen? Its benefit would be that a hole would not be  created in future Budget years.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I am grateful to the Chairman of the Committee for  Finance and Personnel for his comments. On 22 January, I met Gordon Best and  his group. We had a fairly thorough discussion on the matter. I must say that,  as a layman, I am entirely sympathetic.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">As the Member said, that part of the construction industry  has turned its attention to how it can get things done and try to solve  problems. I understand where it comes from, sympathise with it and applaud it  for looking at innovative ways to try to deal with those problems. Unfortunately,  its proposal is prevented by the reasons that I have outlined &mdash; not least of  which is that it is enshrined in statute in the Government Resources and  Accounts Act (Northern Ireland)  2001, which requires Departments and public bodies to prepare accounts in  accordance with United    Kingdom accounting standards. Indeed, the  Treasury follows the same accounting conventions.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, there are practical, legal and other  difficulties in doing what the Quarry Products Association has asked. To take  that approach to change would present big difficulties, not least because it  would change the entire way in which accounting is done at central level by the  Treasury. However, that does not deter me from looking at ways in which a case  for that could be advanced.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I met the Quarry Products Association to discuss other ways  to try to ensure that there is some certainty about money coming forward. I  have liaised with the Department for Regional Development on issues that could  help the industry in the new financial year. I am always open to new and novel  ideas. If there is a way to make them work for the good of people of Northern Ireland  and to create construction jobs, I am willing to listen to them.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  Obviously, the question resonates with road contractors and, I suspect, with  many others. I appreciate the Minister&rsquo;s genuine sympathy in the circumstances  in which he finds himself. However, I support the Finance Committee&rsquo;s Chairman  in pressing this question.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Does the Minister agree that there is an anomaly here and  that continuity in a contract is important, not least to prevent layoffs in the  current circumstances? Can he move to set in place guidelines to offset such  anomalies?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I have much sympathy with the industry on the matter  &mdash; in which all sections of the House have common cause. Ultimately, we should  not allow some accounting procedure to get in the way of rolling money out  where we can.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">It must be recognised that it is more than that in this  case. There is a statutory and legal requirement, which is an impenetrable  barrier. However, I fully accept where Members are coming from on this issue.  If there is something that can be done to help people at a difficult time that  is outwith a dry rule, we will take that action if at all possible. I explored  the matter in considerable detail with officials, and I will undoubtedly return  to it in discussions with the Treasury.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dallat</strong>: I  have listened very carefully to the Minister. I understand the burdens of  finance in the Assembly, and my idea is not new or novel. Does the Minister  agree that there is a serious problem in how we handle roads maintenance,  particularly at the end of the financial year when we depend on the whims of  additional money?</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Roads maintenance is not just about maintaining the roads;  it concerns road safety and people&rsquo;s lives. Therefore, has the Minister given  any thought to how a better system could evolve, rather than Roads Service  having to rush around and spend money in March that it may not have been aware  that it had?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I recognise the importance of investment in our road  infrastructure. It is worth bearing in mind that the Budget settlement over  this three-year period substantially increases capital investment in roads.  There has been a 41&middot;4% increase in capital investment in roads in 2008-9; &pound;177  million has been invested in 2008-09 compared to the &pound;103 million that was  invested under direct rule in 2007-08. That is a massive increase in capital  investment.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">There has also been a substantial investment in roads  maintenance, and it is essentially for the Minister for Regional Development to  allocate the budget that he is given. I appreciate what the Member says about  in-year allocations and so on, but there are always competing priorities. The  Minister who is responsible for roads will argue that roads maintenance is a  good way of giving work to the construction industry. However, there are also  cries &mdash; from quarters with which Members are familiar &mdash; that money should be  given to health, social housing and so on.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Member will understand those pressures. He is putting  forward the case for investment in roads, but other members of his party will  probably disagree and say that housing is the priority, and others will say something  different. I entirely understand the Member&rsquo;s view, but the level of investment  that we are making indicates the importance that we place on this subject.</p>
        <p class="H5StageHeading">Statement of Rate Levy and &nbsp;Collection 2006-07</p>
        <p class="OralWrittenQuestion" style="margin-top:4.25pt;">4. <strong>Mr Beggs </strong>asked the Minister of Finance and Personnel what action  his Department has taken to implement the recommendations in the Public  Accounts Committee Report on the Statement of Rate Levy and Collection 2006-07.  <a name=AQO2149/09>(AQO 2149/09)</a></p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName" style="margin-top:4.25pt;"><strong>The Minister of Finance and Personnel</strong>: Many of the recommendations  will be implemented through a full review of the financial aspects of the  rate-collection IT system, which is making solid progress in Land and Property  Services. That will result in a shadow accruals account being prepared for rate  collection in 2008-09, although the cash statement of account will remain the  principal account statement for this year.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText" style="margin-top:4.25pt;">System-validation controls are  also being further reviewed, and appropriate targets for agency performance are  being set in the 2009-2010 business-planning process. NI Direct now provides  the first-line telephone contact for rate-collection activities in Land and  Property Services, and plans are well advanced to ensure that there is  sufficient capacity for calls after the 2009-2010 rates bill issue in early  April. The Committee for Finance and Personnel has requested a quarterly update  on progress, and the first of those will be provided at the end of April.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName" style="margin-top:4.25pt;"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: Local councils have been through a very difficult rates  process recently, and, indeed, I declare an interest as a local councillor.  There were huge fluctuations in the burdens placed on local councils due to  inaccuracies or changes in the calculations of the penny product that were made  by Land and Property Services (LBS). Will the Minister explain why, some two  months after local councils advised of a considerable number of properties that  were incorrectly listed as vacant, bills have not been issued and the penny  product has not been adjusted accordingly?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName" style="margin-top:4.25pt;"><strong>The Minister of Finance and Personnel</strong>: I am grateful to the Member.  He and other Members have raised this matter previously. I have explained the  situation to him, and he will no doubt welcome the progress that has been made  in relation to vacancies. To date, just over 50,000 inspection forms have been  returned by local councils, and there is now good co-operation between local  councils and LPS. I think that everyone recognises the importance of that.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText" style="margin-top:4.25pt;">Of the 50,000 inspection forms  that have been returned, 13,000 confirmed the property as vacant; 3,500  contained the full information that is necessary in order to issue a bill;  6,500 required follow-up action, such as valuation adjustment; and 27,000  required further information, such as the correct person to whom to send the  bill, before a bill could be issued.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText" style="margin-top:4.25pt;">A massive number of inspections  has been carried out. In most cases, further work is required before a bill can  be issued. However, that essential work is progressing. The Member will be  aware that vacant properties will be rateable in future anyway. Furthermore, he  will be aware of the Department&rsquo;s announcement in early January on help to  district councils and the freeze on the regional-rate element of the household  rates bill. The help that we gave to councils will be, and has been,  considerably helpful in minimising the arrears burden at council level across Northern Ireland.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName" style="margin-top:4.25pt;"><strong>Mr Craig</strong>: Will the Minister outline what actions he has taken to  improve the level of customer care in Land and Property Services, an area in  which it has, unfortunately, been found wanting?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName" style="margin-top:4.25pt;"><strong>The Minister of Finance and Personnel</strong>: I agree that there have been  clear cases of lapses, which must be recognised and addressed. For me, it is  essential that the public enjoy a proper and good experience when they contact  LPS or any part of Government. As I said in my answer, LPS now uses NI Direct  for first-line telephone handling, and backlogs have been reduced  substantially. Service levels must reach a point at which people who contact  LPS through correspondence or by telephone have confidence and an assurance  that they are dealing with a professional and competent organisation.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText" style="margin-top:4.25pt;">I am determined to ensure that  ratepayers and the people of Northern    Ireland have such an experience. It is  simply not good enough that people continue to report problems or difficulties,  and it is the Government&rsquo;s job to ensure that all Departments and agencies for  which we are responsible are doing their jobs effectively and properly. Good  improvements have been made. We know of the legacy issue about the amount of  work that was transferred to LPS at the one time, but it is time for LPS to  perform to the standard that customers, rightly, expect.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName" style="margin-top:4.25pt;"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>: I want to ask the Minister about the significant  problem of rate arrears. Does he agree that there is room for improvement,  particularly for individuals or property owners who have fallen well behind in  their arrears? At the same time, people who pay their rates one day late are  penalised by losing their discounts. Therefore, there seems to be  inconsistency. Has any progress been made on addressing those problems?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName" style="margin-top:4.25pt;"><strong>The Minister of Finance and Personnel</strong>: The issue of arrears has  been raised many times in the House, and I agree with the Member&rsquo;s comments.  Last year, the figure for rate arrears was approximately &pound;124 million, and I am  determined to tackle that issue and ensure that that figure is not repeated. It  is essential that we bring that money in. It should be borne in mind that the  effect on councils is realised only when any arrears are eventually written  off. In any business or Government there will be always be a certain amount  that cannot be recovered. However, it is right and proper that rate arrears  should be brought in as quickly as possible.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">We must recognise that, because of the economic downturn  and the difficulty that people are experiencing in paying household bills, LPS  is finding it more difficult to recover rate arrears this year. I am sure that  Members will have encountered some cases of hardship in their constituencies  and in advice centres. We must recognise that, although we want to ensure that  money that is owed to the Government is paid, that some people are finding it more  difficult to pay bills this year. As a result, we must be careful. That tension  exists, but we must do everything possible to reduce the arrears bill.</p>
        <p class="H5StageHeading">Senior Civil Servants: Bonus Scheme</p>
        <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">5. <strong>Mr  Attwood </strong>asked the Minister of Finance and Personnel for his assessment of  the bonus scheme for senior civil servants.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO2150/09><a name=AQO2150/09>(AQO  2150/09)<a/></a></p>
        <p class="TimePeriod">4.00 pm</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: The bonus scheme for senior civil servants in the  Northern Ireland Civil Service is based on the pay strategy across GB  Departments. That in turn is informed by the independent annual report of the  Senior Salaries Review Body, which makes recommendations on the total senior  civil service pay bill and, within that, what proportion of the pay bill should  be paid as non-consolidated bonuses as opposed to consolidated pay rises.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">In January 2009, Sir David Normington published a report  commissioned by the Cabinet Office. I am analysing that report, along with my  officials, and I intend to make further comment in due course.</p>
