    <p class="H2DocumentStartTime">The Assembly met at 10.30 am (Mr Speaker in the  Chair).</p>
    <p class="H2DocumentStartTime">Members observed two minutes&rsquo; silence.</p>
    <p class="H3SubHeading"><a name="a1"></a>Assembly Business</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Speaker. I want to raise the issue of a priority  written question on the Northern Ireland Memorial Fund. I lodged that question  on Tuesday 13 June, and it was due to be answered on Thursday 16 June. I have  still not received an answer to that question. It is an urgent matter, because  the memorial fund, as you know, Mr Speaker, is very important to victims in our  society. There are 1,700 applications awaiting payment, and money has still not  been paid to the Northern Ireland Memorial Fund.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">It is regrettable that this question has not yet been  answered, and I ask you to ask the Office of the First Minister and deputy  First Minister to urgently reply to this very important question.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I thank the Member for his point of order. He now has it on the record, and I  will follow the situation up for him.</p>
		<p class="H3SubHeading"><a name="a2"></a>Matters of the Day</p>
		<p class="H4StageHeading">Attack on the Short Strand  Area</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Mr Alex Maskey has sought leave to make a statement on the attack on the Short  Strand area, which fulfils the criteria set out in Standing Order 24. I will  call Mr Maskey to speak for up to three minutes on the subject. I will then  call representatives from the other parties, as agreed with the Whips. Those  Members will also have up to three minutes in which to speak on the matter.  Members know that the convention is that there is no opportunity for  interventions or a vote on the matter. I will not take any points of order  until this matter is dealt with. If that is clear, we shall proceed.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maskey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. It was with great reluctance that I  sought leave to raise this matter this morning, but I thought that, given the  considerable media attention to it, it is important that we not only try to set  the record straight, which I do not intend to take up a great amount of time in  doing, but show a sign of leadership from this House to the people of the Short  Strand and the surrounding area of the Newtownards Road and elsewhere in east  Belfast.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">I want to place it on the record that it is absolutely  atrocious for any family&rsquo;s home in this city in this day and age to come under  attack, no matter what side of the community they are from. We all know that  east Belfast  has been euphemistically described as an interface area over a long number of  years. Communities there have suffered greatly over a long number of years. We  had hoped that that was part of our history.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">I want to place on record my commendation of those from the  Short Strand and surrounding unionist and loyalist communities who have worked  tirelessly, especially in recent years &mdash; even more so in the past two years &mdash;  and whose efforts have greatly reduced the problems at that interface location.  I want to place on record my gratitude, and that of the communities in that  area, to those people, for the most part from working-class communities, who  have stood shoulder to shoulder, crossed the barriers and boundaries, and  worked with each other to reduce the tensions in that area. They have very  significantly reduced those tensions and built very strong and solid community  relations, which we are all aspiring to achieve, sometimes against the odds.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">It is probably fair to say that, although there is an  ongoing problem for some residents in those communities, that problem has  nevertheless been substantially reduced to perhaps more antisocial rioting or  sectarian skirmishing, which has not been that serious in recent times. All  credit is due to the people from those interface areas who have been working  together and crossing boundaries to tackle that problem.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">It is atrocious in this day and age that families are left  to try to defend their homes. If you go to Strand Walk this morning, you will  notice a number of pensioners&rsquo; bungalows that have been repeatedly attacked  over the years. Virtually all their windows are grilled, and those not grilled,  because people had a little confidence instilled in the past couple of years,  are smashed, paint-bombed and attacked. The place is like a war zone, as I  think I heard someone say earlier.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">My concern is that if people from any community, or any  political or other sphere, try to present the problem that occurred last night  as just six of one and half a dozen of the other, they are wrong. There was a  UVF-related attack on the Short Strand community last night. All those with any  authority or influence understand that. I am calling on everyone with influence  in that area to bring it to bear, identify and tackle the problem, and bring it  to an end for all the people who live in those communities.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Douglas</strong>:  Yesterday morning, like most in the House, I felt elated after witnessing the  amazing feat of Rory McIlroy. What an ambassador for Northern Ireland, I thought. This  morning, I feel sad and dejected after witnessing some of the most vicious  rioting that I have seen for many years. I spoke to some residents this  morning, and they said that some of the rioting was the worst it has been since  1969.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">The sight of homes wrecked on both sides of the Newtownards Road  and Short Strand, and people lying injured in hospital this morning, is a sad  reminder of how fragile the peace is in east Belfast. We want to convey our thoughts and  prayers to those lying in hospital.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">I was down in the area last night after having been in the  Assembly until 9.30 pm. I went to some of the homes that had been attacked in Duke Street and on  the Newtownards Road.  I was there this morning and, as the Member said, there were houses on Strand  Walk that had been attacked. So both communities suffered.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">It reminds me of the proverb, &ldquo;Hope deferred maketh the  heart sick&rdquo;. When I was there last night, I felt that all our hopes to get  peace embedded in local communities had, in many ways, been placed on hold. I  felt sick in the heart, and I feel sick this morning.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Today is not the time for recriminations or &ldquo;whataboutery&rdquo;.  It is a very tense situation down there, and we all need to take heed of our  words because the danger is that we go on various shows and inflame the  situation. We must all redouble our efforts to deal with the underlying issues  that fester in those communities. I can honestly say that issues have been  festering there for a number of weeks, and, although there was trouble the  previous night, last night was the culmination of a number of underlying issues  in the area.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">As an Assembly, we need to ensure that we use our mandate  effectively in the House and that we are careful not to take for granted the  hard work that is going on at those interfaces. I concur with the Member; great  work has been done there over the years. I was involved with the first  interface group there many years ago, and that became a model of good practice  right across Belfast.  I think that it was one of the first interface groups. However, sadly, for one  reason or another, relationships have broken down. We need to start rebuilding  those relationships. There is an anger, a hurt and a seething in the area this  morning, in both communities, and we need to take the lead, as the Member said.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Coming from a community background, I know all too well the  importance of the hard work that goes on on the ground.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Douglas</strong>:  We need to support the people who are building the peace in the area.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Copeland</strong>:  I thank Mr Maskey and Mr Douglas for their measured remarks. I, too, was in the  Chamber until after 9.30 pm yesterday, in the company of Mr Douglas, Mr McCann  and a number of others, discussing the issue of mortgage relief. Real issues  for real people &mdash; what this place is supposed to be about. On leaving, I was  advised by a member of the PSNI that there were difficulties at the bottom of  the Newtownards Road,  and my phone lit up like a Christmas tree as I left the Building. I travelled  there and saw scenes that I had thought, hoped and prayed I would never have to  see again.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">I understand that there were two distinct incidents. One  happened earlier on in the evening on the Albertbridge Road, which, at the time, I  did not know about. The scenes at the bottom of the Newtownards Road descended from stone  throwing and communal violence to petrol bombs going both ways and to gunfire,  which went both ways. There is one community with two sections down there, and  it is broken, hurt and damaged this morning. There is resentment, a silent cry  for help and the belief that no one cares or that no one can actually do  anything to change or prevent a course of events.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">It is my intention to seek a meeting with the Lord Mayor of  Belfast at the  earliest possible moment to see what he and I can do together. I spoke to  Conall McDevitt, who was on the opposite side of a fence yesterday evening. Our  one community, which shares in equal measure exclusion, economic  underachievement, failures in education and infrastructural difficulties, was  evidencing ancient hatreds that have no honest and real place in the place that  we wish to build for all of us in here.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">There are raw memories. I spoke this morning with Mary  McCurrie. Forty-one years ago this weekend, her husband was killed in events  that were not that dissimilar to what we saw yesterday evening. There is a  salutary lesson for everyone in here. We must watch what we say and do, lest it  be misinterpreted. There are no two sides to this. There is only one side, and  that is the side of right. The side of right will always be mirrored by the  side of wrong.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">I left the scene shortly before 2.30 am, and I was back  there this morning, having witnessed the strength and resilience of our people  in the form of the Belfast City Council cleansing department, which had the Newtownards Road  open for traffic and the side streets cleaned. I saw families moving back into  homes that are seriously damaged. I apologise that I saw only homes on the Newtownards Road  because I did not have access to Strand Walk. I spoke to representatives of  housing associations, who did not know where they were going to find the money  to fix the broken windows, and I thought to myself, &ldquo;Where will we find the  money to fix the broken children?&rdquo; The children who saw the streets that they  play in, were brought up in and live in, and with which they identify &mdash;</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I remind the Member of the time.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Copeland</strong>:  I appreciate your forbearance, thank you.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  Like colleagues, I arrived in the Short Strand, in St Matthew&rsquo;s Court, just  before 10.00 pm last night. The scene that I was confronted with is not one  that any of us in the House would have ever wished to see again. A very  dangerous full-scale riot was happening, and in the front line of that riot was  a row of pensioners&rsquo; cottages and a chapel, which had been turned into a buffer  zone between an orchestrated &mdash; I agree that it was orchestrated &mdash; and serious  attempt to attack a community in the Short Strand and the retaliation from  within that community. It was a reminder of everything that we have worked so  hard to try to put behind us. We must accept it as a collective failure. It is  not good enough to try to reduce the issues at the heart of what is still  happening in some communities to being the responsibility of a few. It is the  responsibility of us all.</p>
		<p class="TimePeriod">10.45 am</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">In the short term, we will have to hold the PSNI to a  higher standard of protection. The sad reality of the situation as it unfolded  last night was not one of preparedness but of unpreparedness on the PSNI side.  A situation was able to develop because of a lack of resources in the area to  try to contain it. However, we cannot police this problem out. We can build out  of this problem only through the good work and relationships that still exist.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">If there is an upside to all this, it is that people kept  talking all night. Those people have been much more involved for much longer than  I have been and have a much greater local connection with both sides of that  community. The House is going to have to start reflecting on the need to build  respect and tolerance in order to build true reconciliation. We are going to  have to start building a better future for the several hundred young people who  saw an opportunity to engage in violence last night. I hope that they never get  such an opportunity again.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Again in the short term, there is a great duty on us all to  behave in a way that ensures that this particular episode goes down as an  exception this summer; that it is not allowed to set the tone; that it does not  become the norm; and that we resolve collectively and resolutely to understand  that the responsibility goes all the way to the top. We must start to put the  need for reconciliation and respect at the heart of everything that we do.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lyttle</strong>:  Having stood here yesterday to celebrate all that is positive about Northern Ireland,  I share the sadness and dejection of my colleagues at the events of last night.  I commit myself and my party to working with and supporting Members in every  way to ensure that the situation is resolved. I recall working with Members as  a volunteer interface worker in the area in times gone by. I hoped that the situation  had been improved.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">I use this platform to ask those involved in last night&rsquo;s  senseless violence to stop. Such organised and orchestrated violence is  unjustifiable and unrepresentative. It is destroying the cross-community  peace-building and community development work that has happened in the area. It  is completely wrong that people there should be living in fear and terror at  the hands of a small minority at the moment.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">I ask anyone with any information to help the police so  that they can respond more effectively to what is a dangerous situation. I want  especially to mention the council and emergency services personnel who had to  deal with an extremely volatile situation. My thoughts and those of my party go  out to those who were injured last night, and I call on political  representatives to take a united stand against all forms of intimidation and  violence in the area.</p>
		<p class="H3SubHeading"><a name="a3"></a>Ministerial Statement</p>
		<p class="H4StageHeading">North/South Ministerial Council: Plenary Format</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I have received notice from the Office of the First Minister and deputy First  Minister (OFMDFM) that the deputy First Minister wishes to make a statement.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr M McGuinness  (The deputy First Minister)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle.  Before I make the statement, I want to say that I have been notified by my  office that a complaint was made in the Assembly by Assemblyman Campbell about  my inadvertently walking across a Member as he was speaking, albeit at a lower  level, so I apologise for that to the Assembly.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">In compliance with section 52(c)(2) of the Northern Ireland  Act 1998, we wish to make the following statement on the twelfth meeting of the  North/South Ministerial Council (NSMC) in plenary format, which was held in  Dublin on Friday 10 June 2011. The Ministers who attended the meeting have approved  this report, and we make it on their behalf.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Our delegation was led by the First Minister, Peter  Robinson MLA, and me. In addition, the following Ministers were in attendance:  Minister Attwood, Minister Farry, Minister Kennedy, Minister McCausland, Minister  N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n, Minister O&rsquo;Dowd, Minister O&rsquo;Neill, Minister Wilson, junior Minister  Anderson and junior Minister Bell.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">The Irish Government delegation was led by the Taoiseach,  Enda Kenny TD. The following Irish Ministers were also in attendance: Minister  Bruton, Minister Burton, Minister Coveney, Minister Deenihan, Minister  Fitzgerald, Minister Hogan, Minister Howlin, Minister Noonan, Minister Quinn,  Minister Rabbitte, Minister Reilly and Minister Varadkar.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">The meeting provided the new Irish Government and our new  Executive with the opportunity to meet for the first time and exchange views on  issues of mutual interest and concern. In their opening discussion Ministers  discussed common challenges, and they shared views on the economy, fiscal  issues, the banks and the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA). With  constraints on budgets in both jurisdictions, the advantages of practical  co-operation and the need to identify potential cost savings through working  together were recognised. Discussions between Finance Ministers will continue,  and they will report to the next plenary meeting in November.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Ministers welcomed increasing collaboration in the field of  innovation in the European Union and noted that a conference on innovation  aimed at increasing collaboration in the European framework programmes will be  held in Belfast  on 30 June, attended by Ministers from both jurisdictions. They noted that such  collaboration can lead to tangible mutual benefits. The Council welcomed the  confirmation of support in both jurisdictions for the development of a  satellite radiotherapy service at Altnagelvin.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Ministers noted the progress report on NSMC meetings since  May 2007. They also noted the mutually beneficial co-operation of the  North/South implementation bodies and Tourism Ireland, and in other NSMC areas,  including the fact that, during 2010, over 150 companies initiated  InterTradeIreland trade or innovation projects, of which 22 companies are  first-time exporters and 12 are first-time innovators. InterTradeIreland&rsquo;s average  return on investment across its portfolio of trade and innovation programmes  was on target for 2010. Through InterTradeIreland&rsquo;s activities, in 2010, 94 new  jobs were reported by companies participating in the programmes.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Waterways Ireland  will host a meeting in Enniskillen from 13 to 16 September for its 17 partners  from 13 countries in an INTERREG IVc project entitled Waterways Forward.  Tourism Ireland&rsquo;s aim in  2011 is to return to growth in overseas visitors to the island from all  markets, with a particular focus on the GB market, which remains the most  important overseas tourist market for the island of Ireland.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Co-operation on the implementation of rural development  programmes and EU programmes has been a high priority. There has been  increasing success in supporting access to EU funding for cross-border and  cross-community rural development projects, such as the &pound;1&middot;3m INTERREG IVa  project between Newry and Mourne District Council, Monaghan County Council and  Monaghan County Enterprise Board to develop tourism and enterprise  infrastructure across the Monaghan and south Armagh region.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">An all-island freight forum has been established whose work  is industry-led and issue-based; it is being taken forward by working groups  focusing on competitiveness and sustainability; safe, compliant and  eco-efficient road freight transport; rail freight and other alternatives;  international connectivity; and data and network management. An additional stop  on the Enterprise train service at Lisburn and a  new Newry to Dublin  early-morning direct service have been introduced. The two railway companies  are planning measures that will be taken forward over the coming 18 months to  align with suggestions made in the Enterprise  rail seminar report.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Ministers noted that the boards of the North/South  implementation bodies and Tourism Ireland are due for renewal in  December and that nominations for appointment will be brought forward for  approval at the NSMC plenary meeting in November.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Ministers noted the progress on the A5 north-west gateway  to Aughnacloy and the A8 Belfast to Larne projects and agreed that payment of  &pound;11 million will be made by the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to  the NI Consolidated Fund. The Council welcomed the continued commitment of the  Irish Government to the funding of those projects and agreed to consider a  further progress report at the next NSMC plenary meeting.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Ministers noted proposals relating to terms of reference  one, which were prepared by the St Andrews Agreement review group arising from  consultation on recommendations in a report that was prepared by expert  advisers to the review group. They agreed that those will be forwarded, along  with a copy of the report, for consideration by Ministers in the new Executive  and in the Irish Government with responsibilities for North/South bodies, and  by Finance Ministers. Taking account of those considerations, the NSMC joint  secretariat will make recommendations to finalise that element of the review at  the NSMC plenary meeting in November. Ministers further agreed that terms of  reference two and three of the St Andrews  review will also be discussed at that meeting.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Ministers noted the background and recent developments on  the North/South consultative forum and agreed to finalise deliberations on this  issue at the plenary meeting in November.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Ministers noted that, following a North/South parliamentary  forum conference in Newcastle  on 7 and 8 October 2010, the Ceann Comhairle of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and the Speaker of  the Assembly asked the working groups that were established in each institution  to take forward discussions on the North/South parliamentary forum. They also  asked the working groups to discuss a further conference, an inaugural meeting  and other ideas that were suggested at the conference and to work jointly,  taking into account the valuable contribution that the conference has made to a  better understanding of key issues of interest and concern to Members of our  Assembly and the Houses of the Oireachtas. Ministers further noted the  intention of the Ceann Comhairle and the Speaker to hold a joint meeting of the  working groups in Dublin  on 23 June.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Ministers noted that the NSMC joint secretariat has taken  forward further work on cross-border mobility issues and that a bid for further  funding will be made to INTERREG IVa for the Border People website. That bid,  which has support in principle from the Social Security Agency, the Department  of Social Protection and the NSMC joint secretariat, will include a bid for  funding for a network of advisers from existing organisations to deal with  complex cross-border welfare and taxation issues.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Ministers approved the appointment of Mr Ian Crozier to the  post of chief executive of the Ulster-Scots Agency.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Ministers approved a schedule of NSMC meetings proposed by  the joint secretariat, noting that the NSMC joint secretariat, in consultation  with relevant Departments, will make arrangements for dates for each of those  meetings. They noted that future NSMC plenary meetings will be held in the  second week of June and the third week of November. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott (The  Chairperson of the Committee for the Office of the First Minister and deputy  First Minister)</strong>: I thank the deputy First Minister for that report. I note  that there is a small section on financial difficulties, particularly in the Republic of Ireland. I am conscious of recent  speculation and reports about the consolidation of financial institutions. Was  there discussion about consolidating financial institutions? What impact would  that have on the Northern Ireland banking fraternity and those banks that are  directly affected by those that may be consolidated in the Republic of Ireland?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr M McGuinness</strong>:  A discussion on the economics of where we are all at ensued during the meeting.  Yesterday, at the British-Irish Council meeting, the Taoiseach, Enda Kenny,  made it clear that banking was undergoing huge change in the South as a result  of the recent crisis that has plunged many businesses and others in the South  into very deep trouble. Our discussions mostly related to how the situation in  the banks would affect banking North and South of the border and also NAMA, which  is a big concern for us.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">We highlighted our concerns about access to lending,  especially to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and about the  potential impact of bank restructuring on jobs in the North.</p>
		<p class="TimePeriod">11.00 am</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">We raised concerns that decisions being taken on NAMA  should not damage our business interests. It was very sad that, on the day that  we were there, the death of Brian Lenihan was announced. Our Finance Minister  had been involved in an ongoing engagement with Brian to try to ensure that any  decisions that were taken on NAMA would not detrimentally affect our situation  in the North, particularly in the context of some speculation that we could end  up with a fire sale, which would be very destabilising for our economic  circumstances. Brian Lenihan was always willing to reassure us that he would  not allow that to happen.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">We highlighted the impact on trading companies that are  servicing their loans when companies and loans are taken into NAMA, and we also  pressed for more effective input by us into decisions on NAMA. On the disposal  of assets, we said that some developers, especially those who are close to  assets that are in NAMA, are keen to get them but that the decision-making  process is very slow.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Our Finance Minister, Sammy Wilson, also met separately the  Irish Government Finance Minister, Michael Noonan, and their Minister for  Public Expenditure and Reform, Brendan Howlin, immediately after the plenary to  discuss those issues in more depth. I understand that officials from the two  Finance Departments will meet again to explore those issues further. There is  obviously big change coming in the South, and I am happy that the relationship  between our Finance Department and that in the South is ongoing and very strong  to ensure that whatever flows from the big decisions that have already been  taken, and those that will be taken in the time ahead, does not detrimentally  affect our economy.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Humphrey</strong>:  I thank the deputy First Minister for his statement. Does he believe that  North/South bodies provide value for money, and does he agree that, like  Departments in Northern    Ireland, they should be subject to  efficiency savings?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr M McGuinness</strong>:  I do believe that they provide value for money, and I agree with the Member  that they should be subject to efficiency savings, and they are. Decisions on  efficiency savings were taken at an earlier stage. The fact that we are meeting  consistently at very well-attended meetings under the auspices of the  North/South Ministerial Council suggests clearly that the Government in Dublin  and our Administration in the North value that contact and the potential that  exists in those bodies to ensure that we continually strive to achieve mutual  benefit for the people who live on this island, whether they live in the North or  in the South. The answer is very clear; we would not be meeting in this format  if the institutions were not delivering for our people, North and South.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ruane</strong>:  Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an r&aacute;iteas. I welcome the statement and the work that has  been done, particularly on cross-border mobility issues, because we know that  there is a lot of work to be done there. You spoke about the  inter-parliamentary forum, and I was present at the previous meeting in Newcastle in County   Down, which was very  useful. Can we be given further information on plans for an inter-parliamentary  forum?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr M McGuinness</strong>:  At the NSMC, we noted that, following a North/South parliamentary forum  conference that was held in October 2010, the Ceann Comhairle of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann  and the Speaker of the Assembly asked the working groups that had been  established in each institution to take forward discussions on the potential  for a North/South parliamentary forum, which is envisaged in the Good Friday  Agreement and the St Andrews Agreement. That included discussions on a further  conference and an inaugural meeting, and other ideas were suggested at the  conference. There were discussions on working jointly to take into account the  valuable contribution that the conference has made to a better understanding of  key issues of interest and concern to Members of the Assembly and the Houses of  the Oireachtas.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">I am pleased to see that work on that is progressing well  and that the Ceann Comhairle, Se&aacute;n Barrett, and our Speaker, Willie Hay, plan  to hold a joint meeting of the working groups in Dublin this week. That work will help to  create a better understanding of the common issues facing both legislatures.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">That conference, which was held in the Slieve Donard Hotel  in County Down, was very well attended by elected representatives North and  South, and I recall that the present Taoiseach turned up to it as leader of the  Opposition. That was a very clear statement of his intent to try to take that  work forward. So, it is a work in progress, and we look forward to the outcome  of our Speaker&rsquo;s deliberations with the new Ceann Comhairle on the work plan  that they put in place in October to see that we expedite the matter as quickly  as possible.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Eastwood</strong>:  I thank the deputy First Minister for his statement. I ask him to join me in  welcoming the ongoing work of the north-west partnership board and ask him to  work with the local MLAs and the partnership board to help them bring forward a  paper on the north-west gateway initiative at an early meeting of the  North/South Ministerial Council.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr M McGuinness</strong>:  Absolutely. That issue has been widely discussed and is of great interest to  people living in the north-west: in Derry, parts of Tyrone and County Donegal.  I do not have any difficulty whatsoever in giving our commitment that that  issue will be kept at the front line in our deliberations. At each meeting of  the North/South Ministerial Council, that issue receives a very substantial  airing, and we all recognise the great benefits that can be accrued for people  on both sides of the border by pushing forward with those developments.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">As we all know, attendant to all of that is the ongoing  interest in the area in, for example, the building and construction of the new  radiotherapy unit at Altnagelvin. There is also interest in the fact that the  preferred routes for the A5 and the A8 have been outlined and that contractors  have been appointed for three different stages of the A5. Infrastructure is  vital for the north-west gateway, and I note from papers in the region that  some concern has been expressed about whether or not the A5 project will go  ahead. People need to be reminded that the A5 project is a very high-level  agreement, as is the construction of the radiotherapy unit at Altnagelvin Hospital.  They involve high-level agreements between our Executive and the Irish  Government, and substantial funds have been put into those projects. Most  recently, &pound;11 million was allocated following a joint decision a few days ago.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Anybody who is in any doubt about whether or not the A5  will go ahead needs to dispel those doubts. Obviously, we cannot pre-empt the  outcome of the ongoing inquiry in the Omagh area, which will be completed over  the next couple of weeks. We will see what that throws up for all of us.  However, those two projects are very important to the north-west gateway. There  are many other important projects of an educational nature and, indeed, if we  see good cross-border co-operation, other projects can bring huge benefits to  the people of that region.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lyttle</strong>: I  thank the deputy First Minister for his statement and welcome his  identification of the savings and collaboration possibilities through effective  operation of the North/South bodies. Enhanced engagement with Europe  to the benefit of local small and medium-sized enterprises is of particular  interest to the OFMDFM Committee. I note that there will be a conference on  innovation and collaboration through the European framework programmes on 30  June. How, exactly, will our small and medium-sized enterprises be involved in that  conference? What additional outcomes does the deputy First Minister hope to see  from it?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr M McGuinness</strong>:  I trust and hope that they will all be ably represented at the conference. The  First Minister and I went to Brussels  to meet the Commissioner for Research, Innovation and Science, M&aacute;ire  Geoghegan-Quinn, and that was a big subject during our conversations. There was  an acceptance from us that we had more to do and that the gap between where  Europe is at and where our SMEs are at in relation to &ldquo;joined-upness&rdquo; left an  awful lot to be desired.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">When we came back from that meeting, we made it absolutely  clear to all our Departments that it was important that all of us upped our  game in Europe. It was also quite clear that,  in M&aacute;ire Geoghegan-Quinn, we were dealing with a sympathetic commissioner. As  someone who understood the problems of small and medium-sized enterprises, she  was more than willing to facilitate smoothing the way to accessing funds from  her department. Therefore, the conference is going to be important and we  encourage all those invited to turn up.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Its emphasis and focus are on SMEs and improving access to Europe. I hope that people will take what is a golden  opportunity to increase our performance and, as a result, gain more support  from Europe for our region.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Spratt</strong>: I  thank the deputy First Minister for his statement. He mentioned the A5 and A8  projects. Will he give further details of the discussions about those projects  at that meeting?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr M McGuinness</strong>:  The good progress on the A5 and A8 projects was noted at the plenary sitting,  and the Irish Government reaffirmed their commitment to those projects and the  related funding. As I said, we agreed that the payment of &pound;11 million would be  made by the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to the NI Consolidated  Fund in accordance with agreed procedures. The Council noted that development  work was continuing on the A5 project and that a public inquiry commenced on 9  May 2011. That inquiry was expected to last some eight weeks and is due to  complete shortly.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Similar progress has been made on the A8, with the third  key milestone met, on target, by the publication of the draft Orders and  environmental statement in January 2011. A public inquiry into that project is  expected to commence later this month.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Those road projects, along with the progress already made  in the overall motorway network in Ireland, will ensure greater road  connectivity across the island. It is no secret to any Member that people west  of the Bann have always felt neglected by Dublin  and Belfast. In  Donegal&rsquo;s case, that feeling relates to Dublin.  People in parts of County Tyrone and County   Derry have always felt  that the good roads were in the east, not just in the North but in the South.  In the west of Ireland  &mdash; our focus is on the north-west at the moment &mdash; there is an infrastructure  deficit. The region is of the strong view that the deficit of proper  infrastructure works against the prospects of bringing new investment to the  area.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, the A5 and A8 are critically important projects,  and I understand that there are concerns about them. The ongoing inquiry is an  opportunity for people to air those concerns and we will see what the judgement  is at the end of that. However, these are high-level agreements between our  Administration and the Government in Dublin.  They are road projects that will bring huge benefits to our people.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">All the talk has been about the A5, but the A8 Belfast to  Larne road is also a vital road to upgrade for the simple reason that, along  the eastern seaboard of the island of Ireland, we have large juggernaut vehicles travelling  back and forward to Europe. It is important  that we provide a proper road infrastructure to ensure that those vehicles get  to their destinations with road safety in mind as well as the speed with which  they ferry their products to mainland Europe.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Molloy</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I thank the deputy First Minister for  his statement. Does he agree that the consistent commitment from the Dublin  Government contradicts, in some way, the lack of a total commitment from the  Assembly to upgrade the A5? Does he think that it is time for the Assembly to  indicate clearly that it wants to build that road?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr M McGuinness</strong>:  The commitment from the authorities in Dublin  has been strong. As far as I am concerned, the commitment from the Assembly and  our Executive is also strong.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">We attended the meeting of the North/South Ministerial  Council, at which we took very important decisions. We took a joint decision to  allocate &pound;11 million. That is not done if the project is not to go ahead. What  would be the sense in that? It would make no sense whatsoever. The question is  around the fact that there has been a public inquiry and that objections to the  road have been raised. People have a right to have their say, and they are  having that opportunity through the establishment of the public inquiry, which  will consider its deliberations and make public its findings. We will then take  it forward from there.</p>
		<p class="TimePeriod">11.15 am</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">However, I have not heard anybody on the Executive say that  the A5 project should not go ahead. In fact, the contrary is the case. It will  come down to how it goes ahead and the quality of the road. Obviously, there is  a strong view that a project of that size needs to be of very high quality. The  question is how we can do that and, at the same time, save vital funds for our  Administrations, North and South. There is no question about the road. However,  questions remain about the outcome of the inquiry, about whatever discussions  officials will have in the aftermath of the inquiry and about how they take  forward the project. The project is very far advanced. Contractors have been  informed that they have the tenders for three stages of the road. I think that  the project is unstoppable. It is now a matter of how it is taken forward to  try to minimise the costs to our Administrations, North and South.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr G Robinson</strong>:  Will the deputy First Minister undertake to ensure that value for money will be  achieved when planning sectoral meetings and that, where possible, money will  be saved by using government venues for meetings, as well as modern  communication methods?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr M McGuinness</strong>:  We are always very conscious of the need to ensure that costs be kept to a  minimum, and we are satisfied that costs have been kept to a minimum. As many  Members know, the NSMC building in Armagh was  opened recently, and that has allowed us to plan ahead to minimise costs. The  cost to OFMDFM of NSMC meetings that the Executive host is met by the joint  secretariat in the North. Travel and subsistence costs for staff other than  those from the NSMC and the joint secretariat are met by the responsible  Departments. The approximate cost to date, for example, of the 81 NSMC meetings  held since May 2007 is around &pound;99,000. The approximate cost to OFMDFM of the 15  NSMC meetings held in the new NSMC joint secretariat building in Armagh since April 2010 is around &pound;5,000, and the cost to  OFMDFM of the 20 NSMC meetings held in 2010-11 was &pound;7,000. People will accept  that we are spending money on NSMC meetings very prudently.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Overend</strong>:  I thank the deputy First Minister for his statement. I am sure that he will be  aware of the EU directive on agency workers, and the associated discussion and  debate by the unions; namely, the Northern Ireland Committee, Irish Congress of  Trade Unions (NICICTU). Have any discussions taken place on the directive?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr M McGuinness</strong>:  There were no discussions at the meeting. I have no doubt that, if it is an  issue of major concern to any party in the Assembly, and if we are informed of  the detail of the difficulties that exist, there will be no objection to our  speaking to corresponding Ministers about how we are handling the issue, North  and South. I know that there is a debate out there on the matter.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maskey</strong>:  Although the deputy First Minister has addressed the issue of the St Andrews  Agreement review, is it possible for him to elaborate on it?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr M McGuinness</strong>:  We discussed the next steps on the St Andrews Agreement review at the plenary  meeting. Work on the review has included consultation with Ministers on the  former Executive and the former Irish Government on recommendations from a  panel of experts on the first element of the review, which is the efficiency  and value for money of the existing North/South bodies. Taking account of the  responses received, the review group made a number of proposals. Those, along  with a copy of the report prepared by experts, will be forwarded to Ministers  in the new Executive and those in the new Irish Government responsible for  North/South bodies and, of course, the Finance Ministers.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Taking account of any comments received, the NSMC joint  secretariat will prepare recommendations for us to consider, so that we can  finalise that element of the review at the next plenary sitting in November. At  the November meeting, we will also discuss the other two terms of reference of  the review, which include the case for additional bodies and the areas of  co-operation within the NSMC.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">It is important that our new Administration takes some time  to consider the work done so far, including the proposals from the review group  on the first element of the review. We also need time to consider the other  elements, and, in my view, it is important that all elements of the review are  progressed at the next plenary sitting. At the NSMC meeting, we agreed that  that should be the case.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  I thank the deputy First Minister for his statement. Reference was made to the  wider community facing difficulties in the banking sector. Was a decision taken  to have joint North/South ministerial discussions with the banking sector to  rectify its inability and unwillingness to provide credit facilities to the  business, commerce and construction industries? Does the deputy First Minister  agree that the lack of availability of credit facilities is having an adverse  effect on the local economy, North and South? Will he ensure that every effort  is made to bring other North/South bodies into the review of the whole process?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr M McGuinness</strong>:  I gave a detailed explanation of how we are taking forward the review of the  North/South bodies in my previous answer. It is a work in progress. I agree  with the Member about the difficulties being presented to businesses, north and  south of the border, as a result of the failure of the banks to lend in a way  that would sustain the opportunities to face the mighty challenges that all  businesses face as a result of the economic downturn.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">The Member also asked about joint representation. Earlier,  I made it clear that officials from our Finance Department and the Finance  Department in the South have pledged to meet regularly. No doubt, that will, as  it should, form part of their discussion.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">One important feature of the NSMC meeting was the openness  with which the Taoiseach approached it. At the beginning of the meeting, he  made it clear to all of his Ministers that they should exchange mobile numbers  with our Ministers, and vice versa. I welcomed his positive suggestion, as it  allows all sorts of opportunities for Ministers of various Departments to meet  their counterparts. At the very least, his suggestion enables them to keep in  touch so that they can deal with some of the huge challenges that we face in a  way that does not compromise the work of the North/South Ministerial Council.  We will get huge benefit from having close contact with our corresponding  Ministers in the South.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">The issue of credit for SMEs and businesses is as difficult  in the South as it is in the North. If anything can be gained by applying  further pressure to the banks through a joined-up approach, I have no doubt  that officials from the two Finance Departments will consider that suggestion  when they meet.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr T Clarke</strong>:  Were there any discussions on child protection at that or any prior meeting of  the NSMC? If so, what child protection plans have been taken forward in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr M McGuinness</strong>:  That specific issue did not come up at this meeting, but it has come up at  previous meetings of the North/South Ministerial Council. I know that our new  Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety, Edwin Poots, is  concerned about the issue. He will work closely with the new Minister for  Health in the South, Dr Reilly, to ensure that we deal with the issue in a way  that gives the greatest possible protection to all our children. As I said, the  issue did not come up at this meeting, but that does not mean to say that it is  not regarded as a huge priority, because it is. That will be given further  emphasis by the work in which Edwin Poots and Dr Reilly will engage in the time  ahead.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  The deputy First Minister has already dealt with the matter of the banks on a  number of occasions. However, I wonder if I could just press him further. Given  that the economy is at the very centre of our thinking these days and the  unavailability of credit is hampering us, does he anticipate any consolidation  of the banking sector in the Republic   of Ireland? Was that  discussed with his colleagues at the North/South Ministerial Council meeting,  and, if so, what are the implications for Northern Ireland?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr M McGuinness</strong>:  The economic situation was discussed, and the plenary meeting provided us with  an opportunity to meet and exchange views with the Taoiseach and Irish  Government Ministers. Our common economic and budgetary challenges were a key  topic of discussion. The Taoiseach outlined the steps being taken by his  Government to bring the economy back on track, which includes the ongoing work  on the restructuring of the banks. He said that they are heading in the right  direction, and we outlined the challenges that we face and the efforts that we  are making to address those, including some encouraging signs and plans to find  further potential sources of additional revenue.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">It will be no surprise to anybody that the issue of  corporation tax came up during our discussions. I was encouraged that, during  the press conference that the First Minister and I held with the Taoiseach  after the meeting, the Taoiseach was supportive. When he was asked whether the  Irish Government would support the work in which we have been involved to try  to get a lower rate of corporation tax, without hesitation, he said that he  would.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">We know that huge changes are taking place in banking. We  also know, because of the linkages between the banks in the South and in the  North, that that will have implications for us. Our focus has to be on ensuring  that jobs are protected and that whatever emerges from the restructuring will  move us all forward in a much stronger way with a more stable approach to  banking than the one that previously brought us to the misery with which many  Governments throughout the world are now dealing.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Campbell</strong>:  The deputy First Minister mentioned the advantages of practical co-operation in  the NSMC meeting. Is he aware that 40,000 people who were born in the Irish Republic  are living in Northern Ireland,  many of whom have lived in Northern    Ireland for many years? They are, therefore,  UK residents, UK voters and UK taxpayers, but they do not have  a right to a British passport. He is a UK  resident, UK voter and UK taxpayer,  and he has a right to an Irish passport. The Home Office, the Irish Republic&rsquo;s  Government and the Northern Ireland Office are aware of the issue. Will the  deputy First Minister ensure that, at a future NSMC meeting, or perhaps more  relevantly, at a British-Irish Council (BIC) meeting, the matter is brought to  the attention of the Home Office and a suitable accommodation arrived at to  give those people the same right to a British passport that he has to an Irish  one?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr M McGuinness</strong>:  That issue has not come up, and, being very honest, I have to say that I am not  that familiar with the subject. However, I understand the Member&rsquo;s point.  Before we deal with it through the auspices of the NSMC, it might be a good  idea for the Member and me to get together to discuss it. We will see then how  we can take the matter forward.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dallat</strong>: I  am pleased that we do not need passports between the North and the South.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the deputy First Minister&rsquo;s statement,  particularly what he said about improvements to the Enterprise  service between Belfast and Dublin. I have every belief that the entire  delegation travelled by train.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">In relation to rail freight, the deputy First Minister will  be aware that virtually everything in the North, and between North and South,  moves by road. With the establishment of the new all-island freight forum, can  we have an assurance that freight trains in the North will begin moving again  and that Northern Ireland Railways will be part of a campaign to move goods  from roads to railways? It is shameful that it was discontinued years ago.</p>
		<p class="TimePeriod">11.30 am</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr M McGuinness</strong>:  The joint secretaries&rsquo; progress report included an update on the establishment  of the freight forum in January 2010. The work of the forum is industry-led and  issue-based and has been taken forward by working groups focusing on  competitiveness and sustainability; safe, compliant and eco-efficient road  freight transport; rail freight and other alternatives; international connectivity;  and data and network management. Each priority area has a lead organisation and  an overseeing Department. The lead organisations are the Freight Transport  Association, the Department of the Environment, the Road Safety Authority, the  Irish Exporters Association, the Irish Maritime Development Office, the central  statistics and research branch of DRD, and the Central Statistics Office. A key  aspect of the freight forum is co-operation between Government and the  logistics sector to help the forum to take a strategic perspective and be  relevant to the needs of industry.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">I am very sympathetic to the points that the Member made,  and the establishment of the freight forum provides an opportunity to deal with  those very relevant issues. Finding solutions to those issues will bring huge  benefits for us all.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: In  the statement the First Minister and the deputy First Minister acknowledged  that there were constraints in the Budget in both jurisdictions and that there  is a need to identify potential cost savings. Does the deputy First Minister  accept that all North/South projects should be reassessed to ensure that they  are proportionate and justifiable and that such investment will maximise the  use of our limited funds so that the economy will reach the best possible  outcome?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr M McGuinness</strong>:  That was one of the purposes of the review. The budget for the North/South  bodies and Tourism Ireland  for 2010 was &pound;146 million; the Executive&rsquo;s contribution was &pound;37&middot;6 million and  the Irish Government&rsquo;s &pound;108&middot;4 million. Guidance to inform the preparation of  corporate plans for 2011-13 and 2011 business plans for the North/South bodies  was issued by the Department of Finance and Personnel and the Department of  Finance to sponsor Departments in July 2010.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">The guidance specified that further minimum cash-releasing  efficiency savings of 3% in 2011, culminating in 9% over the period 2012-13,  are required. It includes the proviso that there may be a review of those  efficiency guidelines for 2012-13 to take account of the developing budget  process in both jurisdictions. Therefore, we agreed that the North/South  bodies, like all other public bodies, must ensure efficiency. However, it will  be important that they have sufficient resources to deliver on their mandates.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Considerable work has been done on the preparation of  budgets and business plans for 2011 and corporate plans for 2011-13 for the  bodies. It is anticipated that those corporate and business plans will be  approved by Ministers at NSMC meetings to be held between now and September.</p>

		<p class="H4StageHeading">Damages (Asbestos-related Conditions) Bill: Royal  Assent</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I inform the House that the Damages (Asbestos-related Conditions) Bill has  received Royal Assent. The Damages (Asbestos-related Conditions) Act (Northern Ireland)  2011 became law today.</p>
		<p class="H3SubHeading"><a name="a5"></a>Ministerial Statement</p>
		<p class="H4StageHeading">Intergovernmental Agreement on Criminal Justice  Co-operation</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I have received notice from the Minister of Justice that he wishes to make a  statement to the House.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford (The Minister  of Justice)</strong>: With your permission, Mr Speaker, I will make a statement  regarding a meeting that I had with Alan Shatter TD, the Minister for Justice  and Equality, under the auspices of the intergovernmental agreement on  co-operation on criminal justice matters (IGA), which was held in Armagh on Wednesday 8 June. It was the third formal  ministerial meeting under the IGA since the devolution of justice matters on 12  April 2010 and the first since the recent Assembly and D&aacute;il elections, although  I have met Mr Shatter on a number of occasions since his appointment.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">The intergovernmental agreement is an agreement between the  UK  and Irish Governments and provides a framework for co-operation on criminal justice  matters. It supports at least one meeting each year between the Justice  Ministers in the North and the South, as well as a working group of officials  from both jurisdictions that meets at least twice a year. The working group is  supported by ad hoc project advisory groups, of which there are currently six.  The advisory groups are tasked with considering criminal justice-related work  strands of mutual interest. We inherited those arrangements. Of course, it is  open to the Executive and the Assembly to review them.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">As I have said in previous statements to the House, I am  committed to keeping the Assembly informed of meetings that are held under the  auspices of the agreement, on the same lines as North/South Ministerial Council  (NSMC) meetings. The meeting with Alan Shatter on 8 June was constructive and  provided a good opportunity to discuss a number of criminal justice issues of  mutual interest. We were updated on a range of cross-border issues, including  supporting public protection; management of sex offenders; support for victims  of crime; youth justice; forensic science; and promoting social diversity. We  also discussed the progress of the ad hoc project advisory groups that cover  those areas of mutual benefit and noted, in particular, the effective channels  of communication between criminal justice organisations on both sides of the  border to ensure that the border is not exploited by criminals to escape  justice.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Indeed, Members may be aware of media reports last week  concerning the management and supervision of sex offenders in Northern Ireland,  which are rightly acknowledged as being highly effective. Through the excellent  working relationships and sharing of information between the two police  services, and under the public protection arrangements Northern Ireland  (PPANI), we already see instances in which the PSNI routinely invites its  colleagues from an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to attend local area public protection panel  (LAPPP) meetings in border areas. That degree of cross-border operational  co-operation between the police and probation agencies on the ground should be  supported and encouraged.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">In addition, the meeting provided an opportunity to review  the good progress that has been made against a work programme that I agreed in  July 2010 with the then Irish Minister for Justice and Law Reform, Dermot  Ahern. Flowing directly from that work programme, I am particularly pleased to  report that Alan Shatter and I signed a memorandum of understanding between our  forensic science services. The memorandum of understanding has been developed  to provide for mutual support in the event of sudden loss or damage to  facilities. It is an example of the excellent co-operation at an operational  level among criminal justice organisations on the island of Ireland.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">That practical co-operation will benefit both jurisdictions  and further strengthen working relationships that are already in place between  the two forensic services. I am pleased to report to Members that the heads of  the forensic science services in the North and the South meet regularly with  their Scottish counterpart and also have in place heads of agreement to provide  mutual support, which is similar to the memorandum of understanding that I  signed with Alan Shatter.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Other successes over the past 12 months include agreement  on a joint proposal to evaluate the use of the stable and acute risk assessment  tool for sex offenders, as well as the organisation of a joint seminar for the  two probation services to showcase the extent of co-operation in public  protection. I welcomed the opportunity to join Dermot Ahern in making a few  closing remarks at that seminar.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">At our recent meeting, Alan Shatter and I agreed a new work  programme, setting out priorities for cross-border co-operation over the next  12 months. I have attached a copy of the work programme to my statement for  Members&rsquo; information. Planned actions to promote co-operation are captured  under three areas: enhancing justice delivery; support for victims and  witnesses of crime; and management of offenders. Some specific planned actions  include exploring the use of fast-track and formatted probation reports in  courts to speed up justice; considering the scope for a joint approach to  implementing the proposed new EU directive on victims of crime; and exploring  the potential of extending information-sharing to include related areas of  public protection police work, such as child abuse, domestic abuse and missing  persons.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Progress against all the actions in the 2011-12 work  programme will be monitored by the working group of officials, who will report  to Alan Shatter and me at our next ministerial meeting. It is my intention, Mr  Speaker, with your continued agreement, to update the Assembly following that  meeting. We are seeing that the devolution of justice powers provides real  opportunities to enhance working relationships further between and across the  criminal justice agencies. Operationally, criminal justice agencies in the  North and the South are working closely together. I want to maximise that  co-operation.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">The IGA is an important framework for supporting co-operation  among the various agencies. As we are all too well aware, crime does not stop  at the border. I know that, by continuing to work together, we can help to make  this island, North and South, a safer and a better place to live.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">The meeting also provided an opportunity for me to update  Mr Shatter on two key initiatives in my Department &mdash; the development of a  reducing offending strategy and the youth justice review &mdash; while I received an  update from him on the development of Ireland&rsquo;s White Paper on crime.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Finally, the intergovernmental agreement is not intended to  provide for discussion of cross-border security issues. However, I have cause  to discuss such matters regularly with Mr Shatter, and I used the opportunity  of our being together to briefly discuss some general wider cross-border  security-related issues.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Givan (The  Chairperson of the Committee for Justice)</strong>: I thank the Minister for his  statement to the House today. He touched on the management of sex offenders.  First, I seek an assurance from the Minister that information under the  notification requirements in both jurisdictions is, indeed, passed on to the  relevant authority should there be any movement of offenders and that  appropriate management of those offenders takes place.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, do disqualification orders for those sentenced  for child sex offences apply equally in both jurisdictions? What is the  Minister&rsquo;s view of the 278 cases where a disqualification order was not put in  place in this jurisdiction even though there was a presumption that that would  happen? Does he share my serious concern about that matter? What efforts are  being made by the judiciary to urgently review all of those cases and to ensure  that no risk is posed to the public?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  thank the Committee Chairman for his couple of related questions. I have every  confidence that the arrangements for the management of sex offenders North and  South, which is particularly facilitated by the specialist group under the IGA,  ensure that all appropriate information is passed between agencies, regardless  of the border. The reality, of course, is that both jurisdictions have  legislation in place that requires sex offenders to notify the police or the  Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of their details if they move across the border, so the primary  onus is on the offender. However, it is clear that there is high-level  co-operation between the agencies.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Mr Givan also asked about disqualification orders. I should  make it clear that the issue of the 278 orders that he mentioned is one for the  judiciary to follow up on at this stage and to address why there has not been a  statement on why orders were not made in those cases. The examination of that  arose because of action I took in the wake of the McDermott case last autumn. I  am glad that the judiciary is now following through on those issues. I hope to  be able to report to the Committee on the detailed position in a couple of  days&rsquo; time. The precise detail of how a disqualification order is applied on a  cross-border basis will be part of the report that I give to the Committee.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms J McCann</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for his  statement. In terms of the work programme, what discussion did the Minister  have with the Justice Minister in the South about the management of offenders,  given that there have been some very damning reports about prison conditions,  particularly where vulnerable people are concerned? Did he have some discussion  with the Minister about how the Departments could work together more to ensure  that there are fewer lock-ups; more education facilities; better access to health  facilities for prisoners, particularly vulnerable ones; and improved prison  conditions?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  thank Ms McCann for her question, although I fear that it is outside the  precise scope of the IGA meeting. The management of the two prison services is  not regularly covered in the operation of the IGA. However, she made a number  of points that will clearly come through as we work on the strategic efficiency  and effectiveness programme and when we see the final report on prisons from  the Owers review team. She made some entirely valid points about the need to  ensure that there are the highest possible standards of management in the  Prison Service.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his statement. I note a number of comments that he made  about effective communication channels to make sure that criminals do not  escape justice and the excellent co-operation on forensic science at an  operational level on the island   of Ireland. If there is  to be enhanced co-operation, why must it be only at an operational level?  Should we not be able to share information on DNA, fingerprinting and all the  other good things that the forensic science services look at on a cross-border  basis? Is there any reason why that information cannot also be shared with  other police jurisdictions in Great    Britain?</p>
		<p class="TimePeriod">11.45 am</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  fear that Ms McCann is not the only person who is trying to drag me  significantly away from the precise detail of the IGA. The reality is that  questions of co-operation between jurisdictions on the sharing of information  are beyond the scope of co-operation on criminal justice matters as currently  dealt with through the IGA. There are perfectly reasonable questions to be  asked about the level of co-operation, which, in some cases, can extend to  European matters, as well as cross-jurisdictional issues in the UK and  cross-border issues on this island.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">I support the fullest possible sharing of information to  deal with organised crime. That is why we see the positive work that is being  done by organisations such as the Organised Crime Task Force and the strong  co-operation between a number of different agencies, for example, between the  two revenue and customs organisations and between the PSNI and the Garda  S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Those are examples of excellent co-operation, but no doubt there will  always be occasions on which Members will suggest that we could further improve  that co-operation.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement and the meeting that took place between him  and Mr Shatter, the Justice Minister in the South. I also commend the work  programme that was agreed between the two Ministers and the two jurisdictions,  although it could be further enhanced. On 23 March 2011, the previous Committee  for Justice met representatives of the Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA),  who indicated that there could be further co-operation in the collection of  evidence, the interviewing of witnesses, etc, by Her Majesty&rsquo;s Revenue and  Customs. I ask the Minister and his southern counterpart to consider seriously  the initiation of a study that would see further co-operation and allow  agencies on either side of the border to deal with issues such as fuel and  money laundering. That would have good and practical implications, North and  South, in dealing with organised crime.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  thank Mr Maginness for his welcome for the statement and his support for the  work that is being done under the IGA. The picture that I am getting at the  moment from a variety of organisations, including the Organised Crime Task  Force, in which SOCA fully participates, is that the highest possible level of  co-operation is ongoing between the revenue and customs organisations in the  North and the South. I am determined to have the highest level of co-operation.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">If Mr Maginness is suggesting that investigations should be  carried out on a cross-border basis, there would be issues as to how that might  happen that would be of concern to people outside the Department of Justice.  However, it is not something that I or any of my officials are opposed to. The issue  is how to ensure that we get the best possible practical co-operation and the  means for it without disrupting good working relationships, if some were  concerned about the precise methods that were used.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dickson</strong>:  I also welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement and his continued practice of keeping  the Assembly up to date with the work that he does with his colleagues in the  Republic. I also welcome the memorandum of understanding between the forensic  science services, on which perhaps the Minister will give the House a little  more detail. I particularly welcome that, as Forensic Science Northern Ireland is based in my constituency of East Antrim. Will the Minister tell the House whether he  has any other plans for similar arrangements with the other forensic science  services in the rest of the United    Kingdom?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  thank my colleague for his welcome for the continuing arrangements. As I said  at the outset, the IGA, although it is something that I inherited from direct  rule Ministers, is directly analogous to the NSMC. At some stage, the Assembly  may decide that the IGA should be replaced by a justice strand of the NSMC,  but, until that day, I will ensure that the Assembly is kept informed in the  best possible way, through statements to the House and interaction with the  Committee for Justice.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">My colleague asked specifically about the forensic science  memorandum of understanding and about co-operation elsewhere in the UK. We have the  heads of agreement, which were signed by the heads of the agencies, including the  head of the Scottish agency. However, because of changes to the governance  arrangements in England and Wales and significant movement towards  privatisation of forensic science services there, it has been much easier to  co-operate with those agencies that are still part of the state set-up in Scotland and Ireland. If I see that there are  benefits to be had from wider co-operation, I am open to that, but at the  moment, we have made significant advances through the co-operation between the  three jurisdictions where the state agencies are able to manage that level of  co-operation through good working arrangements and memorandums of  understanding.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his statement. I refer him to the strengthening  arrangements that are being put in place for the management and monitoring of  sex offenders. I welcome strengthened relationships that ensure that there is  better monitoring of them on a cross-border basis.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">While it is useful to see that there are those good  relationships between North and South, and in the full sharing of information  between Northern Ireland and other jurisdictions in the United Kingdom, has the  Minister either sought assurances or can he give the House any confidence that  the same strong levels of linkage are there between the Republic of Ireland and  other parts of the United Kingdom to ensure that, in this chain of monitoring  of sex offenders, there is no weak link?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  thank Mr Weir for his question. However, it now appears that I am responsible  for the justice system in the Republic and the other two UK jurisdictions as well as in Northern Ireland.  My empire knows no bounds.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">The simple answer is that I can give no direct assurances  as to arrangements for co-operation between jurisdictions for which I have no  responsibility. However, I have no reason to believe that the co-operation is  any less than would be the case where it involves us. There have been occasions  recently when sex offenders have moved from England  to the Republic and fairly speedy action has been taken on both sides of the Irish Sea to deal with that particular problem. The  issues are in hand, but outwith my responsibilities.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCartney</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Aire as an  r&aacute;iteas sin.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement and his outline of the  meeting with his colleague in Dublin.  I am particularly interested in the section where he says that a part of the  remit was dealing with public protection and:</p>
		<p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;the effective channels of communication between criminal  justice organisations on both sides of the border to ensure that the border is  not exploited by criminals to escape justice.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">With that in mind, has the Minister done any  exploratory work on loopholes, particularly with regard to head shops and legal  highs? Substances banned in Derry may be  bought by nipping across to Letterkenny, and vice versa. Has the Minister plans  to try to close such loopholes?</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Last week at the Committee, the Minister&rsquo;s officials spoke  of trying to enforce the law in the North on ticket touting. It was pointed out  that all you have to do is go to Donegal, where it is not illegal to sell  tickets at above face value. Has any exploratory work been done on those  issues?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  thank Mr McCartney for his question. There is clearly a range of issues with  regard to which the border can be somewhat permeable. Nonetheless, the specific  issue that you make most of about head shops and so on is one on which  significant efforts were made in the South last year to deal with, for example,  the production of new illicit substances that are chemically marginally  different from others. My understanding is that the matter is being followed up  at a UK  level. It is not something for which we have legislative responsibility.  However, I will ensure that I get the detail as to exactly what progress is  being made in London  either to the Committee or to Mr McCartney.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Anderson</strong>:  I also thank the Minister for his statement. Does he agree that criminal  justice co-operation between Northern Ireland  and the Irish Republic must be mutual, meaningful and  genuine? Does he also therefore agree that the Smithwick tribunal must be given  the time and resources necessary to complete its important task? Did he raise  that issue at his meeting with Mr Shatter?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  thank Mr Anderson for his question. The Smithwick tribunal did not feature  specifically on the formal agenda, but I raised the issue privately with Mr  Shatter before the meeting began officially. He assured me that the necessary  arrangements are in place to ensure that the Smithwick tribunal will do its  work within a reasonable timescale and that, if necessary, the timescale will  be extended, as that had caused a certain amount of concern on this side of the  border. He has received an assurance from Mr Justice Smithwick that he is  capable of doing the work within the required timescale and will seek  additional time if necessary. The PSNI and the Historical Enquiries Team have  also given significant assistance to the Smithwick tribunal, so I believe that  we are doing all that we can in this jurisdiction.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hussey</strong>: I  also thank the Justice Minister for his statement. He will be aware of the  recent report on the Kingsmills massacre. He referred to cross-border  operational co-operation between the Police Service of Northern Ireland and an  Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Extradition procedures between North and South remain difficult  due to Irish concerns over the British judicial process. To what extent does  that mutual support extend to historical cases?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: Mr  Hussey&rsquo;s question is entirely legitimate, but it is outside the  responsibilities that I assumed on 12 April 2010. I am unaware of any  difficulties regarding any extradition cases in either direction across the  border, but if there are concerns, I will happily listen to what any Member has  to say and see what the position is. The difficult issues as to how we deal  with many incidents that happened in the past are beyond the current scope of  the IGA, but I believe that the Assembly needs to start to take them seriously.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I remind Members that questions should relate to the statement.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Eastwood</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his statement and welcome the developments on  information sharing. Does he agree that there should be no hiding place for  child abusers or people engaged in domestic violence on the island of Ireland?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  thank Mr Eastwood. He is absolutely right. There should be no hiding place for  people engaged in any sort of criminal activity anywhere on the island. We need  to ensure maximum possible co-operation among all relevant agencies. I am  determined that crimes such as domestic violence and child abuse, which would  not always have been regarded as the highest priorities for cross-border  co-operation, come within the ambit of the current arrangements.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  I draw the Minister&rsquo;s attention to the original 2002 intergovernmental  agreement between the then NIO and the Department of Justice in the Republic. I  note that that agreement remains largely unimplemented, and there are gaps,  specifically the absence of arrangements for lateral entry between the two  police services and a real conflict over pension rights for PSNI officers and  garda officers seeking to transfer to the other service. Will the Minister  update the House on any progress on that issue? Does he intend to prioritise it  in the months ahead as an area that must be implemented, particularly now that  we have lost 50:50 direct recruitment to the PSNI?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: Mr  McDevitt is being as creative as other Members have managed to be this morning.  The issue of lateral entry to the Police Service or to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is a  significant concern, but practical work is ongoing with the recruitment of 40  specialist officers by the Police Service.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">The key problem with lateral entry is, as the Member  correctly highlighted, the issue of pensions. That is an issue for every state  institution in the United Kingdom  relating to every state institution in the Republic of Ireland.  It is not an issue for only the PSNI and an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; it is an issue that  goes way beyond that, and it is beyond the ability of the Department of Justice  to resolve. I wish the issue to be resolved, but other minds have supposedly  been tackling it for many years, and we do not see easy movement for people in  any part of the public sector, North/South or east-west. I do not think that we  will be able to resolve the issue within the Department or the IGA, although I  wish that it could be resolved so that we could maximise the opportunity for  officers to move, North or South.</p>
		<p class="TimePeriod">12.00 noon</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dallat</strong>: I  want to ask the Minister about the targets set for meetings between him and his  counterpart in the Republic and their officials. I remind him that those  targets are for one meeting a year between the Ministers and two meetings a  year between officials. Given the millions of pounds that are earned by all  kinds of criminals, does the Minister believe that those are serious targets?  Would he forgive me for thinking that there must be more meetings between North  and South Korea?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  thank Mr Dallat for the question, although the term &ldquo;target&rdquo; is not entirely  accurate. What he stated is, as I understand the IGA, the minimum requirement.  I have ensured that we have got to the point where we have a formal ministerial  meeting at least twice a year, the various project advisory groups are meeting  frequently and officials are meeting somewhat more frequently than the twice a  year specified in the agreement. That is an indication that the Department of  Justice is taking the IGA seriously and implementing it.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">To the best of my knowledge, I was the only Minister from  the Executive who had a meeting with his counterpart from the South in the time  between the D&aacute;il election and the Assembly election. Admittedly, that was an  informal meeting; nonetheless, it was a face-to-face meeting between the two  Justice Ministers. It was essential to ensure that we got off to a good start  in our relationship with the new Justice Minister in Dublin. I had a good working relationship  with Dermot Ahern, and I have already established a good working relationship  with Alan Shatter. I assure Mr Dallat that if the agreement says one meeting a  year, that is not the number that I am looking at.</p>
		<p class="H3SubHeading"><a name="a6"></a>Executive Committee Business</p>
		<p class="H4StageHeading">Budget (No. 2) Bill: Consideration Stage</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I call the Minister of Finance and Personnel to move the Consideration Stage of  the Budget (No. 2) Bill.</p>
		<p class="Q3Motion">Moved. &mdash; [Mr Wilson (The Minister of Finance and Personnel).]</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  No amendments have been tabled to the Bill. I propose, therefore, by leave of  the Assembly, to group the nine clauses of the Bill for the Question on stand  part, followed by the five schedules and the long title.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Clauses 1 to 9 ordered to stand part of the Bill.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Schedules 1 to 5 agreed to.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Long title agreed to.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  That concludes the Consideration Stage of the Budget (No.2) Bill. The Bill  stands referred to the Speaker.</p>
		<p class="H3SubHeading"><a name="a7"></a>Committee Business</p>
		<p class="H4StageHeading">Agency Workers Directive</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Business Committee has agreed to allow up to two hours for this debate. The  proposer will have 10 minutes to propose the motion and 10 minutes in which to  make a winding-up speech. All other Members who are called to speak will have  five minutes.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea (The  Chairperson of the Committee for Employment and Learning)</strong>: I beg to move</p>
		<p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly notes the EU directive on conditions for  temporary agency workers (directive 2008/104/EC); and calls on the Minister for  Employment and Learning to ensure, in implementing the directive, that both the  needs of workers and minimising the costs to business are taken into account.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">I am pleased to bring this motion to the House to debate  these important policy proposals and draft regulations, which will transpose  the EU agency workers directive into Northern Ireland legislation.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">This is an issue that is too important and significant to  allow it to go through the Assembly merely by negative resolution in September  without having a wider and fuller debate that allows Members to understand the  Minister&rsquo;s position. The change does not merely represent an increase in  certain costs by inflation: it is a major change to working and employment  practices that will affect many people in Northern Ireland. That is why the  Committee has agreed on the motion.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">The agency workers directive ensures the protection of temporary  agency workers by applying the principle of equal treatment. The directive  provides that the basic working and employment conditions of temporary agency  workers should be, for the duration of their assignment with a hirer, at least  those that would apply had they been recruited directly by that hirer to occupy  the same job.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">The conditions to which the directive will apply include  duration of working time, overtime, breaks, rest periods, night work, holidays,  public holidays and pay. The directive must be in operation before 5 December  2011, which puts something of a pressure on us to conclude our business. The  Department went out to consultation on the policy proposals and draft  regulations in December 2010, with a closing date of 11 March 2011.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">On 1 June, the Committee was briefed by departmental  officials on the 18 responses to the consultation that were received. The  officials explained that a key issue in the directive was the default position  that equal treatment rights should apply from day one of an assignment.  However, article 5 of the directive provides for a qualifying period for equal  treatment, on the basis of an agreement between the social partners at a  national level.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">In the United    Kingdom, the Confederation of British  Industry (CBI) and the Trades Union Congress (TUC) entered into discussions  with the UK Government and agreed to a 12-week derogation before the temporary  agency workers&rsquo; entitlement to equal treatment would apply. However, here in Northern Ireland, since the Trades Union  Congress does not represent Northern    Ireland trade unions, the Department entered  into discussions with the CBI and the Northern Ireland Committee of the Irish  Congress of Trade Unions (ICTU). Unfortunately, they were not able to reach  agreement. The Department took legal advice and concluded that the agreement  made between the social partners at national level does indeed extend to  Northern Ireland and that the Department would not be fulfilling its  responsibilities in the transposition if it made an agreement at only regional  level.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">As a result of the directive, agency workers may benefit  from enhanced conditions, while private and public sector hirers may face  increased costs. Therefore, it is absolutely appropriate that the Assembly  should be able to deliberate on what will be a significant issue for many  people.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Departmental officials told the Committee that, if the  directive was implemented from day one, it would result in estimated costs of  &pound;716 million, with benefits of &pound;550 million over a 10-year period, resulting in  net costs of &pound;166 million over that same period. However, based on the 12-week  qualifying period, the estimated costs would be reduced to &pound;300 million and the  benefits to &pound;220 million over the 10-year period, resulting in net costs of &pound;80  million over the same period. Private sector employers face an annual increased  cost of some &pound;27 million, while public sector employers face annual increased  costs of around &pound;6&middot;5 million. The main annual benefits run at &pound;19&middot;2 million for  private sector employers and &pound;6&middot;4 million for public sector employers.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Under both options, agency workers and Her Majesty&rsquo;s  Treasury would benefit financially, while private and public sector hirers  would face increased costs. It was assumed that the employment businesses &mdash;  that is, the temporary work agencies &mdash; would be able to pass on 85% to 100% of  the higher wage and holiday costs to hirers.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Departmental officials explained that a number of issues  were still being reviewed. Those include the definition of an agency worker,  working time and holiday entitlement, the definition of pay, length of breaks  between assignments, permanent contracts of employment, payment between  assignments, and antenatal and maternity leave. I am sure that other members of  the Committee will speak at some length on those issues.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">At its meeting of 8 June, the Committee agreed to arrange  for further briefings to gain an understanding of the viewpoints of unions and  employers. On 15 June, the Committee was briefed by representatives from trade  unions, the CBI, Diamond Recruitment Group, the Law Centre Northern Ireland and  departmental officials. I will leave it for other members to raise the issues.  We are grateful, given the shortage of time, that those who attended the  consultations were able to get us additional information quickly.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">In the time left available to me, I would like to speak &mdash;  not as the Committee Chair, but just as an MLA &mdash; about why it is important that  this is debated in the Assembly. We often hear the refrain from the business  community that all that happens is that we introduce more bureaucracy and more  red tape and that, when we get directives coming from Europe,  they are somehow magicked out of the air, arrive with a cost burden and have  nothing to do with us here. That is something that we really have to confront.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">When we were having the debate in the Committee, I noticed  that, when reasonable arguments were put forward, on whatever side, members of  the Committee listened carefully and actually agreed with many of the points  that were raised. There was not a knee-jerk reaction but a considered response.  It is important that we give Members of the Assembly the opportunity to debate  those important issues in full Chamber, because that way we are able to inform  and consult with the electorate.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">One of the things that struck a chord with me is that there  are issues to do with maternity leave. Whether employed by rogue traders or  not, there are occasions when people who announce that they are pregnant  suddenly find that, due to the economic downturn, there are no jobs available  for them. That does not seem to be the correct way to go forward. We introduced  laws to protect women who are pregnant for very good reasons, and we should not  step away from them idly. Of course, there is other protection available under  the law, and perhaps the implementation of the directive by the Minister will  allow us to clarify exactly what is understood by the law, but it is a  situation that many people think we have to deal with, even if it is only in a minority  of cases.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">I also have to say that I found it basically unfair that  you could have employees who are agency workers doing the same job for many  years &mdash; including, I am told, in the Assembly &mdash; perhaps for up to 15 years, yet  they do not have the same rights as people whom they are working alongside.  That just does not seem right to me.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Having said all that, I am also aware of the issues raised  by employers about the need for flexibility and the need to ensure that our  costs are maintained and that we provide a really good working environment for  everybody, because you must have some form of job. The real challenge is to  make sure that we get balance in those matters. I am also aware of the issue  raised by the ICTU. There were some difficulties with getting some information  forward, and I am grateful to the trade unions that supplied some notes to us.  I have no doubt that other Members will bring up the issues, but it was  apparent when we were talking about those matters that there was a complete  lack of information on the total number of people that we were talking about.  Of course, that makes setting policy difficult.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">I want to conclude by thanking my long-suffering Committee  Clerk &mdash; I am sorry if I have slipped back into being the Chair &mdash; my Committee and  the officials for doing an awful lot of work very quickly. It is an important  job that they have done. I am looking forward to hearing what people have to  say. In my opinion, this is about real issues that have a real impact on the  people of Northern Ireland.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Bring your remarks to a close.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  There will be real costs. This is real politics, and I look forward to the  debate.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>: I  listened this morning to the media saying that we will be deciding on this  issue. I do not think that that is entirely right. It is a European directive;  therefore, we do not have a choice about whether we implement it. Our choice is  on how we implement it. I understand the need for the directive. I have spoken  to many people who have been working for an employer as agency staff for many  years, and I have also heard some fairly horrific stories of agency workers  being exploited by unscrupulous employers.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">However, today it is not our business to be debating the  European directive &mdash; its details and what it includes &mdash; as such. We have to  recognise that the directive will be applied to all regions of the United Kingdom, so the debate that we have to  focus on this afternoon is whether Northern   Ireland is included in the national agreement that was  arrived at between the TUC and the CBI in Great Britain in relation to the  12-week qualifying period. The Committee Chairperson has already said that, and  I am sure that other Members will mention the need to strike a balance in this  debate between workers&rsquo; rights and the cost burdens that are placed on  businesses.</p>
		<p class="TimePeriod">12.15 pm</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">I argue that the fact that the unions and the CBI have  managed to strike that balance and come to an agreement on the 12-week  qualifying period should be welcomed. The directive should be implemented in Northern Ireland in the same way in which it is  to be implemented in the rest of the United Kingdom. The unions, of  course, argue that the TUC does not represent workers in Northern Ireland,  has no remit here and was not part of the negotiating process. It is  regrettable that the TUC was not part of the negotiating process and was not  included in those discussions. Nonetheless, the fraternal relationship between  the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the TUC may be something that they can  work on by themselves.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">The position that has been adopted by the trade unions in Northern Ireland is that we should implement the  directive from day one rather than allow for the 12-week qualifying period, and  therefore have different implementation in Northern   Ireland to the rest of the UK. In principle, I am not opposed  to Northern Ireland going a  different way to the rest of the UK on certain issues. We already  have regional variations, and that is what devolution is all about. After all,  we vary on a range of issues, including having different licensing arrangements  and different abortion laws.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">For me, the debate comes down to two major issues. First,  can we implement the directive differently from that which has been agreed at a  national level? Secondly, would it be desirable for us to implement it  differently from the rest of the United Kingdom? There is some  disagreement on the first issue. The unions in Northern   Ireland believe that we can allow for regional variations  throughout the UK.  However, my reading of the situation is that, as is stated in article 5 of the  directive, the UK,  as the member state of the European Union, can derogate from the directive if  agreement can be met at a national level with social partners. That has been  accomplished at a national level between the CBI and the TUC. As I said before,  it is regrettable that trade unions from Northern Ireland were not involved  in those negotiations, but perhaps that is an issue that they have to deal  with. I ask the Minister for Employment and Learning, in his closing comments,  to spell out the legal advice that he has received about whether the national  agreement between the CBI and the unions applies to Northern Ireland. I believe that it  does, and that we can opt into it.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">The second issue is about whether it would be desirable to  implement the directive differently from the rest of the United Kingdom.  As I said, I am not opposed to regional variations, because that is what  devolution is all about. In this case, however, it is clear that a regional  variation would place businesses in Northern Ireland at a disadvantage  compared with businesses in GB.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">In the previous mandate, the Executive placed the economy  at the heart of the Programme for Government. I am quite sure that, when the  Programme for Government for this mandate comes forward, the economy will still  be at the centre of all that we do. In recent weeks, I have been involved in a  series of meetings with business and other leaders about getting the powers to  reduce the rate of corporation tax. It is all about helping to attract foreign  direct investment; helping businesses to expand; helping us to create a more  vibrant and larger private sector; and helping us to create jobs. Indeed, all  the main parties in Northern    Ireland have bought into that. I ask them  why we would want to implement the directive in a way that would place local  businesses at a disadvantage and create further costs for them.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">The CBI has expressed its concerns about the increased  administrative burden. Indeed, any Member who speaks to businesses in their  constituencies will hear about the increased cost and administrative burdens  that arise from regulations, most of which originate from Europe.  The CBI has given us the figures that outline the cost of the directive.  Earlier on, the Chairperson of the Committee for Employment and Learning  spelled out the difference in costs between day one implementation and the  12-week qualifying period.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member must draw his remarks to a close.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>: The  Assembly should be focusing on helping to create an environment in which  businesses can create jobs, not on gold-plating legislation that could  ultimately cost jobs &mdash;</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>: &mdash;  especially when the unions and business leaders have already come to an  agreement at a national level.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. As an Assembly, we can seize this  opportunity to take the lead on the equality agenda. That is precisely what the  agency workers directive invites us to do. The directive establishes a general  principle of equal treatment in working and employment conditions of agency  workers and permanent members of staff in similar posts. The Department for  Employment and Learning (DEL) public consultation on the directive invited the  public to express their views on the policy proposals and the draft regulations  that will implement the directive in the North. This is our opportunity, as an  Assembly, to influence the outcome of the transposition of the directive by  December 2011, as I understand it.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">The directive, as outlined by the Chair of the Committee  for Employment and Learning, Basil McCrea, does indeed have a broad scope. I  draw attention to a quote that the Law Centre brought to the attention of the  Committee for Employment and Learning. In the James v Greenwich Council 2007  appeal ruling, the president of the Employment Appeal Tribunal, Mr Justice  Elias, stated:</p>
		<p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;We should not leave this case without repeating the  observations made by many courts in the past that many agency workers are  highly vulnerable and need to be protected from the abuse of economic power by  the end users. The common law can only tinker with the problem on the margins.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">The Law Centre went on to speak to us about its experience,  which was similar to that of the unions that came before us. Both used the same  phrase. They said that every time an agency worker presents for advice on  employment rights, their hearts sink. The Law Centre&rsquo;s experience reflects the  view expressed by Mr Justice Elias:</p>
		<p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;most agency workers are low-skilled and may accept  work through an agency as a necessity because of want of an alternative. They  are not looking to deprive themselves of employment rights.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">It went on to say that, essentially, agency workers  are:</p>
		<p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;the second-class citizens of the employment sphere.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Furthermore, it said that agency workers do not  deliberately exclude themselves:</p>
		<p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;from the statutory protections that they would  otherwise enjoy.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Some believe that the 12-week qualifying period in the  North should be reduced significantly, to six weeks. Others argue for the  removal of any such qualifying period. In the Committee, some members called it  gold-plating. Indeed, Jim Allister was worried that it might form a patchwork  of rights. Others referred to taking the lead on equality.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Sinn F&eacute;in has consistently championed the cause of agency  workers on the basis of equal pay for equal work. In 2008, Mitchel McLaughlin  tabled a motion calling on the then Minister for Employment and Learning, Sir  Reg Empey, who, at the time, responded very progressively, to:</p>
		<p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;take the necessary measures to protect agency  workers, and to ensure that such workers are provided with the same statutory  protections, regarding pay and conditions of employment, as the directly  employed workforce.&rdquo; &mdash; [Official Report, Bound Volume 26, p245, col 2].</p>
		<p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The motion was passed unanimously. At the time,  Sinn F&eacute;in highlighted the loss of over 900 jobs at Seagate in Limavady, a  significant number of which were the jobs of agency workers who were not  entitled to redundancy pay. Elsewhere on the island, Sinn F&eacute;in tabled a joint  motion with the Labour Party in the D&aacute;il, and it submitted similar motions to  county councils.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">As the Chairman and Mr Ross said, in recent weeks, the  Committee for Employment and Learning took some evidence &mdash; just some, given the  limited time available. There is an evidence gap and an information gap. We are  not sure exactly how many agency workers there are in the North. Some people say  that there are 22,000. We took evidence from the unions, business and the Law  Centre, and written evidence from ethnic minority groups.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">I would suggest that what is called the agreement between  the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills in Britain and the unions  does not apply here, because at no stage was ICTU involved in those  discussions. Therefore, in respect of the North, the social partner agreement  is invalid, because ICTU did not have a proper role in it.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">This is a unique opportunity for us to lead in the area of  rights. The directive is a priority issue for Sinn F&eacute;in, and we should extend  its provisions.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Ramsey</strong>:  First, I thank all those who made a contribution to the Committee, both in  person and through correspondence, over the last number of weeks. Those  contributions have given all members a wider view of the issues that will arise  as a result of implementing the directive, and I am grateful for the time put  in by departmental officials.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">In speaking to the motion, I stress that it is our duty in  the House and in Committee to ensure that the provisions over which we have  jurisdiction are implemented with a balance in mind of protecting workers and  minimising the cost to the wider business community.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">I will touch on a number of issues that arise as a result  of the consultation. As Barry McElduff said, they go to the very heart of what  the equality directive seeks to secure. I have written to the Minister for  Employment and Learning to ask him to investigate the possibility of establishing  a regional social partner agreement. I have some concerns, and I accept the  point that was raised by the Northern Ireland Committee of ICTU about not being  part of the formal consultation process. The national version of the agreement  agreed the 12-week qualifying period on behalf of the social partners, but  there has to be scope, Minister, for regional disparities in the workforce,  just as there are regional disparities among parts of Britain. We  need a regional agreement to help to address issues that will come forward in  future directives as well.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Central to many of the concerns of workers and their  representatives was the 12-week qualifying period in which to ensure that  equality is clearly in the workplace. That raised a number of concerns,  primarily the provision that 12 weeks is valid in the consideration of each  so-called assignment, rather than each hirer. That would give irresponsible  hirers the opportunity to effectively opt out of giving workers equality of  treatment by simply giving them assignments of a length that means that they do  not qualify. The qualifying period should be included when calculating holiday  entitlements for relevant workers.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">We need to know exactly how the anti-avoidance mechanisms  will be put in place. We received responses to the consultation from  stakeholders who were concerned about how the &pound;5,000 fine may be applied and  the general scope of any punishments for offending hirers.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">I agree, as have other Members, with the Law Centre&rsquo;s  contention that any terms and conditions of workers should include rates of  pay. The Department&rsquo;s employment agency inspects relevant agencies to ensure  that they comply with general terms and conditions, but we should look for a  more robust inspection programme from the employment agency to ensure that any  potential offenders are stopped. Furthermore, the rest period guarantee should  be valid from day one. If we truly want the spirit of the directive to work on  the ground, equality has to be the number one principle. I see no real reason  why businesses would not want to implement that.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">I will talk briefly about the provision for pregnant women  in the directive. That is clearly a fundamental issue. It seems only common  sense for women who find that they are pregnant to inform their primary point  of contact, which is usually the agency, which should then ensure that hirers  are informed correctly of the situation. It should not be the responsibility of  the worker to ensure that information is disseminated correctly. I do not see  how that could be detrimental to business. It does not require extra  administration, and it will give a lot of peace of mind not only to the worker  but the small business concerned, as it would know that it has performed its  duty responsibly.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">I share the view of the many respondents to the  consultation on the conditions of employment when a pregnant worker is moved to  more suitable employment. Again, in the interests of transparency and equality,  I see no reasons why her entitlements should not transfer with her to the new role,  and, in particular, why her working conditions or pay should change. That goes  back to trying to address the equality that is outlined clearly in the spirit  of the measure. That is something that we should endeavour to implement on the  ground from stage one.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">My time is running out. Clearly, the directive comes from  Europe, but I appeal to the Minister for some discretion to allow input from  the local unions in Northern    Ireland.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lyttle</strong>: I  am grateful for the opportunity to speak on behalf of the Alliance Party on  what is an issue of flexibility to the local economy and equality for our  workers. I, too, welcome the engagement that the Committee for Employment and  Learning has had with local business and workers on the issue and the public  examination that this European policy, which will impact the everyday lives of  people in Northern Ireland,  is receiving.</p>
		<p class="TimePeriod">12.30 pm</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">There seems to be a degree of agreement on many of the  directive&rsquo;s provisions and on the view that they will be a positive enhancement  of the rights of agency workers in Northern Ireland. However, the key  issues appear to be the extent of the provisions, the fairness of the 12-week  qualifying period and whether the UK Government&rsquo;s social partnership agreement  with the TUC and CBI is applicable to Northern   Ireland, given the disputed authority of the TUC in Northern Ireland  vis-&agrave;-vis the ICTU. There is also the issue of the time pressure to transpose  the directive before we incur costly infraction fines from Europe.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">It is welcome that, as a result of the directive, the basic  working and employment conditions of temporary agency workers will be the same  as permanent employees for the duration of their assignment. It is also to be  welcomed that the regulations will provide the same entitlement to rest time  and leave as for the permanent employee in lieu of entitlement for untaken  holidays. I also understand that the directive will make particular provision  for the protection of pregnant women and new mothers in the areas of health and  safety at work, antenatal attendance and rights to alternative work if  necessary, but I share the concern of some of my colleagues about how far the  directive goes on maternity rights. I am open to hearing more on that.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">There is a cost in the transposition of the directive to  local employers, and that cost increases significantly in the absence of a  qualifying period. The Minister must consider carefully how his decision in  that respect will balance workers&rsquo; rights and economic recovery in Northern Ireland.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">I join my Assembly colleagues in thanking the ICTU, the Law  Society, the CBI and everyone who submitted consultations to the Committee for  Employment and Learning. I recognise that there is some disagreement around the  fairness of the 12-week qualifying period for entitlement to those new  provisions and about whom such an agreement should be struck with. I understand  that the Department received clear legal advice that the agreement with the TUC  and CBI permits that provision in Northern Ireland, but a wider  debate appears to be required on the standing of ICTU in social partnership  agreements in the region.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">There are also wider concerns about the use of agency  workers in general, and the Committee has clearly taken those matters on board.  In particular, the issue of employees spending multiple years in temporary and  agency arrangements has caused significant concern, as has the disproportionate  number of women and ethnic minorities who find themselves in temporary  employment. The general percentage of the UK  workforce in temporary employment seems to be greater than in most other  developed economies, particularly Germany  and France.  The Assembly may need to return to those issues, and I ask that the Minister  consider all the issues that have been raised in the debate when applying the  agency workers directive in Northern    Ireland in as fair and timely a manner as  possible.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D McIlveen</strong>:  I find myself in complete agreement with my party colleague Mr Ross. We have to  accept that, although the debate is useful for airing the Committee&rsquo;s views on  the issue, we are powerless to do anything about the legislation. Whether we  like it or not, the legislation will come into effect on 1 October 2011, unless  further powers are given to the Assembly.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  I ask the Member to rethink his comment that we are powerless in the matter,  given that employment law is devolved to the Assembly.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member will have an extra minute added to his time.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D McIlveen</strong>:  I thank the Member for his intervention. I remind him that it is a European  directive, so &ldquo;powerless&rdquo; is perhaps not too strong a word to use.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">All Members will be united in wanting the rights of all  workers to be protected, and I believe that it is the ethical responsibility of  this House to do so. However, my concern about the legislation is twofold, and  perhaps, if nothing else, we can impress on the Minister the need to at least  make his feelings known to his counterpart in Westminster on behalf of the  Committee. First, does the legislation send a consistent message to the  business community? I believe that it does not. On one hand, the majority of  Members believe that advancing the role of our private sector will be key in  driving forward our economy, but, on the other hand, this legislation will lay  yet more cost and bureaucracy on our private sector.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">The Committee had a presentation from the Irish Congress of  Trade Unions, and its representatives very flippantly described private  business as crying wolf on the additional costs. I met representatives of a  business from my constituency yesterday, and they showed me in black and white  how, this year, they have already sustained a bill of &pound;600,000 as a result of  what was gauged to be a very small rise in the minimum wage. The same company&rsquo;s  most modest projections show that the cost of implementing the new legislation  will be in the region of &pound;300,000 this year. That bill of nearly &pound;1 million has  been forced on a private company as a result of what is seen as relatively  straightforward legislation. That sends out a very inconsistent message on how  we feel the role of our private sector should change in coming days.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">My second concern is that the timing of the legislation is  inappropriate. Times are still very difficult for businesses, and many firms  have no guarantee of work next week, let alone next month or next year. So, for  companies, the ability to employ and dismiss staff on a reasonably quick basis  &mdash; I highlight the phrase &ldquo;reasonably quick basis&rdquo; &mdash; is crucial to their  survival in these difficult economic times. This recession will not go on for  ever; there is an end to it. Therefore, I feel that implementing the  legislation at this stage is, perhaps, lacking a little in judgement.  Therefore, I urge the Minister to express concern to his counterpart over the  timing of the legislation.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">The ICTU&rsquo;s view is that the legislation will deal with the  issue of agency workers being the:</p>
		<p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;second-class citizens of the employment sphere.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">We have to be careful that employed citizens do not  go into the second-class citizen role in the employment sphere. Those employees  have gone through a rigorous recruitment process, and employers have invested  time, resources and experience in them. Agency staff would then be given  virtually the same rights. We are talking not about an unfair environment for  workers but about the resources that are invested in employees. A balance has  to be struck to ensure that agency workers do not force full-time employees  into a position of second-class citizenship.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Gildernew</strong>:  Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I welcome the opportunity to  debate this matter, and I welcome the Minister here today to hear about some of  the discussions that we have had in the Committee for Employment and Learning.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">When departmental officials came to the Committee to  provide a briefing on the agency workers directive, we discovered that trade  unions here had not managed to reach agreement with the Department. Alarm bells  immediately went off in my head about that lack of agreement, and, with a bit  of probing and questioning, it became clear that the trade union movement here  had strong opinions on this but the 12-week arrangement that the TUC was  bringing forward was out of kilter with what ICTU wanted to do.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">A TUC report published in 2007 shows that more than half of  agency staff would rather have a permanent job; a quarter of agency staff are  in assignments of more than a year and are not just filling a temporary need;  agency staff in post for more than a year do not gain the enhanced employment  rights that other workers enjoy after 12 months in a job, as they normally do  not have the legal rights of an employee; agency workers have no security of  tenure and can be made unemployed at any time; and agency staff are paid 80p  for every pound paid to permanent staff doing a similar job, according to a TUC  analysis of official statistics. Yet the TUC was party to the agreement reached  on the other side of the water.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">The TUC has no remit here. According to a letter from  Eugene McGlone to Danny Kennedy in January, the TUC has had no remit here since  1893. Nevertheless, ICTU, which is the trade union organisation responsible for  coming to this agreement, has been, if you like, frozen out. ICTU declined to sign  up to the existing agreement because the introduction of a 12-week qualifying  period would deny many temporary agency workers equal treatment. That means  that serious questions remain about going down that route.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">I was unable to attend the Employment and Learning  Committee last week, when the Law Centre, ICTU and others gave presentations,  but much in the papers that members received made sense. At a previous  Committee meeting, one of the issues that I raised was the right to maternity  leave and maternity pay for agency workers. I welcome the right of women to  attend antenatal clinics and so on, but I am concerned that enhanced  contractual maternity pay is not included in the directive and that the draft  regulations do not provide for entitlement to maternity leave. Therefore,  again, I am deeply concerned about the way we are going on this issue and the  fact that we are not taking into consideration the rights of some of the most  vulnerable people, such as elderly people, those with low educational attainment  and migrant workers. It is incumbent on us to ensure that we protect the rights  of such people.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">I was in the Chamber on the day of Jim Allister&rsquo;s speech.  He was also vocal on the issue in Committee, where his view was contrary to  mine and that of my colleague Barry McElduff. Jim Allister &mdash; I paraphrase  rather than directly quote him &mdash; stood in the Chamber and talked about the  Assembly being judged by how it treats minorities. Well, I think that our  society will be judged on how we treat our minorities. We have a situation here  in which the most vulnerable could be exploited.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">It is also worth mentioning that, given the current  economic situation, people have been made redundant or have lost their job.  Agency or temporary work might be all that is on offer, particularly for the  many unemployed skilled workers, notably in manufacturing.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>: The  Member made a valid point about the economic situation and how many people are  unemployed. There is an argument that many European directives that place  additional costs and burdens on businesses, rather than allowing businesses to  reinvest to expand and create more jobs, will result in jobs being lost. Does  she not buy into the argument that some regulations cost jobs rather than  resulting in desperately wanted new jobs in Northern Ireland?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member has an extra minute added to her time.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Gildernew</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">I do not buy that argument. As we work our way out of the  current economic climate and look for workers, we will be judged on how well we  look after those who best protect workers and encourage them back into the  economy. We and the Agricultural Wages Board debated the fact that we cannot  get agricultural workers to work at minimum wage levels. We need to ensure that  their rights are protected and their skills recognised.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">David McIlveen made the point that we were powerless, but  we are not. Indeed, as Agriculture Minister, I went to Europe  many times to argue that we should have regional variations and should seek  derogations to get the best deal for the people whom we represent. Those are  the people who vote us into the Assembly and look to us to enhance their  protections. Therefore, I ask the Minister to look seriously at this issue  again. Even at this late stage, try to find agreement with ICTU &mdash;</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member must bring her remarks to a close.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Gildernew</strong>:  &mdash; and try to make a better fist of it than thus far.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Business Committee has arranged to meet immediately upon the lunchtime  suspension. I propose, therefore, by leave of the Assembly, to suspend the  sitting until 2.00 pm. The first item of business when we return will be  Question Time.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The debate stood suspended.</p>

		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Question 11 has been withdrawn.</p>
		<p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Legal Aid</p>
		<p class="OralAnswers-Question">1. <strong>Mr  Hamilton </strong>asked the Minister of Justice for an update on the impact of his  decision to reduce fees paid to lawyers in legal aid cases.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 149/11-15<a name="AQO1491115"></a>)</p>
		<p class="OralAnswers-Question">4. <strong>Mr  McNarry </strong>asked the Minister of Justice what action he is taking to resolve  the dispute about legal aid fees. (AQO 152/11-15<a name="AQO1521115"></a>)</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford (The  Minister of Justice)</strong>: With permission, Mr Deputy Speaker, I will answer  questions 1 and 4 together. The new remuneration arrangements came into effect  on 13 April 2011. Since then and up to 24 June, 254 defendants have been left  without representation in Crown Court cases due to the withdrawal of the  solicitors&rsquo; firms that had previously represented them. A further 19 defendants  may be unrepresented in cases where 13 firms have not notified the court  service that they may have withdrawn, but no defence certificate for legal aid  in the Crown Court proceedings has been applied for.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">My officials in the Courts and Tribunals Service have  written to all solicitors&rsquo; firms in Northern Ireland asking whether  they are willing to take on Crown Court work under the new remuneration  arrangements. They have compiled a list of firms willing to carry out legally  aided Crown Court work. Eight firms are on the list. The list has been provided  to all defendants who are unrepresented and to defendants who, it is thought,  may not have representation. The Courts and Tribunals Service has also compiled  a list of barristers who are willing to work at the new rates, including  barristers from outside Northern    Ireland. The list has been provided to any  solicitor who is experiencing difficulty in instructing counsel. In addition,  three firms of solicitors from England  and Wales  have approached the Courts and Tribunals Service to ask about being included on  the list. We are seeking to confirm whether the Law Society will allow them to  take on work in Northern    Ireland.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his response. I assure him of my support and that of  my colleagues on this side of the Chamber in his attempt to lower Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  disgracefully large legal aid bill. In seeking an alternative way forward, has  the Minister considered instigating a US-style public defender&rsquo;s office? In  pursuing and examining that, has he considered how easy that might be to do?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  thank Mr Hamilton for his supplementary question. I am considering all possible  options to ensure that defendants have access to justice. It is my hope and my  effort to date to ensure that defendants obtain solicitors and barristers under  the usual arrangements who are prepared to work at the new legally enforced  rates of remuneration. I could also invite solicitors and barristers from outside  Northern Ireland  to take on Crown Court work on the same basis as applies. As I have said  already, we have had indications of interest, without seeking them, from firms  of solicitors in England and  Wales  that are keen to work here.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Another option would be for the Legal Services Commission  to arrange for legal advice and representation to be provided directly to  unrepresented defendants. Mr Hamilton referred to a US-style public defender&rsquo;s  system. I suspect that that might create concerns about the quality of justice;  however, it already operates successfully in part in England  and Wales.  The legislation is already in place under the Access to Justice (Northern Ireland)  Order 2003 for the Legal Services Commission to engage directly should it wish  and should it be necessary to ensure access to justice for defendants.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his answer to that very interesting question from my  colleague Simon Hamilton. The Minister has said previously that, if we could  not get a resolution to the current situation, he would take another look at  the options. From the tone of what the Minister said, I gather that he is  either being driven or is willingly looking outside the box on the issue. Does  one of those options not include a compromise with local lawyers, or does he  have options, other than those that he stated, that would be a resolution? Does  he see that forthcoming?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  thank Mr McNarry for his supplementary question. He talked about the  possibility of compromise. However, the House should be aware that the new  rates of pay under the regulations are now in force. They are legally in place  because the regulations were laid before the House and were accepted by the  Committee and, by default, by the House as a whole. Therefore, there is no  compromise on changing the rates. There is no way that David Ford, by the  stroke of a pen, can give solicitors and barristers what they want. The  compromise &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span> There is no legal  process by which the Minister could make a compromise, if that is what is being  talked about.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">There is also no way in which, within budget, we could pay  the rates that are sought by certain members of the legal profession. I have  offered a significantly earlier than usual review of the new rates to see where  there are anomalies and to see whether there are issues that need to be  addressed in reforming the rates that are now in force. However, that requires  solicitors and barristers to work normally, so that we can ascertain what the  facts of the case are. I believe that that is a compromise. That is what I have  offered to the Bar Council and the Law Society, and my officials have written  to them about the detail of it. I hope that we will see constructive engagement  in order that we will see defendants being represented and victims of crime  seeing their cases proceed speedily.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lynch</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for his answer.  Can the Minister give an assurance that defendants&rsquo; trials will not be unduly  delayed as a result of this issue?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  thank the Member for asking a question about what is clearly an important issue  for defendants and victims. It is important for them to see that the cases are  proceeded with. Given where we are and because most of these Crown Court cases  are unlikely to proceed before September or October at the earliest, the  reality is that there is no significant delay at the moment, although there is  the potential that some people could be delayed in making a valid bail  application, if they are not properly represented. As my first priority, I am  seeking to get the existing system working properly, with Northern Ireland  solicitors and barristers carrying out the duties at the rates of remuneration  that are now in force. If that does not turn out to be the case, I will  certainly not shrink from other options to ensure that there is access to  justice for defendants and justice being seen to be done for victims.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  It is unhelpful for the Minister to adopt an uncompromising approach to this problem.  It would be better if the Minister reopened discussions with the Law Society  and the Bar Council to see whether there is some basis for a compromise, as Mr  McNarry suggested, on the basis of their proposals, which&mdash;</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I ask the Member to come to a question.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  &mdash; were verified as being within budget.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  fear that Mr Maginness has not appreciated the point that I have tried to make:  the new regulations are in force, and the Assembly has accepted the new rates  of remuneration. Therefore, the suggestion that I am uncompromising is  completely off the mark. The simple position is that proposals were put forward  by the Department, accepted by the Committee and not rejected by the Assembly  and, therefore, have the force of law. No compromise can be made about those  rates.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">The compromise is that I have offered an early review. We  will see how the arrangements work and whether there are anomalies. I have  engaged with the Law Society and the Bar Council; I have offered them that. I  have asked my officials to engage in detail with them, and that is the  compromise. The compromise is not to suggest somehow that I should accept from  the two professional bodies a proposal that was uncosted, could not be costed,  would have significantly exceeded the budget available for legal aid and would  have resulted in cost pressures being met from other aspects of public  expenditure in Northern Ireland that, I believe, deserve equal priority. I  suspect that few Members would wish to see us shifting funds from the budget  for health and social services, for example, into the funding of legal aid,  when Northern Ireland  will still have the most generous system in western Europe.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Allister</strong>:  With regard to the unfortunate situation that has arisen, has the Minister any  concern about the impact on the quality of justice? I ask him to bear in mind  the incident in Newry Crown Court on 9 June, when a novice solicitor made the  schoolboy error of being willing to see someone returned on a charge where they  could face 14 years&rsquo; imprisonment, without ever having received or read the  papers in the case. Is there not a live concern, therefore, about the impact on  the quality of justice? Might that concern be intensified if &mdash;</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: One question please.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Allister</strong>:  &mdash; if, during this dispute, there are difficulties dealing with custody  interviews?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  am not quite sure precisely what Mr Allister meant by his last remark. Let me  make it clear that I am not here to discuss any individual case. What is  absolutely clear is that I am committed to ensuring access to justice and the  best quality of justice, but it also has to be the best quality of justice that  is affordable. The simple position is that it was not possible, with the budget  that I am obliged to live within, to meet the rates of remuneration requested  by certain solicitors and certain members of the Bar. I am seeking to provide  the highest possible quality of justice within a budget, not on an open-ended  expenditure list.</p>
		<p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Craigavon: Rioting</p>
		<p class="OralAnswers-Question">2. <strong>Mr  Moutray </strong>asked the Minister of Justice to outline the cost of the riotous  behaviour over 12 July 2010 in the Craigavon area. (AQO 150/11-15<a name="AQO1501115"></a>)</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>:  Regrettably, there were several incidents of disorder in the Craigavon area on  12 July 2010, principally in Lurgan. Those included attacks on police officers,  using petrol bombs and other missiles, and the hijacking of vehicles, including  a train carrying 55 passengers. The Police Service advised that the cost of  officer hours for policing 12 July in Lurgan last year was approximately  &pound;41,000. That figure covers the total cost of the policing operation. In  addition, there was the cost of the damage to the hijacked train, which amounted  to over &pound;20,000, and the cost of damage to the other vehicles that were  hijacked. That is not to mention the cost in lost revenue for local businesses  and the potential impact on tourism. However, there are wider costs than the  financial ones. Those who suffer most are clearly the local community. There  can be no doubt that that type of wanton and destructive violence has an  unwelcome and detrimental impact on those who live in the area. The  perpetrators need to wake up to that.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">In the past couple of days, Northern Ireland has occupied the  headlines for our sporting excellence, bringing with it the prospect of  continuing to improve our reputation internationally. Unfortunately, it is not  just a matter of Craigavon on 12 July. Following the scenes of violence last  night in east Belfast,  that image has been replaced by one of rioting. Quite simply, those scenes were  a disgrace, and I condemn those involved for the damage, fear and disruption  that they created in their own community. There is no justification for the  scenes we saw last night. I welcome the efforts of the police and community  representatives who stepped forward to seek to restore order.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">It is vital that the Executive and Members of the Assembly,  with other agencies and community leaders, work together to build a shared  future and to divert our young people from becoming involved in this criminal  and destructive activity in Craigavon, Belfast  or anywhere else.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Moutray</strong>:  Thank you, Minister, for that response. I concur with your remarks about last  night&rsquo;s trouble. Given the significant financial resources spent in relation to  riotous behaviour in Craigavon last July, will the Minister outline what  effective measures will be put in place to circumvent such happenings this year  and to allow the people of Craigavon a peaceful holiday period?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  am sure that the Member does not expect me to go into the detail of any  operational planning that the Police Service might be putting into place, which  is a responsibility for the Chief Constable and not for me. The responsibility  that we in the Department have is to do what we can to promote diversionary  activity, to build on the community safety work being done by my officials and  in conjunction with Craigavon Community Safety Partnership and to ensure that  every possible effort is put forward in seeking to divert people from that kind  of trouble. Unfortunately, however, because of what we have seen in Belfast over the past few  days, I suspect that we may expect to face certain difficulties this summer,  which I believe every Member of the House would wish to avoid.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dallat</strong>:  Does the Minister agree that, where riots can be linked to or associated with  particular organisers, those organisers should get the bill for the damage  caused to public property, in the same way as football clubs are heavily  penalised when their overenthusiastic supporters run riot and rip up the seats?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  suspect we probably all agree with Mr Dallat that, where people are responsible  for organising riots, they should be made to pay for it. I am not sure,  however, that that is a practical proposition, as opposed to something that  would be an aspiration.</p>
		<p class="TimePeriod">2.15 pm</p>
		<p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Road Safety: Scramblers and Quad Bikes</p>
		<p class="OralAnswers-Question">3. <strong>Mr P  Maskey </strong>asked the Minister of Justice what plans his Department has to  introduce legislation in relation to scramblers and quad bikes. (AQO 151/11-15<a name="AQO1511115"></a>)</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>:  Road safety matters are primarily the responsibility of the Department of the  Environ&shy;ment (DOE), but related issues, such as criminal law and enforcement,  clearly fall to my Department. Therefore, I work closely with the Environment  Minister to address road traffic and safety matters, including problems with  off-road vehicles.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">On the justice side, the law against nuisance vehicles was  strengthened in 2008. New police powers were put in place to seize and retain  vehicles that were being used to alarm, distress or annoy. We all know how  dangerous scramblers and off-road vehicles can be. That was exemplified by the  recent tragic death in north Belfast  of 12-year-old Daniel Mooney, who fell from the back of a scrambler. I know  that Members will join me in extending heartfelt sympathies to Daniel&rsquo;s  parents, relations and friends on their bereavement.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Maskey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I, too, extend my sympathies to  Daniel&rsquo;s family and to everyone who has lost someone as a result of a tragic  accident involving a quad or scrambler throughout the years. It is a massive  issue, and it was picked up in the recent canvassing campaign prior to the  elections. Quads and scramblers are being used in some of our parks and fields,  and are destroying them. People are buying quad bikes or scramblers without  having tax or insurance. I appreciate that some of the responsibility lies with  the DOE, but there needs to be joint working between the Minister&rsquo;s Department  and the Department of the Environment. Hopefully, we will see some sort of  legislation in the future.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  am entirely open to appropriate further legislation. However, in the context of  nuisance vehicles and issues relating to insurance, there is probably more of a  case to be made for enforcing existing legislation than passing new  legislation. However, if the Member or any other Member has specific  suggestions, I will work with the Minister of the Environment to see what can  be done.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Campbell</strong>:  In addition to the tragic death that the Minister and the Member opposite  referred to, there are occasions when antisocial behaviour is linked to  off-road vehicles. Will the Minister undertake to work in conjunction with the  Department of the Environment to ensure that it will try to diminish the  effects, particularly on elderly people, of young people driving those vehicles  at weekends and accessing land and property illegally?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: The  Member has highlighted the sort of issue that is raised by vehicles being used  to annoy and create disturbance. The detail is to ensure that we work  proactively to cut down on that. For example, a number of community safety  partnerships have sought to educate people away from that kind of behaviour, as  well as enforcing the law when it happens.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>: I  agree with those who spoke about the seriousness of the issue. It causes a  nuisance right across the North. Will the Minister tell us how many of those  nuisance vehicles have been seized since the introduction of the law?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  cannot give the Member the detail of how many vehicles have been seized since  the introduction of the law, but I know that there have been only two vehicle  seizures in the past six months. There may frequently be a safety issue with  regard to dealing with the incidents where they actually occur. It can be  difficult to safely stop and apprehend people who use those vehicles.  Therefore, the police need the assistance of local communities to identify  perpetrators so that they can be dealt with somewhere other than where the  incident is actually happening.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Question 4 was grouped with question 1.</p>
		<p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Community Safety</p>
		<p class="OralAnswers-Question">5. <strong>Ms J  McCann </strong>asked the Minister of Justice what percentage of the policing and  justice budget has been allocated for community safety in the current financial  year. (AQO 153/11-15<a name="AQO1531115"></a>)</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  can confirm that approximately 15% of the core budget of the Department of  Justice has been allocated to community safety in the current financial year.  That figure excludes funding allocated to arm&rsquo;s-length bodies and agencies. In  monetary terms, it means that just over &pound;6&middot;9 million has been allocated to  community safety for this financial year. However, Members should note that, as  well as allocating funding directly to community safety, my Department ensures  that additional resources are available through the requirement to secure match  funding. The net result is that significant funding has been allocated to  community safety in the current year.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms J McCann</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his answer. Given the success of many of the locally  based community safety forums, such as the West Belfast Community Safety Forum,  which works in partnership with organisations that have a responsibility for  community safety, will the Minister give us an assurance that they will be  resourced and financed in the way that they need to be to carry on and develop  those initiatives?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  appreciate the point that Ms McCann has raised. I cannot give her an absolute  guarantee that the West Belfast Community Safety Forum will be funded  indefinitely. However, I can confirm that funding for the facilitator post has  been extended until 31 March 2012, so that time is taken to assess the most  appropriate model for delivering local engagement on community safety in west Belfast. Clearly, there  are community safety issues on which we would like to spend significantly more  money. However, the fact is that budgetary pressures on the Department do not  always make that easy. I am concerned to ensure that money that is allocated to  community safety from limited resources is used in the best possible way and to  assess the good work that is being done both by formal community safety  partnerships and by informal local groups such as the one that the Member  highlighted.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Eastwood</strong>:  Will the Minister ensure that the new policing and community safety  partnerships act in accordance with the spirit of the Patten report, so that local  neighbourhood policing is truly community policing?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>:  Certainly. I am happy to endorse Mr Eastwood&rsquo;s comment. It is certainly the  Department&rsquo;s intention to put forward proposals for the new amalgamated or  extended policing and community safety partnerships so that the spirit that has  gone through the DPPs since the Patten report will be carried forward. Some  Committee members were concerned that the consultation document did not reflect  that fully. It has, therefore, been revised to take account of views that have  been expressed by Members of the House.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lyttle</strong>:  What is the Minister&rsquo;s assessment of how well the various Departments&rsquo;  interventions and initiatives on community safety are being joined up?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: The  Member asks a question that applies to every aspect of public expenditure.  There is absolutely no doubt that we have seen good work done in many community  safety partnerships to join up the responsibilities of different bodies. The  way in which the new policing and community safety partnerships will function  will bring a number of statutory bodies into a wider role while preserving what  Mr Eastwood has just referred to: the existing pattern of DPPs in the policing  committees of those partnerships. It seems absolutely clear that, if we are  really to make communities safer, we need to look at the role of a number of  Departments, not simply the Department of Justice and its agencies, to ensure  that we get maximum benefit. I am certainly keen to work with other Departments  to ensure that that benefit is maximised and to get the best possible results  for the entire community.</p>
		<p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Police: Part-time Reserve Gratuity Scheme</p>
		<p class="OralAnswers-Question">6. <strong>Mr  Hussey </strong>asked the Minister of Justice to outline the current situation  regarding payments under the gratuity scheme for the police part-time Reserve.  (AQO 154/11-15<a name="AQO1541115"></a>)</p>
		<p class="OralAnswers-Question">10. <strong>Mr  Buchanan </strong>asked the Minister of Justice what discussions he has had with the  Secretary of State, the Northern Ireland Office and Her Majesty&rsquo;s Revenue and  Customs concerning the proposal to tax the &pound;20m gratuity package for the police  part-time Reserve. (AQO 158/11-15)</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>:  With permission, I will answer questions 6 and 10 together. The current  situation with regard to the part-time Reserve gratuity scheme is that 6,228  applications for the gratuity payment were received. They have all been put  through the verification process. It is the Department&rsquo;s intention to make  payment to verified applicants as soon as possible. We are, however, awaiting  the view of the Chancellor of the Exchequer on the tax and National Insurance  treatment of those payments. Officials from my Department have been in contact  with Her Majesty&rsquo;s Revenue and Customs (HMRC) since the devolution of justice,  when I was given responsibility for administering the police part-time Reserve gratuity  scheme as set out by the Northern Ireland Office. HMRC advice has consistently  been that, since those payments relate to an individual&rsquo;s employment and do not  fall within any existing exemptions, they will be liable to tax and National  Insurance. Liability will depend on the individual&rsquo;s tax status. The DOJ has  always understood that HMRC is able to operate only within the parameters of  existing tax law. However, I have raised the issue again with the Chancellor  with a view to finding an equitable solution. I have also written previously to  the Secretary of State with regard to tax and National Insurance issues. DOJ  officials have been in contact with NIO officials on a number of occasions.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hussey</strong>: I  declare an interest. Does the Minister agree that the attempt by Her Majesty&rsquo;s  Revenue and Customs to take more than its pound of flesh &mdash; &pound;7&middot;5 million or &pound;9  million, depending on whatever figure it uses &mdash; is totally unacceptable and  that, perhaps, it should use the system that was used by the Ministry of  Defence for the Ulster Defence Regiment and the Royal Irish Regiment?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  am afraid that I cannot agree with the Member&rsquo;s assessment that HMRC seeks more  than its pound of flesh. As I understand it, the issues are different from  those that were raised by the Ministry of Defence in connection with the UDR  and RIR gratuity. All that my officials who seek to administer the scheme can  do is to follow the advice that they are given.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Spratt</strong>:  Despite all Mr Hussey&rsquo;s blustering about the issue, will the Minister confirm  that more than 50% of the initial applications had to be returned? Will he also  confirm that whatever time is necessary will be taken to verify those claims,  so that everyone in the system is allowed to be included in the appeal process?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  certainly confirm that a significant number of the original applications had to  be returned in order to verify certain aspects. However, I cannot be sure  whether it was exactly the proportion that Mr Spratt speaks of. Those who  administer the scheme seek to do so as speedily as possible and in line with  the law under which they are required to operate.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Buchanan</strong>:  Does the Minister agree that it is totally unacceptable that the package that  was given as a gratuity is now being taxed? Will he do all in his power to  ensure that the proposed tax on that gratuity is waived?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: All  I can do is administer the scheme that was handed to me by the Northern Ireland  Office in accordance with the law. As I said in my initial answer, given the  concerns that were expressed, I took the opportunity to raise the issue again  with the Chancellor of the Exchequer when I met him last week. It had been  raised with the Prime Minister the previous week. The only way in which any  change will be made to the scheme is if additional funding is granted. Other  than that, I can work only within the legislation that I am required to work  under and within the sum of money that was set aside by the Northern Ireland  Office.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member is not in his place for question 7.</p>
		<p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Rosemary Nelson Inquiry</p>
		<p class="OralAnswers-Question">8. <strong>Mr  McDevitt </strong>asked the Minister of Justice what action he intends to take as a  result of the Rosemary Nelson inquiry report.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   (AQO 156/11-15<a name="AQO1561115"></a>)</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  have read the inquiry report, and my assessment is that the findings of the  inquiry relate to a policing and security environment that has been largely  overtaken by fundamental reforms of the police. In addition, many of the issues  relate to the PPS, the Security Service and the NIO, which are outside my area  of responsibility. I have, however, taken actions that, I think, will be  helpful. I have spoken to the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and have  been given assurances about the current limited home protection scheme, in  particular assurances that adequate arrangements are in place to ensure that  the problems that occurred in the past will not happen again. I have also  written to the PSNI and the PPS about the security of documentary material and  to the Law Society to ascertain whether it has any remaining concerns about the  protection of its members.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  I am sure that the Minister will agree that the report marks a seminal moment  in the acid test of whether the Assembly is capable of taking the difficult  decisions outworking themselves from the devolution of policing and justice.  Does the Minister have any intention of weeding out of his Department the  securocrats formerly attached to the NIO who were so severely criticised in the  Rosemary Nelson report?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  must say that I find that question interesting, particularly when I remember  the comments made by Mr McDevitt as we finished the debate on the Justice Bill  before the election. He referred to the Justice Bill as a sign that things had  changed. He actually said that, when he looked down the Chamber and saw the  people sitting in the Box, he could think of them as being from the DOJ and not  the NIO. On that basis, it seems slightly surprising that, faced with a report  dealing with events that happened 12 or more years ago, he is somehow keen to present  officials of the Department of Justice as if they were NIO securocrats. I do  not recognise that as a description of anyone who works in the Department of  Justice. It is not what I see in the attitude of those who work for and with me  on a daily basis. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  see people who are committed to working under a devolved system in entirely  different circumstances and are keen to work in a different way.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">I must say that I also find it funny that we seem to be in  a position where those who were members of the RUC can be reformed as members  of the PSNI and those who have backgrounds that include criminal records can be  reformed as Members of the Assembly but anyone who has ever worked for the  Northern Ireland Office is somehow tainted for life, meaning that it is  impossible for them to be considered as having a new way of operating.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">While we are on the topic, there are no officials in the  Department of Justice who were members of the Senior Civil Service at the time  that is covered by the Rosemary Nelson report.</p>
		<p class="TimePeriod">2.30 pm</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: That concludes questions to the Minister of Justice.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Givan</strong>: On  a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>A Member</strong>:  You cannot take a point of order during Question Time.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: It is a point of order that relates to this Question Time. I am  taking the point of order.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Givan</strong>: A  number of Members asked supplementary questions to question 1. I do not know if  some of those Members are still members of the Bar, but it may well have been  necessary for them to declare an interest, and I do not recall that being done.  I accept that Members do not declare interests on all occasions, and that is  fine. However, I would like the Speaker&rsquo;s Office to rule on that issue and come  back to the House.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: It is correct that any Member speaking on any issue in which they  have a particular interest should declare that interest. Under Standing Order  69(4), Members must declare any interest before they speak in any debate or  proceedings.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Allister</strong>:  Further to that point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. I apologise for neglecting  to declare the fact that I have been and am a member of the Bar of Northern  Ireland.</p>

		<p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Railways: North-west</p>
		<p class="OralAnswers-Question">1. <strong>Mr  Sheehan </strong>asked the Minister for Regional Development when the upgrade to the  railway line in the north-west will commence and be completed. (AQO 164/11-15<a name="AQO1641115"></a>)</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy (The  Minister for Regional Development)</strong>: I thank the Member for his question.  The original plans for the Coleraine to Londonderry  track relay project would have resulted in the completion of the project by  2013, and that was to coincide with the introduction to service of all 20 new  trains. However, the Budget that was approved by the Assembly and the Executive  makes provision for the commencement of the track relay in 2014. That reflects  the capital budget that is available &mdash; &pound;20 million in year 4 of the Budget  period. It is not possible to start the work on the main relay earlier than  2014 for that reason.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">The project was originally envisaged to take two years to  complete, and, on that basis, I hope that the project will be completed in the  financial year 2015-16. A revision of the current approved economic appraisal  will be required, and that will also be subject to funding in the next  comprehensive spending review.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Translink has identified interim measures to be taken to  ensure the continued running and safety of the line up to 2014. It is its  intention to maintain services until the project is completed, and funding has  been provided for that purpose over the next two years.</p>

In respect of the Derry to Coleraine line, can the Minister assure me  that looping systems will be implemented as commutes to Derry  city will terminate before 9.00 am?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  I am grateful to the Member for his supplementary question. Some changes are  envisaged for the Coleraine to Londonderry  stretch of the line, and I have no doubt that those will be appropriately  managed by Translink.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dallat</strong>: I  have enormous sympathy for the Minister. He inherited this wanton neglect,  which should have been attended to during the last Assembly. Given that Derry  will be the City of Culture  in 2013, will the Minister make a serious case to the Executive to find the  necessary funding for the project? I find it an absolute disgrace that an  intercity service will have speed limits imposed on it at a time when the  numbers of those who use it have doubled. I appeal to the Minister, and I  attach no blame to him for the neglect of the past.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  I am grateful to the Member for the non-attachment of blame. I have ongoing  concerns, but, in the current financial climate, particularly with respect to  my departmental budget, I must be honest with the House and say that the  earliest date that I am able to indicate is 2014. If things improve, we will  seek to bring the project forward. I am aware of the Member&rsquo;s long-standing  interest in the issue. It gives me no pleasure to relay that news to the House,  but I have to be honest.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>: I  thank the Minister for that information. Had it not been for the Assembly, we  would not have a Belfast to Londonderry  line because Minister Spellar would have closed it.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Will the Minister take back to Translink an issue that has  been unresolved for some time? I refer to an express service from Ballymena to Belfast. Given the  important place that Ballymena plays in relation to the transport hub of the  region, it is important that we have an improved service. With the introduction  of new trains &mdash;</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The question is about &mdash;</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  In that case, this line will not be sacrificed.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I remind Members that questions should be short. There are many  questions to go through, and statements are not required at this time.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  I will draw the Member&rsquo;s remarks to the attention of Translink.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Swann</strong>: My  question will be like myself &mdash; short. Work on the railway line is likely to be  disruptive for passengers. Will the Minister advise how Translink will minimise  disruption for passengers from Ballymena and Ballymoney during that work?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  I am grateful to the Member for his supplementary question. Unfortunately,  there will be some inconvenience, and it will be Translink&rsquo;s responsibility to  manage that. I have every confidence that it will do so professionally. I am happy  to be kept updated on progress and will seek updates regularly if particular  problems emerge.</p>
		<p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Cullybackey    Link Road</p>
		<p class="OralAnswers-Question">2. <strong>Mr D  McIlveen </strong>asked the Minister for Regional Development what progress has been  made on the planned link road around Cullybackey. (AQO 165/11-15<a name="AQO1651115"></a>)</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  Roads Service has been involved in discussions with the potential housing  developers as part of the planning application on the line of the Cullybackey  throughpass. I can advise that an agreed housing layout, which includes the  construction of the central portion of the throughpass, received planning  approval in June 2007. A revised planning application was submitted in July  2008, which also included the throughpass element, and was being processed by  the Planning Service but has now been withdrawn by the developer. However, the  original approval remains live.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">To date, the developer has not started work on the housing  development, and there is no indication of when it might progress. The  completion of the throughpass is not included in any current major works  programme. However, Roads Service has stated its commitment to the completion  of the remainder of the route and has progressed preliminary design of the  throughpass.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Roads Service has considered how the scheme might be  provided. It would probably be in two or more parts, following on from the  section to be constructed by the developer. As with all proposed works,  delivery of the throughpass will be subject to the programming of schemes on a  priority basis, successful acquisition of lands and availability of funding. At  present, the scheme is not high enough on our priority list to secure funding.  However, I assure the Member that it remains part of Roads Service&rsquo;s plans, and  the service intends to avail itself of any opportunities for progress by  developers or other funding opportunities that may become available.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D McIlveen</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his answer. I am conscious that, for anyone outside North Antrim, this issue does not have a lot of  relevance, but it is an important issue in the constituency. I have spoken to a  number of my council colleagues in North Antrim,  and some of them bear testimony to the fact that the issue has been discussed  since the 1960s, so it has been on the agenda for some time. I am conscious  that budgets are tight. The Minister mentioned that the issue is not a  priority. When will it become a priority? When will it be our turn?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  I am grateful for the Member&rsquo;s supplementary question. It seems that almost  every road that has not been completed was promised in the 1960s. I understand  the importance of the road to Cullybackey. It is a throughpass not a bypass. In  the scheme of things, it does not represent a major investment, but there have  been unfortunate hold-ups.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">It was hoped that the scheme would run in conjunction with  the planned development. As that development has not taken place, we will  continue to monitor the situation to see whether earlier progress can be made.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Nesbitt</strong>:  Does the Minister agree that there is great disquiet, not just about the  failure of the Cullybackey link, but about the many smaller road proposals that  are on hold because of the cut in capital expenditure, while the A5 proposals  seem to sail on impervious to the current downturn in economic conditions?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  I am grateful to the Member for his question, and I understand his point. There  is increasing debate and reflection on whether we should be improving existing  roads instead of attempting to build new ones. That comment does not relate to  the current planning inquiry into the A5 and A8 schemes. I am anxious to await  the outcome of those public inquiries and will give careful consideration to  their findings. However, the question of improving or maintaining existing  roads goes back to the current financial position that I find myself in as  Minister. It is quite a challenge.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Allister</strong>:  I am disappointed that the Minister was unable to bring any timely good news  about the Cullybackey throughpass. Is the essence of his answer that, by  hitching that scheme to the planned development, several years have been lost?  If that is so, does that not increase the need for Roads Service to treat the  throughpass as a Roads Service scheme in its own right and, as such, to  complete it?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  I am grateful to the Member for his contribution. All schemes have to be  considered according to their importance and cost, but they must meet a number  of priorities. Unfortunately, the Cullybackey throughpass does not appear to  have made progress on that. That is not to say that Roads Service will not  continue to consider the scheme&rsquo;s potential. However, it was hoped that the  housing development project linked to the throughpass improvement would advance  the scheme. Unfortunately, time and other factors, including the housing  downturn, contributed to the lack of progress.</p>
		<p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Roads: Ards Peninsula</p>
		<p class="OralAnswers-Question">3. <strong>Mr  McNarry </strong>asked the Minister for Regional Development what action is being  taken to reduce the number of public liability claims made against Roads  Service as a result of poor road surfaces in the Ards Peninsula.  (AQO 166/11-15<a name="AQO1661115"></a>)</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  I am grateful to the Member for his question, although given his success and prowess  in the art competition, I half expected it to be in the form of a rhyming  couplet.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">I acknowledge that there is considerable room for  improvement in Northern    Ireland&rsquo;s road network. I remind the House  that I inherited a budget and programme of improvement works that limit the  finance available for structural maintenance and will result in further  reductions in conditions during the next four years. However, given the limited  funding that I have for road maintenance, I assure the Member that the Ards Peninsula  is receiving its fair share of the available funds. That said, Roads Service  has in place an ongoing roads maintenance regime, which means that all adopted  roads and footways, including those in the Ards Peninsula,  are inspected regularly, and any defects are noted for repair.</p>
		<p class="TimePeriod">2.45 pm</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Essentially, the safety standards and procedures currently  in operation establish frequencies &mdash; I will have to speak to my officials &mdash; for  road inspections that are dependent on traffic volumes and specify response times  for the repair of defects. The safety standards were last reviewed in 2009, and  they continue to provide a systematic approach to road maintenance management.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">I reassure the Member that the maintenance of road and  footway surfaces and their underlying structure continues to be a high priority  for Roads Service. Throughout the current financial year, funds will continue  to be directed to the maintenance and upgrading of roads services across the  Ards Borough Council area. That investment is aimed at improving road  conditions and therefore reducing the likelihood of public liability claims.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his answer. If he intends to do poetic justice to my  question, perhaps I can remind him of the personal promises that he has made to  me &mdash; imaginary or otherwise &mdash; on what needs to be done in the Ards Peninsula.  So, in light of the Audit Office&rsquo;s concerns about the proportion of resources  used for patching and repairs and compensation, does the Minister acknowledge  the necessity of maintaining our roads? Will he advise us on what schemes are  planned for the Ards area and tell us whether they include very necessary  repairs in Ballyhalbert?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  I am grateful to the Member for his supplementary question. The maintenance  regime is important. Inspection frequencies vary from daily cycles for  motorways to four-monthly cycles for carriageways that carry low volumes of  traffic. There are safety standards that were last reviewed in 2006 and  continue to provide a systematic approach to road maintenance management.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">I assure him that all of the roads in the Ards Peninsula  area are regularly reviewed and, where problems exist, we seek to take action  to identify them. My officials are currently embarking on their regular tour of  local district councils to present the divisional manager&rsquo;s report, which  contains the more detailed schemes for Ards and the other council areas. I will  ensure that the Member is provided with an early copy of the list of schemes  that are planned for the Ards Borough Council area.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  Through the Minister, I congratulate the local section office in Ards for its  resurfacing of a large stretch of the Kircubbin to Portaferry road recently. If  and when resources permit, will he ensure that equal concentration is given to  the other side of the Ards   Peninsula and the A2,  particularly around Ballywalter, Ballyhalbert and Portavogie?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  I hear the Member&rsquo;s plea and will refer it back to our local officials.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his responses.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">I do not know how long it has been since the Minister  visited the Ards Peninsula, but I invite him to come down as soon as possible,  as Ards Borough Council has invited him. I will show him the Ballyeasborough Road, the Gransha Road, the Ballygelagh Road  and the Springfield Road.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Question.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  Those roads are abysmal, particularly after the Water Service has left them.  That is a big problem: when the Water Service leaves a road, the Roads Service  does not want to come back.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. The Member knows well that this is Question Time.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  I am asking a question. When will the Roads Service come and tell the Water  Service that roads of the type I describe need to be replaced and resurfaced?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  My sense is that the Member has run out of road. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">However, he does make an important point. I have the same  representations made to me, as a Member, by constituents who are every bit as concerned  about the condition, maintenance and structure of local roads. That gives rise  to the debate that I mentioned earlier about whether it is better to maintain  the roads that we have or simply build new roads. I am interested in the  Member&rsquo;s views on that and the views of other Members, if they wish to relay  them to me.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">However, I pay tribute to all my staff in the section  offices for their ability to identify road projects and improvements. They are  working very hard with limited resources, and they deserve congratulations, not  criticism.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Question 4 has been withdrawn.</p>
		<p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Car Parking: Charges</p>
		<p class="OralAnswers-Question">5. <strong>Mr  Givan </strong>asked the Minister for Regional Development for an update on the  review of on-street car parking charges. (AQO 168/11-15<a name="AQO1681115"></a>)</p>
		<p class="OralAnswers-Question">10. <strong>Mr B  McCrea </strong>asked the Minister for Regional Development for his assessment of  the potential impact of on-street car parking charges on town centre  regeneration. (AQO 173/11-15<a name="AQO1731115"></a>)</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  I am grateful to the Member. He nearly got the answer for question 4. With the  Deputy Speaker&rsquo;s permission, I will reply to questions 5 and 10 together.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">I am currently carrying out a review of my Department&rsquo;s  proposal to introduce on-street parking charges in 30 towns across Northern Ireland.  I intend to make an announcement on the issue in due course. As part of the  review, I met a number of local representatives and traders from across Northern Ireland  and listened to their concerns. I will carefully consider their views on the  proposal before I make my decision.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Givan</strong>: I  thank the Minister for that response. Lisburn already has on-street car parking  charging. A complaint often made to representatives is that if charging was  brought in to ease traffic movement, why is charging starting at 8.00 am and  continuing through to 6.00 pm? When the Minister is looking at the review, can  it be considered that those times should change? If it is to do with traffic  movement, charging could be from 10.00 am to 4.00 pm, as opposed to the current  arrangements. Perhaps that can be brought into the wider review, not just in  Lisburn but in other areas as well.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  The Member raises a fair and reasonable point, which I am prepared to look at  as quickly as possible. A great deal of consultation was undertaken to agree a  scheme acceptable to all parties prior to the introduction of charging for on-street  parking in Lisburn and Newry a few years ago. The Member has raised an issue  about timings for waiting restrictions, and I will look at that as closely as I  can.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Since we are on the subject of Lisburn, is the Minister aware of the challenges  facing traders there when they seek to compete with out-of-town shopping  centres? The cost of parking, not to mention the attitude that people take when  confronted with &ldquo;redcoats&rdquo;, is a material factor in economic development. Will  he take that on board during his review?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  I am grateful to the Member for his supplementary question. As part of the  review, I have met representatives of the Northern Ireland Independent Retail  Trade Association (NIIRTA), and we had some discussion on the issue that the  Member raised. I found that insightful as I begin to reflect and finalise my  thinking on on-street charges.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">A great many towns in Northern Ireland &mdash; traditional market  towns and new cities such as Lisburn and Newry &mdash; have considerable concerns about  out-of-town shopping and its impact on the local, indigenous retail trade.  Those are slightly wider issues to the review on which I wanted to proceed on  taking office, but they are worthy of serious consideration.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maskey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Will the review have any impact  on, for example, some of the potential residents-only parking schemes?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  The Member, I think, was not in his place for the question that he tabled. We  had a prepared answer, so he might as well have it.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">The Member will be aware that attempts by my Department&rsquo;s  Roads Service to introduce the first residents&rsquo; parking schemes in the inner  city areas of Belfast  were met with considerable local opposition. Initially, residents were  concerned about the proposed cost of a permit. Other issues included the number  of permits available, and where short-term parking would be available on a  pay-and-display basis.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Although we have no immediate plans to re-engage with  residents in the Donegall   Pass area, for instance,  we will add that neighbourhood to the list of areas for future consideration.  We have sought to re-engage with the local community in the Markets area.  Progress on the issue has been very slow, and at some point I will have to  question whether it justifies the investment of time and money by my officials.  Unless we can see early progress being made, my sense is that this will run  into the sand.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lo</strong>: With  your indulgence, Mr Deputy Speaker, I want to ask a question following on from  the answer that the Minister just gave. I know that there have been  difficulties with negotiations on the residents&rsquo; parking scheme for Donegall  Pass and the Markets, but will the Minister consider extending it outwards? I  know that residents in Stranmillis and the lower Ormeau Road are very interested in taking  up that scheme.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  I am certainly aware that other areas have indicated interest in such a scheme,  but putting together a scheme, in real terms, that is acceptable to residents  has proved difficult so far. Therefore, at some point I will have to make a  judgement as to whether serious progress is possible or whether we are simply  going around in a rather circular argument.</p>
		<p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Rathlin Island</p>
		<p class="OralAnswers-Question">6. <strong>Mr  Storey </strong>asked the Minister for Regional Development what progress has been  made in implementing the Rathlin   Island policy and action  plan. (AQO 169/11-15<a name="AQO1691115"></a>)</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  The Rathlin Island policy was endorsed by the  Executive in February 2010, and the action plan was agreed last September.  Following an invitation from the Rathlin Develop&shy;ment and Community  Association, I hope to visit the island in July to meet not only the people but  the puffins and to hear of progress that has been made on implementing the  action plan to date. I will review that when I chair the third meeting of the  Minister&rsquo;s forum with the islanders and senior officials from all Northern  Ireland Departments in the early autumn.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>: I  welcome the fact that the Minister is to visit the island. He will see the  puffins, and I am sure that, as a member of the Loyal Orders, he will be glad  to know that it is the only place in Northern Ireland where orange feet  walk without the requirement of an 11/1. When visiting the island, will the  Minister ensure that progress is made? I have been concerned for some time  that, although the model is admirable, his Department, along with other  Departments, needs to show a greater commitment to delivering on specific  issues that have been raised through the process to date.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  I am grateful for the supplementary question. I have no intention of forming a  concerned residents&rsquo; group for the puffins, which, I understand, largely fly  off around the Twelfth. That might be something that others could consider.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">I take the point that the Member makes. It is a realistic  point. I am very pleased that my responsibilities as Minister for Regional  Development include responsibility for Rathlin Island,  and I am looking forward to the visit and to meeting the Rathlin Development  and Community Association, discussing the issues of concern to it and carrying  those forward, not only in my Department but in the other Departments in the  Executive.</p>
		<p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">A5 Dual Carriageway: Public Inquiry</p>
		<p class="OralAnswers-Question">7. <strong>Mr P  Maskey </strong>asked the Minister for Regional Development for an update on the  public inquiry on the A5 dualling scheme. (AQO 170/11-15<a name="AQO1701115"></a>)</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  The public inquiry for the A5 western transport corridor commenced on 9 May  2011 and will run for approximately eight weeks. The first two weeks of the  inquiry dealt with strategic issues, with issues relating to section 1 of the  scheme, which runs from north of Newbuildings to south of Strabane, dealt with  in weeks three and four. Hearings in relation to section 2 of the scheme, which  runs from south of Strabane to south of Omagh, are currently being held at the  Mellon Country Hotel in Omagh, and the hearings in relation to section 3, which  runs from south of Omagh to the land frontier at Aughnacloy, started yesterday  in Kelly&rsquo;s Inn, Garvaghy.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">It is expected that the independent inspector&rsquo;s report of  the public inquiry will be presented to the Department before the end of this  year. I will give careful consideration to its recommendations and to the  strategic roads programme when the process has been completed and the necessary  reports are available.</p>
		<p class="TimePeriod">3.00 pm</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Maskey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. The Minister says that he will  give careful consideration to the outcomes of the public inquiry. I would be  grateful if he could put a time frame on that, because the inquiry will be  beneficial to the people of the entire area. Obviously, there is support from  the Irish Government. Will he impose a deadline on his consultation with his  Department after the inquiry has reported?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  I have not been terribly impressed by the Irish Government&rsquo;s adherence to the  deadlines that they have put on things recently, such as the Smithwick  tribunal. Although the timings are not date-specific, my expectation is that I  will have the report of the public inquiry in the early autumn. I want some  time to give careful consideration to that report. It may be possible to  outline things in or around October.</p>
		<p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Roads: Donaghadee</p>
		<p class="OralAnswers-Question">8. <strong>Mr  Easton </strong>asked the Minister for Regional Development how much his Department  is planning to invest in the roads infrastructure in Donaghadee in the 2011-12  financial year. (AQO 171/11-15<a name="AQO1711115"></a>)</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  Roads Service has advised that it does not draft its work programmes on a  town-by-town basis but by council area. Roads Service is, at present,  finalising its budget allocations for individual council areas. Details of the  work programmes are presented to the respective councils in the spring of each  year and are dependent on the amount of funding available. I know that the  Member is still a member of North Down Borough Council. The report to Ards  Borough Council, which includes Donaghadee, can be accessed from the Department  for Regional Development&rsquo;s Internet site and contains the indicative programme  of work. Copies of the report can also be obtained by contacting the divisional  roads manager for Roads Service&rsquo;s southern division.</p>

		<p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Debate resumed on motion:</p>
		<p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly notes the EU directive on conditions for  temporary agency workers (directive 2008/104/EC); and calls on the Minister for  Employment and Learning to ensure, in implementing the directive, that both the  needs of workers and minimising the costs to business are taken into account. &mdash;  [Mr B McCrea (The Chairperson of the Committee for Employment and Learning).]</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: This is the first debate in which the Assembly will hear from Mr  Sammy Douglas, so I remind the House that it is the convention that a maiden  speech be made without interruption.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Douglas</strong>:  Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for the opportunity to speak to the motion. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. Members must leave the Chamber quietly when a Member is  speaking.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Douglas</strong>:  First, I want to thank the electorate of East Belfast  for putting their faith and trust in me to represent them in the House and in  other places. I commit myself to working for the whole community of East Belfast. Secondly, I wish to pay tribute to Lord  Wallace Browne, who did a sterling job as a Member of the Assembly in the  previous mandate.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Earlier today, I mentioned some of the serious difficulties  that we had last night. I hope and pray that those things are resolved for us  all. Last night, there were gunmen on the streets of east Belfast for the first time in many years, and  it is only by the grace and mercy of God that people were not killed. I hope  that people stop, take a step back and analyse where we are, because none of us  wants to go back to the bad old days.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">In the 1970s, I met a young man from the lower Shankill  estate in Belfast  who had a passion and a vision for ordinary working-class people, and, in  particular, low-income families. He became my role model for community  regeneration, and I am grateful for his help, direction and support over the  years. That young man was Jackie Redpath, who later became the chief executive  of the Greater Shankill Partnership. He was the pioneer for early-years  education, training and employment schemes and working with local communities.  However, he also worked with local businesses. His was a broad approach to  community regeneration on the Shankill    Road.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">I remember that, back in 1978, he sent me to a seminar at Magee College,  in the north-west. A man known affectionately as &ldquo;Paddy Bogside&rdquo; was taking the  seminar. In those days, there were no high-level presentations; it was a matter  of using a blackboard and chalk. He talked about community regeneration, the  social economy, community enterprise and many other things. He asked us how  many Catholics were in the room, and, as I was running out the door &mdash; I am only  joking &mdash; 19 or 20 people put their hands up. He then asked us how many  Protestants were there. I was the only person there from the  Protestant/unionist community. He wrote on the blackboard, &ldquo;Where are all the  Prods?&rdquo; He was asking: on community development, community economic development  and community regeneration issues, why do no self-help initiatives come out of  disadvantaged Protestant areas?</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">All that set me on a search through which I got involved in  a lot of community regeneration projects, where I made cross-community contacts  and took part in cross-border co-operation. When I came away from cross-border  and cross-community meetings, I was surprised to find that I was still a Protestant,  still a unionist, and still a loyalist. I have a lot to thank Jackie Redpath  for. He is a real man of vision from the Shankill Road.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Today&rsquo;s debate on the agency workers directive is about  parity with the UK, the 12-week qualification period for rights and ensuring  equal treatment for agency workers. Mr Deputy Speaker, do I have five or ten  minutes?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Five.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Douglas</strong>:  Many of those workers are low-paid, low-skilled and from low-income families.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I thank the Member for giving way. He might need an extra minute. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Douglas</strong>:  I would be happy for the Member to ask me to give way again.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">While we have regional variations across the UK, it is difficult to argue for special  treatment for Northern    Ireland. The Committee took evidence from  the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), which raised issues about the cost  to Northern Ireland  companies. We also heard from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions (ICTU), but I  was very disappointed because it did not realise that the Trades Union Congress  (TUC) and CBI in the UK  had reached an agreement on the directive.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">For me, the directive is about ensuring the rights of  low-paid, low-income families. I know some workers who have been in temporary  employment for two, three or four years. In fact, I know of some people who  have been temporary workers for 20 years. Surely that is not right in today&rsquo;s  society.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">I understand that my time is nearly up, so I will jump  forward. Mr Deputy Speaker, in my opinion, we need to accept the EU directive.  I propose, therefore, that we support the motion.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Overend</strong>:  I am grateful for the opportunity to participate in the debate, and I thank my  colleague Basil McCrea, the Chairman of the Committee for Employment and  Learning, for tabling the motion. This is what the Assembly is all about:  bringing legislation to the Chamber and debating the various issues that are  important not only to the people of Northern   Ireland but to businesses in Northern Ireland. At this time of  economic downturn, it is very important to get that balance correct.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">The EU directive raises issues that are important to agency  workers. Just the other day, as I was coming out of the Committee for  Employment and Learning, I bumped into a guy with whom I had a casual  conversation about the directive and what we would be doing today. Talking to  him brought home to me how important the directive is. He told me that,  although he had worked for an agency for 15 years, it was not by choice; he  needed to take the job. He would have benefited from the extra rights that the  EU directive will bring. That brings home to us how important those issues are.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Implementing the EU directive in Northern Ireland raises three big  issues, the most important of which is the 12-week derogation. We received  representation and information from the Recruitment and Employment  Confederation. In its argument for ensuring that the qualifying period is  implemented in Northern    Ireland, it said that having the 12-week  qualifying period would avoid creating significant bureaucracy. It also said  that it is impossible to overestimate the damage that would be done to the  already fragile Northern Ireland  labour market if new regulations were implemented without measures to limit the  impact on businesses.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Earlier, my colleague Alastair Ross referred to our being  powerless in Northern    Ireland. However, article 5(4) of the  directive makes it clear that the derogation can be utilised by member states  only if an agreement to do so can be reached with social partners at a national  level.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Overend</strong>:  Just a wee second, if you do not mind. Article 5(4) goes on to state that such  arrangements shall also be made without prejudice to agreements at national or  regional level. Suffice it to say that we are certainly not powerless.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>: I  want to put the record straight: I did not say that we were powerless. I said  that it is a European directive, so it is not a matter of whether we implement  it; it is how we do so. That was my point.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Overend</strong>:  Thank you for your intervention. It certainly is about how we implement it.  Thank you for clarifying that.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">The EU directive will give additional rights to pregnant  women, who will have the right to go to antenatal appointments. Those rights  are welcomed, but the Minister needs to consider whether those rights go far  enough. Other issues that he needs to investigate further are the six-week  period and the definition of &ldquo;agency worker&rdquo;.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">The big issue for me, coming from Mid Ulster, which is a  rural constituency, is that we have a large number of small and medium-sized  enterprises. I really want to represent the concerns of those businesses in my  constituency. I urge the Minister to make sure that we have a balanced approach  in the implantation of the directive. I want to support businesses, especially  during this economic downturn. I am reluctant to add a burden to those  businesses with the implementation of the directive.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the opportunity to participate in the debate. I  am a new Member, and it has been a steep learning curve. I have enjoyed the  presentations in Committee from various organisations, trade unions, businesses  and so forth. Departmental officials said to us that they have picked up on  various issues that had not been raised earlier. Hopefully, the debate will  have raised additional issues that the Minister will take on board. I urge him  to do so.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Nesbitt</strong>:  I thank the Chairman of the Committee for Employment and Learning for bringing  the directive to the House. As he said, it is too important not to debate. I am  somewhat conflicted in my support for the directive, but not because of the  aim; I have no difficulty with the aim of equal treatment. What gives me pause  is whether it is the correct vehicle &mdash; the right means to the end &mdash; and also  the cost of the directive, which, as we heard, could be between &pound;80 million and  &pound;166 million over the next 10 years to our private and public sectors,  depending on whether the directive takes effect from day one or week 13 of when  an individual is engaged by a hirer.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">The CBI is quite explicit about the implications. It  states:</p>
		<p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Where UK  costs prove prohibitive businesses could fail or alternative approaches that  are detrimental to the UK  job market will be developed.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">We must beware that we are not introducing a  directive that makes agency workers less attractive to employers than they are  now. We must beware that the admirable goal of the equality agenda does not  result in more people being equally unemployed and unemployable because of red  tape.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">It is not the role of politicians to create jobs. Rather,  our role is to create the environment in which businesspeople can create jobs  and wealth that will generate the taxes that will fund excellence in our public  services. As I said, our role is to create the environment, not the jobs.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">During the election campaign, I asked a businessman to name  three measures that the Executive could take to help him to grow his business.  His initial reaction was that there was nothing that we could do for him, but,  on mature reflection, he said that one thing that we could do is to make it  easier for him to get rid of unproductive employees. He is not a man who is out  to exploit his workforce but someone who would rather see a fair day&rsquo;s work in  return for a fair day&rsquo;s wage and some manner of redress when he does not get  that balance from his employees. Therefore, we should beware and reflect on the  wisdom of introducing more red tape at a time when the Northern Ireland Chamber  of Commerce estimates that red tape has cost local business &pound;2&middot;4 billion since  1998.</p>
		<p class="TimePeriod">3.15 pm</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">I speak with the experience of having previously employed  temporary workers when I ran a public relations company. We specialised in  event management, which meant that, depending on the event, we had a short-term  need for particular specialisms and expertise that were of no use to us for the  rest of the year. We operated a flat fee arrangement, which was good for us and  good for the contractors and was done without reference to the terms and  conditions of my full-time staff.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">I speak also as a former freelance journalist who was  employed by BBC sport at weekends to cover games of association football, rugby  union or Gaelic football. Some of my associates had spent over 20 years in that  arrangement, working for a flat fee, and were more than happy that that was the  only recompense that they got. I note that Ms Gildernew spoke about agency and  temporary workers, and I also note that the directive contains no agreed  definition of &ldquo;agency worker&rdquo;. The Minister needs to clarify that.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">As the legislation is an EU directive, I understand that we  have relatively little wriggle room. Mr McIlveen made that point earlier.  However, I fear that this will be another squeeze on the application of common  sense. It seems to me that the more we legislate, the further common sense is  squeezed from the agenda. Indeed, if the earth were flat, common sense would be  hanging on to the rim by its fingertips. We should do what we can to ensure  that the directive does not loosen the grip of common sense any further, and we  should ensure that, as far as possible, the directive continues to allow  businesspeople to apply local solutions to local issues. I support the motion.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Allister</strong>:  There is something essentially academic about the debate, because the  fundamental reality, unpalatable as it is to me, is that this is a piece of EU  legislation. In consequence of the very substantial surrender by member states  to the EU of the rights to control much of their own social policy and  employment policy, Brussels now has the capacity to decree what we should  think, do and implement in respect of our own particular employment laws and  needs. That is not a healthy situation, and it curtails and stymies the rights  of an Assembly such as this to adjust its policies to meet its specific local  needs.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, we are faced with the agency workers directive,  which decrees what we shall and must do. All that is left to us is the  mechanism of implementation, and that is within very confined and constrained  circumstances. Therefore, it follows that there is much about this debate that,  as I said, is academic.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Of course, it comes also in the context that the hand of Europe upon the control of our business and our  employment laws has been a tremendously expensive operation. A total of &pound;74  billion since 1998 has been the cost of implementing in the United Kingdom EU  regulations pertaining to employment matters. This is but the latest dead hand  that has been delivered upon us. Therefore, all we can do, and what we most  certainly should do, is seek to diminish and restrain the impact and to do the  minimum that is required, bearing in mind the very substantial burden that it  places on business.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">We are often told that the future economy and prosperity of  Northern Ireland  relies upon building our small and medium-sized businesses, and we all repeat  the platitudes about that. However, as legislators, we are taking steps,  whether by compulsion or otherwise, that, if we take the 12-week option,  according to the Department, will burden our industry to the tune of &pound;26  million a year. Yet we tell ourselves that we are in the business of flexible  working arrangements, building our economy &mdash;</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Since we are having a debate, I want to ask the Member a question. Does he  think that it is right that someone who has worked for an agency for 15 years  alongside another person who has been employed does not have the same rights  and can be dismissed without any compensation or any other legal rights? Is  that an appropriate way to behave?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member has an extra minute.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Allister</strong>:  It is not right that, where a person continues, as they do under the agency  workers directive, to be essentially an agency worker employed by an agency,  the employer who takes them on to work in his business has all the obligations  put upon him. It is a fact that there are still basic threshold periods in  employment law. For unfair dismissal, it is 12 months. It is a basic criterion  of employment law that there are thresholds, and it is right, therefore, that  this directive has the scope for a qualifying threshold.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">In this case, I say that we do not have any option because  article 5 of the directive decrees that, where there is a national agreement,  that sets the parameters. In this case, there is a national agreement between  the two sides of industry in the UK, which sets the introductory  period as 12 weeks. Therefore, as far as I am concerned, it is chasing a  rainbow for others to say that we need to give this immediate implementation. I  believe that it cannot be done and, if it could be done, it should not be done,  because it would add excessively to the burden upon industry and create a  patchwork of rights across the United    Kingdom. If we want to be an effective and  functioning part of the sixth biggest economy in the world, rather than an  appendage to the basket case that is the economy of the Irish Republic,  we need to have &mdash;</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Bring your remarks to a close.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Allister</strong>:  &mdash; not a patchwork of rights but a uniformity of rights. For those reasons, I  take the de minimis approach to this directive.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry (The  Minister for Employment and Learning)</strong>: I thank the Employment and Learning  Committee for putting down this balanced motion, which I fully support. I  entirely appreciate why the Committee saw the need for wider debate on the  draft agency workers regulations. The underlying issue goes to the very heart  of employment law, and we need to find a difficult balance between employment  rights and the burden that those rights can place on business.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">The scale and importance of the proposals in the agency  workers directive are significant and fully merit the considered and balanced  debate that has just taken place. I want to thank all Members who contributed  to the debate. I fully acknowledge, as some Members argued, that the  transposition of the directive will have a considerable impact on local  business and that there is a need to minimise the inherited costs without  compromising the rights of agency workers. However, I also recognise the  equally cogent arguments made by other Members that these proposals are  designed to provide greater protection for agency workers and that there is an  opportunity to go beyond what is proposed in the rest of the United Kingdom.  Having heard the strength of the debate, I am sure that the people most  affected will be assured that the Assembly is committed to the directive&rsquo;s  transposition in a way that is fair to agency workers and companies.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">I assure Members that the final proposals that I will take  to the Executive will be informed by the two guiding principles established in  the Employment and Learning Committee&rsquo;s motion. Members will be aware that the  directive sets out the principle of equal treatment as follows:</p>
		<p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The basic working and employment conditions of  temporary agency workers shall be, for the duration of their assignment &hellip; at  least those that would apply if they had been recruited directly &hellip; to occupy  the same job.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">The directive was the culmination of a long history of  lobbying for better protections for temporary agency workers for whom there  were no robust deterrents to abuse and mistreatment by those few rogue agencies  that engaged in such unacceptable practices. If an agency worker is doing the  same work as a permanent employee in the same workplace, there can be little  justification for that agency worker to receive inferior basic working and  employment conditions. I am confident that the proposed transposition of the  directive will address those long-standing inequalities in a measured way and  ensure that agency workers receive the same basic entitlements as their  permanent colleagues. In addition, I am convinced that the proposals will maintain  the flexibility that characterises agency work and which is so critical to  ensuring that that the Northern    Ireland economy remains competitive.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">The directive&rsquo;s default position is that equal treatment  should apply from day one of an assignment. However, the directive allows  member states some flexibility in how they apply that principle. That  flexibility includes the establishment of a qualifying period before the right  to equal treatment arises, provided that such an agreement is by social  partners at a national level. Such an agreement was reached by the CBI and TUC  in May 2008, with the support of the previous UK Government, and I have  received legal advice that that agreement does, indeed, apply to Northern Ireland.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">I fully appreciate the concerns of the local trade union  movement, as represented by the Northern Ireland Committee of the Irish  Congress of Trade Unions. The Northern Ireland Committee has made strong  representations to the Department and to the Employment and Learning Committee,  arguing that the social partner agreement should have been between the regional  partners.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">I fully understand the points that were made by the trade  unions and I put it on record that I recognise they key role that the Northern  Ireland Committee plays in representing workers in Northern Ireland. I also reassure  Members that my Department will continue to engage with the Northern Ireland  Committee on the implementation of the directive and all other policy  developments which impact on the rights of workers. However, be clear: we do  not have the option of a regional agreement. The directive is clear that that  can be only on the basis of a national agreement, so, in that respect, our  hands are tied. The legal advice that I received sets that principle out  clearly. In that context, the only possible agreement is between the national  social partners, which, in a UK  context are the CBI and the Trades Union Congress.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  Does the Minister accept that, in the North, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions  has the remit to represent the union view? Does he further accept that the TUC  has not been imbued with that authority since 1893? That issue was raised in  Committee by the unions, and I feel that it has not been answered.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  am grateful to Mr McElduff for his intervention, and I will not disagree with  what he said. However, equally, we must be clear that, irrespective of  particular historical arrangements that have arisen in relation to Northern Ireland and Ireland, the terms of the European  directive are clear: we can derogate only on the basis of a national agreement.  This may well be the &mdash;</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Will the Minister give way?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  Yes, I will give way to the Committee Chair.</p>
		<p class="TimePeriod">3.30 pm</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I thank the Minister for giving way. Obviously, I accept the timescale that he  has to work within. However, the argument that was put to the Committee, and  which was raised by my colleague Sandra Overend, is that article 5(4) of the  directive makes it clear that the derogation can be utilised by member states  only if an agreement to do so can be reached with social partners at a national  level. However, it goes on to state:</p>
		<p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Such arrangements shall also be without prejudice to  agreements at national, regional, local or sectoral level that are no less  favourable to workers.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">My reading is that there is some room for manoeuvre. That  said, it may be that time is against us and we may not be able to do that.  However, I ask the Minister to reflect on that when he considers his position.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: It  is fair to say that we have some room for manoeuvre on the precise way in which  the directive is put into effect in Northern Ireland. It is important  to draw a distinction between that point and being clear that the derogation on  the 12-week commencement period can be taken forward only at a national level.  The Department has taken legal advice on that point, and the advice is  incredibly clear and unambiguous.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Gildernew</strong>:  I support the position of colleagues from the Committee for Employment and  Learning on that point: we need to see some flexibility for our particular  circumstances. Although the 12-week period has been discussed, I am concerned  that there are other issues, such as outstanding maternity entitlements where,  again, the Minister has the capacity to add flexibility. It would be  interesting to hear the legal opinion that the Minister sought. As colleagues  in the House know, there is always more than one legal opinion. Has that  pointed to any other flexibility that we could apply here?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  Those comments reflect the opportunity for us to do things differently locally  as regards the precise detail and balance. Again, I repeat the point on the  derogation regarding commencement: the legal opinion is incredibly clear that  that can be taken forward only on the basis of a national agreement between the  social partners. We are perhaps in danger of talking about two slightly  different concepts of where we have room for manoeuvre. I will come to the  point about maternity issues in a moment.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Another point worth stressing is that this episode points  out the need for devolved Administrations, in particular our own, given where  we are today, to be more actively involved in the process of drawing up  directives in Brussels.  That points to the need for a strong representation in Brussels by the Northern Ireland Executive  and the Assembly so that we can add our input to the policymaking process at a  much earlier stage when there is much more room for debate, rather than at the  eleventh hour, where we stand today. I am more than happy, via my Department,  to write to my UK  counterparts to stress those points and the need for Northern Ireland to be involved  much earlier in the process.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McLaughlin</strong>:  I want to ask a question while you are dealing with the issue of application  and interpretation. Much has been made of the strength of the public sector.  Staff in the public sector have developed very significant protections,  entitlements and benefits over a long time. However, it is not normally  recognised that there is a significant cohort of agency workers working  alongside them who have very different working conditions. Would it be helpful  if the Minister were to consider that with regard to interpretation and legal  advice? In this place, for example, a significant cohort of agency workers is  working in entirely different circumstances to those of their colleagues, and  we should attempt to address that anomaly.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  will certainly listen to all the comments that have been made today. The final  paper that goes to the Executive will reflect all of that. The general policy  will capture all those situations across Northern Ireland. Of course, the  policies on the employment of agency workers, whether in the public or private  sector, are for those bodies to decide, rather than my Department. No doubt,  the Assembly Commission will have listened to the Member&rsquo;s comments.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">I am conscious of the need to progress through this very  substantive issue.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The derogation would mean that there would be a  12-week qualification period in any job before equal treatment would apply. The  12-week period was arrived at in order to establish a compromise between the  interests of agency workers and those of industry. The Department carried out a  preliminary regulatory impact assessment of the directive&rsquo;s proposals based on  the 12-week derogation. The impact assessment identified annual costs for  private sector and public sector employers of up to &pound;27 million and &pound;6&middot;5 million  respectively. The main annual benefits of up to &pound;19&middot;2 million and &pound;6&middot;4 million  will fall to the agency workers most affected and Her Majesty&rsquo;s Treasury  respectively.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">The 12-week qualification period represents an almost 60%  saving on the costs of implementation compared with equal treatment being  applied from day one. Therefore, although the proposed legislation will  undoubtedly place sizeable burdens on business in Northern Ireland, the 12-week  qualification period significantly reduces the burden on business.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">I want to restate the commitment of the Executive to  rebalancing and growing the Northern    Ireland economy. That requires us to take  steps to develop a dynamic, flexible workforce that can respond quickly to new  job opportunities and inward investment.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">The role of agency workers in Northern Ireland ensures that  companies can respond quickly and effectively to market demands. That cannot be  underestimated. In that context, I firmly believe that any attempt to implement  the directive on a day-one basis will only threaten those critical economic  goals. Instead, the application of the qualification period is key to  transposing the directive to minimise the burden on business while meeting the  directive&rsquo;s equal treatment commitments for agency workers. It is critical that  we strike a balance in that regard.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">The Great    Britain agency workers regulations have  already been laid before Parliament and are due to come into effect in October  of this year. The Republic   of Ireland, as I  understand it, does not yet have full agreement on how to proceed with the  implementation of the directive.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Many businesses and employers in Northern   Ireland will have interests in the Republic  of Ireland and Great Britain.  Although it would have been of benefit to benchmark our proposals against the UK&rsquo;s and the Republic of Ireland&rsquo;s  approach, I am sure that Members will recognise the urgency of proceeding with  a transposition of the directive in order to meet the December 2011 deadline.  As Members will be aware, failure to transpose the directive before the  deadline could leave my Department open to costly and embarrassing infraction  proceedings. The Department had a consultation between December 2010 and March  2011, and I am grateful to the 18 organisations that took part, many of which  provided substantive responses.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Douglas</strong>:  When the Committee was going through its deliberations, the figures presented  to it were from the wider GB. Does the Minister agree that we were disarmed in  many ways, because even if we wanted a regional variation we did not have the Northern Ireland  figures? As a member of that Committee, I am saying that we need that  information before we can make a major recommendation.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  The figures and information are available. It is important to stress that the  Department&rsquo;s policy is robust and has been backed up by independent research  that it commissioned. That fed through to the regulatory impact assessment.  There would be no difficulty in providing that information again to the  Committee for further consideration.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">I do not intend to describe in detail all the proposals.  However, I want to focus on some of the key issues that arose during the  consultation, critical issues raised by the Committee and some of the points  that were raised today. The proposed regulations set out the scope of the  proposals and, specifically, which workers and agencies are affected and which  are not, including the definition of an agency worker. Recently, concerns were  expressed by some consultees and Members that the proposed definition is not  sufficiently robust to protect agency workers fully. That is especially so in  recent case law. I have considered the matter and taken further legal advice.  In light of that, I propose to make a minor but important amendment to the  definition of an agency worker to ensure that agency workers can avail  themselves of the directive&rsquo;s intended additional rights and protections.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">In line with other requirements of the directive, the  definition of an agency worker in any related case law will continue to be  reviewed. I trust that that will satisfy Members. I am sympathetic to the real  concerns expressed on that point, and I am committed to keeping the matter  under review.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">It is also proposed that the equal treatment will apply in  respect of the duration of working time and paid holiday entitlement. That  means that agency workers who remain in a given job after a 12-week  qualification period will have the same entitlements to rest time and leave as  permanent employees. That will be the case even if those entitlements are more  generous than the statutory minimum requirements and also provides for payment  in lieu of entitlement for untaken holidays over the statutory minimums. That  proposal prompted considerable commentary during the consultation because certain  respondents felt that enhanced holiday entitlements as well as the entitlement  to public and bank holidays went above and beyond what was intended in the  directive.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Another key issue is the definition of pay. That is an  issue that is, unfortunately, open to interpretation and, therefore, argument,  as no definition was provided in the directive. The Department did not consider  that basic pay alone would satisfy the equal treatment requirement. Therefore,  in addition to basic pay, it has been proposed that pay should include holiday  pay, payment of overtime, shift allowances, unsocial hours premiums and certain  bonuses. However, and again in the interest of balance, we consider that only  those bonuses that could be seen as directly attributable to the amount or  quality of work done by the agency worker should be included.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">We also considered that certain aspects of contractual  remuneration are in place to reward the long-term nature of an employer&rsquo;s  relationship with the employee. In that light, we came to the view that those  should not be included in the definition. As a consequence, we propose to  exclude financial participation schemes; occupational pensions; sick pay;  pay-related rights; benefits in kind such as company cars, care allowances or  health insurance; and maternity, paternity and adoption pay.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">For understandable reasons, agencies and employers raised  concerns about the inclusion of bonuses and their cost implications, as well as  the administrative burden of calculating bonuses for temporary workers. On the  other hand, some of our consultees, as well as certain Members who spoke today,  felt that the definition of pay did not go far enough and should include  maternity pay, pensions and expenses. I firmly believe that it would be  impossible to exclude all bonuses from the definition of pay and still be  confident of having properly transposed the directive. What has been proposed,  therefore, is a compromise, as long-term bonuses have been excluded. Were all  bonuses to be excluded, it is likely that we would receive a very strong  challenge from the outset.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">As we have heard today, a range of views has been expressed  as to how the directive should be implemented. I see it as my role, therefore,  to try to establish a pragmatic and sensible accommodation of the different  perspectives, and I am content that the regulations should include only those  bonuses that are directly related to work done or individual performance.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">We sought views on a range of other proposals, including  the criteria for establishing what constitutes a new qualifying period and a  new assignment; anti-avoidance measures for regulations; what the key factors  should be for establishing equal treatment; liability for compliance with  obligations if things go wrong; as well as measures to deal with dispute  regulation. A number of other proposals in respect of provisions intended to  apply from day one of an assignment, such as access to employment vacancies and  collective facilities at a hirer&rsquo;s premises, were also raised in the public  consultation.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">The proposed regulations make particular provision for the  protection of pregnant women and new mothers, especially in regard to securing  their health and safety at work, rights to attend antenatal appointments and  the right to adjustments to be made of an offer of alternative work if risks  have been identified on assignment.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">We have also asked for reviews on proposed thresholds for  bodies representing agency workers and provision of information on the use of  agency workers to workers&rsquo; representatives. Finally, we have consulted on the  approach to take regarding the flexibility available under the directive that  is known as the Swedish derogation. That derogation permits alternative  arrangements for agency workers on permanent contracts of employment. Such  workers are paid between assignments.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">On the issue of maternity, I am still looking at whether we  can allow for antenatal appointments from day one of a placement, rather than  that kicking in at week 12. I certainly have listened very carefully and closely  to those arguments.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">My time is up, Mr Deputy Speaker, and I shall leave it  there. Thank you very much.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Buchanan (The  Deputy Chairperson of the Committee for Employment and Learning)</strong>: It is  clear from the debate we have heard that there was value in bringing the issue  to the House. The debate has provided all Members, not just members of the  Committee for Employment and Learning, with an opportunity to understand the  potential impact of this EU directive on employers and agency workers.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">The European Union has handed down the directive for  transposition into the legislation of member states, and the Department is  seeking to comply with a statutory duty to do so. It is the role of the  Committee to scrutinise this legislation and to ensure that this is not a  country where agency workers can be exploited or subjected to conditions that  are prejudicial to their health and safety.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Equally, the Committee is mindful of imposing an additional  burden on businesses at a time of real economic hardship. The Department has  set out the projected costs of the two alternatives for the qualifying period,  either from day one or after 12 weeks. Those alternatives will need to be  carefully evaluated. There also appear to be a number of essential legal  issues, such as the very definition of an agency worker and the definition of  pay, which remain to be resolved. I expect the Minister to keep the Committee  informed of the outcome of his review on those issues.</p>
		<p class="TimePeriod">3.45 pm</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">I will refer briefly to some Members&rsquo; contributions. The Committee  Chairman mentioned problems with pregnant workers; for example, when an  assignment is withdrawn when an employer learns that someone is pregnant.  Obviously, it is an issue of concern, and the Minister touched on it during his  speech. The Chairperson also mentioned the unfair situation of temporary agency  workers doing the same job as permanent staff for up to 15 years but on lesser  terms. That issue was raised by quite a lot of Members. He said that he was  aware of the challenge to employers in that area, but there was a need for  balance between the needs of workers and the needs of employers. That is  another issue of concern. He also mentioned the lack of information on exactly  how many workers are involved. There is little information on the number of  agency workers in Northern    Ireland, which is an issue that quite a lot  of Members raised. Members also raised the short timescale for Committee  scrutiny of the directive.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Alastair Ross said that there was no choice about whether  we implement the directive. He said that it was a matter of how we implement  it, not if we implement it. We have the directive before us, and it is  something that we have to implement. He also said that there was a need for  balance between business costs and workers&rsquo; rights, and he mentioned the lack  of union involvement in Northern    Ireland. He said that the directive should  not be implemented differently in Northern   Ireland from the UK, and he asked the Minister to  spell out the legal position on that. He said that he was not opposed to  regional variation, but Northern    Ireland businesses would be placed at a  disadvantage. He said that the focus should be on job creation rather than  adding another burden of cost and administration for businesses. That is one of  the key factors in this debate.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Barry McElduff said that the Assembly should now take the  lead to ensure equality on the directive, and he used the example of a Law  Centre case, referring to the vulnerability of agency workers. He mentioned the  union view that agency workers are often the low-skilled, second-class citizens  of the employment world, and he said that there is a case for a reduction in  the derogation period from 12 weeks to six weeks. He also identified the  information gap on the number of agency workers in Northern Ireland and said that the  agreement between the UK Department for Business, Innovation and Skills and the  TUS was not valid because there was no input from the Irish Congress of Trade  Unions.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Pat Ramsey asked the Minister to investigate the concerns  regarding the inclusion of ICTU. He mentioned that the 12-week gap period  allowed unscrupulous employers to opt out of provision of benefits. He asked  what anti-avoidance mechanisms are to be put in place. He said that a more  robust inspection programme is needed. I agree fully with the Member that there  needs to be a much more robust inspection programme for employment agencies  with regard to workers. He preferred the day-one approach to the 12-week  derogation. Of course, Pat wants to see provisions brought in on day one rather  than after 12 weeks. He was concerned that pregnant women should be moved to  more suitable employment if it were at all available.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Chris Lyttle mentioned the time pressures to complete the  transposition. He thanked the witnesses who briefed the Committee at short  notice. He expressed wider concerns about the social framework. He discussed  the wider issue of disproportionate representation among agency workers of  long-term workers, ethnic minorities and women, which is worse in the UK than in Europe.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">David McIlveen said that the Assembly is powerless because  the directive is coming from Europe. Of  course, that was challenged by Barry McElduff. Mr McIlveen expressed his  concern that the Minister should raise those issues with his UK counterpart.  He said that the introduction of the legislation does not send out a consistent  message to businesses and that it will add to costs and bureaucracy. He said  that although unions have disputed the additional burden, his constituency  contacts have quoted substantial costs. He said that businesses in his area had  contacted him about the additional costs that would be required to implement  the directive. I think that he said that it would cost one business in his area  &pound;300,000 to implement it. We have to take that into account when we consider  the directive. Mr McIlveen said that the timing of the legislation is  difficult. He said that flexibility in recruitment is essential for the  survival of businesses. He also said that there is a need to protect the  interests of permanent staff who have undergone rigorous recruitment processes.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Michelle Gildernew highlighted the lack of agreement with  unions. She quoted the TUC report that states that a large number of agency  staff would prefer to have permanent employment. She was concerned that  enhanced maternity pay and leave are not included in the directive and that  temporary agency work may be the only work available to unemployed skilled  workers. However, she did not mention the burden that that would have on  businesses and its potential to put some small businesses to the wall through  loss of employees simply because they cannot meet the extra financial burden  that the directive may well place upon them. That is one issue that she failed  to take into consideration during her deliberations.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Other Members, such as Sammy Douglas, said that the  directive was about ensuring the rights of low-paid temporary staff. He spoke  from personal experience in his constituency. Sandra Overend spoke of the value  of bringing those issues to the Assembly for further debate. She mentioned that  working for an agency is not a positive choice. She said that recruitment  agencies spelled out negative impact on businesses here. She challenged the  view that Northern Ireland  was powerless, saying that it was capable of implementing the directive in its  own way.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member must bring his remarks to a close.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Buchanan</strong>:  I have not got through other Members&rsquo; remarks. As the consultation period on  the directive comes to a close, the Committee calls for the Minister to take  account of concerns that have been raised in the debate and to ensure that the  legislation that he brings back to the Committee in due course reflects both  workers&rsquo; needs and businesses&rsquo; costs in a fair and equitable way.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
		<p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly notes the EU directive on conditions for  temporary agency workers (directive 2008/104/EC); and calls on the Minister for  Employment and Learning to ensure, in implementing the directive, that both the  needs of workers and minimising the costs to business are taken into account.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I ask Members to take their ease while there is a change in the  Chair.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyTextItalic">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr Dallat] in the Chair)</p>
		<p class="B3BodyTextItalic" style="page-break-before:always;">Motion made:</p>
		<p class="Q3Motion">That the Assembly do now adjourn. &mdash; [Mr Deputy Speaker.]</p>
		<p class="H3SubHeading"><a name="a11"></a>Adjournment</p>
		<p class="H4StageHeading">Colin Worton</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Before we begin, I caution the House that there are serious issues  associated with this matter. Members should, therefore, exercise responsibility  when making their contributions today. I remind Members that the proposer of  the topic for debate will have 15 minutes. The Minister of Justice will have 10  minutes to respond. All other Members who wish to speak will have approximately  six minutes.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  Mr Deputy Speaker, I welcome your caution on the matter. There are obviously  very serious issues involved, and I accept and appreciate that. I welcome the  opportunity to speak on the issue today, and I hope that the House will give it  the significance that it deserves. I will not speak for very long, because I  want to hear from other Members about where they are coming from on the issue.  In particular, I look forward to the comments of my party colleague Danny Kennedy.  He has been working on the matter for quite a lot of years and obviously has  the inside knowledge that many others do not.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">I feel that it is important to lay the context for this  debate. As I understand, Colin Worton was arrested on Thursday 1 December 1983  at 6.00 am and was taken to Castlereagh police station under suspicion of being  involved in the murder of Adrian Carroll three weeks before that in Armagh. He was interviewed no fewer than 23 times and  vigorously denied any complicity in the murder. However, during the  twenty-fourth interview on the evening of 5 December, it is alleged that Mr  Worton made a rather bizarre and surprising statement to police during which he  confessed to having prior knowledge of the attack, to taking part in the mock arrest  of Neil Latimer in Lonsdale Street and to subsequently travelling with him in  the same Land Rover before seeing the gun being handed over.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">It is not for the House to rule on the admissibility or  inadmissibility of evidence that dates back almost 30 years. However, I feel  that it is important just to note the words of Mr Smyth QC when he commented  that the statement:</p>
		<p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;had been induced by the detectives at Castlereagh by  a trick which embraced threats and dishonest promises and oppressive and unfair  means.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That point is crucial.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">The sole evidence against Mr Worton on the charge of murder  was the verbal and written confessions said to have been made by him to  detectives at Castlereagh holding centre on 5 December 1983. However, Mr Worton  has since claimed that the police informed him that he faced up to 20 years in  jail unless he made a confession. He also claims that he was told that, if he  admitted a role in events surrounding the murder, he would serve only five  years.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Taking a step back from the interview during which it was  claimed that a confession was made, it is clear that Mr Worton was under some  immense emotional and psychological strain in the initial period of his  detention. He refused food on 1 and 2 December. He then took a short reprieve,  and subsequently went on a milk-only diet until lunch on 6 December, before  reverting to his fast until the evening of 7 December.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, we must wonder what his mental state was on the  evening of 5 December, when he was alleged to have made that confession. Mr  Worton remained on remand for 30 months, until May 1986, when he was eventually  released due to the inadmissibility of his evidence.</p>
		<p class="TimePeriod">4.00 pm</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">This case is about much more than financial compensation.  Colin Worton spent 30 months of his life in custody awaiting a trial that never  happened. The prosecution case against him relied entirely on a single piece of  verbal evidence, which was crudely rejected on the grounds of inadmissibility.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Until April 2006, an ex gratia scheme was operated by  successive Home Secretaries and Secretaries of State for Northern Ireland for  the payment of compensation to people who had been wrongly convicted but whose  cases did not fall within section 133 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988.  Although the scheme has now been discontinued, it is accepted that individuals  such as Colin Worton who applied before April 2006 continue to be entitled to  compensation if they meet the requirements of the scheme. It is the opinion of  the Ulster Unionist Party that Mr Worton deserves compensation similar to that  which was awarded to Noel Bell, James Hagen, Winston Allen and many others who  found themselves in similar situations. There is no doubt about the  inadmissibility of the evidence against them, and there is no doubt about the  inadmissibility of the evidence that supposedly implicated Mr Worton.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Mr Worton did not get so much as an apology, and he  certainly did not get any compensation, financial or otherwise, for the years that  he spent behind bars. Therefore, I urge the House, its Members, the Department  of Justice, the Minister of Justice and the Secretary of State to take on board  this case. I further urge them to review the situation that Mr Worton found  himself in and to look at the possibility of offering him an apology and  compensation.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Irwin</strong>: I  very much welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate, and I thank my  colleagues for securing this adjournment debate. I attended an event in  Bessbrook this morning with my colleague Jeffrey Donaldson MP. It was organised  by the Kingsmills families, who gave their response to the HET report on the  massacre of 10 Protestant workmen. Colin&rsquo;s brother was cruelly murdered in that  attack, and it has been a difficult and long day for him and his family. We  recognise that and commend him for making the trip to Stormont today.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">At the outset, I must state that Mr Worton has conducted  one of the most rigorous and dignified campaigns to exonerate himself. Having  met him on numerous occasions, I know that one cannot be left in any doubt as  to his genuineness and utmost respectability. We in the Chamber fully recognise  that Colin was acquitted and was not convicted of the murder of Adrian Carroll.  We also recognise the difference between his situation and that of other  individuals directly related to the case who were convicted and subsequently  had their convictions quashed. In light of that, I fully support Mr Worton in  his assertion that, given the stigma that is attached to the case and despite  his acquittal and absolute innocence, the whole ordeal has had a detrimental  effect on him and his family.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">It must be remembered that Colin spent almost three years  on remand and had a particularly difficult time in the legal system. He was extremely  vulnerable at that stage of his life, and the entire ordeal greatly upset him  and his family. As a result of the case, Mr Worton lost his job with the Ulster  Defence Regiment, and he believes that it prevented him from pursuing a full  career with the Army and hindered many other employment opportunities  throughout his life. I share the view that his co-accused, who later had their  convictions quashed and were fairly compensated, were more clearly and  unambiguously exonerated than he was.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Colin is firmly of the view that there were serious issues  with the manner in which his interviews were conducted and believes that there  was a serious default. In countless communications from various Secretaries of  State and other members of the British Government, it is concluded that Colin  does not meet the criteria for either the statutory compensation scheme or the  ex gratia scheme, as he was not convicted but acquitted. However, under  established ex gratia arrangements, compensation can be awarded in exceptional  circumstances, including a situation in which the detention was the result of  serious default on the part of the police or any other public body. Colin  firmly believes that to have been the case. I must state that, although Colin&rsquo;s  fight is not one in which compensation is the ultimate goal, the treatment of  his co-accused, following the quashing of their convictions, is in stark  contrast to Colin&rsquo;s post-acquittal treatment.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Colin has suffered tremendously since this ordeal. I  welcome the fact that our own Justice Minister, Mr Ford, is present and is  giving the case a fair wind. I urge him to look into this matter in the utmost  detail for Mr Worton&rsquo;s sake and do all he can to address the obvious injustices  visited against Mr Worton, which Mr Worton feels strongly aggrieved by.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">In a recent meeting, Mr Ford, the Justice Minister, stated  that he would be willing to make a statement to the House which would go some  way to further highlighting Colin&rsquo;s innocence and non-involvement in the murder  of Adrian Carroll. I trust that that will be the case today, as such a  statement will be warmly welcomed by Colin.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">I also urge the Minister to pursue the ex gratia issue in  his Department and further investigate any avenue that may be open to Mr Worton  for some financial recognition of his situation, given the circumstances. I  understand, from corresponding with the Historical Enquiries Team, that it is  looking into the murder of Adrian Carroll within its investigative remit.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Given the timely nature of this debate, my thoughts are  with the family of Mr Carroll at this time.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Adrian Carroll was murdered in Armagh  as he made his way home from work on 8 November 1983. He was shot three times  in the head and neck by a lone gunman. The Carroll family had already suffered  the loss of a son through murder. Adrian Carroll&rsquo;s murder is being investigated  by the Historical Enquiries Team, and I sincerely hope that that investigation  will bring justice for the Carroll family. I know from speaking to him that  Colin Worton wants that family to have justice in the same way that he seeks  justice and has done for the past 27 years.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Five members of the UDR, including Colin Worton, were  subsequently arrested and charged with Mr Carroll&rsquo;s murder. The four others  were convicted but three had their convictions quashed and were compensated for  their time in custody. However, the fourth, Neil Latimer, had his conviction  upheld and served 14 years in prison before being released under the terms of  the Good Friday Agreement. Latimer unsuccessfully appealed against his  conviction on two further occasions, the last being in 2004. That is the  general background to the case.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Colin Worton was acquitted of the murder of Adrian Carroll  on the basis that the only evidence against him was a statement made by him in  Castlereagh police station. That statement was deemed inadmissible by the trial  judge and Mr Worton was acquitted. Mr Worton set out thereafter to fight for  justice for himself and, in the interim, he has been supported by the leaders  of the four main Churches here, the British Irish Rights Watch, the victims&rsquo;  commissioners in Northern Ireland, the Irish Department of Foreign Affairs and  the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission, as well as by the majority of  political leaders and public representatives from across the political divide  in Northern Ireland.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Anyone who has met Colin Worton cannot help but be  impressed by his honesty and desire for justice. He certainly impressed me, and  that is why I am prepared to stand here and speak in support of his attempts to  find justice. He has asserted his innocence constantly over the 27 years of his  campaign, and he maintains that his incriminating statement to police in  Castlereagh was the result of his vulnerability and the constant pressure  exerted on him over days of intense questioning. Police found the areas of  vulnerability in Mr Worton, namely his family and his girlfriend, and applied  pressure to exploit them. The fact that the resulting statement was deemed  inadmissible by the trial judge is, I believe, a strong indication of serious  police default in the manner in which they obtained that statement.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Mr Worton believes that, despite the dismissal of the case  against him and the fact that he was never convicted of murder, he has been  treated unfairly compared with those who were convicted of murder and later had  their convictions overturned. His claim for compensation has been rejected, and  he has never received any apology for what happened to him during that period.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">A judicial review of the case in February 2010 failed. It  rejected the view of serious police default in obtaining the statement from Mr  Worton. Indeed, the methodology employed by the police in Castlereagh was not  unusual at the time. Police often used a similar approach to obtain statements.  A similar approach was used in the case of a constituent of mine, Lawrence  O&rsquo;Keeffe from Newry, to obtain a statement that led to his conviction for the  mortar bombing of Newry police station and a five-year prison sentence. Mr  O&rsquo;Keeffe, like Mr Worton, is fighting for justice, and I am happy to support  them both.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Mr Worton&rsquo;s case does not meet the criteria of either of  the two compensation schemes, and he has been left in limbo to fight for justice  over a long number of years. However, Mr Worton has constantly emphasised the  fact that his fight is not fundamentally about compensation; it is about his  exoneration and the clearing of his name. That has been his main aim.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wells</strong>:  Does the honourable Member agree that it would be impossible to put a monetary  value on the loss that Mr Worton has suffered over the past 27 years and that  no amount of compensation could ever recompense him, but that a very public  payment, no matter what it is, would be a clear indication that the security  forces treated him extremely badly all those years ago?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  I thank the Member for his intervention, and I agree with him. Mr Worton&rsquo;s life  has been blighted by the experiences that he endured, and, as Mr Wells said, no  amount of money could buy back what he lost or compensate him for what he  suffered.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">A mechanism is needed for the review of cases such as that  of Mr Worton. I appeal to the Minister of Justice, whom I welcome here today,  and to the Secretary of State to review in detail Colin Worton&rsquo;s case, with a  view to his full exoneration and adequate compensation for his suffering, loss  of career opportunity and disruption of family life through the years.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">I express my admiration for the way in which Mr Worton has  carried out his campaign for justice through the years. Many a lesser person  would have given up by now, but it is an indication of Mr Worton&rsquo;s belief in  his case that he has continued to this day.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Your time is up.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  I hope that his campaign soon comes to an end and that it does so having met  with success.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
		<p class="TimePeriod">4.15 pm</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  I am grateful for the opportunity to speak from the Back Benches on this  important issue. I thank my party leader, Tom Elliott, for tabling this topic  for discussion and consideration by the Assembly. I also thank the other  Members who contributed. I was impressed by the previous contribution from Mr  Bradley. I note the non-attendance of Sinn F&eacute;in Members. However, if they are  not present, they are not speaking against the debate, which, in itself, may be  of some significance.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">The 21 June is the longest day, and it has been a very long  day. It has been a very long day for a number of reasons. As my honourable  friend Mr Irwin said, the HET inquiry report on the Kingsmills massacre was  discussed and effectively launched for public consideration earlier today in  Bessbrook. That has been a difficult report not only to read but to come to  terms with. The connection with Colin Worton is that his brother Kenneth was a  victim in the Kingsmills massacre.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">So, it has been a very long campaign for Colin Worton not  only with regard to Kingsmills but for justice for himself. He has doggedly pursued,  lobbied for and raised his case and refused to go away. He has brought his case  to the attention of many individuals, elected representatives and campaign  groups, and it is right that it is aired today in the Assembly. I pay tribute  again to his persistence and welcome him here today with other members of his  family, including, on a day such as today, his mother.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">I do not want to go over the details that we have already  heard; they have been well documented. However, it is clear that the only bit  of evidence that implicated Colin in the murder of Adrian Carroll was the  supposed confession. For the avoidance of doubt, let me place on record my  opposition to murder, wherever it comes from. I condemn all murders.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">The police acknowledged that during not one of the 23  interviews did Colin Worton ever indicate any culpability or guilt for the  murder. So, it is important that we look at the circumstances in which it is  alleged that he made his confession. Given that he was sleep-deprived and  suffering, no doubt, emotional and mental disarray and compelled by the  unjustified line of questioning from several RUC officers, one can only imagine  the pressure that was being placed on Colin Worton. The police have formally  acknowledged that they may have used somewhat irregular interrogation  techniques.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">The police were doing, or were attempting to do, a  difficult job. In many ways, it was extremely challenging to get the truth from  some compulsive liars. Even to this day, there are prominent public  representatives who deny any involvement in incidents of the past or even a  link with proscribed organisations. Nevertheless, the debate today is about  whether a line was crossed during those interviews. There is a big difference  between acceptable interview techniques and trickery or improper conduct.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">The debate regarding compensation depends on whether there  was a serious default on the part of the police in Castlereagh holding centre.  Members who are aware of the details of the case will be aware that there has  been significant discussion on the alleged will or last testament that was  supposedly produced during the interview process and which contained significant  passages, allegedly from Colin himself.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">However, that claim gives significant credence to Mr  Worton&rsquo;s allegation that detectives were telling him that, if he did not make a  confession, he would be charged with murder and sent to prison for 15 to 20  years. The Ulster Unionist Party firmly believes that the Secretary of State  made an error in law by persistently interpreting previous conclusions as  identifying no serious police default.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Colin Worton spent 30 months of his life in custody waiting  on a trial that never happened. He was wrongfully charged. There is no doubt  about that. The only piece of evidence against him has been entirely  discredited, and there is no doubt about that, either. Colin was improperly  incarcerated. However, he has not received so much as an apology.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Legal precedents have been set over the past couple of  decades in which people have successfully challenged their sentences.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Bring your remarks to a close, Mr Kennedy.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  This has had a devastating impact on the life of Colin Worton. I welcome the  presence of the Justice Minister. I hope that, when we hear from him shortly,  he will be able to give comfort to Colin Worton and the Worton family. Whoever  killed Adrian Carroll, it was not Colin Worton.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Time is up.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  This wrong needs to be righted, and we need an apology and subsequent  compensation. This is the place to start.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  I support Mr Worton in his quest for justice in relation to the very difficult  circumstances that he found himself in and the very long period that he was  kept in custody awaiting trial and during the course of his trial. That  amounted to 30 months, which, incidentally, would amount to a prison sentence  of five years. So, effectively, this man served five years in an ordinary  prison sentence. As a result, his life was blighted, and he has bravely tried  to rebuild his life ever since.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">It is important to remember that he was unjustly treated.  Now, on top of that injustice, having been acquitted, he is not entitled to  claim compensation under section 133 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988. As a  result, he is thrown on to the discretion of the Secretary of State in relation  to an ex gratia payment.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">It seems extraordinary that a number of Secretaries of  State have refused to give compensation on the grounds that there was no  serious default on the part of the police. It seems to me, when I examine the  remarks of the learned trial judge, that there is an inescapable conclusion  that there was default on the part of the police and that, in the circumstances  of the trial, this was serious default. That is a matter, I believe, of fact,  and I am baffled by the attitude of successive Secretaries of State in relation  to this matter.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">They may argue that there was a court case in February of  last year in which a judicial review of the Secretary of State&rsquo;s decision was  brought by Mr Worton and that that judicial review rejected his claim that the  Secretary of State had acted unlawfully. If you look at the judgement by the  learned judge in that case, Mr Justice Treacy, you see that his evaluation of  the case was that, in terms of irrationality, the Secretary of State did not  err. In addition, there was no error in the procedure that he applied. However,  if we examine the judgement, we can see that it is a fairly narrow one. One is  not second-guessing what another judge would do or what a further court might  do, but, nonetheless, the judge clearly stated, in fairly narrow legal terms,  that the Secretary of State did not err. However, when one applies what I would  have thought is a common-sense test to what the Secretary of State actually did  when faced with the facts of the trial and the rejection by the learned trial  judge of that man&rsquo;s confession statement, the inescapable conclusion reached is  that, in fact, the Secretary of State erred.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">The House, with its collective strength, should send a very  strong message to the current Secretary of State that he should review the  case, and review it positively by giving compensation on the basis of an ex  gratia payment to that man, who, I believe, has been treated very shabbily. I  say to the House that we should send out a very strong message today.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  I thank the Member for giving way. I was impressed by the point that he made,  which was that Mr Worton was held for 30 months. In real terms, that equates to  a prison sentence of five years. A five-year sentence would be given for a very  serious crime. Is it not significant that those who were convicted were  subsequently released and compensated, yet here is a man for whom eventually  the charge was not made to stick, and he is left to get on with his life,  having served &mdash; as Mr Maginness rightly said &mdash; a period of five years in  prison. And there is no compensation for him at all? It has been mentioned on a  number of occasions this afternoon that he does not qualify under section 133.  Is the legislation adequate to deal with cases such as Mr Worton&rsquo;s? Surely that  needs to be looked at.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  I can continue, Mr Deputy Speaker?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Yes.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  I agree that the law should be looked at. Of course, the ex gratia payment  scheme is supposed to be a safety net to prevent anomalies such as the one that  we are faced with today. I will go further, because those who were acquitted  were acquitted on the basis that the police had interfered with the way in  which they had recorded the statements and that they could well have been  pre-written, and so on.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Bring your remarks to a close, please.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  The ESDA tests indicated that there was some manipulation or interference. That  was proven scientifically, and that certainly &mdash;</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Your time is up.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  &mdash; amounts to serious default on the part of the police.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Allister</strong>:  I have been familiar with the Colin Worton case for many years, as, in a  previous role as an MEP, I made representations for him and took issues  relating to the case not just to the Secretary of State but to the Commissioner  for Human Rights in the Council of Europe.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">When we distil it down &mdash; this is the point that I want the  Minister to focus on today &mdash; at the heart of the Colin Worton case is a gross  inequity and injustice. Lord Morrow has just referred to it in his  intervention. Colin Worton found himself, having served 30 months on remand,  acquitted of the offence on direction of the judge, yet those whom the same  judge convicted and, in due course, were acquitted on appeal, qualified for  compensation and got compensation under the statutory scheme. However, Colin  Worton, who was acquitted at first instance because the evidence was utterly  discredited, although he equally served a period of time in prison, has been  denied compensation.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Therein lies the basic inequity and injustice that survives  to this day.</p>
		<p class="TimePeriod">4.30 pm</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Let us never forget that Colin Worton was acquitted by Lord  Justice Kelly, who was one of the toughest judges who ever sat on the Bench in  this land. He took no prisoners, as it were. He was no soft touch on anything,  and he was prepared to convict others, but he faced the reality that, in this  case, there was no basis on which to convict. In fact, he directed the  acquittal of Colin Worton.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Let me remind the Minister of what Lord Justice Kelly said  in that acquittal and direction. He said:</p>
		<p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;At the end of the day I am left with the strong  conviction that having regard to his make-up, to the situation in which he  found himself, to all the circumstances of Castlereagh, to the length and  persistence of his questioning &hellip; I should exercise my discretion and exclude as  inadmissible his confession &hellip; I go further and say even if this statement was  admitted I would have some difficulty in assessing what weight should be given  to it having regard to all the circumstances and in particular Worton&rsquo;s  intellectual and emotional make-up. It has been said and I believe it to be  appropriate here that the right to the assurance of a fair trial includes the  right to be protected from evidence which might have an unreliable effect on  the result of the trial.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">It could not be clearer. Lord Justice Kelly was saying  that, by virtue of the manner in which Worton, being the person he was, with  his capacity, was treated in police custody, no reliance could be placed on  anything that was said and that he could not have a fair trial if his statement  were admitted. If Lord Justice Kelly reached the conclusion that things were so  bad that this man could not even have a fair trial if his statement were  admitted, and for that reason directed his acquittal, what possible  circumstance could there be to conclude that either there was not serious  default on the part of the police in the conduct of that interrogation or that  circumstances do not prevail which should entitle him to the ex gratia payment?</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">I come back to the nub of the matter. As it turned out, it  would have been better for Colin Worton to have been convicted and, with those  who were co-accused with him, ultimately acquitted on appeal.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  I want to make a point about the co-accused. In a 15 May 2008 reply to my  letter to the then Secretary of State, the Minister of State, Mr Paul Goggins  MP, said:</p>
		<p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;You also believe that the circumstances around the  quashing of the convictions of three of Mr Worton&rsquo;s co-accused in 1992 show  that there was serious default in Mr Worton&rsquo;s case. Serious default was not  established against the police in the former cases; even if it had been, I  believe it would be wrong to simply assume the same default in Mr Worton&rsquo;s  case.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Is that not an extraordinary assertion by Mr Goggins about  those who had been acquitted on appeal? Surely that also amounted to serious  default, which, I believe, also strengthens Mr Worton&rsquo;s case.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Allister</strong>:  I think that it is. It points up that we have got ourselves onto a roundabout  here, where successive Secretaries of State and Ministers of State have got  themselves bound into defending a decision that really is indefensible. With  the matter now devolved to the local Justice Minister, we have an opportunity  to take a fresh look. I will make the point again: it is incredible, and it is  the ultimate irony that it would have been better for Colin Worton, in  compensation terms, to have been convicted and then had that conviction set  aside, than to have been acquitted in the first instance.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">That has to be wrong. Something there is so fundamentally  offensive to the basic tenets of justice and the compensation process that it  cannot be right to construct upon it an edifice that says that there is to be  no compensation for Colin Worton because he was acquitted. It is preposterous,  and the Minister has to address it. If that requires rewriting the guidelines,  then rewrite them, because this inequity cannot be sustained. Whether it takes  change to the legislation or to the guidelines on ex gratia payments, change  must be made.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>:  Bring your remarks to a close, please.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Allister</strong>:  The House should not and cannot tolerate that injustice.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  I support Mr Worton&rsquo;s bid to clear his name and to be compensated for his time  on remand.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Mr Kennedy pointed out the timing of today&rsquo;s debate: we  have just had the report of the Historical Enquiries Team into the Kingsmills massacre  and the murder of Mr Worton&rsquo;s brother. In the briefing that I have on the  history of Colin Worton&rsquo;s case is a 2004 &lsquo;News Letter&rsquo; article in which Mr  Worton remarked that, coming out of court, Adrian Carroll&rsquo;s brother shook his  hand and shook his head at what had happened to him. As I am sure Members will  agree, the Carroll family need justice for their brother.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">This is a time in which we are struggling to deal  adequately with the past and with victims&rsquo; needs, including miscarriages of  justice. In any other democracy, the Kingsmills massacre would be deemed a war  crime and those responsible would either have been held or pursued throughout  the world and brought to justice for what they did. The families of those who  lost loved ones must be remembered. It is telling that part of what drives Mr  Worton is the fact that his father did not live to see his son&rsquo;s name cleared.  His mother is still alive, so the Justice Minister has an opportunity to allow  at least part of Mr Worton&rsquo;s family to gain closure on their sufferings.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">I will not delay proceedings, because many of the legal  points have been covered by colleagues to my right and left. Nonetheless, this  is an auspicious day on which to recount the trials and tribulations of Colin  Worton. When one reads his remarks, it is poignant to note that he continues to  live in a mental prison because he has yet to break free from the chains of the  past. By clearing his name and awarding compensation for his time spent on  remand, he might be able to do that.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford (the  Minister of Justice)</strong>: I thank Tom Elliott for initiating the debate on this  important subject, and it would not be improper to associate Tom Elliott with  the Back-Bench Member Mr Danny Kennedy for all his work on this case.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">I listened with considerable interest to all the points  made around the Chamber. Perhaps I should begin by acknowledging that &mdash; I am  sure that Members would wish me to do so &mdash; another important factor at the  heart of the discussion about Mr Colin Worton and the UDR four is not in  dispute: Adrian Carroll was murdered on 8 November 1983. That is something that  his relatives and friends have had to cope with for almost 30 years. The controversy  attached to Colin Worton&rsquo;s case must have made coping more difficult for the  Carroll family.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">The murder trial took place in May 1986. After exhausting  the judicial appeals process, one man, Neil Latimer, remains formally  convicted, though released on licence. Three others, Noel Bell, James Hagan and  Winston Allen, were also convicted, but, in 1992, their convictions were  quashed. In Mr Worton&rsquo;s case, the trial judge had first to decide whether to  admit the only evidence presented against him: his confession.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">After thorough consideration, with detailed evidence from  Mr Worton, the police and expert witnesses, the judge concluded that the  confession should not be admitted. Unlike his four co-accused, therefore, Mr  Worton was not convicted but acquitted. He was released immediately and  returned to service in the Ulster Defence Regiment for the remainder of his  contract.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">At the beginning of the debate, Tom Elliott outlined Colin  Worton&rsquo;s case regarding his treatment and the interrogation process. I must respond  to one point, because I think it is crucial. William Irwin said that, in some  senses, he believed that the co-accused had been more clearly demonstrated as  being innocent because of the way in which they were subsequently treated and  the fact that they received compensation. That point was followed up by Lord  Morrow. However, I do not believe that that is the case. Mr Allister pointed  out that Colin Worton was acquitted at first instance. I shall not go into the  discussion about Lord Justice Kelly&rsquo;s demeanour, but the fact is clear: Colin  Worton was acquitted at first instance.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">I am very conscious that the Historical Enquiries Team  (HET) has still to report on its review into the investigation of Adrian  Carroll&rsquo;s murder.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Allister</strong>:  Does the Minister take the point that, because Colin Worton was, quite  properly, acquitted at first instance, he has in fact been prejudiced in  compensation terms because he has fallen between the two stools of the  statutory scheme and the ex gratia scheme, and that it is that lacuna that the  Minister needs to close?</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  entirely take Mr Allister&rsquo;s point. I was coming to it later. In simple terms,  the court, in the first instance, established Mr Colin Worton&rsquo;s innocence. As  we have heard, however, he was held in custody for two and a half years  awaiting that trial. It is certainly a case that concerns us this year. It is  fundamental that those who are charged with crimes should be held in custody  only when necessary, that continuing remand should be periodically tested and  reviewed and that they should be brought to trial without undue delay. That is  why I am committed to ensuring that we speed up the justice process.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Members have referred to the various representations that  have been made. As Dominic Bradley, in particular, pointed out, representations  that are in support of compensation for Mr Worton have been made from very many  different sources. As has been said by many, he has conducted his case in an  extremely dignified way. However, Members are also aware that, under the  previous Administration, several Secretaries of State, on a number of different  occasions, concluded that Mr Worton did not meet the criteria for either of the  compensation schemes that were then in place. Let me spell them out: the  statutory criteria, which are in section 133, required a conviction to have  taken place, and the ex gratia scheme was based on the premise of serious  default on the part of police or otheThat is clearly a point of debate today,  and I have listened carefully to the points that have been made as to what  exactly that serious default meant in the case of Colin Worton.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">Last year, the Secretary of State&rsquo;s decision was upheld by  judicial review, although Alban Maginness has given his opinion of the  narrowness of that judgement. I met Colin Worton about his application last  October. He was accompanied to that meeting by the three Newry and Armagh MLAs  who have spoken today.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  I am obliged to the Minister for giving way. The judgement of Mr Justice Treacy  is fairly narrow in so far as he was dealing primarily with whether there was  irrationality in the decision-making of the Secretary of State, or,  alternatively or in addition, that the procedures had been properly adhered to.  His examination was that those matters had been complied with. He was not, in  essence, examining the substance of whether there was serious default on the  part of the police. In that sense, it was a narrow judgement. I submit that it  was really on the basis of procedure more than anything else.</p>
		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  take Mr Maginness&rsquo;s point. Having given way to two barristers, I shall now  attempt to proceed or else, Mr Deputy Speaker, you will be hauling me up for  time.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">When I met Colin Worton last October with the three local  MLAs who have spoken &mdash; Danny Kennedy, Dominic Bradley and William Irwin &mdash; I  explained the factors that lay behind the previous decision and explained that  I would have to have regard to the same eligibility criteria that would have  had to have been considered by previous Secretaries of State. However, I said  that I would certainly look at the decision in light of any new material that  might emerge.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">There is a suggestion that I might simply make a goodwill  payment to Mr Worton. However, the legal effect of that would be to establish a  completely new compensation scheme. I could not establish a precedent by making  a payment to him without serious implications elsewhere.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">The position is that I remain open to important new  information that might affect the previous decision that Mr Worton is not  eligible for compensation and, indeed, that was the statement that was made by  Peter Hain as Secretary of State when he closed the ex gratia scheme in 2006.  When I met Mr Worton last autumn, the current HET review was getting under way.  It may be unlikely that the review would reveal any new information, but, if  any such information were to emerge, I would take full account of it in  considering Mr Worton&rsquo;s case.</p>
		<p class="TimePeriod">4.45 pm</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">In addition, I have noted the detailed points that Members  made during the debate, and I will take those into account as I ask officials  to re-examine the judgement. The case is absolutely still under review, and, in  particular, we will need to examine the detailed judgements that have been  referred to, initially that of Lord Justice Kelly and then the judicial review  of Mr Justice Treacy, to ensure that all factors are taken into account.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">At the start of his contribution, Danny Kennedy reminded us  all of the significance of today, as it is the day of the publication of the  Kingsmills report from the HET and all that that means for the Worton family in  their own loss. Dolores Kelly made a telling contribution when she reminded us  all that we have serious issues to deal with as we seek to deal with the past  in a collective and inclusive way, not in a piecemeal way. I welcome the  sensitivity that has been shown by Members from all of the parties that have  contributed to the debate. I hope that my contribution in response has  recognised that sensitivity and sought to see how the process can be moved on  constructively.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">In concluding the debate, let me make it absolutely clear  to Members, to Colin Worton, to all those who support him, to the wider public  and to the Worton family circle that there is one clear fact: Colin Worton was  found by the proper authorities of the law to be not guilty of any crime  associated with the death of Adrian Carroll. As I said in a similar debate in  this place, as Justice Minister this year, I bear no responsibility for what  happened nearly 30 years ago, but I do have the authority of being Minister of  Justice today to repeat that statement: Colin Worton is and always has been  completely innocent of any implication in the death of Adrian Carroll. The  court made that absolutely clear, and it is my opportunity as Minister to  repeat that, so I hope that, although the issue of compensation may still be  unresolved, a clear statement to that effect from the Minister of Justice will  be some comfort to Colin and his friends.</p>
		<p class="B3BodyText">There is no reason for his character to be stained, and  there is no reason why a charge should have been anything other than an  erroneous charge that was cleared by the courts at the first instance. I am  grateful for the opportunity to make that point. I will continue to examine the  information that is there, and I will take full account of all of the  constructive contributions made in the Chamber this afternoon.</p>
