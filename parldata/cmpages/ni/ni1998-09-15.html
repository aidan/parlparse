                </b></font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the end of yesterday’s proceedings Mrs
                Robinson, very helpfully, drew to my attention some problems
                with the sound amplification in the Strangers’ and Press
                Galleries and in some parts of the Chamber proper. I have had
                this matter investigated and it may be that we will need to
                improve the speaker capacity in the Galleries. As our staff
                become more familiar with balancing the amplification system, we
                may be able to overcome some of the other difficulties
                ourselves.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As far as the Chamber itself is concerned,
                may I draw the attention of those on the Back Benches to the
                small recessed speakers, in the carved rail at the top of the
                Back Benches. For those at the desks, please note the recessed
                speakers there. Yesterday, some of the staff noticed that
                Members’ notes were obstructing the desk speakers, and that is
                why there was difficulty hearing from them. That also reduced
                the amount of amplification in the Chamber as a whole. Our staff
                will try to improve the balancing, but if Members are unable to
                hear clearly, they should check that their papers are not
                obstructing the speakers and then incline their ears towards
                them — either on the Back Benches or at the desks. I hope we
                can overcome this problem.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am grateful to Mrs&nbsp;Robinson for
                drawing this matter to my attention. If there are any other
                teething troubles either inside or outside the Chamber, I would
                be very grateful if Members would draw them to my attention as
                well.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We hope and pray that that list will not get
                any longer.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have all expressed our sympathies many
                times over, but I am certain that other Members will wish to
                join with me at the beginning of this debate to record sincere
                sympathy and condolences to all those families who have been
                devastated by this atrocity, and especially to those who have
                lost loved ones. We also think of those who are still recovering
                from their injuries, and we think too of our fellow Assembly
                Member, Mr&nbsp;Gibson, whose family also suffered directly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Omagh is one of the two main towns in my
                West&nbsp;Tyrone constituency. It was my home for the first half
                of my life; it is where I grew up, went to school and
                socialised. Most of my family still live there. Omagh is one of
                those towns where everyone knows everyone else and where people
                get on well together. That is not to say that it has not had its
                share of bombings and murders over the past 30&nbsp;years. In
                spite of this, good relations have generally prevailed in Omagh.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But bombs do not discriminate. The explosion
                has left 29 people dead — and let us not forget the unborn
                either — and hundreds injured, regardless of age, creed, class
                or, indeed, country. This evil and indiscriminate act has left
                so many homes, throughout Tyrone and beyond, shrouded in sorrow
                and despair. There is the heartache of those grieving for lost
                family members and friends; there is the pain of those sitting
                by the bedsides of the injured, praying for the best; and there
                is the trauma of those involved in the rescue attempts. The pain
                of Omagh has been felt by many thousands of people who were not
                directly affected.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Tribute must be paid to all those who became
                involved in the rescue operation after the explosion. The
                Royal&nbsp;Ulster&nbsp;Constabulary, firemen, ambulance
                personnel, doctors, nurses, bus drivers, the Army, the
                Royal&nbsp;Air&nbsp;Force, council workers, and the man and
                woman in the street. They all deserve the very highest praise
                possible. All involved did the very best they could, and no one
                could have asked for more. I have nothing but the highest
                admiration for all involved.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many hospitals throughout Northern Ireland
                swung into action to receive victims. The Erne, Altnagelvin,
                South Tyrone, Musgrave Park, the Ulster, the City and the Royal
                Victoria are all deserving of praise. In particular, the task
                undertaken by Omagh’s own Tyrone County Hospital must be
                highlighted. The skill and expertise of its staff, and the
                performance of emergency operations to stabilise the injured
                prior to their transfer to acute hospitals undoubtedly saved
                lives. The value of such local hospital services cannot be
                overstressed and must not be forgotten in any future health
                board plans.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The excellent and speedy co-ordination of an
                incident centre, and the subsequent counselling services
                undertaken by Omagh District Council, the social services and
                the local clergy are all deserving of commendation. Indeed, I
                welcome the fact that a task force has been brought together to
                deal with the tremendous trauma felt by survivors. The
                ramifications of this atrocity will be with us all for a long
                time to come. It is vital that everything possible is done to
                cushion the ongoing difficulties that have to be faced by so
                many.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have no doubt, given the nature of their
                warning and the geography of Omagh’s main shopping area, that
                it was the intention of the so-called Real IRA to kill and maim
                as many ordinary citizens as possible. To plant a bomb in such
                an area on a busy shopping day, during school holidays, and to
                have timed it to explode just prior to a community event speaks
                for itself.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">How can anyone understand the mind that can
                contemplate, much less carry out, such an action? Such people
                are beyond the comprehension of a normal, civilised society and
                they do not deserve to be part of it. They have claimed that
                their so-called warnings were not properly passed on. Such a
                despicable attempt to transfer blame adds insult to the pain and
                misery they have already created. I trust that the entire House
                will join with me in expressing our disgust and unequivocal
                condemnation of those responsible for this outrage.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I must add that there are those in the House
                who know who these people are. They should be sharing such
                knowledge with the authorities, North or South, so as to assist
                in their apprehension. I quote the Adams statement:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Sinn Fein believe the violence we have
                seen must be for all of us now a thing of the past, over, done
                with and gone.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Is it so?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Confederation of British Industry has
                said that the Omagh bombing focused attention on the issue of
                explosives and weapons. Its director, Nigel Smyth, said</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The existence of significant amounts of
                explosives and weapons and the capacity to use them with such
                horrific impact is deeply worrying and highly dangerous.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It calls on all of those who have influence
                over such arsenals to do everything possible to secure their
                early decommissioning. That would be a crucial step forward
                which would also provide an important, confidence-building
                measure.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While we consider Omagh, let us not forget
                the many other tragedies, murders and atrocities which have
                resulted in multiple deaths that have plagued our land for so
                long.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If violence is now to be a thing of the past,
                why the need to maintain these arsenals? The leader of the Real
                IRA, a former Provo quartermaster, surely knows where supplies
                are held. He therefore had, and still has, access to such
                materials as were used to make the Omagh bomb and the others as
                well over the past few months. The potential for another Omagh
                must be removed. That is the overwhelming public expectation,
                and, further, it is a political imperative, if we are to advance
                the return of right and proper powers to Northern Ireland’s
                elected representatives.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the anti-terrorism legislation,
                North and South, that has been passed in the wake of the Omagh
                bomb. However, I must also point out that the security Minister
                was warned in no uncertain terms in the aftermath of Banbridge
                of the probability of an even more devastating attack. I am also
                disappointed by our Government’s failure to match the South’s
                internment capacity, thus rendering that option virtually
                unworkable for the Southern Government. We now wait to see if
                the new legal options available will be used to apprehend and
                bring to justice those who carried out the attack on Omagh and
                those who give succour to such actions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The security response is one thing, but our
                Government must commit all the resources necessary to assist
                Omagh to resurrect itself physically and mentally. The
                after-effects of this act of depravity on that dark August
                afternoon will remain with everyone for a long time to come and
                will require a long-term commitment from medical and trauma care
                experts.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Every assistance has been promised by the
                Secretary of State, but I understand that extra medical staff
                need to be committed to the Omagh area to help ease the
                tremendous burdens still being carried by doctors and nurses.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The wishes of the people of Omagh must also
                be fully considered by those responsible for restructuring the
                lower market area, and funds must be made available to assist
                with that. Let us not see officialdom frustrating this progress.
                The Government must ensure that everything possible is done to
                help Omagh and the area around it to return to some sort of
                normal life.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have witnessed the great, the good, and
                the mighty visiting Omagh and those affected. Certain scepticism
                may have been expressed about some of these visitors, but, in
                general, the visiting dignitaries gave welcome support to the
                bereaved and injured, and their visits were, and are, aiding the
                healing process. All must be thanked for their time and concern.</p>

                which the courageous and dignified people of Omagh had on all

                on our community was at last, perhaps, being understood by
                outsiders.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It would be wrong to conclude without
                referring to the cruel phone calls and letters being received by
                some of the families who have lost loved ones and to the recent
                spate of hoax bomb warnings that have been perpetrated on the
                people of Omagh. Such actions are to be abhorred, and I call for
                an immediate cessation of such activities which are causing
                intense extra pain, concern and worry to people who have already
                suffered more trauma than anyone should ever have to endure.
                Surely it is the wish of us all that the Omagh bomb is the last
                bomb and that we will have to endure such things no more.
                Therein would be a fitting memorial to the death, heartache,
                pain and trauma created by evil in Omagh, this day last month.</p>

                represent the area and its surroundings, this debate is a deeply
                painful and emotional one. I also appreciate that many Members

                to prevail upon all those who wish to speak to try to keep
                within the 10-minute allocation. Many Members wish to
                contribute, and the more who are able to do so, the better. I
                understand that there is a lot of pain, especially for those of

                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Byrne:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Omagh bombing on 15 August came as a
                horrific shock to everyone in Omagh and beyond, especially at a
                time when most people felt that a more peaceful climate had been
                developing here. I believe that the Omagh bomb was a defining
                moment in our political development, principally because so many
                civilian people were killed and injured — people from
                throughout Tyrone, Donegal and Spain. The people of Ireland were
                shocked and saddened that at this time in our history, Irish
                Republicans could be so off beam and act in a way so alien to
                the wishes of the people. The enormity of the casualties caused
                by the Omagh bomb sickened everyone, as did the fact that some
                people were still pursuing political objectives by using deadly
                physical force.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We all know that dissident Republicans wanted
                a so-called spectacular, at this time, in order to wreck the
                current peace process and prevent the new political structures,
                including this Assembly, from functioning. The timing was right
                and the town of Omagh ideal, in their view, to provoke a
                derailment of the entire peace process.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is, however, a sad fact that it took the
                deaths of 28 people (now 29) and over 200 injuries — many of
                them very serious — to bring everyone, including most senior
                politicians, to their senses. Public opinion throughout Ireland
                was clearly one of revulsion. No one could justify such an
                atrocity. The Social Democratic and Labour Party Members want to
                extend their sincere sympathy to all the bereaved families and
                to those who are still suffering from injuries.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The two Governments have had to act in
                unison, as never before, in order to reflect public anger. Omagh
                is a unique town, as my fellow Member from West Tyrone, Mr
                Hussey, said earlier. It has always been a model of tolerance
                and accommodation. People who live, work or shop in Omagh have
                always been comfortable with each other. Omagh is the county
                town of Tyrone. It is a good, well-integrated provincial town
                where community relations have always been good. People feel
                very angry, therefore, that a terrorist group should decide to
                bring a bomb into the heart of the town on a busy Saturday
                afternoon, intent on causing maximum damage and destruction to
                people and property.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a public representative of the people of
                Omagh, I have to ask &quot;What kind of patriotism is this? What
                kind of humanity allows the bombing of a crowded civilian
                shopping scene, such as Market Street, Omagh?&quot; Quite
                simply, nothing in the wide world could justify the killing of
                people in such an inhuman and callous way.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One key fact has emerged. The Omagh bomb has,
                I hope, at long last done away with ambivalence about political
                violence in Ireland, as we approach the end of this millennium.
                Many people who have been reluctant in recent times to speak out
                about bombings and killings have been shaken to their moral and
                political foundations. The so-called brave people who plan and
                plant bombs are not so brave when it comes to helping those who
                have been injured as a result of their evil deeds — to say
                nothing of those killed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The ambulancemen and women, the firemen, the
                police officers, the voluntary-care groups, the St&nbsp;John’s
                Ambulance Brigade, the clergy and the ordinary people who help
                others at the scenes of bombs like the one in Omagh are much
                braver people than those who plan and plant such bombs.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is a terrible shame on our land and on our
                society that some people can inflict such inhumanity on other
                human beings — fellow Irish people. It has been quite apparent
                to most observers that the people of Omagh, in the aftermath of
                this terrible massacre, have behaved in a very civilised and
                restrained way, displaying great humanity and Christian feeling.
                The collective grief and sorrow of the people has been quite
                remarkable at this very trying time.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to address the way in which the town
                of Omagh and, in particular, the Tyrone County Hospital
                responded to the bomb. It is remarkable how the medical and
                nursing staff at the hospital in Omagh responded to this
                large-scale emergency. The Tyrone County Hospital is only a
                small-scale hospital, which, sadly, has been steadily run down
                over recent years. I can tell Members that the families of the
                injured, and the injured themselves, deeply appreciate the care
                and attention they received at this hospital. Many patients had
                to be treated quickly before being transferred to other
                hospitals throughout Northern Ireland. Mr&nbsp;Pinto, our senior
                consultant, his entire medical team and all the other staff at
                the Tyrone County Hospital deserve the highest praise and
                appreciation for their dedicated and highly professional efforts
                in the midst of such terrible injuries and trauma.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many patients were transferred to the Erne
                Hospital in Enniskillen, Altnagelvin Hospital in Derry, South
                Tyrone Hospital in Dungannon and, by helicopter, to the
                hospitals in Belfast. Omagh is a garrison town, and many
                patients were very glad of the helicopter lifts to the hospitals
                in Belfast. Many patients were also taken to hospital in private
                cars and buses. Everyone did what he could to help. Many other
                groups of people and individuals did remarkable work in helping
                people after the bomb, and that was deeply appreciated by Omagh
                District Council and the community in general.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Omagh District Council, under the leadership
                of its chief executive, John McKinney, quickly set up an
                emergency disaster centre. This was very important for the
                families who were looking for those who were lost. Omagh was put
                on the world media’s map because of the bomb, and many
                journalists and reporters came to our town to relay the horror
                story and its aftermath of funerals to the world. The coverage
                of the many important people who visited Omagh in the days after
                the tragedy was, on the whole, covered sensitively. Coping with
                this tragedy has been both difficult and trying for the bereaved
                families, the relatives of the maimed and injured and the owners
                and workers of the shops and businesses affected. It will take
                Omagh a long time to recover.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to say a special word of thanks to the
                clergy from all the churches in Omagh who did a magnificent job
                consoling and dealing with the many families that suffered death
                and injury. It was the local clergy who organised for the
                victims the very moving and solemn memorial service which was
                shown throughout the world the following Saturday.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is my earnest hope that the Government and
                their agencies recognise what Omagh represents. Sadly, in recent
                years, we have only witnessed minimal Government help and
                support.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is sorely felt that the central
                Administration has not dealt Omagh a fair hand. In particular,
                it has been obvious to local people that Tyrone County Hospital
                has been gradually and steadily run down by those who simply do
                not listen to the concerns of those in the west. Quite simply
                the people of Omagh want an assurance from the relevant
                Government authorities that their hospital will be sustained
                with proper resourcing to provide a viable level of acute
                medical services in the future.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is to be hoped that now that we have had
                visits from senior Government Ministers and heads of state, we
                will be listened to with regard to some of our social and
                economic problems. I welcome the fact that yesterday Mr Ingram,
                the industry Minister, announced plans to build an advance
                factory in Omagh. Young people in particular need reassurance
                that they will have better access to higher education locally
                and that jobs can be created in their area.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The people of Omagh are still in a
                traumatised state. Many families of the bereaved and injured are
                suffering terrible grief and pain. Many business people are
                trying to come to terms with damage to buildings, but some of
                them have also been affected deeply by the loss of colleagues
                and workers who were killed or badly injured.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We welcome the fact that the Secretary of
                State has appointed a senior civil servant to liaise with the
                local agencies involved in the reconstruction of Omagh. I want
                to place on record the deep gratitude of the Omagh people to all
                who have visited us or sent messages of support since the
                bombing. Many Members of the Assembly came to Omagh and
                expressed their solidarity with us. We are very thankful for
                that. In particular, the First Minister (Designate) and the
                Deputy First Minister (Designate) came a number of times and
                attended funerals. This was appreciated by all concerned.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have been deeply touched by all the
                messages of support from Ireland, Britain and around the world.
                We can only hope that there will be no more Omagh bombs, and we
                should all work for that. Surely the public revulsion throughout
                these islands to the Omagh bomb must mark a new beginning in
                political relations here. The victims and their families have
                paid a terrible price for the political stagnation which has
                existed here for such a long time. Indeed, all of the victims of
                violence over the last 30 years have borne the same enormous
                pain and grief that Omagh experienced so tragically just weeks
                ago.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The path is very clear for all of us in the
                Assembly. Certainly the people of Omagh wish to see the new
                political structure working, so that there will be no more of
                these atrocities.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Dr Ian Paisley:</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I deeply regret that the Assembly was not
                recalled immediately after the bomb. It is wrong that this
                elected body was refused the right to meet at that time. Other
                bodies were able to do so but, because of the influence of the
                First Minister (Designate), his deputy and the Secretary of
                State, the Assembly was not. I regret that it has taken so long
                for us to have the opportunity to express our views here.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am glad to associate myself with all the
                tributes that have been paid by those Members who have already
                spoken. The terrible crimes of those responsible for that bomb
                in Omagh and those killings and murders throughout the province
                should not be allowed to be forgotten.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I utterly deplore the fact that the President
                of the United States of America came to Omagh and unveiled a
                carefully worded plaque which contained no indictment of the
                so-called Real IRA. We had the same thing in Enniskillen as
                well.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Why are we constantly reminded by politicians
                of the crimes perpetrated by those on the Loyalist side? This
                should go on the record fairly and squarely: there is no
                difference between the villainy, the hellishness and the
                hideousness of what took place in Omagh and all the killings of
                the past. Do the parents and loved ones of the 299 murdered
                policemen, put to death by the Provisional IRA, feel any
                differently than the people in Omagh who mourn their loved ones?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The people of Northern Ireland, who have
                opposed what is happening in this province have a right to say
                something today. We were promised tranquillity, but instead we
                got terror. We were promised peace, but instead we got war. We
                were promised quiet, but instead we got grief. We were promised
                the end of killing, but instead killings have multiplied.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Since this so-called Belfast Agreement was
                signed 37 people have been murdered by terrorists. Every
                paramilitary group supposedly on ceasefire has breached that
                ceasefire and the terms of the Mitchell principles of
                non-violence. There have been 691 people injured by paramilitary
                inspired violence; 75 separate bombing incidents, including the
                atrocities in Omagh, Banbridge and Moira; a growing list of
                largely unreported incendiary devices, many of which have
                destroyed businesses; six car bombs; 49 separate punishment
                shootings and 55 serious assaults carried out by all the
                paramilitary groups; and there are more persons detained in
                custody this year than during the mid-1970s, when the troubles
                were at their height. Some peace process.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Government claim to be doing everything
                possible to counter these violent acts, but there is little
                evidence to prove that. The Government are neither tough on
                terrorism nor on the causes of terrorism today, and the time has
                come when people have to face up to reality. This was not the
                first bombing or the first killing in Omagh. The whole
                mid-Ulster area has been a killing field, an area of IRA
                activity. One has only to see the graves of gallant men of the
                Ulster Defence Regiment to know how serious the killings have
                been.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Prime Minister keeps saying that the
                Provisional IRA and Sinn Fein are closely identified with one
                another. One side is the IRA and the other side is Sinn Fein.
                These people, whose representatives sit here in this House, were
                responsible for all the violence that led up to what happened.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are told by the security forces that the
                detonator for this bomb was purchased along with other
                detonators by the Provisional IRA in Phoenix, Arizona. The time
                has come to face up to reality. We are being asked to take
                representatives of this organization to our bosom and put them
                on the Executive to have a part in the Government.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is no difference between the killings
                of the past, on both sides of the religious and political
                divide, and this killing in Omagh. The only thing that happened
                this time was that the Governments had a vested interest in
                their so-called peace process, so that is why they had such a
                quick and swift answer to this matter. I would say that this
                matter is not over. I would like to think that no more bombs
                will follow.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All my political life I have been hearing
                about the day when the gun will be out of Irish politics. But
                the gun will never be taken out of Irish politics until those
                people realise that the majority of the people of Northern
                Ireland are not going to accept a united Ireland, are not going
                under Dublin rule and are not going to be pushed around by
                either a British Government or anyone else on that issue. Until
                they learn that, they will never cease from their violence. The
                violence will continue: there will be more sorrow and more
                deaths. To say that the speeches made by the IRA/Sinn Fein
                Leader is some sort of going back on what they have always stood
                for, is to fly in the face of the evidence.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not see any repentance. I do not see a
                turning. The best way for them to demonstrate a turnaround would
                be to hand in the remainder of their arms, give up the murder
                weaponry and dismantle their arsenal. That is the only proof of
                their having turned from their wickedness and their lies that we
                can accept.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It behoves all of us to understand the real
                issues that are involved. An attempt is being made by concession
                and concession and concession to buy off the bombing of the
                mainland. That is what it is all about. Mr&nbsp;Blair is
                prepared to keep making concessions to ensure that no more bombs
                go off on the mainland. But when those who control the arsenal
                find that things are not going completely their way, they will
                return. As one of their members — now a Member of this
                Assembly — said during the talks, they will return to that
                which they do best. So what can we do but heed what they are
                saying?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is a sad and a bitter day. I have spoken
                to many of the victims’ loved ones. What was reported by
                Mr&nbsp;Clinton and Mr&nbsp;Blair about their attitude was
                untrue. They spoke to both the President and the Prime Minister,
                but their feelings were not portrayed by both these gentlemen
                when they addressed public meetings.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The sorrows are deep, and the wounds go to
                the very quick. There is only one healing, and that is to see
                every murder weapon surrendered and complete and final
                decommissioning and destruction of the arms used to murder
                people.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr P Doherty:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One month ago the atrocity of the Omagh bomb
                was visited on the people of Tyrone, on the people of my own
                county — Buncrana, Donegal — and on people from Madrid. I
                would like to reiterate my condolences and sympathies and those
                of my party to all who were bereaved and injured. The dignity
                with which the family members, relatives and friends of those
                who were bereaved conducted themselves was a humbling experience
                for any of us who were around Omagh in the days after the bomb
                went off. The courage of the emergency services, the doctors and
                the nurses was also exemplary.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the weeks and months ahead when
                accountants’ figures and management reports about hospitals
                appear, let them fade into insignificance against that courage.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have been reminded by other Members of the
                awful summer that we have come through: the three children
                murdered in Ballymoney; Nationalists driven from their homes;
                and Drumcree and the Garvaghy Road. When we reflect on these
                things there is an onus and an awful responsibility on us as
                politicians to move forward and resolve them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The attack on Omagh was also an attack on the
                peace process. There is therefore a great responsibility on us
                to sustain that process and bring it to fruition. We also have a
                responsibility to build a memorial of lasting peace to all those
                who have died, not only in Omagh but throughout the troubles.
                The foundation stones of that memorial should be not only the
                resolution of the conflict but the resolution of the issues that
                lead to the conflict in the first place.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Exactly a year ago today we were invited, on
                the basis of our electoral mandate, to start the process of
                negotiations. After months of negotiations we produced what has
                become known as the Good Friday Agreement. It is our duty as
                politicians to implement that Agreement. We did our best. We
                brought forward our concerns, our aspirations, and we matched
                them against the concerns and aspirations of the other political
                parties. We now must build on that and implement the Agreement
                with as much speed as we can muster. Omagh will renew itself,
                and I hope that we can move beyond renewal to rebuilding all
                that has been lost.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We all have our memories of the event and of
                the days after. I had just landed in Portugal for a week’s
                holiday with my wife, and I had to return immediately. My clear
                and undying memory is of lists — lists of funerals, lists of
                those in hospital (and the length and the indignity of those
                lists) — and of so many people killed and so many people in
                hospital.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My other clear memory is of two men — one
                an Ulster Unionist councillor and vice-chairman of Omagh
                District Council, the other a Sinn Fein councillor and chairman
                of Omagh District Council — and of the way in which they
                worked together. They performed their civic duties in a way
                which matched and mirrored the dignity and the courage of all
                who had been bereaved, of all who had suffered and of all who
                had worked to save the people caught up in the bomb. They have
                shown us how we might move forward. There is an onus, a deep and
                heavy responsibility, on us to do so.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must ensure that Omagh is the last
                atrocity. We must put all of that behind us. We can, as
                politicians, recriminate. We all have memories of suffering, of
                loss and of indignities, but we must match the courage of the
                people of Omagh, move forward, find a solution and make the
                Omagh atrocity the last.</p>

                </i><b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Neeson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On behalf of the Alliance Party, I wish to
                express deep sympathy to the families of all the 31 people
                (including the unborn twins) who were killed at Omagh and to
                those who were injured. Sadly, some will have desperate injuries
                for the rest of their lives. Again, I would like to express our
                sympathy to Assembly Member, Mr Gibson, whose family was touched
                by the atrocity as well.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This probably was the darkest summer in the
                history of Northern Ireland. But Omagh was a tragedy waiting to
                happen. It could have happened in Banbridge or Moira. The sad
                thing is that Omagh has always had excellent community
                relations. Omagh was the unfortunate victim of the Real IRA.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I heard about the tragedy on the second day
                of my holiday with my family. You remembered where you were when
                John F Kennedy and Princess&nbsp;Diana were killed, and Omagh is
                rather like that. The enormity of the tragedy did not come all
                at once. It unravelled gradually: 10 were dead, then 20, then,
                eventually, 28, and hundreds injured.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I visited the hospital in Omagh on the Monday
                afterwards, accompanied by Seamus Close, David Ford and Cllr Ann
                Gormley. I wanted to say my thanks to the staff, but I also
                wanted to speak to some of the injured. I was struck by the
                large number of young people who had been injured, and I could
                identify with them because some of them, like my own children,
                were waiting for the GCSE and A-level results due the following
                week. Suddenly the results seemed irrelevant.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I went to the leisure centre, which had been
                the incident centre, and I must pay tribute to the staff who
                took on a very difficult job, informing loved-ones that it was
                their father, mother, daughter or son who had been killed. Never
                have I seen police officers so touched by the savagery of the
                bomb that had been planted.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I met Mr Byrne, Mr Hussey and some
                councillors in the high street, and there was an eerie silence.
                I met people like Tom Watterson, who lost three members of the
                staff of his shop. Those images are for ever etched on my mind.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the Saturday I went back again with Seamus&nbsp;Close
                to the service, and I was struck by the dignity of the occasion.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like to put on record my thanks to
                John&nbsp;McKinney and all his staff at Omagh Council. He showed
                true leadership at a very tragic and difficult time.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Governments, North and South, reacted
                quickly, and it was proper that both the Dáil and Westminster
                were recalled to deal with the issue — that was what everybody
                wanted — and I was impressed by the way in which both
                Governments worked in tandem on it. Both Parliaments passed
                draconian legislation which must be kept under review.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the culprits are known — and we hear
                that the dogs in the street know who the members of the Real IRA
                are — it is important that surveillance be kept on these
                people morning, noon and night so that evidence can be collected
                to convict them in the courts — I would rather see convictions
                than internment dealing with this.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are told that the Real IRA is on
                ceasefire. I am somewhat sceptical of that. The Continuity IRA
                has not yet called a ceasefire, so there is always a fear that
                these misguided morons will commit another atrocity.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, despite what happened in Omagh we
                see daily the poison of naked sectarianism on our streets,
                particularly in Portadown. It is a poison that we must not allow
                to spread throughout Northern&nbsp;Ireland; and there is a
                danger of this poison spreading. It can kill: we have only to
                look at Ballymoney and the murder of the three Quinn children to
                see that. It can injure: only a week ago a policeman, doing his
                duty, was severely and savagely injured by a pipe bomb. And it
                can destroy. There are many people who want to destroy the
                Assembly and the peace process, and they must not be allowed to
                succeed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am calling today for all those involved in
                the conflict at Drumcree and Portadown to get round a table and
                talk. Dialogue can work. We saw it happen in Derry with the
                leadership of the Apprentice Boys and all the other groups
                involved in the conflict there. Dialogue can work&nbsp;— that
                is why we are here today. The Assembly provides a new chance and
                a new opportunity for Northern Ireland. It is therefore
                important that the situation at Drumcree should not be allowed
                to drift; it must be dealt with now.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The enormity of the tragedy at Omagh united
                the entire community in Northern Ireland. The following Saturday
                hundreds of thousands of people right across the province —
                Catholic, Protestant, people of every religion — came onto the
                streets to show their solidarity and sympathy with the people of
                Omagh.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Surely that must inspire us all to want to
                create a society in Northern Ireland where, at long last, we can
                truly live in peace and reconciliation.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McCartney:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I join with everyone here in paying tribute
                to the medical and emergency services who did so much to lessen,
                insofar as it could ever be lessened, the tragedy of Omagh. No
                words can adequately describe the horror of Omagh, and ordinary
                people cannot comprehend the mindset of those who were
                responsible for that outrage. Yet except in terms of its scale,
                that outrage was little different from others in Oxford Street,
                McGurk’s Bar, Enniskillen, La Mon, Teebane or the Shankill.
                All of these outrages, including the one in Omagh, were
                committed in the belief that they would accelerate progress
                towards achieving the political goals of those who committed
                them or prevent others from reaching or maintaining their goals.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At this moment, the Provisional IRA retains
                all the armaments necessary to perpetrate a hundred Omaghs. The
                Real IRA was almost certainly making use of explosives and
                detonators which had formerly been part of the Provisional IRA
                arsenal. What distinction or difference, if any, is there
                between the Real IRA and the Provisional IRA? The Provisional
                IRA is acknowledged everywhere as being inextricably linked with
                Sinn Fein. The word &quot;inextricably&quot; means that it
                cannot be separated from Sinn Fein — Sinn Fein, 18 of whose
                members have seats in this Assembly, two of whom may shortly be
                placed in government over the people of Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Real IRA and the Provisional IRA share
                the same political goals; both have as their political objective
                a united, socialist Irish Republic. Both believe that terror and
                violence, murder and mayhem may be justified in the pursuit of
                their objectives. There are no moral or ethical differences
                between the Real IRA and the Provisional IRA. They differ only
                in their tactical views as to when violence may be most
                efficiently and effectively used for attaining their political
                goals.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The statement of Mr Adams, the Assembly
                Member for West Belfast, that the violence was over and done
                with was, of course, qualified: it will be over if the present
                process continues to deliver the political aims and visions of
                Sinn Fein. But should Unionists — or anyone else — obstruct
                what it considers to be the inevitable progress towards those
                goals and ambitions, violence may once again have to be resorted
                to, and for that reason it is absolutely necessary that
                armaments, explosives, guns and detonators be retained in order
                to exert, when necessary, the appropriate leverage in
                negotiations or discussions which are ostensibly part of the
                democratic process.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After Omagh many people had a sense of
                déjà&nbsp;vu. Those who remember Enniskillen will recognise
                remarkable similarities: then, as now, the Provisional IRA, like
                the Real IRA, had not just committed indescribable murder and
                destruction, it had occasioned a public-relations disaster.
                Then, as now, Ireland was aghast. Fifty thousand people signed a
                book of condolence in Dublin. The Catholic Church apologised —
                in my view quite unnecessarily — on behalf of those who had
                committed the atrocity. Mrs&nbsp;Thatcher visited Northern
                Ireland. The great and the good shed their tears and gnashed
                their teeth. But such emotional outpourings did not prevent the
                renewal of violence by the groups that had committed such
                atrocities as those in Enniskillen, La Mon, Oxford Street,
                Teebane and Whitecross when, once again, it became politically
                necessary to resort to violence. And they will do the same
                again.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Doherty, the Member for West Tyrone, well
                appreciates that Omagh was once again — even if one step
                removed — a public-relations disaster for the Provisional IRA
                and Sinn Fein who have been struggling ineffectively with the
                condemnation of their former associates. The Real IRA has done
                and is doing nothing which is contrary to the ideology of Sinn
                Fein/IRA.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the recent debate in the House of Commons
                on the new anti-terrorist legislation it was pointed out that
                since 10&nbsp;April some 38 people had been murdered in Northern
                Ireland, 11 of whom were not involved in Omagh, including people
                murdered by &quot;good terrorists&quot;. By &quot;good
                terrorists&quot; I mean terrorists whose organisations and the
                political parties fronting them are ostensibly within this
                process.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">More than 37 punishment shootings, some of
                them fatal, have been committed in an effort by these parties
                and organisations to maintain control over those areas which
                they dominate. There have been over 59&nbsp;brutal punishment
                beatings, inflicting injuries which are orthopaedically and
                physically very often more grave than shootings, all of which
                were sanctioned by organisations fronted by political parties in
                this Assembly. That is why I referred yesterday to the need to
                have democratic, non-violent principles as the touchstone for
                participation in the Assembly or its Executive.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let me close with this anecdote. When
                Parliament was recalled to debate the anti-terrorist legislation
                I spoke to a former member of the Shadow Northern Ireland Labour
                team and pointed out this distinction between &quot;wicked&quot;
                terrorists outside the process and &quot;good&quot; terrorists
                within it. I pointed out that the &quot;good&quot; terrorists
                had committed nine murders and umpteen beatings and shootings. I
                said &quot;Is it not immoral for any Government, and
                particularly for the Mother of Parliaments, to be sanctioning
                such a distinction?&quot; His reaction was &quot;I do not
                consider it immoral, because the peace process must go on.&quot;
                The peace process must, therefore, sanction murders of the kind
                to which I have referred as long as they are perpetrated by
                people who, ostensibly, support the process and can offer us
                their hypocritical expressions of grief about what happens.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is not sufficient for Omagh to be the
                occasion for an emotional outpouring of grief, necessary though
                that may be. There must be a rational, cold analysis of the
                underlying factors, principles and ideologies which permitted it
                to occur, and it is the duty of the Assembly, as it is the duty
                of the House of Commons, to purge itself of those who think
                otherwise.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Ervine:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not think that I, or any Member here,
                fully understands the immeasurable pain and suffering of the
                people of Omagh. Many have pointed out that the size of the
                atrocity in Omagh sets it apart from the many other atrocities
                that we have had to live with over the last 30 years. Maybe we
                will never fully understand the grief and suffering and pain
                that is abroad in our society. But Omagh will not go away; Omagh
                will not be forgotten.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The physical and mental legacies are two
                reasons for that. It will be seen in those who were disfigured,
                left limbless or blind or had other serious injuries. Some of us
                are not in Omagh very often, and every time we drive through, we
                may see someone on crutches, or someone with a guide dog. We
                will be being reminded for a very long time to come, more
                especially because of the ages of some of the victims.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I share in the tributes to the carers, those
                heroes and heroines who saw and dealt with that which no human
                being should ever have to deal with. Yet I heard the voices
                coming from Omagh — soft, determined and dignified, wanting
                Omagh to be the last. Whether they were on the &quot;Yes&quot;
                side or the &quot;No&quot; side, they certainly wanted Omagh to
                be the last, and I hope that it was the last. I am not
                clairvoyant, and predictions have been made here today, but I
                sense that Omagh was a watershed. There was the strong attitude
                of the Government, determined — some would say for the first
                time — to be the moral guardian of democracy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Politicians, in the main, are coming to their
                senses and realising the level of brutality and pain there, and
                we are sensing that it has to be different. Then there has been
                the attitude, more especially, of the ordinary people. From
                wherever it came, there was absolute condemnation, revulsion and
                anger that more bodies and last breaths had been taken away from
                us on a vehicle of ideology, inflicting again that which has
                already been inflicted — against their will.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have heard talk about ambivalence, and in
                the past there has indeed been ambivalence from all sides. Prior
                to the Omagh bombing, I heard the leader of Sinn Fein being
                accused of ambivalence towards the bombing of Banbridge and
                Moira. But was it ambivalence, or was it fear on his part? All
                groups have three sets of people: the thin band that is the
                leadership, the thin band that are the moralists, and the vast
                swathe of people in between who wish that the leader, or
                leaders, could say the things that would get the moralists off
                their backs. We are experts about that, are we not? The
                predictors, the prophets, who tell us what we really do not want
                to hear — even though they have no concept of how they are
                going to take us beyond the brutal subculture of violence, they
                condemn all and sundry. I can say this because I have stood and
                taken such condemnation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I accept my complicity; I accept my
                responsibility; and I expect others to do the same. The
                moralists never do anything wrong. They are better people than
                everybody else; they are more honourable than everybody else;
                they are better Unionists or Nationalists than everybody else,
                but they do not take us anywhere. They take themselves to nice
                places. They do well for themselves, but they do not offer my
                society very much.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I heard a journalist say that we had to
                consider the cock-up theory for Omagh, that young men, not
                experienced in paramilitary ways, panicked. I do not accept
                that, but there is a historical reason for my not accepting it.
                I can remember bombs going off in Northern Ireland. I can
                remember no-warning car bombs. And I can remember worse — car
                bombs when the warning gave the wrong location of the bomb. That
                was around the time when two IRAs were created: the Official IRA
                and the Provisional IRA. Can some parallel be drawn between that
                and the present-day split between Real IRA and the Provisional
                IRA? Perhaps the leaders of the organization that is associated
                with the Provisional IRA have learnt lessons from the very acts
                that they themselves committed when they succeeded in taking
                over that organization.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The one big difference that exists now is the
                will of the people. That is the new dynamic in the politics of
                Northern Ireland — 71.12% of the people supported the
                Agreement. I listened yesterday to those who vociferously, and
                quite brutally, attacked the Leader of Unionism. They accused
                everyone else of not being democrats, and then by their very
                actions, language and attitude, challenged the single, most
                important democratic decision that has ever been taken in
                Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">They have the right to challenge political
                opinions. They have the right to ensure that their voices are
                heard. They have the right to share in the government of this
                society and begin a process of healing and building and
                delivering of services. But they do not have the right to rerun
                the referendum — not at any time. Those who have described me
                as &quot;pathetic&quot; need seriously to look at our future.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have heard the decommissioning issue being
                dealt with along with Omagh. I understand that there may be a
                bit of brinkmanship here, but if Mr&nbsp;McGuinness cannot
                deliver — and I emphasize &quot;cannot&quot; — what happens
                next?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And in returning to the issue of Omagh, I
                hope and pray that the caring, the sympathy and the outpouring
                of love that have been directed towards Omagh will continue,
                because many people in our society who have been hurt and
                wounded have not been the recipients of such love, and that
                makes me feel that we may have only a short attention span in
                circumstances like these. Omagh happened to us, to our people,
                and it must not be forgotten.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms&nbsp;Morrice:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The tragedy in Omagh has had a profound
                effect on all of us. Never in my life have I experienced such
                shock and sadness throughout the community. It has been said
                that none of us will ever forget 15&nbsp;August&nbsp;1998. We
                will remember the men, women, and children who lost their lives.
                We will remember those who were maimed and those who were
                injured — indeed, some are still in hospital just along the
                road from here. We will remember their families in Omagh, in
                Buncrana, in Madrid, so cruelly torn apart by this terrible and
                horrific tragedy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When we speak of man’s inhumanity to man we
                will remember Omagh. We will also remember the
                Quinn&nbsp;family, and Teebane, and Oxford&nbsp;Street, and the
                Shankill&nbsp;Road and all the other atrocities. I have been
                able to visit Omagh, and above all I will remember the
                tremendous grief and the dignity in the words and the deeds of
                the families of the victims and those directly affected by the
                bombing in the days and weeks that followed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We in the Northern Ireland Women’s
                Coalition want to add our names to the long list of people from
                near and far who have sent their heartfelt sympathies and
                condolences to the families of the dead and injured. We also
                want to convey our sincere appreciation to the medical services,
                the emergency services, the security services, the health and
                social services, the volunteers and all those who responded so
                swiftly to the call for help. There is no doubt that they played
                a hugely important role in the immediate aftermath of the
                bombing. But we must also remember that they are still playing a
                vital role now and will continue to do so in the weeks, months
                and years to come.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We pay tribute to the determination, courage
                and strength of spirit shown by all those who have been touched
                by this outrage. We stand in their shadow. The people of Omagh
                and all who have suffered have shown us what real greatness is.
                Their determination to rebuild their lives and the life of their
                community is a lesson to us all. Every step we take in this
                Chamber towards the creation of a peaceful society will be taken
                in the shadow of their suffering and of all those who suffered
                before them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is inadequate merely to condemn the
                actions of a minority who are bent on destroying the
                peace&nbsp;process. We must go further and show our
                determination to stand firm against all acts of violence. We
                pledge ourselves — and I hope everyone else in the Chamber can
                pledge themselves — to work for a better, peaceful, stable,
                democratic, non-violent society, in which every man, woman and
                child has a sense of belonging and a feeling of security.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like to take a moment to pay tribute
                to the work of the First&nbsp;Minister (Designate) and the
                Deputy First&nbsp;Minister (Designate). Both have shown real
                leadership throughout these dark days. By their actions, they
                have shown their determination to move forward towards a better
                future. Together, they are guiding the Assembly with a
                combination of strength and sensitivity, and we know that that
                will be the hallmark of their leadership. They have our full
                support.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are Members who will criticise their
                efforts. Some will say that they are going far too slowly;
                others will say that they are going far too fast. The Women’s
                Coalition wants to see the Agreement implemented as fully and as
                swiftly as possible, but we will caution against any knee-jerk
                reaction. We cautioned against the introduction of new emergency
                legislation in the aftermath of the Omagh bombing. We agree with
                what Mr&nbsp;Neeson has said, that the perpetrators must be
                brought to justice, and the sooner the better, but we are
                concerned that any possible miscarriage of justice could be
                counter-productive. The Omagh bombers are isolated in our
                society, and they must continue to be starved of the oxygen of
                support. Never, never, never can the use of violence be
                justified as a means to an end — political or otherwise.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Women’s Coalition welcomes all
                statements saying that violence must end, and we also welcome
                the recent ceasefire announcements. We commend the courage and
                determination of the people who have held firm to their
                commitment of non-violence. We continue to call for an end to
                all acts of violence, and we call on all those with influence to
                work for a future in which every weapon of war is removed from
                society for ever. The Women’s Coalition is working towards
                this end, and we will continue to do that in the Assembly and by
                building a culture of tolerance in society.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Much has been said about the cost of this
                violence in monetary terms, but not enough has been said about
                the cost in human terms. Much greater priority should be given
                to the victims, to those who are condemned to live with the
                legacy of war. Even after the guns are silenced, and more than
                anyone else, the victims of violence deserve our support. The
                Women’s Coalition recognises this in the Good Friday
                Agreement, and today we reiterate the demand more forcibly than
                ever that no door should ever be closed to a victim of violence.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Children who have lost their parents and
                grandparents or who have witnessed events on their doorsteps
                that would be X-rated in our cinemas must be guaranteed our
                unflinching support. The Assembly must not be found lacking in
                its support for such victims, and until we have the power to
                provide that assistance, we call on the Government to introduce
                sensitive measures quickly to ensure help for the people of
                Omagh, the Quinn family and all the others who have suffered so
                terribly over the last 30 years or so on their journey towards
                emotional and physical recovery.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Omagh must be the last atrocity, and the
                greatest memorial that the Members of the Assembly could give to
                the victims of Omagh and to the others who have suffered so
                tragically would be a re-doubling of their efforts to work for
                peace.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many words of sympathy have been expressed in
                the Assembly this morning. I am sure that they were all well
                meant and said with feeling. Let me quote some that express the
                agony of Omagh:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;I left him down to the bus and he was
                so excited that he jumped out of the car before saying goodbye.
                But he did look at me and smiled in the way he normally did. He
                had a beautiful smile and was such a happy, gifted child.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To see him lying there with half his head
                gone and those most beautiful green eyes looking out as if he
                was waiting for me was devastation. I never realised how green
                his eyes were. That image will stay will with me for the rest of
                my life. They have taken away my baby; they have robbed him of
                his future, and for what? I will never forgive the evil men who
                carried out this&nbsp;deed.&quot;</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Such are the poignant words of a
                broken-hearted mother.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">How could they? The heartache, the
                heartbreak, torn and rent bodies, the bloodlust, the absolute
                horror of Omagh are all so inconceivable. How anyone could plot,
                plan, co-ordinate and then activate such horror on any community
                is beyond comprehension. Our hearts bleed for the victims of the
                Omagh carnage. Only they will understand the real trauma of such
                evil. Our prayers are for them at this very sad time.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In my home town of Enniskillen almost 11
                years ago 11 people died in similar circumstances. Two people
                died in my hands as I tried to console them. My neighbour lay
                dead behind me. I assisted in pulling a survivor,
                Mr&nbsp;Jim&nbsp;Dixon, who still suffers from the injuries
                sustained, out of the rubble where he would have perished. I
                think of Mr&nbsp;Ronnie&nbsp;Hill who has lain in a comatose
                state since that fateful day. I became the social worker to the
                Enniskillen Fund, completing 130 visits to the victims and the
                bereaved. I refer to all of this, not out of bravado, but to
                emphasise that Omagh suffered, to an extreme degree, what others
                throughout Northern&nbsp;Ireland have also suffered.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is in the event of such carnage that it is
                realised just how much outlying areas of the province value the
                acute hospital services. They are vital. What would have
                happened to the victims of Omagh if the Tyrone County had not
                been an acute hospital and if the Erne Hospital in Enniskillen
                and the South Tyrone Hospital in Dungannon had not been
                available to render invaluable medical support? Access to a
                hospital when life or death issues are presented is absolutely
                vital. The death toll could have been so much greater without
                the availability of those hospitals.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I cannot pay tribute enough to all the
                hospitals throughout the province for the services they provide,
                to the agencies which offer help and to all who showed such
                tremendous bravery and courage in the face of horrific scenes of
                bloodletting. Thank God for the compassion of all who serve this
                afflicted community.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, the obvious question is this: have
                Mr&nbsp;Adams and his Sinn Fein associates taken any steps to
                discourage such heinous crimes over the years? It has already
                been said that they and the IRA are inextricably linked. Both
                Governments have stated so many times. The IRA said some time
                ago that IRA members who are also members of Sinn Fein may sit
                in British institutions. This dispensation is also verification
                of the inextricable link made manifestly clear. This Assembly is
                a British institution accepted by all who pledged themselves to
                the Agreement on Good Friday, and Sinn Fein is telling us that
                it has permission from a terrorist grouping to be here.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We trust that never again will such evil
                present its ugly face and that those who have been involved in
                any kind of terrorist activity over the years, or who presently
                lie through their teeth, will, if not caught by the temporal
                law, one day suffer the wrath and indignation of Almighty God.
                Such recompense is inescapable. The need is therefore for
                repentance and disarmament on the parts of unlawful groups. This
                is essential.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Republican elements and others must now
                activate decommissioning to evidence good faith, honesty and
                intent and, as the Agreement dictates, commitment to
                non-violence and exclusively peaceful and democratic means.
                Never should our people ever again have to experience the pain,
                the deaths, the carnage of another Omagh, La&nbsp;Mon, Greysteel,
                Loughinisland, Shankill Road, Enniskillen, Teebane and such
                like.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In my constituency of Fermanagh and South
                Tyrone we have suffered over the years along the border with the
                murder of so many good citizens — ethnic removal indeed.</p>

                lips, and peace, therefore, is the key. When illegal weapons and

                bring about terror and destruction, peace will prevail. There
                must be evidence of decommissioning by such people now; there
                must be no more stunts with weapons and explosives; now is the
                hour; there cannot be any equivocation on this matter.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is with a sincere sense of service that I
                speak to the House today. The topic of my maiden address to this
                august body fills me with great sadness. I have worked and
                played in Omagh and, several times in the past weeks, I have
                prayed in Omagh.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The entire civilised world now equates the
                name Omagh with atrocity — the vileness of man’s inhumanity
                to man. In the annals of our tragic history, Omagh will
                symbolise the levels of inhuman barbarity into which our little
                land has been plunged time and again.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Fortunately, we have witnessed the
                magnificent response of the good people of Northern Ireland to
                the emergency in Omagh. Doctors, nurses, police, emergency
                services, social workers and the entire community reacted with
                great love, care and compassion to help the dying, the wounded,
                and the broken-hearted. We have all suffered from this tragic
                wrath. Let me reiterate our deepest sympathy to the bereaved,
                the maimed and the young minds which have been blighted and
                disillusioned by the absence of peace in Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let me say to fellow Members that surely this
                is not the legacy that we wish to bequeath to our sons and
                daughters. There is an old African saying which is used at

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Death is not the extinguishing of the

                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Assembly should ensure that a new day has

                and mutual respect to guarantee that that new day will bring
                peace, prosperity and the joy of living to our young people. Let

                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev William McCrea:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For 14 years I had the privilege of
                representing the people of Omagh in another place. They are a
                courageous people. The dignity with which they have borne their
                grief ought to have touched the heart of every decent citizen.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Omagh was a tragedy of immense proportions.
                Twenty-nine innocent victims were blown apart by a bomb
                designed, coldly planned and detonated by evil men. As a member
                of a family that has endured similar barbarity, I unreservedly
                condemn the IRA action in Omagh. I have heard it said that no
                one can fully understand the pain people suffer except he has
                been there. That is true. No one can understand the darkness of
                the night the families pass through unless he has been afflicted
                in like manner. The atrocity of Omagh cannot be fully described
                in words.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The heartache and the grief that were
                experienced by so many families have rent the hearts of so many
                others over the past 30 years. The genuine expressions of
                sympathy by those from every walk of life were admirable, but
                many families have suffered throughout the province over the
                years. It must take a brass neck for certain people to sit in
                this elected body and not blush when they think of the
                atrocities of the past. The pain of Omagh was not the
                commencement of heartache. Over the past 30 years other families
                have endured similar tragedies. When we talk about 29 families
                we talk about 29&nbsp;individual families. But think of the
                countless hundreds of individual families who to this very day
                grieve for loved ones who were brutally done to death.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I stood on the bridge in Omagh with my back
                to the awful carnage and wreckage in the town. I looked to my
                right down the Ballygawley Road, where 13 young soldiers were
                brutally done to death. And then there is Teebane. I looked down
                the Cookstown Road and remembered the innocent workmen that got
                into the van in Omagh to make their way home to Cookstown and
                Magherafelt — men who had done a hard, honest day’s work,
                trying to make a living for their families. As they made their
                way home that night they were watched until their van came to
                the place where the bomb was detonated right on time. Those men
                were blown to bits. I stood amidst the broken bodies and helped
                the security forces and members of the other services pick up
                the pieces.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No words of condemnation or regret have been
                uttered concerning those bombings. And when I hear Members in
                this Chamber condemn the Real IRA, I ask myself if this is the
                day when we are going to hear Mr&nbsp;Adams condemn the
                Provisional IRA. Is this the day when we are going to hear
                Mr&nbsp;McGuinness condemn the Provisional IRA? It is
                interesting that they have condemned this atrocity because it
                was the work of the Real IRA, even though the Real IRA was using
                the weaponry of the past. It is a different organisation; it is
                not the Provos. That is why they could say &quot;We condemn this
                action&quot; because it made them blush. They did not blush when
                the bodies were being picked up at Teebane.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">They did not come on to the television and
                condemn Warrenpoint, La Mon, Ballygawley, the Droppin’ Well
                Inn or Oxford Street. Perhaps some Members could tell us all the
                sordid details. And, of course, we have the two young corporals
                who were so brutally done to death. The persons who did that
                deed were certainly not squeaky clean.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But words are cheap. It is totally insincere
                to condemn the Real IRA without condemning the Provisional IRA
                and every other grouping, irrespective of which side of the
                community it comes from, because every other paramilitary
                grouping has carried out acts of terrorism. I think of the
                tragedies that have happened throughout Mid Ulster. We went to
                Government after Government and begged for action. We went to
                security chief after security chief and begged for action. But
                nothing was done. Today, however, political manoeuvrings
                demanded that something had to be done, and so anti-terrorism
                legislation was rushed through the House of Commons.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let us have decommissioning of all the
                weapons that are in the hands of terrorists and paramilitary
                organisations. I salute the security forces that have protected
                the people of this province. It is interesting to note that over
                the years even Sinn&nbsp;Fein/IRA has been very happy to lift
                the phone and ring when help was needed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have heard today in this Chamber that Omagh
                will not go away and that Omagh is different. What is the
                difference between Omagh and Teebane? I know a woman whose
                husband was murdered at Teebane. She asked me if everyone had
                forgotten her husband, if anyone cared about her child, who is
                being brought up without a father and who cries himself to sleep
                even to this day. He is begging for a father who will never come
                home again. Then I think about those who condemned the incident.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What is the difference between Omagh and what
                happened to my family? Fifty bullets were fired at my home from
                an AK-47 in an attempt to kill my wife and children. But there
                will be no words of condemnation because those words are
                selective. This province has endured the nightmare of terrorism,
                and the terrorists must be defeated.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">La Mon and Enniskillen may be forgotten, but
                it is said that Omagh is different. I say to the people of Omagh
                that their grief is genuine and their hurt such that no one can
                ever imagine or understand its depths. But I also want to say to
                the people of Omagh that if the Government do not bring to
                justice those who were responsible for all those deeds, whose
                hands are stained with blood, that if they think that they have
                escaped into the darkness of the night and got away with their
                evil deeds, and that if they think that they will get political
                gain through the power of a gun, there is a day to come that God
                has ordained.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is the day when men shall stand before
                God and every deed will be brought before Him. The Bible says</p>

                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is forgiveness with God, and there is
                pardon with God, but there is only one pathway to that pardon
                and forgiveness and that is repentance. The Scriptures say</p>

                Co&nbsp;Donegal, Spain and the length and breadth of this
                island. A community is sharing tragedy, and I do not pretend to
                understand what those worst affected are going through. Horror,
                pain and grief have affected many people in many communities. It
                is heartbreaking. All of the adjectives that could be used have
                been used. I acknowledge and recognise the hurt that Unionists
                have felt, and I ask for similar recognition and acknowledgement
                of our hurt. We have suffered as well.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I regret — I say this mildly and not
                stridently — that some Members cannot resist political point
                scoring even when we are all united by the horror at what
                happened in Omagh.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I heard the news of Omagh on the radio at
                7&nbsp;o’clock as I was driving home from Dublin. I just heard
                enough to know that something very serious had happened in our
                county town. I began to think about my daughter Niamh, my wife
                Paula, my parents, my brothers and sisters and everyone else who
                might be affected by the tragedy. I went directly to the Omagh
                leisure centre where recently I had had a political debate with
                Mr&nbsp;Maginnis, Mr&nbsp;Durkan, Ms&nbsp;McWilliams and
                Mr&nbsp;Ervine.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr&nbsp;Byrne chaired those proceedings, and
                the leisure centre will be familiar to some Members from outside
                Co Tyrone. We stayed in the leisure centre for more than
                20&nbsp;hours. It was my birthday, and I recalled the seven
                happy years that I had spent at the Christian Brothers Grammar
                School and my walks through the streets now affected by the
                bomb. I had made many friends, socialised and shopped in Omagh.
                What happened next was a seemingly never-ending succession of
                wakes and funerals.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those present will never forget what happened
                at the leisure centre: people were queuing up to go to the
                morgue and identify their loved ones.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Then the funerals began. The first were those
                of Mrs&nbsp;Grimes, her daughter, Avril&nbsp;Monaghan with her
                unborn twin girls and her daughter, Moira. The most recent
                funeral, was that of Sean&nbsp;McGrath. Few people know that
                Libby&nbsp;Rushe’s mother, Mrs&nbsp;Eileen&nbsp;McCulla, has
                subsequently died at the age of 96, heartbroken to the end.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A dignified candlelight vigil was held at the
                Drumraw&nbsp;Avenue/Ulsterbus car park in Omagh. Many prayers
                have been said in Ireland and abroad, including Donegal and
                Tyrone and places like Fintona, Dromore and Castlederg. The dead
                and injured were young and old, an amazingly diverse grouping
                who happened to be in the one place, at the one time. There was
                parity of suffering: boys and girls; men and women; Irish people
                and Spanish people; people from Tyrone and people from Donegal;
                and Nationalists and Unionists. From one family a father and son
                died, and from another a grandmother and her daughter and
                granddaughters. Many were close friends and good neighbours. It
                is hugely devastating for everybody.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All who helped deserve commendation. The
                professionalism of the Tyrone County Hospital staff stands out
                for me. Voluntary helpers answered the call. Having been born in
                Tyrone County Hospital, I shudder to think of the consequences
                had plans gone ahead to remove the acute services from the
                hospital before 15&nbsp;August. The total of 32 deaths — if
                the accident victim from Co Antrim is included — would have
                been more.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am reluctant to make a political point,
                however, I have no doubt that the death toll would have been
                significantly higher but for the existence of the Tyrone County
                Hospital. That is a compelling argument for ensuring that the
                Tyrone County Hospital is retained as a first-class acute
                services hospital. Indeed, it should be upgraded and expanded.
                It would be terrible if it were not retained — that whole
                swathe of rural territory west of the River Bann would be
                disadvantaged.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A Chathaoirligh, tá muid uilig ag mothú na
                péine. Aithním go bhfuil go leor leor duine in Éirinn a thuig

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is difficult to dwell on the political
                implications. If there is to be a political response, let it be
                the speedy implementation of the Good Friday Agreement; let
                everyone hold his nerve.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many of those bereaved by the carnage in
                Omagh have pointed to the way forward for all of us. They have
                very earnestly said that they want to see the further
                development of the peace process. Even in the depths of personal
                despair they have communicated that message to us very clearly
                and coherently.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a long road ahead for the people of
                Omagh. Those in that area, district and county will need every
                conceivable help. We are all still coming to terms with what has
                happened, and we need to tread gently. Hearts will continue to
                bleed in Omagh for a long time to come. However, there is hope:
                hope that is represented by Sean Clarke and Alan Rainey at an
                official level, hope in the birth of baby Chloe Emery from the
                Campsie area who was born in the South Tyrone Hospital and is
                now about four&nbsp;weeks old.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For me, the hope and spirit of Omagh shone
                through when Niall McSorley took his place for Omagh St Enda’s
                in the Tyrone County final against&nbsp;Ardboe O’Donavan Rossa’s
                at Pomeroy St&nbsp;Plunkett’s on Sunday afternoon.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to commend everybody — low profile
                and high profile — who came to Omagh. Let us all take our
                responsibilities seriously with a visible, speedy and real
                enactment of the Good Friday Agreement — that is the least we
                can do. Go raibh míle maith agaibh.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGimpsey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to be associated with the expressions
                of sympathy and sorrow towards the people of Omagh — to those
                who died, to the injured and to their relatives who are trying
                to come to terms with what happened and with the pain, physical
                and mental, which they are suffering as a result of the trauma
                of a random bomb set off for a political end. I have close
                family in Omagh who had the good fortune on that Saturday to
                break their routine — they were not on that street when they
                normally would have been. It is the juxtaposition of that with
                the cruel fortune of those who were on that street then which
                is, I suppose, impossible to understand, to rationalise and to
                come to terms with.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The people of Omagh that I met in the
                aftermath had a simple message: they want the Agreement to work;
                they want peace. People in the province want security; they want
                to live in peace. As Fr&nbsp;Denis&nbsp;Faul would say, they
                want to live in peace; they want to die in peace; and they want
                to rest in peace. It seemed to me that that was the strong
                message coming from Omagh in the immediate aftermath of the
                bombing, and other Members have alluded to that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The point was made to me by people living in
                the town that if Omagh was to mean anything at all — if
                anything good was to come of it — it must be that this process
                would somehow succeed, that the Agreement would be made to work,
                and that the will of the overwhelming majority of the people of
                Northern Ireland would be adhered to by the politicians in this
                political process. The people who set off that bomb did so
                deliberately, in a ratcheting up of their bombing campaign —
                Moira, Banbridge and then Omagh — to ensure that the political
                process that we are all engaged in was firmly knocked off
                course, or even destroyed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If we fail in this process, the Real IRA will
                have succeeded. We do have problems with it. Indeed, the United
                Kingdom Unionist Party and the Democratic Unionist Party spent
                most of yesterday talking about those problems and giving their
                opinion, for example, that decommissioning was not being treated
                as a sine&nbsp;qua&nbsp;non. That is a major hurdle, obviously,
                but we are trying to get over it, and we do need some progress
                on it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are currently acting under the part of the
                Agreement which sets out the transitional arrangements. Those
                transitional arrangements require an absolute commitment to
                democracy and non-violence. That is the principle underpinning
                everything that we are about, the basic building block of the
                process. That was the demand in Omagh in the aftermath of the
                bombing, and it was the demand of the overwhelming majority of
                our people. To me, it is self-evident that having a military
                wing is the antithesis of a commitment to democracy and
                non-violence. This is not a Unionist point of view, it is a
                tenet of civil society and the basis of a democratic society,
                and you cannot go forward claiming to have a commitment to
                democracy and non-violence and yet having armed military wings.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So how do we move forward? It seems to me
                that steps have to be taken. We have waited 20&nbsp;years for
                what we have now, and the demand to rush forward has severe
                risks. What are a few weeks here or there after these 20 years
                with all the atrocities, hurt and pain that were mentioned this
                morning? It seems to me that on decommissioning, for example, we
                have Gen de Chastelain sitting with his commission and getting
                very little co-operation, as I understand it. It seems to me
                essential that we move forward and at least agree the mechanics
                of decommissioning, some form of stocktaking and a timescale.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not think that anyone on this side of
                the House believes that all the guns and ammunition can be
                delivered on day one in one fell swoop. But look, for example,
                at the negotiations between the Soviet Union and the United
                States on nuclear disarmament: the Strategic Arms Limitation
                Treaties I, II and III — a step-by-step process. Taking one
                step at a time and making progress with an agreed programme is
                the very least that the people of Northern Ireland expect.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a difference between requiring
                terrorist organisations to surrender their arms to a lawful
                authority and international negotiations between states about
                reducing nuclear arsenals. However horrible nuclear arms are,
                the two are not analogous. To suggest that you can proceed in
                the same way with a terrorist organisation as with Governments
                is to legitimise the very people who are holding the terrorist
                arms.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">May I thank Mr Roche for sharing that with
                me. It seems that he does not want any progress in this area. <i>[Interruption]</i>
                It appears to me that what we were listening to yesterday was
                justification for a situation in which there is no progress. All
                we heard yesterday was a particular interpretation of the
                Agreement. I do not care what the analogies are. All I am
                interested in is the end result, getting through this process,
                getting us into a situation where we can live in peace, die in
                peace and rest in peace. I am prepared to be pragmatic; I am
                prepared to take chances; and I am prepared to accept and be
                aware of the difficulties that the other side has with this.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In conclusion, if Omagh is to mean anything
                it must mean that we deliver somehow or other practical steps
                and in pragmatic form the Agreement for which the overwhelming
                majority of people voted. I am a democrat, and as a democratic
                politician that is the imperative that I will work to.</p>

                never been ambivalent about violence. We have always confronted
                violence from every quarter — and it has come from many
                quarters — and we continue to confront and challenge the
                attacks on human rights and assaults on the human dignity of

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The bomb in Omagh did not discriminate on
                grounds of nationality, tradition, age or gender. We saw that in
                the trail of suffering from Barcelona to Buncrana to Omagh and
                beyond. It extended to my own constituency of Fermanagh and
                South Tyrone where we lost one of the youngest victims,
                Maura&nbsp;Monaghan, together with her mother Avril and her two

                outpouring of sympathy. It has certainly helped those families,
                and it has been a comfort and a balm at a time of deep agony and
                grief.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We in Omagh were overcome by that immense
                sympathy, and we feel we have to respond, in a reasonable way,
                to that genuine outpouring. We should recognise that we have
                terrible trauma yet to come because, while we have buried our
                dead, there are 30 people in hospital who are maimed, disfigured
                and physically and mentally scarred. They have to be welcomed
                back into our community, to be re-integrated, accommodated and
                assured of a quality of life that is the best that we can
                provide. That is one of the long-term demands that we will have
                to meet in future.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Omagh atrocity was of an unprecedented
                nature. We have heard much this morning about the heroic efforts
                of those who came and made a contribution to the saving of life.
                It was immense, but perhaps one verse of a poem that was sent to
                me — ‘The Bomb in Omagh Town’— in its simple words says
                it all:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The many folk who rallied round and
                gave heroic aid —<br>
                The memory of their efforts from our minds will never fade.<br>
                They worked so hard for others, in a true, unselfish way.<br>
                What would we have done without them on such a dreadful
                day?&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The police, the Army, the doctors, the
                nurses, the bus drivers and the taxi men: they all helped —
                and even someone called Joe. I heard him say on the radio, in a
                very simple way,</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The house gave a terrible shake. I knew
                something desperate had happened. I put on me and went and done
                what I could.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An Omagh man, in his own way, understating
                the heroic efforts which every person in the community made.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I propose that, as well as the obvious people
                who will be truly and genuinely rewarded, everyone who helped in
                the aftermath of that atrocity should be given a special
                citation. They should all be brought together, as part of the
                process of mourning and healing, from humble Joe, who put on him
                and did what he could, to the skilled surgeons who saved many
                lives, and acknowledged in a noteworthy way by some royal
                personage.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was very important that no one died in
                Omagh because he was unable to get to the emergency services and
                also that the special efforts made by staff trained to deal with
                catastrophes — and we have had many, unfortunately, in our
                area — were successful.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">John&nbsp;McKinney’s claim to fame — or
                notoriety — is now that he has probably turned out to be the
                best disaster manager. He has suddenly risen to fame because of
                the important contribution he made in successfully managing the
                catastrophe, where the number of deaths could otherwise have run
                to hundreds rather than tens. All those people are to be
                commended, be they helicopter pilots, the taxi men or whoever.
                Unfortunately, another tragedy occurred outside Knock
                Presbyterian Church when one of the ambulances which was dashing
                was involved in an accident. A family was enjoying its in-car
                entertainment and did not hear the screaming sirens.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are mindful in Omagh, in the midst of our
                grief, that others are left behind. And I think particularly
                today of someone else whose world has fallen apart:
                Esther&nbsp;Gibson is dead and buried, but her boyfriend is left
                behind. That reality has yet to be dealt with.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I listened intently this morning to glean how
                people from outside the area view the atrocity. Of course the
                atrocity in Omagh was different, not just because of its scale,
                not just because of the horrific havoc that resulted and not
                just because the emergency services did such a brilliant job —
                it was different too because it internationalised terror.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The business of terrorists is terror, but
                what happened in Omagh was not like the Shankill bomb, which was
                equally horrific. People from Spain and from another
                jurisdiction on this island also suffered. Suddenly the grief
                and the agony that the people of my constituency have been
                suffering for 28&nbsp;years, not all of them Unionists or
                Protestants, some of them Roman Catholics, was discovered.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And when I look down through this photograph
                album that has been given to me, I get some idea of the extent
                of that horror in previous times. These are the photographs of
                24 tombstones in a little graveyard outside Castlederg — each
                one a memorial to the terror of the IRA. That is the reality of
                the pain and the suffering.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would not want to forget in the middle of
                this atrocity those who are perhaps sitting, listening to this
                so-called debate. As far as I am concerned, this is not a proper
                debate. We are simply stating the facts of terrorist horror
                committed not just in the constituency that I represent, but in
                every constituency in Northern&nbsp;Ireland. So terrorism has
                been exposed on the international scene for what it really is.</p>

                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yes, we will rebuild Omagh. This is the
                twenty-ninth time the town has been bombed, so almost every
                building in Omagh has been rebuilt, including the courthouse. In
                fact, the scene of the greatest devastation of all was all the
                new-build. The shops that are devastated now were rebuilt only
                recently.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We will rebuild Omagh. But first of all, we
                still need time to grieve, to mourn, to recover and to welcome
                home and reintegrate those who have suffered mental and physical
                scars. But we want to go further than that. As part of that
                rebuilding, we want to make sure that there is, somewhere in
                this province, a scene, a pastoral scene, an idyllic scene,
                where the people of Northern Ireland can come for those moments
                when they wish to reflect, mourn or grieve in privacy. We are
                country people, and we do not live with our nostrils in a
                microphone. We want to bury our dead with dignity and solemnity
                and mourn in private. Grief is not something that we wear on our
                sleeve.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We had many important visitors to Omagh. We
                had presidents, princes, party Leaders and all the rest. They
                brought one unfortunate thing to the scene. No sooner had they
                mouthed the words of condolence than they set about defending
                their political ideas. What is the relevance of the Belfast
                Agreement to a family in the midst of deep agony and grief? Is
                it relevant when a family is mourning?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We had to castigate the media from across the
                water for a despicable programme broadcast on Carlton
                Television. I have taken that up with the company, and I hope
                that it will compensate for that dreadful programme by helping
                us to make a video that will present a more positive picture of
                Omagh, nationally and internationally. But I must also pay
                tribute to the local media. They have been kind and sensitive to
                us all, and we should not brand all the media with the sins of
                one particular programme.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We met Mr Jim Lyons, special adviser to
                President Clinton, on the Tuesday before the President’s
                visit, and I made one appeal to him. It was not for money. Some
                people were so crass as to say that we wanted the mighty
                American dollar. You can not measure the pains of the bereaved
                in financial terms. I asked him to use his influence, as a
                representative of the most powerful nation in the world, to
                persuade the South of Ireland to act as a mature political state
                and not to hide the terrorists that perpetrated those dreadful
                deeds, not to provide an operational headquarters, and not to
                give them training grounds or allow the arms dumps to exist.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The greatest tribute to the people of Omagh
                would be for the two Governments to take responsibility for
                ensuring that democracy can operate freely, and that means that
                we must have good order. We must remember that the business of
                terrorists is terror. The hoax bomb warnings that we have had in
                Omagh are also part of that terror. Last Saturday, we had two of
                them, which badly disrupted business in our town. We will not be
                able to rebuild our businesses if the terrorists continue to
                terrorize us.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr&nbsp;M McGuinness:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat a Chathaoirligh. As an
                elected representative from a neighbouring constituency, of Mid
                Ulster, I should like to express my condolences to
                Mr&nbsp;Gibson, to all the other people who have lost loved ones
                and, indeed, to all those who were so grievously injured in the
                bomb explosion in Omagh.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was a terrible event. It was a shocking
                event. It was an event that had a very deep impact on every
                single Member of this Assembly — there is no question about
                that. It has been described as a watershed, and I believe that
                it was a watershed. There can be no doubt that the people who
                planted the bomb in Omagh and who described themselves as
                Republicans set out to destroy the peace&nbsp;process. All they
                have succeeded in doing is destroy themselves.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Within hours of the bomb exploding, Sinn Fein
                made its position clear through its party Leader. We condemned
                it — unequivocally — and we called on the bombers to stop.
                We called on the Republican and Nationalist people throughout
                the island of Ireland not to support them but to challenge them.
                And they did, and in doing that, they brought them into a
                position where they were compelled to call a cessation. It was
                the weight of Republican opinion which brought about this
                cessation; these people have enough intelligence to know that
                there is no way that they can hope to succeed without the
                support of the people.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The bomb explosion in Omagh — that sad
                event — strengthened the hand of the people who support the
                Agreement. My assertion of this fact in the debate yesterday was
                challenged by some members of the Democratic Unionist Party, who
                said that it may have increased support for the Agreement in the
                Nationalist community but that it did not increase support in
                the Unionist community. I dispute that. The support within the
                Nationalist community for the Nationalist politicians who
                supported the peace process was almost total anyway, and I am
                convinced that, in the aftermath of Omagh, more and more
                Unionists recognised that the only way forward was to move
                forward in agreement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sinn Fein is very conscious of the
                implications of the Agreement and what we have committed
                ourselves to. Indeed, there is a declaration of support at the
                beginning of the Agreement which says that the participants in
                the multi-party negotiations believe that the Agreement offers a
                truly historic opportunity for a new beginning.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sinn Fein, the representatives of Irish
                Republicanism, have come to this Assembly for a new beginning.
                The tragedies of the past have left a deep and profoundly
                regrettable legacy of suffering. We must never forget those who
                have died or have been injured and their families, but we can
                honour them by making a fresh start whereby Members firmly
                dedicate themselves to the achievement of reconciliation,
                tolerance and mutual trust and to the protection and vindication
                of human rights for all. Sinn Fein want to be a part of this
                fresh start.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Listening to the debate this morning it is
                obvious — and it is also understandable — that people have a
                difficulty with Sinn Fein’s assertion that we want a fresh
                start. I understand that. I know it is difficult for Unionists
                of all descriptions, for the Democratic Unionist Party, for Mr
                McCartney and for the Ulster Unionists. I understand that
                completely.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The people we represent have difficulties
                also. Unionists deeply suspect that we are not genuine and not
                for real. The people whom we represent are also suspicious of
                Unionists and the British Government. They have lived in a state
                for over 70 years in which, they believe, they were treated as
                second-class citizens, treated unjustly, with inequality,
                discrimination and domination.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am not recriminating. We have to deal with
                these realities. Unionists point out my responsibilities to me
                and urge me to face the difficulties that Unionism has. I am
                prepared to do that. But I appeal to Unionists, including those
                in the Democratic Unionist Party, to face up to the reality that
                they too must look at us as the elected representatives of many
                tens of thousands of people living in this state who also want
                to see a new beginning. The question now is whether or not we
                can bring that new beginning about.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The decommissioning issue has been raised to
                assert that Sinn Fein is not serious. We have moved on that
                issue because our aim is to take all the guns — British and
                Irish — out of Irish politics. This morning we have heard
                speech after speech about the damage that IRA guns have done
                over the last 30 years, and the IRA has been named on countless
                occasions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">People have made sweeping references to
                Loughinisland and Greysteel. Nobody mentioned &quot;bloody
                Sunday&quot;. Nobody talked about the damage caused by British
                guns. Nobody talked about the Dublin/Monaghan bombings. Nobody
                talked about the children killed by plastic bullets. I am not
                getting into the politics of &quot;whataboutery&quot;. I just
                think that we need to have an honest debate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There has been much injustice in the past. We
                can, if we wish, rake all of this up for the next five months,
                five years or 50 years. If we do that, we are not going to make
                a new beginning and we are going to fail the overwhelming
                majority of people on this island who have placed so much faith
                and trust in us, as their political leaders, to find a way out
                of the morass that we have all been in during the last 70-odd
                years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I believe we can succeed. Yes, there are
                people out there who describe themselves as Republicans and who
                may attempt to continue to destroy the peace process. I believe
                they will fail miserably. I believe that many of them now know
                that. There are Unionists out there who will also try to destroy
                the process because — and we have to be very clear about this
                — it is not only guns and bombs that kill: words can kill
                also.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our responsibility is to give political
                leadership, not just to the people of Omagh, but to the
                relatives of the &quot;bloody Sunday&quot; dead and to the
                relatives of those people who were killed on the Shankill Road,
                in Enniskillen and in other attacks right throughout the course
                of the last 30 years. People have lived through all of that
                because politics have failed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are here for a new beginning. We are
                deadly serious about the search for peace; we are deadly serious
                about the search for justice; we are deadly serious about the
                search for equality; and we are deadly serious about the search
                for freedom. Either we can rise to the challenge or we can fail.
                We in Sinn Fein are geared to succeed and to make the Agreement
                work — and that should be the bounden duty of every serious
                elected representative in this room.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs E Bell:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am conscious that a number of things have
                been said that I do not want to repeat. However, I do want to
                join with others in extending my sympathy to Mr&nbsp;Gibson, his
                family and the people of Omagh.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr&nbsp;Paisley commented earlier that today’s
                debate was too late. Perhaps I can give some words of comfort.
                My church and a lot of the people who were relatives and victims
                in Omagh will be celebrating what is known as a &quot;month’s
                mind&quot;. There will be services today in Omagh, and this
                debate should act as another show of respect, sympathy and
                remembrance for all the people, Catholic, Protestant and others,
                who lost their lives that day. So I find this debate timely.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is not one Member who will have
                difficulty remembering, as with countless other tragedies, where
                and when he first heard of the Omagh bombing. Like Mr&nbsp;McElduff’s,
                my birthday is on 15&nbsp;August, and I was having a birthday
                meal in Tenerife when the news came out on CNN. My birthday will
                never be the same again.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Northern Ireland has suffered many tragedies:
                McGurk’s Bar, the Shankill&nbsp;Road — and I make no apology
                for repetition because we should never forget even one —
                Darkley, La Mon, Loughinisland, et&nbsp;cetera, and there was
                the murder of the three Quinn brothers from Ballymoney as well.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My personal memory is of a narrow escape from
                the Abercorn explosion, where friends, whom I was supposed to
                meet, and their children were injured. One was a 10-year-old boy
                who now has a mental age of three because of what happened on
                that day. The horror and fear came back to me, and I thought
                then that it would never happen again — but I was wrong.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is horrifyingly sad to have had so many
                such tragedies time and time again, and I can only repeat the
                hopes expressed by many of the grieving relatives and victims of
                Omagh that this must be the last. As has been mentioned in other
                debates, if relatives thought their tragedy would mean the end
                of all killings, they would be able to feel that their suffering
                was not in vain. We must always remember the victims of all
                tragedies and try to make sure that they are the last.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To achieve this, the people of Northern
                Ireland should consolidate their disgust by saying loud and
                clear to the people still engaged in violence that enough is
                really enough. The Assembly should support this by Members
                working together in a constructive way that would help to
                stabilise and create the conditions that would result in the
                reduction and eventual eradication of sectarianism and all its
                ramifications.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a peace activist and community worker I
                have seen at first hand how beneficial attempts to encourage
                inter-community and cross-community contact in a generally
                beleaguered community can be. There can be direct improvement in
                mutual understanding and tolerance of diversity, and that could
                be another avenue of work for the Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was clearly demonstrated at Omagh that the
                men and women of violence are no respecters of age, gender,
                religion or tradition. We must therefore build institutions and
                systems that will ensure that violence is met with severity from
                all sections of society — from the community to the Assembly.
                Words have never been enough. Language can be as violent as any
                actions, but our words of sympathy must be linked to
                constructive support, and support is urgently needed in Omagh
                today.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A proper representative Assembly could lead
                the way and show everyone that the only way to stop more Omaghs
                is by people working together in all aspects of government and
                daily life. In that way we could sustain a safe society for
                everyone. We were under no illusion on 10&nbsp;April when we
                signed the Agreement that the violence would end.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We had only to look at places like South
                Africa and the Middle East, where violence actually escalated
                after such agreements. But that should make us more determined
                not to indulge in saying &quot;Oh, it is never going to happen,
                peace is never going to happen.&quot; It should make us more
                determined that violence will stop and that we will have peace.
                We have a chance of a new beginning, and we must grab that
                chance and end the nightmares that have set us against each
                other for far too long.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The political process that we are now
                developing will, I hope, create conditions that will further and
                develop a real peace process. We owe that to all the victims and
                their relatives whom we have talked about this morning, to those
                victims of other tragedies and to future generations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I finish by expressing my appreciation to
                every person who has given assistance in the aftermath of
                atrocities over the years — the hospitals, the ambulance
                services, the Royal Ulster Constabulary, the Fire Authority and
                the many others.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Omagh brought all traditions together: people
                from the North and the South and from Spain were brought
                together in grief and friendship. True reconciliation was
                portrayed at every funeral. Let us hope that the war is really
                over for all of us and that we can go forward together having
                learnt from the past. The Alliance Party will certainly play its
                part in this process and hope that progress will be made. Let
                peace begin. Indeed, I would ask everyone to say to himself
                &quot;Let peace begin with me.&quot;</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr C Wilson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What happened at Omagh was an atrocity and an
                obscenity by anyone’s calculation. As reports started to
                filter through, one became aware of the enormity of the incident
                and the scale of the carnage — reports of men, women and
                children, grandmothers, an expectant mother and two unborn
                children. Graphic descriptions by eyewitnesses and harrowing
                scenes of dismembered pieces of bodies being washed down the
                High Street in Omagh as a result of a burst water main will
                remain with many of us for a long time, and undoubtedly with the
                people of Omagh for a lot longer.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the aftermath, and given the anger and the
                sense of revulsion that swept across the entire United Kingdom,
                the Irish Republic and, indeed, the rest of the world, one would
                have thought that the window of opportunity —&nbsp;although
                opportunity is perhaps the wrong word to use on this occasion
                — would have been taken by the British and Irish Governments,
                undoubtedly with full world-wide support, to implement a new
                root-and-branch approach to security. The incident itself was
                obscene, but the response of the two Governments who are
                responsible for law and order on this island was also obscene
                and totally inappropriate. That window of opportunity was
                squandered.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Not for the first time was the aftermath of
                carnage and death, instead of uniting all believers in democracy
                and the rule of law and order, used in a very wrong manner. Not
                for the first time was it used to drive forward what is referred
                to as the peace process, a process that has been driven by
                terrorism and fuelled by concessions to terrorism.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I back that suggestion up by asking Members
                to remember that at every stage in this process, when those who
                have been engaged with Sinn Fein/IRA have dragged their feet or
                refused to pay the instalments required of them, there has been
                a terrorist incident.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One can go back to Canary Wharf, to the
                Baltic Exchange and, indeed, to the incident that brought the
                current negotiations into being — the murder of two community
                policemen in Lurgan. There is a history, a catalogue of events
                that demonstrate that what I am saying is right.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For 25 years the people of Northern Ireland
                resisted the suggestion that the way to peace was to pay the
                price required by the terrorists. Indeed, on the radio this
                morning a journalist asked why this Assembly could not have
                happened 25 years ago. Many watching the television reports of
                these proceedings see a veneer of democracy, but it is only
                that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a belief that Members gathered here
                have a similar standing and legitimacy to be here today. The
                reality is that that is not the case. The reality is that we
                have a role to play. We have to hold the line and say that there
                is a difference in our values. There are those who come into
                this Chamber armed only with reasoned arguments and there are
                those who possess arsenals capable of replicating Omagh many
                times over.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It would be sad if Omagh were not to prove a
                turning point in the history of this province, a time when the
                days of the men of terror were gone for ever. The reality is
                that its legacy will be two-tier terrorism, and it is a disgrace
                that the British Government — my Government — have allowed
                this to happen.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is now a belief in some circles, and
                indeed it is held by some in this Chamber, that as my Colleague,
                Mr McCartney, has said &quot;If you are a good terrorist and
                support the peace process, any of these actions that are to be
                taken, all of this security that has been or will be
                implemented, will only be directed against the bad terrorists,
                against the Real IRA.&quot;</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The truth is that the Real IRA’s true
                description should be &quot;disgruntled members of the
                IRA&quot;. The explosives that were used in the bomb and the
                detonating equipment came from arms dumps which members of the
                Ulster Unionist Party and others see as the subject of
                negotiation. Is it not a disgrace that there are parties in this
                Chamber who condone the notion that it is legitimate for
                IRA/Sinn Fein to retain those weapons? We, of course, are aware
                of the reason for this complicity — Mr&nbsp;Adams, Mr&nbsp;McGuinness
                and their colleagues are vital to the peace process.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The indictment today has to be against the
                security forces. Members will recall that after other atrocities
                and incidents at least we always had — even though it may have
                been insulting in some cases — the cosmetic announcement that
                a large quantity of explosives or guns had been found by the
                Gárda or the Royal Ulster Constabulary.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.15 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To my knowledge it did not happen on this
                occasion because it would have upset the position of
                Mr&nbsp;Adams and Mr&nbsp;McGuinness in the peace process. So it
                was politically expedient not to allow the security forces to go
                and collect the weapons and explosives, even though they know
                where they are in most cases.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The people of Omagh have our heartfelt
                sympathy, and we are greatly indebted to all those who were
                involved in the security and emergency operations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have a view about the future, and it
                involves our contributing a three-point plan. First, we, as
                democrats, must continue to insist that the only people entitled
                to take part in governing this province are those who are solely
                and totally committed to the democratic process. We cannot see
                the process perverted any further. We must try to reclaim the
                ground. Secondly, the police and the authorities of law and
                order must have the shackles of political expediency removed
                from them. They must be allowed to deal with all terrorists,
                real or imaginary. And thirdly, the people of Omagh need the
                assistance and support of the Assembly to help rebuild their
                lives and their town — in this they will not find us wanting.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On yesterday’s ‘Thought for the Day’
                some Members may have heard Fr&nbsp;Michael Collins — quite a
                name — quoting from a poem by Kipling:</p>

                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I come from Omagh and was born in Mullaghmore.
                My father went there from the Royal Irish Constabulary in
                Dublin, and my first education from the age of five to seven —
                in those days we did not have pre-school education — was at
                the Loreto Convent, where I was taught by Mother&nbsp;de&nbsp;Sailes.
                It was she who taught me not only how to read but to love my
                religion and to have a feeling of self worth. It is that sort of
                spirit which is alive and well today in Omagh, a town with
                extremely fine people who live together in peace and who think
                well of each other.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the beginning of my time in the
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland Forum for Political Dialogue — I called
                my first day &quot;Capt Mainwaring’s day&quot; — I was
                interviewed by a lady from Dublin who asked me what I thought of
                Mr&nbsp;Gerry&nbsp;Adams. I told her that I admired
                Mr&nbsp;Gerry&nbsp;Adams, but she did not record what I went on
                to say. I said that I admired him particularly for his
                leadership and for the discipline which he exercises on Sinn
                Fein and its military outlet, the IRA. I have met Mr&nbsp;Adams
                only once before when he came to a youth forum chaired by me as
                part of my ideas for the Forum, and he behaved impeccably. He
                had every opportunity to make political points, but he did not
                do so, so I thanked him for that. Now is the chance for
                Mr&nbsp;Adams to show that leadership and discipline which I
                know he is capable of. Mr&nbsp;Adams brought the Semtex here.
                What about a big bang to get rid of as much of it as the Member
                can get hold of? It could make a huge difference.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As well as being an Assemblyman, I am the
                head of the Order of Malta in Northern Ireland. Three of our
                ambulances attended Omagh, one at great haste from Monaghan.
                They behaved impeccably. They did not want to be mentioned here
                today because the Order of St John, the Ambulance Service and
                all the other people involved in first aid activity did wonders,
                and thus did not want exceptions made. But I am so proud of them
                that I feel I must mention them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of our first-aiders,
                Donna-Marie&nbsp;Keys, is still lying in intensive care in the
                Royal Victoria Hospital with 60% burns. She was not there with
                the ambulances that day but with her fiancé and little flower
                girl. They took the full force of the bomb. Her fiancé was
                badly burned and she was desperately badly burned. She is still
                alive, just hanging on. Her parents, Malachy&nbsp;Keys and his
                wife, were there and they said to me &quot;Please, for God’s
                sake, keep this Assembly going; it is our only hope now.&quot;</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Surely it should be possible for the
                wonderful co-operation shown by all parties at Omagh, and which
                has been so well and touchingly described today, to be kept
                going in other parts of the province. We have heard from people
                such as Joe&nbsp;Byrne, Derek&nbsp;Hussey and Oliver&nbsp;Gibson
                what the people of Omagh need to give them a sense of belonging
                and the respect which they deserve, so we should do something
                about it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One such thing would be the commencement of
                disarming somewhere where it could be seen to have begun.
                Disarming has become the touchstone of our future. We have heard
                about the pike in the thatch. Rust brings trust and
                confidence-building measures such as the reconstitution of the
                Royal Ulster Constabulary.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Each of the hurdles faced by the parties has
                been overcome. The Trimble/Adams meeting has taken place. Surely
                the last hurdle left is disarmament. Start now, not in 2000.
                What is the need for explosives, when we have embarked on a
                peace process? What defensive quality has a bomb got? Let us
                stop dismissing the plea for decommissioning with weasel words
                like &quot;word games&quot; and irrelevance.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We had a really good day yesterday. There was
                no shouting; there was courtesy; reason ruled. If we can get rid
                of the bomb, we can achieve the wonderful future of peace,
                prosperity and pluralism, as advocated by the First Minister
                (Designate) and Deputy First Minister (Designate) yesterday.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Hendron:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I listened very carefully to Mr&nbsp;Gibson’s
                speech, and I was very moved. I sympathise with him on the
                slaughter of his niece. He made an important political point —
                that the Agreement would mean nothing to some families that he
                had spoken to. I understand that and respect his opinion, but
                there are other families who lost loved ones in Omagh, and
                families right across the North of Ireland who have lost loved
                ones over the last 25 years who do very much support the
                Agreement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I believe that the future peace of Northern
                Ireland depends on the Agreement. I associate myself, of course,
                with those who have condemned what happened in Omagh, and I
                fully appreciate the suffering of the families who have lost
                their loved ones or had loved ones very badly injured. I have
                good reason to do so.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In a medical capacity, I have visited many
                homes over the years of people who have lost loved ones. Their
                suffering is every day of the week and every week of the year. I
                very deeply resent that young children have had to grow up
                without a father or a mother, usually without a father.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When all the tears and the funerals are over
                and the great and the good have gone, the families have to pull
                themselves together. So often have I seen the young people of
                West Belfast — 16-, 17- and 18-year-olds from the
                Falls&nbsp;Road and the Shankill&nbsp;Road — who have had
                their father taken away from them getting into trouble with the
                law. But I will not elaborate on that point.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I visited the Royal Victoria Hospital within
                a few days of the explosion, and I was horrified at the injuries
                that I saw. One Member referred to Miss&nbsp;Keys, the lady who
                had received such terrible burns. I spoke to her family; I also
                spoke to other families, and I can only say that I greatly
                admired the dignity which these people were showing.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to thank the doctors, nurses and all
                of the staff of the Royal Victoria Hospital whose expertise
                helped to save lives. I was struck by their praise for the staff
                in Tyrone&nbsp;County Hospital. Those people, who were badly
                injured and who were transferred to the Royal Victoria Hospital,
                could not have survived without the expertise of Mr&nbsp;Pinto
                and all of the people associated with the hospital in Omagh —
                and I am referring to doctors, nurses, paramedics, cleaners,
                porters and everybody who got in on the act of helping.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the aftermath of Omagh, where are we now?
                What sort of a society are we in? There is still violence. There
                is still sectarian conflict. I believe that it is the
                responsibility of this Assembly, by its example, to make sure
                that the two great traditions can work together for all the
                people and especially for the disadvantaged.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The First Minister (Designate) and the Deputy
                First Minister (Designate) have shown great courage and
                leadership, and people like Mr&nbsp;Ervine and Mr&nbsp;Adams
                have shown great courage and leadership. But I want to put down
                a marker. We are all opposed to violence, but it is a fact that
                on the streets of Belfast, people are still having their knees
                smashed; young people are still being ordered out of the
                country, and paramilitary organisations are still deciding when
                they can come back. It is humiliating for a young person or his
                family to have to report to a quasi-political office.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In making these points I want to make it
                clear that I am not pointing the finger at any Member of the
                Assembly or at any party. I listened carefully to what
                Mr&nbsp;McCartney and Mr&nbsp;Ervine had to say.
                Mr&nbsp;McCartney talked about the wicked terrorists and the
                good terrorists. He talked about the fact that this Chamber must
                undertake a rational, cold analysis. I agree that there should
                be a rational, cold analysis, but I hope that it will be based
                on the Agreement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr&nbsp;Ervine said that what happened at
                Omagh was a watershed. He talked about moralists — and I agree
                that some people do see themselves as being on some sort of
                higher moral ground. They have a right, as Mr&nbsp;Ervine said,
                to challenge political opinions, but they do not have the right
                to rerun the referendum.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some people seem to be begrudgers; they seem
                to resent the fact that there is a peace movement. We want all
                the paramilitary organisations to disappear off the face of the
                earth, but I sometimes wonder what certain politicians would do
                if that were to happen.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There have been many attacks on Sinn Fein,
                and, having fought Mr&nbsp;Adams at four Westminster elections,
                I am not a spokesman for that party, but I believe — and I do
                not mean this in any condescending way — that he has shown
                great courage and leadership. Let all of us in the Assembly
                resolve to work together for all of the people of both
                traditions so that our children and our children’s children
                can have a meaningful and worthwhile future.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have come to the end of our agreed time.
                Many Members from almost all of the parties wished to speak in
                this debate to express their sympathies but did not have the
                opportunity to do so. And people outside this Chamber should be
                aware of that.</p>
