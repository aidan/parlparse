                Northern&nbsp;Ireland in respect of discrimination by reason of

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Dr Ian Paisley:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, Mr&nbsp;Speaker. Why was
                the Assembly given no notice of this Bill? Are we not entitled
                to be given notice?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No. In many other places, notice is not given
                of the First Reading of a Bill. The First Reading is purely a
                technical device to publicise the order for the Bill to be
                printed. When the Bill comes to its subsequent stages, those
                will go down on the Order Paper, but normally the First Reading
                does not. In certain circumstances it cannot go down on the
                Order Paper because the Speaker may decide to bring the Bill
                forward early, and that decision can be taken after the Order
                Paper has been published.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Dr Ian Paisley:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Further to that point of order, Mr Speaker.
                In the House of&nbsp;Commons, at times, the First Reading of a
                Bill does appear on the Order Paper.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Business Committee was not informed about
                this either. I understood that nothing could come before this
                House without passing through that Committee.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not know about the House of Commons, but
                certainly in the House of Lords there is never any notice of the
                First Reading of a Bill. In any case, there are differences here
                about the question of Bills coming forward, advice to the
                Speaker, the Speaker’s response, and so on.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There was, in fact, discussion in the
                Business Committee about Bills coming forward and the need for
                urgency in moving forward with the business of the House. It
                seems reasonable that this important Bill should come forward as
                quickly as possible.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Morrice:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Further to that point of order,
                Mr&nbsp;Speaker. This is, as you say, an important Bill that you
                are asking the House to accept. None of us know what it is
                about. How can we possibly accept it in this way?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The House has no option but to accept it.
                Under Standing Orders, it is not open for debate. It is purely a
                technical matter whereby the Bill is presented in order to be
                printed. It is not possible for the House to know exactly what
                is in the Bill until it has been printed. That is the purpose of
                the exercise. That is what the First Stage is about in the other
                places that Dr&nbsp;Paisley and I have referred to. It is not a
                matter for debate. The only way it could be done differently
                would be if there were a pre-legislative scrutiny stage, which,
                of course, there is not.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy First Minister:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There has been wide consultation on this
                Bill. A substantive Bill has been proposed at Westminster, and
                the bodies representing the disabled in Northern&nbsp;Ireland
                have made representations to it. The First&nbsp;Minister and I
                have had discussions with the Equality Commission and with other
                groups. It was their request, and our desire, that this Bill be
                finalised by May&nbsp;2000 so that there should be no gap in
                time between the completion of this Bill and the completion of
                the Bill at Westminster. Such a gap would have left
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland without any legislation on this crucially
                important matter. There has already been wide-ranging
                consultation.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Dr Ian Paisley:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Further to that point of order, Mr Speaker.
                It should be made clear that the House could vote against this.
                I do not think any of us want to do that, but the House is
                entitled to say that the Bill cannot be printed.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In fact there is no provision in Standing
                Orders for the House to do that. This is not a Question in that
                sense. There is no opportunity for this to be voted on; it is
                simply a presentation to the House and an order to be printed.
                That is the position under Standing Orders. Of course, the House
                may change the Standing Orders, and we would have to consider
                the legality of that with regard to the Act, but at this time
                the position is as I have stated.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister for Regional Development
                (Mr&nbsp;P&nbsp;Robinson): </p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></b>Further to that point of order,
                Mr&nbsp;Speaker. I do not think that anyone in the Assembly is
                saying that the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister
                should not introduce such a Bill, that it should not flow
                naturally from Great&nbsp;Britain legislation and that it is not
                timely for it to be introduced at this stage, but because the
                heading on the Order Paper merely reads &quot;Executive
                Committee Business&quot;, Members have no way of knowing what
                types of issues will be brought forward.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I suspect that Mr&nbsp;Mallon knew before
                today that he was going to introduce the Bill. Could the
                introduction of various Bills be listed on the Order Paper as a
                matter of courtesy and to keep Members informed?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The First Minister (Mr&nbsp;Trimble):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, Mr&nbsp;Speaker. Had
                Mr&nbsp;P&nbsp;Robinson carried out his duty by attending the
                Executive meetings, he would have known all about the matter.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister for Social Development (Mr&nbsp;Dodds):</b>

                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Perhaps before —</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr P Robinson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Such meetings are covered by confidentiality,
                so I could not have told Colleagues anyway.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Order. I will respond to points of order, and
                Members should try to keep some order. As far as the heading
                &quot;Executive Committee Business&quot; is concerned, Standing
                Orders make it clear that decisions about that matter or on the
                ordering of that matter are not for the Business Committee to
                make. It is for the Executive Committee to order the business in
                respect of that slot on the Order Paper.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Robinson raised some legal questions —
                for example, that this would have been known about and sorted
                out well in advance. Because of the timescale, that is not
                necessarily the case. The urgency with which the First Minster
                and the Deputy First Minister sought to bring this issue before
                the House meant that matters had to be resolved as quickly as
                possible. However, as regards the matter of the First Readings
                of Bills going down, there is no particular reason why that
                should be the case. In practical terms it would not always be
                possible for that to be the case, otherwise all Bills would have
                to be delayed further.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For example, this Bill could not have been
                brought today had that requirement been in Standing Orders —
                which it is not.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dodds:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, Mr&nbsp;Speaker. If,
                like the First Minister, members of the Democratic Unionist
                Party were in the business of breaking election pledges, then we
                would, of course, be sitting in the Executive. It may be all
                right to say that members of the Executive Committee who are
                present may know that these Bills will be coming forward, but
                what about the other Members of the House? Do the First Minister
                and Deputy First Minister — particularly the First Minister,
                given his remarks — have no consideration for other Members,
                who should at least be given the courtesy of knowing what is
                going to arise from the Order Paper? <i>[Interruption]</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Order. The Minister will resume his seat.
                This is not a point of order; this is becoming a debate. The
                Standing Orders are clear. It is not necessary for First
                Readings of Bills — certainly for First Readings at
                Westminster — to be on the Order Paper. In this case the
                matter could not have been on the Order Paper. That is the
                ruling, and I am not prepared to take further points of order on
                that specific issue. Some of the issues raised were not points
                of order. This technical matter is becoming a matter for debate,
                and that is not appropriate.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Further to that point of order,
                Mr&nbsp;Speaker. You would need to make it clear that even if a
                member of the Executive attends an Executive meeting, he would
                not be able to inform Colleagues of issues that would be coming
                forward if they were confidential. The person who was out of
                order in this debate was the First Minister.</p>

                its own business is not a matter for me or for the House.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The important thing is that the Executive
                Committee decided, rightly, that Northern Ireland should not
                lack disability legislation because of a particular timescale.
                This type of issue will arise in relation to other Departments.
                That may require urgent legislation so that parity is not
                broken. I should have thought that Mr&nbsp;Dodds would have more
                than a passing interest in ensuring that this House proceeded
                very quickly with matters that affect his Department — the
                Department for Social Development — as this one does, so that
                people are not disadvantaged as a result of delay.</p>

                proposals which would reward and elevate terrorists while

                members, both full-time and part-time, have diligently and with
                great distinction served the whole community.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am grateful for the opportunity to debate
                this issue this morning. As Members will be aware, only about
                20&nbsp;minutes were left at the end of the proceedings last
                week, and that was not enough time to enable us to explore these
                matters fully and allow Members who wished to express a view to
                do so. For that reason we withdrew the motion and sought
                permission for it to be reintroduced this week. It has been
                reintroduced, its terms are identical, and I am grateful to the
                members of the Business Committee who have allowed it to appear
                on the Order Paper today.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is right and timely that the Assembly
                should be deliberating this matter, given the events of last
                week and the statement made in the House of Commons by the
                Secretary of&nbsp;State to the effect that the Government are
                adopting virtually all the recommendations of the Patten
                Commission’s Report. Indeed, some reports made previous to the
                statement that only some changes would be made turned out to be
                largely groundless. There was some minor tinkering and some very
                minor changes were made to the proposals, but virtually all
                recommendations of real substance and meat were adopted, as were
                all those that are controversial and deeply devisive.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In spite of the large number of
                representations that were made right across the Province, the
                Government, nevertheless, proceeded to introduce virtually all
                the recommendations of the Patten Report.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In spite of the fact that, at present, this
                is a reserved matter, it is right that the Assembly should
                deliver an opinion on it. It would be amazing if the Government
                and all the pundits, commentators and media personnel who are so
                quick to tell us how important this place is and that the
                Assembly must and will make an impact on the lives of the
                ordinary people of this Province chose to ignore the democratic
                decisions of the House, particularly on an issue such as this.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that the House will decisively reject
                the Patten Commission’s report, and its conclusions and
                recommendations, and that in so doing, it will send a strong,
                emphatic signal to the Secretary of&nbsp;State and the
                Government that what they have announced is unacceptable,
                certainly as far as the Unionist community is concerned.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am sure that during this debate the deep
                anger, the deep frustration and the deep sense of
                disillusionment that is felt right across the Unionist
                community, and by many moderate Nationalists as well, will
                become apparent. Members of the minority community to whom I
                have spoken recently have expressed deep concerns about where
                all this will lead with regard to the policing of their
                communities. They have also expressed concern about the way in
                which Sinn&nbsp;Féin/IRA has hijacked the policing agenda and
                about the way in which the SDLP appears to have lain down while
                the Government have responded to the demands of the
                Sinn&nbsp;Féin/IRA propaganda barrage and to those demands
                alone.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Of all the issues which have flowed from the
                Belfast Agreement, this is the one which most touches a raw
                nerve in this community. It is bad enough that we should have
                unreconstructed IRA terrorist frontmen and their supporters in
                the Government of Northern&nbsp;Ireland; it is bad enough that
                virtually all terrorist prisoners have been released much
                earlier than they would otherwise have been, even under the
                normal early-release schemes; it is bad enough that we should
                have all-Ireland, cross-border bodies with executive powers —
                and I note that one of those bodies will meet in Newry today
                after a meeting to be attended by the Minister of Enterprise,
                Trade and Investment and the Minister of Higher and Further
                Education, Training and Employment with their Southern
                counterparts; and it is bad enough that all these things should
                have happened as a result of the Belfast Agreement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All these matters have caused deep concern in
                the Unionist community, but now the axe is being taken to the
                RUC. You have only to pick up the newspapers, you have only to
                go out among people, and you have only to listen to media
                reports to know that ordinary people on the ground are deeply
                apprehensive and angry at the proposals which were made by the
                Secretary of&nbsp;State last week.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I urge the First&nbsp;Minister to get out
                among ordinary people occasionally and listen to what they say.
                I heard him on the radio on Saturday saying that people should
                not listen to those who are expressing concerns about the
                Belfast Agreement and to those who are opposed to the agreement.
                Where on earth has he been over the past 18&nbsp;months? Who on
                earth is he talking to? He is certainly not talking to people on
                the ground.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Every person in the House from a Unionist
                background — and, indeed, from other backgrounds — will know
                that the message coming through from the grass roots of every
                section of the community is one of deep anger and concern at the
                way in which the police have been treated, at the way in which
                the Royal Ulster Constabulary has been decimated in spite of its
                80&nbsp;years of service to the people of Northern&nbsp;Ireland
                and in spite of the 30&nbsp;years of horrendous injury and
                aggression that have been inflicted on that gallant force.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like to pay tribute — as, I am
                sure, will other Members — to the 302&nbsp;officers, both
                full-time and part-time, who died in the service of this
                community during the recent period of the troubles. I also want
                to pay tribute to the almost 10,000&nbsp;officers who have
                suffered injuries, many of them appalling, lifelong injuries, at
                the hands of terrorists.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No one has spoken more eloquently about the
                hurt and anger felt than spokespersons for current RUC members
                and disabled officers who regard this as the ultimate insult to
                their membership and to the memory of those who fell while
                serving Northern&nbsp;Ireland and defending the community
                against violence and terrorism.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I said at the outset, all the main
                controversial and deeply divisive proposals in the Patten Report
                are going to be implemented. On all the key issues, this
                Government sided with the Provisional Republican movement
                against the Royal Ulster Constabulary and the decent,
                law-abiding majority in this community.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What was the response from the Republican
                community and movement to this announcement? On the very day
                this announcement was made in the House of Commons, we saw the
                Sinn&nbsp;Féin leadership carrying the coffin of the IRA killer
                of an RUC officer through the streets of Belfast. Yesterday we
                saw them — Ministers included — standing before a memorial
                to the IRA killer of a policeman. That killing took place back
                in 1942, and I have had many complaints from people who have
                pointed out that while we know the name of the IRA killer and
                have read background pieces on who and what he was, we have
                heard very little about the victim of this crime — an innocent
                police officer who was done to death by an IRA killer. There is
                much concentration on the victims of crimes. The media sometimes
                pay lip-service to this issue, as do some Members. Where,
                however, was the balance in the reporting of this issue? Where
                was the attempt to find out how this affected the victim of that
                dastardly crime? Where was the in-depth analysis of just what a
                vicious, nasty murder that crime was?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Dr Ian Paisley:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The people of Northern&nbsp;Ireland should be
                reminded that the police officer was a member of the
                Roman&nbsp;Catholic community.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dodds:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is correct.
                Const&nbsp;Patrick&nbsp;Murphy was murdered by the IRA. There
                has, of course, been not one word of remorse or regret from the
                Sinn&nbsp;Féin leadership. Instead there has been eulogy and
                praise for the IRA killer at the very time when the Royal Ulster
                Constabulary is being marked for destruction.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What is the response from the Provisional
                movement? It is not a generous one; it is not one of
                acknowledgement. They are asking for more; nothing is ever
                enough. A prominent Sinn&nbsp;Féin spokesperson said that of
                course this did not go far enough. It is never enough. The
                bottom line in this whole debate is that it is not the behaviour
                of the Royal Ulster Constabulary which offends the Republican
                movement and Sinn&nbsp;Féin and the IRA, but rather the very
                existence of a police force in this part of the
                United&nbsp;Kingdom. The RUC is designed to uphold law and order
                and to prevent terrorists from getting their way by violent
                means against the wishes of the majority community and, indeed,
                the majority of the population in Northern Ireland as a whole.
                That is why all the other forces of law and order have been
                attacked, denigrated, demoralised and eventually destroyed over
                the years. That is why the concentration of attack has been on
                the RUC.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We all know that in a few years time, if
                these proposals go ahead, whatever this renamed force will be
                called will also be the subject of complaint. There will be
                calls for reform or disbandment until, eventually, they attempt
                to have their way by doing away with any police force in this
                part of the United&nbsp;Kingdom. Some people have said that the
                Secretary of State, in his statement last week, did grant some
                concessions. However, they were very minor and of little import.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The change of name has been delayed until
                Autumn&nbsp;2001. Even the badge on the cap of the RUC has not
                been saved, despite reports that Mr&nbsp;Trimble was fighting
                very hard on that front. Nothing was delivered. The district
                policing partnership boards are not to be given powers to raise
                money from ratepayers to cover extra policing services. Of
                course, that does not mean that they will not get these powers
                in the future. The real objection that many of us have — I
                will deal with the concerns felt in due course — is that these
                boards are being set up at this level with participation and
                membership for Sinn&nbsp;Féin, an organisation part and parcel
                of the Republican movement which has been murdering and maiming
                police officers for more than 30&nbsp;years. Talk about the
                politicisation and the introduction of politics into policing.
                There could not be a clearer illustration of the introduction of
                politics into policing than that proposal.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are some who will say that we have to
                bear in mind that the vast majority of the Patten
                recommendations are non-controversial, that most of them could
                be welcomed. The reality is that most of those proposals were
                already being addressed by the RUC and the Police Authority. We
                did not need the Patten Commission. The real changes to be
                introduced by Patten are those which will affect the name,
                emblems and insignia and the political involvement in policing.
                There will be a drastic reduction in numbers, the full-time
                Reserve will be abolished, and Special Branch will be wiped out,
                with consequences for the operational capacity to defeat
                terrorism. There will also be the appointment of an
                international overseer.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have been asked on a number of occasions if
                everything is perfect with the RUC and whether it should be left
                as it is. My party has made it clear — and I am sure that
                other parties have their views — that of course there are
                areas that need to be changed and where improvements can be
                made. I am not satisfied with the present make-up of the Police
                Authority. A substantial section of the community that we
                represent has been completely left off that body.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are means by which police
                accountability could be addressed and where improvements to the
                operational effectiveness could be made, and proposals on those
                matters have been put to the Secretary of State. Patten’s and
                the Government’s proposals are not about improving the
                operational effectiveness of the RUC but about decimating and
                destroying it. They are about destroying its ethos and its
                effectiveness as a counter-terrorist organisation. That has been
                the aim of IRA/Sinn&nbsp;Féin from the very outset. What they
                could not accomplish by the bomb and the bullet this Government
                is delivering through an Act of Parliament. That is the reality,
                and that is what everyone in the community knows.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">People are rightly alarmed that these
                proposals are coming at a time when the IRA has not given up
                anything. It has not given up its name or its threat to the
                community. The Chief Constable told us recently that the IRA and
                other paramilitary organisations on ceasefire retain the
                capacity to inflict enormous damage on the community through
                violence. That threat remains. It has not been removed. There
                has been no proposal for the dismantlement of the IRA machine,
                for a reduction in the number of terrorists. We have not heard
                anything from Sinn&nbsp;Féin regarding that. We have not heard
                anything about the introduction of a human rights regime for the
                leg-smashers, the racketeers and the intimidators, yet the law
                enforcement agency — the RUC — and the other security forces
                will have this imposed on them. The community will rightly ask
                what on earth kind of logic there is in this so-called peace
                process, which rewards the terrorist and their spokespersons by
                putting them in government, letting them out on the streets,
                creating political institutions that they are happy about and
                which destroy the Royal Ulster Constabulary.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When you speak to such people the only answer
                they give is that it is part of the price of the agreement —
                the price that the community is being asked to pay. The price is
                far too high — the community is not willing to sacrifice the
                RUC. We have to remember also — and we had news this morning
                of an arrest in the Irish Republic — the continuing threat
                being posed on both sides of the border by so-called dissident
                terrorist groups while these very proposals are being made.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Charges were levelled last week in the United
                States against a number of individuals — serious terrorist
                charges — and that shows us that, in spite of Sinn&nbsp;Féin’s
                so-called commitment to peace, the reality is that its members
                are busy re-arming, getting their agents in the United States to
                tout for arms and shipping them across to Northern&nbsp;Ireland.
                Yet the arms that are being used to defend this community are to
                be removed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have to remember too that all this is all
                taking place in the context of a series of announcements that
                will be made over the next weeks and months. Proposals will be
                brought forward shortly on the review of the criminal justice
                system. Again, they are part of the Belfast Agreement, and
                concerns have already been raised, not least by the
                Lord&nbsp;Chief&nbsp;Justice, about what the impact of some of
                them may be. We also have ongoing proposals for so-called
                demilitarisation, and where is that going to end?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When, if ever, are we going to see, any
                reciprocation on the part of the terrorists for whom all these
                concessions are being made? The reality is that we will wait a
                very long time for any such reciprocal movement. They have not
                had to make any move so far in this process, and why should they
                begin now? That is the reality of it, and it is time that we had
                a firm pledge here from the First Minister and the leadership of
                his party. I make a distinction between the leadership and the
                grass-roots support of the Unionist Party. It is time that we
                had some indication from the leadership of the party to my left
                of what it is going to do about these proposals.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A leading columnist said in the ‘Belfast&nbsp;Telegraph’
                on Saturday that it was now clear what Mr&nbsp;Trimble’s line
                of defence is on any of these problems. He gets all furious and
                concerned on the day that an announcement is made, then he lets
                it all calm down for a number of months to let everybody get
                used to it, and then he proceeds as normal. This time I do not
                think that he is going to get away with it. People are simply
                not going to sit.</p>

                suspect that the leadership of the Ulster Unionist Party also

                the very person who has proposed that new recruits are to be
                appointed on a fifty-fifty basis.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Is it not surprising that those who have
                shouted loudest about religious discrimination are strangely
                quiet when we have deliberate discrimination which flies in the
                face of all the laws of the European Union?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dodds:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank my hon Friend for that intervention.
                The fact that the European Commissioner responsible for these
                issues is the same Chris&nbsp;Patten is an irony which will not
                be lost on people in Northern&nbsp;Ireland and, I suspect, in
                the United&nbsp;Kingdom as a whole. Having a man such as this in
                charge of that area will certainly re-inforce many of the deep
                concerns and suspicions that people have about the direction of
                the European Union.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the point about fair employment laws, it
                is clear that there are grave question marks over the
                enforceability, admissibility and legality of this, as far as
                European legislation is concerned. A leading Queen’s Counsel
                delivered an opinion on this matter and said that discrimination
                in the numbers of men and women being recruited to the RUC or
                the police service as a means of correcting imbalance would most
                assuredly be against European law. However, when he considered
                the matter on religious grounds, he was not quite sure.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Without any doubt the fair employment laws
                — laws which have been upheld and lauded for their fairness
                and heralded by this Government and by parties in the House as
                the only approach possible — will have to be abandoned for
                this proposal. These safeguards will have to be done away with
                when it comes to future recruitment for the police service, for
                it is quite clear that these proposals run counter to current
                fair employment law. How far will they go with rigging the
                system for recruitment when they are going to do away with the
                very fair employment laws that were passed to counter
                discrimination and imbalance — laws which parties in this
                House have vehemently supported over the years, in spite of
                criticism from us?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is something that touches a nerve in the
                community. Is there any real doubt that if this proposal did not
                have the support of a sizeable section of the Nationalist or
                Republican community the Secretary of State’s statement in the
                House of Commons last Wednesday would have been very different?
                If there had been a proposal on a series of recommendations, or
                if a commission had been set up, on a fundamentally divisive
                issue to which 100% of Nationalism was opposed, does anybody
                seriously think that the Government would have proceeded to
                implement these proposals or the recommendations of that
                Commission? Of course they would not.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We would have had a statement saying &quot;We
                would like to have gone down this road; we still believe that it
                is the best way forward, but at this time no cross-community
                consensus exists, so we must search for a way forward that
                brings the two communities together.&quot; A petition on this
                matter, containing between 300,000 and 400,000&nbsp;signatures
                was handed into 10&nbsp;Downing&nbsp;Street, showing almost
                universal opposition to these reforms from within the
                organisation itself.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does the Member agree that the terms of the
                Belfast Agreement, in providing Mr&nbsp;Patten and his
                commission with their remit, specifically charged the commission
                to bring forward proposals for police reform that would enjoy
                widespread support throughout the community?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dodds:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member is absolutely correct. The terms
                of the Belfast Agreement have not been met because of the
                opposition to this.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will now move on to deal with the terms of
                the agreement. It is clear that the agreement set up and
                provided for the remit and the parameters within which the
                commission would operate. The Member is absolutely right. This
                series of proposals and the Secretary of State’s statement
                will alienate far more people than they satisfy, and that is
                entirely contrary to what the commission was supposed to be
                about.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The reason the Government have chosen to
                ignore their normal conventions in these areas and on these
                sorts of issues, the reason they have chosen to ignore the broad
                swathe of community opinion, to totally ignore representations
                from within the security forces — to whom they normally pay a
                great deal of attention, we are told — is that they are not
                interested in accommodating and listening to the views of the
                broad mass of the people. Their focus is on appeasing an extreme
                minority. In terms of the implementation of the Patten Report,
                the Government are interested only in satisfying
                Sinn&nbsp;Féin. That is just like saying that you have to make
                the police force in England acceptable to hoods, vandals and
                drug dealers, because only then will you get the support of such
                people for a policing service. You have to set down principles
                for a law enforcement agency and objective criteria under which
                they will be able to carry out their job effectively. If that
                does not please the criminal element, those who wish to see that
                force and the institutions of the state destroyed, so be it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is incumbent on any police force and law
                enforcement agency to carry out its duties impartially. A police
                ombudsman has been appointed with widespread support from all
                parties in the House. We have been told that the force itself
                has to reflect the entire community. In the words of the
                Sinn&nbsp;Féin leader &quot;Can people from Crossmaglen and
                West Belfast feel comfortable in it?&quot; I wonder what sort of
                people he had in mind. We all know who he had in mind. That sort
                of force will not be the effective policing force that the broad
                mass of people want, not least in Nationalist areas.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Nothing is more sickening than to listen to
                the slick and oily words of a Secretary of State who, before he
                was appointed, never set foot in Northern&nbsp;Ireland. He comes
                here and lectures us about the tremendous sacrifice, courage and
                valour of the RUC — and I&nbsp;have already paid tribute to
                the courage, valour and integrity of the RUC. The Secretary of
                State belatedly awarded them the George Cross; he talked about
                the force’s being greater than its name. If that is so, why
                change it? With one hand he pays compliments and patronises, and
                with the other, he smashes the force that he is complimenting.
                No wonder many of us were a little concerned when the
                George&nbsp;Cross was awarded. At that time many people wondered
                if this would be a posthumous award; sadly, that is what it has
                turned out to be. The manipulative Secretary of State tried,
                through propaganda and spin doctoring, to put a different gloss
                on it, but the people know this. Instead of running around with
                his newly found friends that we read about in the media, he
                should go out and listen to ordinary people. Then he too would
                understand the deep resentment brought about by his action.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He has done dishonour to the service of RUC
                officers over 80&nbsp;years. I will not go into details on the
                various changes, for I know that other Members will speak on
                those aspects. We have dealt with issues relating to the name of
                the RUC. The Secretary of State says that any new badge decided
                by a new police board will have to meet the test of
                cross-community support.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He does away with the force, even though that
                move does not have cross-community support, but he says that any
                new name must meet that test. No doubt the call for
                cross-community consensus will be warmly welcomed by the SDLP.
                What about a bit of cross-community consensus for reforms of the
                RUC? Of course, that is not on, for the only agenda is to
                appease the extreme minority in Sinn&nbsp;Féin/IRA and its
                supporters.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What about the police force down South, the
                Garda Síochána? Its symbol has a very close identification
                with the Irish State. Has there been any proposal to do away
                with its symbols or insignia? Have there been any proposals from
                the Irish Government who are so quick to comment on Patten and
                on what should happen in Northern&nbsp;Ireland? Have they made
                any proposals on recruitment?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I understand that, at the last count, they
                had to engage in a pretty intense exercise to find the number of
                Protestants in the Garda Síochána. They did not amount to more
                than 20, yet in terms of community balance, there should be
                almost 300 — more than 10 times more. What do the gardaí or
                the Irish Government propose? What are the British Government
                doing to press the Irish Government on these issues? What is the
                First Minister doing?</p>

                I certainly have not heard anything about that from those who
                have expressed concern about the implications of the Patten

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members have only to read some recent history
                of Irish political life, particularly during the Haughey
                Administration, to see the extent of political interference with
                senior members of the gardaí. People were transferred from one
                police station to another at the behest of their political
                masters for political reasons. Police cars were used to ferry
                witnesses and to get people offside.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I commend some of that literature to those
                who are so quick to promote the values of the tremendous Irish
                Republic and who urge us to look southwards to see an example of
                modern pluralist democracy. They should study the way in which
                the police down there have been interfered with and how
                political corruption has led to the resignation of not just one
                but several Cabinet Ministers over the years.</p>

                want as many Members as possible to speak. In view of the
                outrage that has been expressed and the concerns of many, people
                are asking what will happen here now. I have already indicated
                how the First Minister intends to play it — basically he
                intends to do very little. He says that when the matter comes
                before the House of Commons, amendments will be moved. Quite
                right. I have no difficulty with that, and I am sure that all
                Members who are concerned will support those amendments.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, the reality is, as pointed out at
                the weekend by the deputy leader of the UUP, Mr&nbsp;Taylor,
                that this will not make any difference — it will be a waste of
                time. The Government’s majority is such that it will not make
                any difference.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So what do we do? Do we do what Ken&nbsp;Maginnis
                tried to do and have a private word in the ear of the Secretary
                of State? Mr&nbsp;Maginnis highlighted his great concern, only
                to be shafted by the Secretary of State in the House of Commons.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No. The Member will have an opportunity
                later.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Maginnis was told by the Secretary of
                State in the House of Commons that his public pronouncements
                were very different from the compliments that he paid him in
                private. In respect of this issue, should the First Minister and
                his party not exercise the leverage on the Government which they
                are entitled to exercise? They have been urged to do so by the
                DUP and the whole Unionist community.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is no point in dithering. There is no
                point in sitting on. There is no point in hoping that at some
                stage down the road the Secretary of State or the Government
                will suddenly change their mind. It is up to Mr&nbsp;Trimble and
                his Colleagues to say that they will not go on propping up the
                institutions of the agreement and tell the Secretary of State
                that they are not prepared to preside over the RUC’s being
                axed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is not the time to issue pious
                statements of condemnation. This is the time to actually do
                something. Action by the UUP is the only way that these
                institutions will be collapsed or brought down. Under the
                legislation only three Unionist Members have to be on the
                Executive to make it work. That is why, for the benefit of those
                denser members of the UUP who are speaking from a seated
                position, the UUP has to move on this. Perhaps they could use
                their calculators to work out why that is the case.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, the reality is that many of us will
                look in vain for that judgement. Again I make the distinction
                between the leadership of the UUP, as exemplified by the First
                Minister, and the grass-roots members of the party, who take a
                very different view on this. We will look in vain, however, for
                a sign that the leadership will start to exercise good judgement
                given what the gentlemen who make up that leadership have said
                over the years about the Patten Commission. Their judgement has
                certainly been lacking.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have only to look at what Mr&nbsp;Maginnis,
                the security spokesman for the UUP, said on
                4&nbsp;June&nbsp;1998. He said that he was</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;very happy with the make-up of the
                Patten Commission.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And he went on</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;I think practically we could not have
                hoped for anything better.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Then we had the same Mr&nbsp;Maginnis
                speaking on behalf of his party on 28&nbsp;April&nbsp;1998. This
                is what he said then:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;If we are going to have a sensible look
                at the RUC, then I believe that Chris&nbsp;Patten’s
                appointment is progress, because there was talk that we were
                going to have some distant international figure, perhaps an
                American or a European.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Do I hear the name George&nbsp;Mitchell being
                mentioned? Was it Ken&nbsp;Maginnis who mentioned
                George&nbsp;Mitchell first of all?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, as Chris&nbsp;Patten said,</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;What on earth did these people think
                they were going to get when they signed up to the Belfast
                Agreement?&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The remit, the terms and conditions and the
                parameters of the Patten Commission were in the agreement for
                all to see.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As Frank Millar, a former honorary secretary
                and chief executive of the Ulster&nbsp;Unionist&nbsp;Party,
                said, in his capacity as a journalist in the ‘Irish&nbsp;Times’,
                on 20&nbsp;January&nbsp;1999,</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;In the mind of Mr&nbsp;Patten and his
                colleagues, as to most outside observers, it was, and is,
                manifestly clear that the International Commission and the
                Belfast Agreement were the two&nbsp;sides of the same
                coin&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A blind man on a galloping horse could have
                seen that the principal of parity of esteem, as enshrined in the
                agreement, would translate into the end of the identification of
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland’s police service with the symbolism of
                the British State. That is the reality. Everybody knows it. Let
                us not make the same mistake again. Let the Ulster Unionist
                Party not make the same mistake as they have with the Executive.
                IRA/Sinn&nbsp;Féin has been allowed into the Executive. Pledges
                have been broken. Promises of &quot;No guns, no government&quot;
                have been ditched in the hope and expectation that
                IRA/Sinn&nbsp;Féin would deliver on decommissioning. As we are
                seeing on a daily basis, that is not happening.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Now it looks like the same mistake is going
                to be made again. &quot;Let us implement Patten. Let us go for
                all these changes.&quot; they say, in the hope, belief and
                expectation that all will be well further down the line. The
                reality is that if this is allowed to proceed — and it will
                proceed only if, as I said earlier, action is not taken— then
                someday it will too late to save the RUC. This community will
                find that it is too late to have the proper defence it needs
                against the terrorist threat.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Neeson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I beg to move the following amendment: Delete

                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Assembly believes that, while the
                Patten Report causes pain to many, it can provide a new
                beginning for policing in Northern&nbsp;Ireland, responsive to
                and representative of the entire community.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This Assembly urges leaders from all sections
                of the community to give full support to the proposed reformed
                police service and to encourage people to join.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Like Mr Dodds, I welcome the opportunity to
                debate the Patten Report. The Assembly and the Business
                Committee were wise to delay the debate until today because this
                has provided us with the opportunity to respond to the Secretary
                of State’s speech. The amendment before you, in my name and
                that of Mr&nbsp;Close, is one which is a balanced reflection on
                the Patten Report and the Government’s response to it. The
                Alliance Party broadly welcomes the report. However, we, like
                others, have some reservations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When we submitted our response on the Patten
                Report to the Government, we put forward our vision of policing
                in Northern&nbsp;Ireland. We want to see a single, integrated,
                professional police service, which is representative of,
                responsible to, and carrying the confidence of the entire
                community in Northern&nbsp;Ireland. We believe that the
                responsibilities of the police are, primarily, to serve and
                protect the public and to uphold the rule of law fairly and
                impartially. We are pleased that, in the main, the report
                reflects this vision.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In saying that, we recognise the pain that
                many people in Northern&nbsp;Ireland are going through as a
                result of the report. I served on the Police Authority for
                six&nbsp;years, and I walked behind many of the coffins of RUC
                personnel. We have to understand the pain and hurt felt by
                people in Northern&nbsp;Ireland — particularly in many areas
                of the Unionist community. By the same token we must also
                understand the hurt felt by every family in
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland which has been bereaved during the
                30&nbsp;years of the troubles. We have all suffered. We are all
                feeling the pain. However, if we are to move forward, we have to
                move forward in a climate of change.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yesterday I bought the book ‘Lost&nbsp;Lives’.
                Once again, it brought home to me the number of friends,
                relations, civilians and police personnel that gave up their
                lives during the troubles. The one message that is important for
                this Assembly to adhere to is that while we are all trying to
                create a society of forgiveness we must not forget the suffering
                that has been felt by the whole community over that futile
                30&nbsp;years of violence and the troubles.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of my greatest difficulties with the
                Patten Commission is that it did not give the RUC the
                recognition it deserves. The Secretary of State referred to this
                in his Commons statement last week, and I believe that we also
                need to put on record our appreciation of the RUC’s work
                during the troubles. Some people regarded it as cynical, but I
                welcomed the award of the George&nbsp;Cross to the RUC.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have some reservations. First, my party is
                concerned about the proposed local police boards. I am in favour
                of local consultation. The community police liaison committees
                have made a worthwhile contribution throughout
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland, although it has always been my criticism
                that those committees based purely on the local council have not
                been as effective as those which involved all of the community.
                There is a need for local consultation. However, despite the
                Secretary of State’s decision to leave the question of finance
                to the criminal justice review, I want to put on record my grave
                reservations about giving district councils any authority to
                raise money for policing. I hope that a mechanism for local
                consultation can be established, bearing in mind that if this
                Assembly succeeds, there could be changes within local
                government.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The other area about which I want to express
                concern is recruitment. I want to see a balanced police service.
                At the moment it is totally unbalanced in its gender and
                religious make-up, but to devise a quota system that is illegal,
                under both British and European law, is not on. Quotas are both
                illegal and unnecessary. The 1991 census shows that the
                composition of the target 18-30&nbsp;group is roughly balanced.
                Looking beyond that, I want to see a police service that
                reflects not only religion and gender but also race. This is not
                the most pluralist society, but there are sizeable ethnic
                minorities developing. Their numbers should be reflected in the
                police service.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Secretary of State’s
                statement on the possible downsizing of the police service. It
                is important that any such downsizing be based on the security
                situation and not on political considerations. It is important
                that the Chief Constable be given the impartial role of advising
                the Government on the needs of his service and the effects of
                any downsizing of that police service. We must ensure that no
                irresponsible action is taken.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the major aspects of our amendment is
                to call on community leaders to encourage recruitment to the
                proposed reformed police service from right across the
                community. Here, I must take issue with a number of groups in
                the Assembly.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">11.45 am</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I believe that there is an onus and a
                responsibility on Sinn&nbsp;Féin and Republicans to acknowledge
                the changes that have been taking place recently. The Executive
                has been established. The Government have responded to the
                Patten Report. Proposals are coming forward for
                demilitarisation. However, if we are going to move forward, it
                must be on the basis of trust.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">David&nbsp;Trimble has set a deadline of the
                end of January in relation to decommissioning. My party believes
                that the Good Friday Agreement clearly set a May deadline —
                but the May deadline is for the completion of decommissioning by
                both Republicans and Loyalists. An opinion poll in ‘The&nbsp;Irish&nbsp;Times’
                last Saturday showed that 86% of people in the Irish Republic
                believe that decommissioning should start now. I am firmly of
                that view.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I must be honest. Like many people living in
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland, I am getting a little tired of the
                arrogance of Republicans with regard to the changes that are
                taking place in Northern&nbsp;Ireland. To move forward is not a
                matter of having one’s cake and eating it as well. All sides
                of the community have to make sacrifices to ensure that this
                society can break away from the 30&nbsp;years of violence and
                move forward into a truly peaceful society.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The proposals in the Patten Report were
                brought forward on the basis of a peaceful society. That has to
                be created. Therefore if people hold back, they are also holding
                back on the implementation of the Patten Report — and it is
                for the Chief Constable to decide on any downsizing that might
                be necessary.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another matter that annoys me is the GAA’s
                response to the report. Once again it is begrudging, rather than
                moving forward and accepting the importance and nature of the
                Patten Report. It is holding back. It will not change
                Rule&nbsp;21, which, in essence, is political apartheid. In any
                society in the twenty-first&nbsp;century, political apartheid is
                unacceptable. It is not on. If this were South&nbsp;Africa,
                there would have been an outcry about it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Therefore if a truly pluralist society, based
                on trust and confidence, is to be created, this form of
                discrimination by organisations like the GAA can not be
                afforded. I know that there are those in the GAA who want to see
                change, and I urge them to bring about the abolition of the
                iniquitous Rule&nbsp;21 sooner rather than later.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Going back to the opinion poll in ‘The&nbsp;Irish&nbsp;Times’,
                it related to all paramilitary organisations. Therefore, while I
                have pointed the finger at Republicans, I point it equally at
                Loyalist paramilitary groups. The murder in Portadown just over
                a week ago clearly shows that unless decommissioning takes place
                then incidents like this will continue throughout
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland. The onus and responsibility on Loyalists
                is equal to that on Republicans. Why can we not get away from
                the &quot;win/lose&quot; situation in Northern&nbsp;Ireland?
                Nationalists are perceived to have won by the Government’s
                response on the Patten Report, and Unionists have lost. How are
                we going to get away from this mentality? The Patten Report
                reflects the policing needs of the new society that we hope to
                create in Northern&nbsp;Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The main proposal shows the total hypocrisy
                of the DUP, whose support for the police has been conditional. I
                remember the leader of the DUP, when he was being carried out of
                the Assembly Chamber on 23&nbsp;June&nbsp;1986, pointing his
                finger at the policemen and saying</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Do not come running to me if your homes
                are attacked&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That typifies the double standards of the DUP
                throughout the troubles.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many police officers have said to me that
                they are embarrassed to have the DUP leading the so-called
                &quot;Save the RUC Campaign&quot;. They are embarrassed by the
                activities and double standards of the DUP during the last
                30&nbsp;years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In our response to the Patten Report we must
                recognise that throughout the 30&nbsp;years of the troubles the
                police have been the piggy in the middle. The best example of
                that has been at Drumcree. If the police let the parade down the
                Garvaghy&nbsp;Road, they are attacked by Republicans; if they do
                not let the parade down the Garvaghy&nbsp;Road, they are
                attacked by Unionists. In 1996 we remember the First Minister,
                Mr&nbsp;Trimble, pointing the finger at police personnel on the
                Garvaghy&nbsp;Road. Support for the police has been conditional.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The whole Assembly can accept this amendment.
                It aims to reflect on the sacrifice of the police over the
                30&nbsp;years of the troubles and yet recognise that the Patten
                Report aims to provide effective and efficient policing. It is a
                plan that could be adopted by police services in other parts of
                the world. I urge the leaders of every community in
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland to encourage people to join the proposed,
                reformed police service.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To see the good name of the RUC being sullied
                by Chris&nbsp;Patten and his fellow executioners is one of the
                most painful experiences that I&nbsp;have had to endure.
                I&nbsp;say this as one who had the great honour of serving in
                the RUC for over 30&nbsp;years. During that time I served with
                the finest group of men and women one could ever wish to meet
                — Roman Catholic and Protestant alike — and the suggested
                dropping of the proud name RUC is an insult not only to those
                who have faithfully served the citizens of this country but also
                to the 302&nbsp;people who made the supreme sacrifice and gave
                up their lives. It is particularly insulting to the widows, the
                children and the fathers and mothers who lost loved ones in the
                prime of life.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">How Chris&nbsp;Patten, Tony&nbsp;Blair,
                Peter&nbsp;Mandelson and the other betrayers who have
                contributed to this dirty deed can feel comfortable or sleep in
                their beds is beyond my comprehension. Of course, Patten’s
                reward has been a £200,000-a-year job in the European set-up.
                Is it too much to hope that when the legislation to enact this
                is passing through Parliament, enough hon Members will restore
                the good name of the RUC? If not, I suggest that the George
                Cross, rightly awarded to the RUC, be not passed on to the new
                police service for Northern&nbsp;Ireland. It was earned proudly
                by the RUC and should remain with that great name.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No one could say that Roman Catholics are
                discriminated against in the RUC. Roman&nbsp;Catholics have held
                every rank up to and including Assistant Chief Constable, Deputy
                Chief Constable and Chief Constable. Indeed, at one stage a
                Roman&nbsp;Catholic Assistant Chief Constable was the head of
                Special&nbsp;Branch.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The force was certainly well served by men
                such as the late Brendan&nbsp;Durkan, who reached the high rank
                of district inspector. He was the father of our new Minister of
                Finance and Personnel, Mark&nbsp;Durkan, and he was a close
                friend of my Colleague Sir&nbsp;John&nbsp;Gorman.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another colleague was the late
                Supt&nbsp;Danny&nbsp;McDaid, who was a native of the Bogside in
                Londonderry. Danny gave great assistance in providing welfare to
                injured members and widows during my five years as chairman of
                the Police Federation, No&nbsp;7&nbsp;Region.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The religious imbalance in the RUC is the
                result of the intimidation, by murdering Republican thugs, of
                Roman&nbsp;Catholics from Nationalist areas who had joined the
                RUC.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr A Maginness:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will the Member give way?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Benson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I can give an example of this. A very close
                colleague of mine, who had reached a high rank in the force, was
                a Roman&nbsp;Catholic who had married his childhood sweetheart.
                Both were from west Tyrone. During the time when his family was
                growing up he could never return to visit his wife’s parents
                because of the near-certainty that he would be shot. Because
                both sets of parents lived in a strong Nationalist area he had
                to take his wife and family down, drop them off to visit and
                then get offside. Several hours later he would pick them up at a
                predetermined safe area — sometimes many miles away.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members can now see why many
                Roman&nbsp;Catholics who wished to make a career in the RUC
                considered the intimidation and risk too great. The surprising
                thing is that any Roman&nbsp;Catholics at all were prepared to
                withstand the pressure.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members will have seen the great excitement,
                in the last week or so, over the exhumation of the body of
                Tom&nbsp;Williams, the IRA murderer, and the big memorial
                service for him yesterday. I am certain that, like me, they
                heard little mention of the man he murdered. He was
                Const&nbsp;Patrick&nbsp;Murphy, a decent, honest
                Roman&nbsp;Catholic man doing his duty, and he left a widow to
                bring up her young family. This was a brave Roman&nbsp;Catholic
                man who made a career in the RUC and ended up a sad statistic.
                Unfortunately Patten and Mandelson have forgotten these victims
                and are now rewarding the murderers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I cannot speak too highly of the loyalty and
                bravery of my colleagues in the RUC. I stood with them during
                the serious riots in the Falls, the Shankill and the Bogside,
                when petrol bombs and bullets were the order of the day. I know
                what it is to be on the receiving end of a brick thrown by a
                Bogside Republican at Butcher’s Gate. No amount of
                intimidation and murder could prevent the RUC from continuing
                professionally to defend its fellow countrymen, both Unionist
                and Nationalist. I am 100% behind the motion, but the DUP’s
                motives for bringing it forward appear to have more to do with
                having a bash at the Ulster Unionists and David&nbsp;Trimble
                than with defending the RUC.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let us examine the DUP’s record of support
                for the RUC over the years. First, it tried to form the Third
                Force, which was really a means of undermining the authority of
                the RUC and the security forces. Then it marched up and down
                mountains waving firearm certificates — again distracting the
                RUC from its prime function of administering law and order.
                During its many protests, some members of the DUP were quite
                happy to knock policemen and policewomen about and tramp police
                caps on the ground — caps that bear the very badge that the
                DUP is now purporting to be trying to protect. On one occasion,
                when some of its members were being carried away from a sit-down
                protest, remarks such as &quot;Don’t come to us for help when
                you are being burned out of your homes&quot; were made and other
                insults hurled.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am delighted that the DUP has now come into
                line with the Ulster Unionists in defending the RUC.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The proposer and seconder of the motion are
                expert at making snide remarks about my party, so let us examine
                their contribution to the defence of Northern&nbsp;Ireland
                during the time of the troubles. Did either of them don the
                uniform of the security forces, and what medals can they wear? I
                could make a snide remark like &quot;Perhaps the Clontibret
                Star&quot;, but I will not go down that road.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I fully support the motion, and I appeal to
                Tony&nbsp;Blair, William&nbsp;Hague and Charles&nbsp;Kennedy to
                advise their members to do what was suggested by Msgr&nbsp;Denis&nbsp;Faul,
                who is surely a responsible representative of the Nationalist
                people. The RUC name should be retained and the words
                &quot;Police Service for Northern&nbsp;Ireland&quot; added. If
                parity of esteem is to mean anything, this must be the correct
                course of action.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the RUC is sacrificed on the altar of
                appeasement, these three political leaders and their parties
                will be tramping on the graves of those who gave their lives to
                protect all people, Unionists and Nationalists alike. This would
                be an insult to the bereaved who will go on suffering for the
                rest of their lives.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I make this plea from the bottom of my heart.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, I wish to state that I intend to tread
                warily and easily, not least because of the comments made by
                Mr&nbsp;Benson, who said that this is one of the most painful
                experiences of his life.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When I reach the body of my speech my
                perspective will be to tread warily and tread easily because we
                tread on people’s hearts and experiences. Nothing that I say
                on behalf of the SDLP — indeed, no SDLP comment today — will
                be meant to do anything to compound the hurt, anxiety and
                anguish in our community.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, a number of matters that were raised
                by Mr&nbsp;Dodds and Mr&nbsp;Neeson need to be commented on.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Roche:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In view of your comments about not wishing to
                tread on the sensibilities of Members, what do you make of the
                comments made by the deputy leader of your party when he
                attended the Brehon&nbsp;Law&nbsp;Society ‘Irishman of the
                Year’ award in Philadelphia? He took the opportunity to inform
                his United States audience that in the North of Ireland the RUC
                has reduced the rule of law to little more than the law of the
                jungle. That is your party’s position.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Attwood:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will deal with that issue, but first I wish
                to deal with some other points.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr&nbsp;Dodds referred to the Garda
                Síochána. He asked if the SDLP had made any submissions to the
                Irish Government about issues such as emblems and names in
                respect of the Garda Síochána. Whilst I did not wish to start
                with this issue, the point that Mr&nbsp;Dodds raised is germane
                to the issue of Patten, the RUC, and policing change.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While it may or may not be necessary for the
                Garda Síochána to modernise in a pluralist society, it can be
                said that there is no disagreement about the nature of the
                Republic&nbsp;of&nbsp;Ireland and its Constitution. There is no
                disagreement about the nature of its institutions of state,
                including its police service. As far as we are aware the people
                of the Republic&nbsp;of&nbsp;Ireland are comfortable regarding
                the name ‘Garda Síochána’ and the symbols and emblems it
                displays.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is the reality in respect of the Garda
                Síochána and the Republic&nbsp;of&nbsp;Ireland but it has not
                existed heretofore in the North of Ireland. The fact that these
                core values and requirements about the nature of the state and
                its institutions did not exist in relation to the North is one
                of the compelling reasons why the nature of our state, and its
                police service has to change. This is why the name, the emblems,
                the symbols, policies and practices of the police service in the
                North must change. There are compelling arguments why that must
                be done — arguments that do not exist in relation to the Garda
                Síochána.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation in
                Dublin, the SDLP — along with many other parties — made
                proposals to the Irish&nbsp;Government about how that state
                should modernise in the context of a pluralist future and the
                new millennium. Therefore we are not behind the door about
                making proposals to the Irish&nbsp;Government about ways in
                which they could change their constitutional institutions in
                order to reflect more fully the requirements of our changed
                circumstances.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My second point was raised by Mr&nbsp;Dodds
                also. He said that the SDLP had lain down before Sinn&nbsp;Féin
                in relation to the issue of the RUC and policing. I
                fundamentally disagree with that assertion. Our attitude towards
                the RUC and policing change has been fundamentally different to
                that of Republicans. We have repeatedly said that, whatever its
                nature, our conflict should not be expressed in violent terms.
                It should not be visited upon any member of our state, including
                the RUC, in violent terms. We have said to our community that,
                whatever our difficulties with the Patten Report — and there
                are some — it remains the baseline around which people in the
                North can begin to gather in order to create a police service
                which earns the allegiance of all. We have said that to our own
                community and to Republicans.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Regardless of our anxieties about the
                hesitancy evident in some of the Government’s comments on
                Patten in its response last week, we tell our community, and we
                urge Republicans to tell theirs, that this represents the
                opportunity for a new beginning for policing. We should not
                dismiss it idly or casually.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We differ from Sinn&nbsp;Féin in this matter
                and in many others. It is dishonest and inappropriate to say
                that we have lain down before any party on this issue. Our
                judgements have been made solely on what we feel best serves the
                needs of all communities in the North — not on what may or may
                not be the view of any other party.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wish to turn to the core of my speech by
                returning to some of the comments I made earlier in reply to
                Mr&nbsp;Benson. It is important that some of these matters be
                put on the record in this Chamber, just as we hope we have put
                them on the record in the public domain in the past. Nothing
                that I say on behalf of the SDLP should deny certain truths. My
                community recognises how greatly, both individually and
                collectively, the RUC, their families and the wider community
                have suffered. They have acted courageously, and members of the
                present RUC are entitled to be in a future Northern Ireland
                police service.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While we have been tough on what is wrong in
                policing — myself in particular, perhaps — we have also been
                tough on the wrongs visited on the RUC. Some of those who seek
                to protect the RUC do not fully accept that my community
                acknowledges what the RUC has endured. My community’s
                requirement for far-reaching change is seen as somehow
                diminishing what has been endured. That is not the case, and my
                community wishes this to be known conclusively. If nothing else
                arises from this debate, I want those Members who feel most
                protective of the RUC and who have valued its role over the last
                30&nbsp;years to understand how my community and our
                constituency view the RUC, notwithstanding our concerns about
                RUC actions in the past.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a concept developing, especially in
                certain eastern European states, of &quot;chosen victims, chosen
                victories&quot;. It concerns the selective remembrance of the
                past. We can all relate to how we have &quot;chosen victims and
                chosen victories.&quot; Whilst it is too painful at this stage
                of our history to move beyond that way of viewing past conflict,
                it is essential that we remind ourselves that others have their
                own victories and victims also.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If we are selective or partial, and if we do
                not deal with matters in a complete way we will end up not
                dealing with the conflict of the last 30&nbsp;years and the pain
                inflicted and endured over that time in a complete way. Whilst
                our community has not yet reached that stage, it will be
                essential for us to fully and creatively deal with past abuses
                if we are to move past this phase of conflict.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is inevitable that the differences about
                the future of policing are intense. Emotions surrounding the RUC
                and our experiences of it have been different. Wrongs have been
                perpetrated against the RUC, and wrongs have been perpetrated
                against Nationalists and others by the state and its agencies.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Next Sunday I, Bairbre&nbsp;de&nbsp;Brún and
                other Assembly Members will be speaking at the &quot;bloody
                Sunday&quot; commemoration rally. It would be helpful and
                creative if the pain of &quot;bloody Sunday&quot; were more
                fully acknowledged and accepted by all Members of the Assembly
                and not just by those who have been associated with that issue.</p>

                that it is time to draw a line under the past and let history be
                the judge of it. Unfortunately, as he knows, a very expensive
                commission has been established to investigate what is supposed
                to have happened on &quot;bloody Sunday&quot;. Is he prepared to
                draw a line under this, or is this one of the special items that
                is reserved for the domain of the Nationalist community?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When John&nbsp;Hume referred to drawing a
                line under the past he did not mean that we should ignore or
                abandon it, or that our obligation to explain, interpret and
                deal with the past should not be accepted. There is a difference
                between drawing a line under the past, in terms of how we
                conducted our political affairs, and how we should try to
                understand and interpret what happened in the past so that it
                does not happen in the future. That is why we have a victims’
                commission, a police ombudsman and a human rights commission
                which is enabled and empowered to investigate and deal with
                issues of the past which have caused anxiety and concern. There
                are issues of the past that every Member can talk about that
                must be dealt with, but that is different from saying that we
                should ignore the past and abandon it to memory and history.
                That is what John&nbsp;Hume meant, and if he were here it is
                what he would say.</p>

                responsibility of the police ombudsman. These include complaints
                arising from the killings of Robert&nbsp;Hamill, Pat&nbsp;Finucane
                and others, and the investigations into the circumstances
                surrounding the death of Rosemary&nbsp;Nelson. Complaints from
                anybody else, from whatever background, will continue to be
                within the custody of the police ombudsman, and she will have
                the responsibility of dealing with those issues when she is

                the dignity which they have shown in their campaign and to
                acknowledge that we are at a very important moment, given that
                the Government have undertaken this inquiry into the
                circumstances of &quot;bloody Sunday&quot; — to stand with
                them in order to get at the truth of what is in representative
                and local terms a deeply painful moment in the last

                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That wisdom has informed the political
                process over a number of years, and, unlikely though it may seem
                at the moment, it may yet inform the policing debate over the
                coming months. I appeal to everybody to stand back and reflect
                on what Patten and the Secretary of State have said and
                proposed. Everyone should ask themselves a number of questions.
                These are essential if we are to move this debate from the
                sterile ground which it currently occupies into a more fertile
                area. The following questions must be answered if we are to
                solve the current policing problems.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, if each of us were asked to design a
                police service for a new beginning, could we say honestly and
                with absolute conviction that the Patten proposals and the
                Government’s response are so far off the mark? Do any of us,
                including Republicans, seriously believe the changes are the
                outworking of the obsolete slogan &quot;Disband the RUC&quot;?
                Are the proposals on training, recruitment, human rights and
                structure such that, taken in totality, they would not create a
                service to which we could all give allegiance? Ultimately, if
                both traditions join in equal numbers and with equal enthusiasm,
                is that not a prize worth striving for? The answers to those
                questions, which should be placed honestly before each of our
                parties and communities, may enable us to begin to work through
                the current problem and find a solution.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I should like to comment on what the British
                Government have said and what they will do in the coming weeks.
                The judgement of the SDLP is that, taken in totality, the Patten
                and Mandelson proposals create the potential for a police
                service that can earn the allegiance of all. That judgement will
                be better informed when the Government publish their draft
                legislation. We trust that the legislation will faithfully and
                fully reflect the Patten and Mandelson proposals. I say that
                advisedly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The draft Northern&nbsp;Ireland Bill, which
                gave legislative effect to the Good Friday Agreement, did not
                faithfully and fully reflect the agreement when first published.
                It required a lobby inside and outside the House of Commons and
                the good offices of Paul&nbsp;Murphy, in particular, to ensure
                that the powers of the Human Rights Commission and the
                responsibilities of the Equality Commission, as intended by the
                Good Friday Agreement, were reflected in the Northern Ireland
                Act.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The intentions of the Patten and Mandelson
                proposals need to be reflected in the forthcoming Police Bill;
                and we anticipate that that will be the case. If not, people’s
                concerns that elements within the police or Government wish to
                design the new police service in their own way rather than in a
                way that is consistent with what Patten and Mandelson have
                proposed will be confirmed. If that were to happen, a new
                policing world would dawn, but the old men would have come out
                again and remade it in the likeness of the world that they knew.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Government need to be aware that we shall
                watch closely to ensure that that situation does not arise. In
                particular the Government should be aware that we wish to see
                human rights put centre stage in the new police service. It is
                surely not coincidental that the lead chapter of Patten is on
                human rights, and it cannot be coincidental that the lead
                sentence of the report says</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;the fundamental purpose of policing
                should be … the protection and vindication of the human rights
                of all.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Patten translates that principle into a wide
                range of practices, including a code of ethics, codes of
                practice, training and awareness of human rights, close
                monitoring by the police board, integration of human rights in
                every module of police training and a new oath for new officers
                that expresses an explicit commitment to upholding human rights.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Given the centrality of human rights to
                Patten, there cannot be selective, partial or occasional
                implementation of his proposals. On this issue where Patten’s
                proposals are authoritative, where the arguments are definitive
                and compelling, where the recommendation is unambiguous, Patten
                should be implemented through Mandelson in full, and in good
                time. The same is true for any Patten proposals that are
                definitive, compelling and unambiguous.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I conclude by addressing my comments to those
                in the Nationalist and Republican constituencies. While the SDLP
                has a degree of concern and caution over certain Patten/Mandelson
                proposals — in particular, the timeframe for balanced
                membership, the use of plastic bullets and emergency laws —
                nonetheless, we say to all, and not least to those in our
                community, that it is a baseline around which those who wish to
                see a representative, unarmed, civilian, accountable police
                service that conforms to human rights standards can congregate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We say to all — and again not least to
                those in our community — that we must move beyond slogans
                about the RUC and into strategies about good policing policy and
                practice. In spite of the headlines, 85% and more of the Patten
                proposals can be signed up to by 85% and more of the population.
                The Patten proposals, with all their integrity, that Mr&nbsp;Mandelson
                intends to implement in their totality represent a new beginning
                in the practice of policing to sustain our new beginning in the
                practice of politics.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I remember when I first read the Patten
                Report I was anxious about what was not recommended. Last
                Tuesday I was anxious about the hesitancy in the Government’s
                response to some of the proposals. All of us, and I&nbsp;not
                least, would design a new police service somewhat differently.
                But if each of us were asked to design a police service for our
                new beginning, not in the image of Nationalism or Unionism, not
                remade in the image of the previous policies and past practices,
                we would design a service to be shared in and joined in, and the
                Patten/Mandelson proposals are not so far off that mark.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I commend the amendment to the House.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs Nelis:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a Chathaoirligh. Let us
                be realistic about this motion. The harder the DUP tries to
                convince itself and others that the RUC is a normal, acceptable
                police body like other police bodies throughout the world, the
                less people believe it. Most right-thinking people acknowledge
                the reality that the RUC as an organisation is the product of a
                failed political dispensation. RUC families have suffered as a
                result of this.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wish to correct the comment made by the
                spokesperson on the Official Unionist Benches. Gerry&nbsp;Adams
                addressed the suffering of Const Murphy’s family at yesterday’s
                commemoration in honour of Tom&nbsp;Williams. The Good Friday
                Agreement was put in place to give us the new dispensation, and
                part of that new dispensation is a new police service acceptable
                to all the people on this island. I can tell you now that that
                will not be the existing RUC or a reformed RUC. The RUC is not
                acceptable in Nationalist areas. It can be argued that there is
                some evidence to suggest that it is not acceptable in some
                Loyalist areas either, in spite of the continual assertions from
                the Unionist camp that the RUC is their police force — not a
                Nationalist but a Unionist one. And this claim is part of the
                problem.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The abuse of the Nationalist community is
                well-recorded, and what body would want to claim such a record?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The RUC has been involved in a campaign of
                intimidation, harassment and terrorisation of people in
                Nationalist areas, not only in the last 30&nbsp;years, but since
                this state was set up. The RUC has been responsible for killing
                women, men and children with plastic bullets, yet not one of
                them has ever been convicted of any of those murders.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is growing evidence of the RUC’s
                collusion with Loyalist death squads that resulted in the deaths
                of 300&nbsp;people, including two lawyers. Sinn&nbsp;Féin is
                not the only group that has flagged up the role of the RUC in
                murder and torture. It has been criticised by a raft of credible
                and prestigious human rights bodies such as
                Amnesty&nbsp;International, the United Nations’ Rapporteur on
                the Independence of Lawyers and Judges, the US Congressional
                Committee on Foreign Affairs, the British-Irish Watch, the
                Helsinki&nbsp;Watch, the Committee on the Administration of
                Justice, the Pat&nbsp;Finucane Centre and even the British
                Scarman and Bennett Inquiries. They all indicted the RUC over
                its abuse and violations of human rights — a catalogue which
                includes murder, torture, intimidation and threats.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The RUC has paid £2·5&nbsp;million to
                members of the public arising out of 6,702&nbsp;complaints made
                against them in the last four&nbsp;years. This year alone it has
                paid out £982,000. Six&nbsp;thousand people do not complain for
                the sake of it, and the RUC does not pay compensation for the
                sake of it — the compensation is an admission of guilt.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is the RUC that Nigel&nbsp;Dodds
                attempts to defend and tries to convince us is a decent, good
                and honourable force, while all the sheep on the DUP benches say
                &quot;Baa, baa&quot;. The world-renowned organisations I have
                mentioned, whose credentials cannot be disputed, have found that
                the RUC’s track record of consistently abusing human rights
                has resulted in the British Government’s being brought before
                the European Court of Human Rights 23&nbsp;times during the last
                25&nbsp;years. It can be argued that the RUC has contributed to
                and prolonged the conflict in this island and that it is the
                greatest threat to its peaceful resolution.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If we are to start from scratch, as Patten
                suggested, we should do so urgently because daily in our
                communities we can see the results of a policing vacuum. We
                should take the Patten Report’s recommendations on human
                rights, culture and community policing as a positive template.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Human Rights Commission has a key role to
                play in a number of areas relating to policing. Two of its key
                actions should be to weed out those RUC personnel guilty of
                human rights abuses and to press for an end to the suppression
                of reports on the RUC, including those by
                Stalker&nbsp;and&nbsp;Stevens. The RUC has never diligently or
                with any distinction served the whole community, as this motion
                states.</p>

                with the community and heard the truth about the RUC. In fact,
                there is an article in this morning’s Independent which states
                — and this has been suspected for a long time — that</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;the inquiry into claims that RUC and
                Army officers colluded in the [Pat Finucane] murder is
                understood to have found material to support allegations made by
                two&nbsp;informers that the authorities ignored a series of
                tip-offs&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">that he was to be murdered by the UDA. In
                fact, Mr&nbsp;Stobie, an RUC informer who is now on bail, was
                arrested in 1991 on a charge of murdering Pat&nbsp;Finucane and
                admitted to his involvement in the murder. He also admitted to
                being a registered informant of the RUC Special Branch and that
                he had informed his handlers on the night of the murder that
                Pat&nbsp;Finucane was going to be murdered and that they ignored
                it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is obvious from these disclosures that the
                RUC wanted Pat&nbsp;Finucane dead. It is a known fact that RUC
                members threatened Pat&nbsp;Finucane’s life just as they
                threatened the life of Rosemary&nbsp;Nelson. The RUC have known
                for 11&nbsp;years who murdered Pat&nbsp;Finucane. They knew that
                their paid informers were acting to their agenda, were involved
                in that murder and supplied arms for the murder. Yet this is the
                police force that Nigel&nbsp;Dodds wants us to try to defend and
                wants the Nationalist community to support — this so-called
                law enforcement agency that conspires in the murder of lawyers
                who were attempting to uphold their clients’ rights and uphold
                justice.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In saying this, I am reminded that policing
                is one of the most important issues that lies at the heart of
                conflict resolution. To ensure the success of the Good Friday
                Agreement — something I am sure most Members want — it is
                crucial that a proper democratically accountable police service
                be established. This is a touchstone issue for Nationalists and
                Republicans.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sinn Féin has called for the RUC to be
                disbanded. In common with the other participants of the Good
                Friday Agreement, we believe that a police service should be one
                which is professional, effective and efficient, fair and
                impartial, free from partisan political control and accountable,
                both under the law for its actions, and to the community it
                serves. It should be representative of the community it polices
                and should operate within a coherent and co-operative criminal
                justice system which conforms with human rights.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In essence, the RUC cannot deliver on any of
                the above, as it is an integral part of a failed political
                dispensation. For young people in Nationalist areas the word
                &quot;police&quot; has become synonomous with the word
                &quot;sectarianism&quot;, with repression, with all-invasive
                surveillance of their everyday lives, with harassment and
                brutality meted out with total impunity, with daily humiliation
                at the hands of an armed force which has shown total contempt
                for the political and religious beliefs of the people in this
                community.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have a cutting from a paper which states
                that an Omagh student successfully sued the RUC for damages for
                assault. One of the officers commented to another policeman that
                there was nothing like beating a few Fenians on a Friday night.
                It is no wonder young people have no respect for this brutal
                force. Yet, in spite of their myriad negative experiences at the
                hands of the RUC, Nationalists and Republicans still want a
                policing service.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our community is implacably opposed to the
                RUC, but it is not anti-police per se. Nationalists and
                Republicans, like all sections of society, want and, indeed,
                deserve a policing service they can trust and respect, one which
                they can feel confident of joining or recommending to others as
                a possible career option.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We were promised a new beginning in policing.
                Our task at present is to assess whether this report and its
                implementation hold the potential to create that new beginning.
                Pending the establishment of an all-Ireland policing service,
                Sinn&nbsp;Féin wants to see the establishment of a police
                service that can attract the widespread support that is
                necessary and is seen as an integral part of the whole
                community. We remain to be convinced that the Patten&nbsp;Report
                provides the potential to bring this about. However, we could be
                convinced if there were clear evidence that the British
                Government have the political will to see such a service
                established.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Nationalists and Republicans, like all
                sections of society, want and deserve that policing service. I
                do not believe that anyone from any community will accept being
                policed by a force whose members sit by in a Land Rover while a
                young Catholic is kicked to death by a Loyalist mob, by a force
                whose security files on Nationalists are routinely passed on to
                Loyalist death squads, by a force that acts with total impunity

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let us stop pretending. The composition of

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The negotiators of the Belfast Agreement,
                which included the leadership of the UUP, obviously considered
                that the RUC was so deficient that a new beginning to policing
                was imperative for Northern&nbsp;Ireland. The Patten Report
                incorporates the letter and spirit of this section of the
                Belfast Agreement and is, in short, a blueprint for the
                destruction of the RUC. The content of the Patten Report, in
                keeping with the terms of reference for the Patten Commission in
                the Belfast Agreement, was determined by the fundamental
                perspective set out in paragraph&nbsp;1·8.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This paragraph states that the so-called
                reform of policing in Northern&nbsp;Ireland</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;should not be a cluster of unconnected
                adjustments…that can be bolted or soldered onto the
                organisation that already exists&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The &quot;organisation that already
                exists&quot;is the RUC. This means that the fundamental
                perspective of the Patten Report is that the implementation of
                the recommendations of the report is entirely incompatible with
                the continued existence of the RUC. In fact, the so-called new
                police service for Northern&nbsp;Ireland, recommended in the
                Patten Report, which the Government are now committed to
                implementing, will be radically different from the RUC in terms
                of symbolic identity, basis of allegiance, organisational
                structure and, over a relatively short period, personnel. Not
                even the name will remain.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At an even more fundamental level, the
                imperative of the Patten Report to destroy the RUC is based on
                an unbelievable inversion of reality. For the members of the
                Patten Commission, terrorism is not central to the
                intractability of political conflict in Northern&nbsp;Ireland.
                The Patten Report makes the RUC the cause of the persistence of
                political instability and terrorism in Northern&nbsp;Ireland.
                The Patten Report presents the RUC as being at the</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;heart of … the problems that

                Northern&nbsp;Ireland&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The logic of the report is that the effective
                destruction of the RUC must be central to a process that the
                report claims is required to restore the</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;values of liberty, the rule of law and

                rights and respecting human dignity&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The authors of the report obviously consider
                that these values are absent from policing in Northern Ireland
                and that the restoration and maintenance of these values is
                incompatible with the continuing existence of the RUC. The
                report explicitly states</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;by means of a fresh start for policing,
                our aim is to help ensure that past tragedies are not repeated
                in the future&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The clear implication in this statement is
                that the destruction of the RUC is required to prevent a
                repetition of the tragedies of the past. This means that the RUC
                must, in the minds of the authors of the Patten Report, have
                been, in some unspecified way, responsible for these tragedies.
                This is a gross and offensive insult to the memory of the
                302&nbsp;RUC and RUCR officers who were murdered and almost
                10,000 who were maimed in defence of liberty and the rule of law
                during 30&nbsp;years of Sinn&nbsp;Féin/IRA terrorism.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In keeping with this inversion of reality,
                the Patten Report deploys the tactic of demonising the RUC. This
                tactic has been central to Sinn&nbsp;Féin/IRA and SDLP strategy
                for 30&nbsp;years. The tactic involves relentless denigratory
                propaganda. What is the political motivation behind this tactic
                of demonisation? The political motivation is to remove every
                security barrier to the SDLP and Sinn&nbsp;Féin/IRA goal of the
                political unification of the island of Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Sinn&nbsp;Féin/IRA and SDLP strategy of
                demonisation directed against the RUC has the unqualified
                support of the Clinton Administration and the US House of
                Representatives. On 22&nbsp;July&nbsp;1999 the House of
                Representatives unanimously accepted a report on the RUC by the
                Committee on International Relations. In this report the RUC is
                presented, as the enforcement arm of the dominant Unionist
                majority and as a Gestapo-type organisation which is rotten to
                its core. Needless to say, there is not a shred of evidence in
                the report to back any one of these absolutely outrageous
                claims. Both Sinn&nbsp;Féin/IRA and the SDLP propaganda feed
                these outrageous sentiments.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr&nbsp;Mallon is a vociferous anti-RUC
                propagandist, and I want to repeat what I said to one of the
                SDLP members earlier. At the Brehon Law Society ‘Irishman of
                the Year’ award ceremony in Philadelphia on
                24&nbsp;April&nbsp;1999, the then Deputy First Minister
                (Designate) took the opportunity to inform his United States
                audience that in the North of Ireland the RUC had reduced the
                rule of law to little more than the rule of the jungle. This is
                precisely the understanding of the role of the RUC that
                determined the conclusion of the report by the House of
                Representatives Committee on International Affairs.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">12.45 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report concluded that the RUC had been at
                the core of — indeed, had given rise to — the human rights
                abuses and civil unrest that has plagued Northern Ireland for
                the last 30&nbsp;years. The position of the Committee on
                International Relations is that terrorism in
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland is driven not by Sinn&nbsp;Féin/IRA but
                by the RUC.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This inversion of reality is not confined to
                the rigid Nationalism that directs the Northern&nbsp;Ireland
                policy of the Clinton Administration. The Patten Report fully
                incorporates this entire mindset. The core logic of the Patten
                Report is that what it refers to as &quot;the return of hope,
                healing and peace&quot; to Northern&nbsp;Ireland requires the
                effective destruction of the RUC and the incorporation of
                Republicans into a so-called Northern&nbsp;Ireland Police
                Service.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Patten Report claims that the consent
                required right across the community in any liberal democracy for
                effective policing has been absent from the RUC. This claim is
                the ostensible basis for the effective destruction of the RUC
                recommended by the report, but it is demonstrably false. In
                reality, the statistics used in the report, along with the
                results of annual community attitude surveys since the
                mid-1990s, almost certainly demonstrate a level of
                cross-community support for the RUC unmatched by that for any
                other police force in the United&nbsp;Kingdom.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What is the real reason for the effective
                destruction of the RUC? The real reason is that the destruction
                of the RUC is a core demand of Sinn&nbsp;Féin/IRA, backed by
                the SDLP. Sinn&nbsp;Féin/IRA knows that without the destruction
                of the RUC, the terrorist war cannot be won. The SDLP is equally
                tied into the demands and objectives of Irish Nationalism. The
                position is set out in their 1995 policy document ‘Policing in
                Northern Ireland’. This document claims that what it calls
                &quot;the problem of policing in Northern&nbsp;Ireland&quot; is
                incapable of resolution in the absence of a so-called political
                settlement agreeable to Nationalists.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The SDLP objection to the RUC is
                fundamentally a political objection that it shares with
                Sinn&nbsp;Féin/IRA, based on the demands of Irish Nationalism.
                This means that no amount of so-called reform of the RUC could
                make it acceptable to the SDLP. The real strategy of the SDLP is
                to use the concocted claim that the RUC is radically
                unacceptable to Catholics as a powerful lever for constitutional
                change in Northern&nbsp;Ireland in the direction of Irish unity.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Patten Report meets the core requirements
                of Sinn&nbsp;Féin/IRA and the SDLP in respect of the
                destruction of the RUC, but that is not the final appeasement of
                terrorism. The report further recommends the replacement of the
                RUC with a Northern&nbsp;Ireland police service.
                Sinn&nbsp;Féin/IRA is guaranteed a central role in the
                political control and operational structure of the so-called new
                police dispensation in Northern&nbsp;Ireland. Recruitment from
                the Republican movement is a reiterated requirement of the
                report. The report states that the police service in
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland needs to include appropriately large
                numbers of Nationalists, including Republicans, if it is to be
                fully effective. The inclusion of Republicans — individuals
                committed to IRA terrorism — in policing in
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland would also be accommodated by the
                recommendation in the report that police support services should
                be contracted out by district councils and paid for from local
                rates. There is no doubt that in Nationalist districts of
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland these support services would be provided
                by members of the IRA.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Patten puts the incorporation of
                Sinn&nbsp;Féin/IRA into the heart of policing in
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland and in an all-Ireland framework; the
                report clearly envisages the development of an all-Ireland
                police structure. This structure would initially be based on the
                recruitment of members of the Gardaí into the police service of
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland and a programme of long-term personnel
                exchanges between the Northern&nbsp;Ireland police and the
                Gardaí. The location of the new Northern&nbsp;Ireland police
                service in an all-Ireland structure would provide the Republic
                with a developing role in the policing of Northern&nbsp;Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Republic of Ireland, to which the Patten
                report gives this developing role in policing in
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland, has effectively been a safe haven for the
                IRA and other Republican terrorists since 1970. Members of
                Jack&nbsp;Lynch’s Fianna&nbsp;Fáil Government established the
                Provisional IRA in the early 1970s. The status of the Republic
                as a safe haven for Republican terrorists is beyond dispute.
                This is due to the maintenance of Sinn&nbsp;Féin’s
                headquarters in Dublin; the failure of successive Governments in
                the Republic, over a 30-year period, to extradite republican
                terrorists to the jurisdiction of the United&nbsp;Kingdom; and
                the storage and ease of movement of a hugh arsenal of IRA arms
                in the Republic.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These considerations mean that for 30 years
                the Republic of Ireland has been responsible for what was, in
                effect, state-sponsored terrorism directed against the
                Protestant and Unionist community in Northern&nbsp;Ireland. The
                implementation of the Patten Report will establish the policing
                of law-abiding citizens in Northern&nbsp;Ireland by IRA
                terrorists within a developing all-Ireland structure involving
                the country — the Republic of Ireland — that initiated and
                sustained IRA terrorism in Northern&nbsp;Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Patten Report rewards 30&nbsp;years of
                Sinn&nbsp;Féin/IRA terrorism by incorporating both the
                terrorists and the Republic of Ireland — the state which
                sponsored them — into the policing of the society against
                which that terrorism was directed. The ‘Daily Telegraph’ of
                28&nbsp;September&nbsp;1999 described this scenario as an
                &quot;insane project&quot;. That is true, but it is not the
                whole truth. The implementation of the Patten Report will
                destroy the rule of law in Northern&nbsp;Ireland that the
                officers of the RUC fought and died to defend, and it will
                incorporate the terrorist organisation responsible for their
                murder into the policing of Northern&nbsp;Ireland. The Patten
                Report exemplifies not mere insanity but wickedness in respect
                of any civilised understanding of the requirements of public
                morality.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, every one of the recommendations of
                the Patten Report is in keeping with the requirements of the
                Belfast Agreement. The agreement requires that the new so-called
                police service must</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;recognise the full and equal legitimacy
                and worth of the identities, senses of allegiance and ethos of
                all sections of the community in Northern&nbsp;Ireland.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This means that the agreement requires that
                policing in Northern&nbsp;Ireland must be based on recognition
                of the legitimacy and worth of the Irish Republican tradition
                that spawned and has sustained 30&nbsp;years of IRA terrorism in
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, these considerations have not
                prevented the UUP leadership — again I make the distinction
                made by Mr&nbsp;Dodds, I am talking about the UUP leadership —
                that delivered the Belfast Agreement from insulting the
                intelligence and political integrity of the Unionist electorate
                by attempting now to present themselves as the champions of the
                RUC. In fact, they fought the referendum and Assembly elections
                on the claim that they had actually saved the RUC by signing up
                to the Belfast Agreement. There is only one honourable course of
                action left to the leadership of the RUC — and I address this
                point to Mr&nbsp;Trimble — and that is to resign immediately
                from the Executive and collapse this edifice that he has
                constructed to replace the police in Northern&nbsp;Ireland with
                terrorists.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Roche:</p>
                </b>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I too must express my disgust and abhorrence
                at the Secretary of State’s announced decision to implement
                the vast majority of the Patten Commission’s Report. This
                announcement has further demoralised the Royal Ulster
                Constabulary, and it gives Loyalist and Republican
                paramilitaries every hope that they can infiltrate and corrupt
                the police force that they hate. Society in the rest of the
                United&nbsp;Kingdom does not aspire to have a police force that
                is acceptable to anarchists, so why do the people of
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland have to be subjected to this? For many
                years the reputation of the RUC has been successfully demonised
                at home and abroad by Sinn&nbsp;Fein/IRA. They have classed the
                RUC as sectarian, yet people know that the overwhelming reason
                why Roman&nbsp;Catholics represent only 8% of the force is due
                to Republican murder and intimidation. The intimidation is such
                as was witnessed in Carrickmore against Msgr&nbsp;Faul.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have seen little recognition for a force
                that over the last 30&nbsp;years, through its vigilance and
                intelligence work, has prevented Northern&nbsp;Ireland from
                descending into anarchy. We will not forget the
                302&nbsp;officers who were murdered or the 9,000&nbsp;injured
                — some horrifically — as a direct result of terrorism. The
                courage and suffering of the members of the force has been
                ignored.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is particularly painful to see how their
                tormentors are to be rewarded by the changing of the RUC’s
                name and adopting new insignia. Little of the ethos of the RUC
                will remain, and Republicans are rubbing their hands in glee.
                They know that they are now perfectly placed to decide on
                suitable recruits for the new force. Though it has been
                confirmed that convicted terrorists cannot join the police,
                there are hundreds of terrorists who have never been charged.
                The new force will not be able to keep out these enemies of the
                state, as recruitment will be handed over to civilians.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The political representatives of the IRA, who
                have murdered members of the RUC, will have a share in the
                management of the district policing partnership boards. A police
                board will include two frontmen for the IRA, so an organisation
                that has yet to give up a single bullet or an ounce of Semtex,
                an organisation that is still murdering and mutilating its own
                people with virtual impunity, will oversee these boards.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is no reason for implementing any of
                these controversial recommendations unless it is the British
                Government’s intention to hand over parts of this Province to
                Republican and Loyalist fascists. The British taxpayer already
                subsidises many of these volunteers — I hope that he will not
                give them a uniform and a salary. The latest concession, like
                all the others made to the Irish Republicans by an
                Administration which, tragically, goes under the name of Her
                Majesty’s Government, is aimed at weakening
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland’s position as part of the
                United&nbsp;Kingdom, and it is sad that some Unionists have yet
                to waken up to this fact.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unionists who voted in favour of the Belfast
                Agreement should remember what their endorsement has meant so
                far. Republican and Loyalist prisoners convicted of the most
                heinous crimes against innocent people are being released after
                serving a few years of their sentence. A Northern&nbsp;Ireland
                Executive was set up on a fifty-fifty Unionist/Nationalist basis
                — conveniently ignoring the fact that Unionists account for
                60% of the total Assembly membership. Sinn&nbsp;Féin members
                hold ministerial positions, without any decommissioning of IRA
                weapons. Indeed, dropping &quot;Northern&nbsp;Ireland&quot; from
                the title of their Departments and banning the flying of the
                Union flag from departmental buildings were among the first
                things they did.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">North/South institutions were set up to
                legitimise the direct influence of the Republic of Ireland in
                the day-to-day affairs of the Province. Vital security
                installations were scaled down in areas where Republican
                paramilitaries still hold considerable sway. Finally, the RUC
                has been emasculated and effectively disbanded, with plans to
                recruit officers to a new force on a fifty-fifty
                Protestant/Roman Catholic basis — in clear breach of fair
                employment legislation. What further enticements will there be
                to convince the Provos to make the move that may save the
                so-called peace process?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The leader of the SDLP, in a response in the
                House of Commons, would not call on Roman Catholics to join the
                new force. The First Minister showed his displeasure at the
                Patten announcement. This confirmed what many of us had thought
                — that he had been shafted once again.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The majority of the Unionist family will not
                forgive or forget what some of their representatives have done,
                and they will show their disgust when they next get their chance
                at the polls. Since last Wednesday I have been inundated by
                calls from Unionists who had supported the agreement but are now
                expressing their total disgust at this latest treachery. They
                wish that they could turn back the clock. They were well warned
                by the anti-agreement lobby, but, sadly, they were misled into
                ignoring that warning.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am proud to have served in the Royal Ulster
                Constabulary Reserve, and I count myself part of the greater
                family of the RUC. Religion was never mentioned, either among my
                Colleagues or by the people that we served and protected. Sadly,
                the reformed force will remain as unacceptable to
                Sinn&nbsp;Féin/IRA as the existing one is.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We should not forget that Queen&nbsp;Victoria
                bestowed the &quot;Royal&quot; designation to the RUC’s
                predecessor, the Royal Irish Constabulary, in 1867. It was
                carried forward to the new force on its inception in 1922. In
                1867 the words of the Inspector General encapsulated the depth
                of feeling at that time:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;It will, I am persuaded, be gratifying
                to the Force to find that the loyalty and courage displayed by
                them during the late unhappy disturbances and their efficiency
                at all times (which have elicited admiration throughout the
                United&nbsp;Kingdom, and been noticed in both Houses of
                Parliament) have now been recognised in a quarter so
                illustrious.&quot;</p>
                </font><i><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.00 pm</p>
                </font></i><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Whatever the circumstances that prevailed in
                the unhappy disturbances at the time, they surely pale into
                insignificance when compared to the terrorist onslaught endured
                by the RUC over the last 30&nbsp;years. We continue to be
                blitzed with the view that this peace process is all about
                parity of esteem. Surely the RUC badge encapsulates that with
                the crown, the harp and the shamrock. Unfortunately, the change
                in its title and badge are for nothing more than political
                expediency. The RUC longs for peace more than any other section
                of the community, and it is happy with modernising reforms and
                the encouragement of more Roman Catholic recruits.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In conclusion, the Patten proposals are the
                most odious manifestation of this obnoxious peace process —
                they stink of continuing appeasement of the IRA.</p>

                They get very simplistic responses when they ask about what is
                going on in this society. For instance, the last Member who

                the next election. Perhaps some in our constituency will be

                &quot;Isn’t it terrible what they are doing to the RUC?&quot;,
                and one of the clever ones will say &quot;Aye, I know. Shout
                loudly, for it will not do us any harm in the long run.&quot;
                That is a truth.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We also need to look at those who have lumped
                Republicanism and Loyalism together, and the last Member who
                spoke said that Loyalists hate the RUC. I do not know how he
                would know. Nevertheless, just to put it on public record, my
                Colleague and I have been kept alive on numerous occasions only
                because of the efforts of the RUC.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The area from which I come — for those who
                really want to know — is the Braniel&nbsp;estate, about two
                miles from here, as the crow flies. The police drive through
                there without any difficulty, and if anybody wants to make a
                phone call because there is trouble in his street, or his house
                has been broken into, or his car has been damaged, or whatever,
                he phones the RUC.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have never seen anybody being molested
                where I live, which is in a solidly working-class, Loyalist
                area. So this very simplistic notion of the RUC being hated by
                Loyalists is quite incredible. But then you cannot have a go at
                the Provos without lumping the bad Prod people in as well. That
                is because people are moralists and have to lump all us bad
                people together.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What is happening to the RUC is shameful, and
                it is wrong. It is bad enough that the British Secretary of
                State said what he did last week, but he said it against a
                backdrop of some very interesting things. When we created the
                baby, the Good Friday Agreement, we were very quick to realise
                that we required a visit from the marriage-guidance counsellor,
                George&nbsp;Mitchell, to put us straight on how the new family
                might best look after the agreement. While he managed to create
                the circumstances where there was a movement forward — or an
                impetus that suggested a movement forward — I am afraid that
                we are in need of great assistance from marriage-guidance
                counsellors again.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Against a backdrop of what I am about to say,
                the Secretary of State made his determination on the future of
                the RUC.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If someone had told Angelo&nbsp;Fusco
                10&nbsp;years ago that he would go North and appear in front of
                a judge who, because of the Good Friday Agreement, would release
                him on bail and that, when the case was heard, he would be
                sentenced and serve probably one month or six&nbsp;weeks in
                prison, he would have said &quot;Where do I&nbsp;sign on?&quot;.
                That is not what we have heard from the Provos; that is not what
                we have heard from Sinn&nbsp;Féin — disgusting, arrogant,
                dishonourable Sinn&nbsp;Féin. What we have heard is the
                agitation that has again sent a tremor into the Unionist
                community and compounded the difficulty of moderate Unionism by
                the narrowing of the ground even further.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This was followed by an incident involving
                &quot;he who visits Europe and speaks in strange
                languages&quot;, Barry&nbsp;McElduff, who went to Carrickmore
                with a bunch of lunatics to attack those who wanted to deal with
                the circumstances of a crime — an issue about which everyone
                in this community should worry. This was another awful message
                to send to the people who want the Good Friday Agreement to work
                but who are worried about the implacable in-your-face politics
                of Sinn&nbsp;Féin.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Of course, the SDLP could not be outdone,
                because when the Provos are showing their greenness, the SDLP
                must respond. So we had Downpatrick, where the flag became an
                issue. It is to be replaced with St&nbsp;Patrick’s flag.
                Within the confines of Down District Council the SDLP has the
                right to do such a thing. The tragedy is that it did so without
                worrying about or giving consideration to the consequences of
                its actions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Last week we heard about Bairbre&nbsp;de&nbsp;Brún
                and her very simplistic decision on the Union flag, a decision
                which flies in the face of the recognition that
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland shall remain part of the
                United&nbsp;Kingdom for so long as it is the wish of the greater
                number of people so to do. It thus flew in the face of the Good
                Friday Agreement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Enter the treatment of the Duchess of
                Abercorn in Pomeroy, treatment which was pathetic and arrogant
                in the extreme. It was good that Assembly Member Denis&nbsp;Haughey
                was on hand to put the SDLP’s position on record — but he is
                the only one I have heard speaking on the issue then or since.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All of these things have been happening in a
                rush, and they have all been hitting the Unionist community like
                Exocets. They have all been destabilising factors, not only in
                the Unionist community but, especially from a Sinn&nbsp;Féin
                perspective, for their partners in this process. Is this the new
                dispensation that Mary&nbsp;Nelis almost knew what she was
                talking about when she spoke?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mary&nbsp;Nelis talked about the bad peelers
                and about how we have to root out those RUC officers who have
                performed badly on human rights. She did not mention the IRA. We
                can all go to Ronnie&nbsp;Flanagan and ask for the overtime
                sheets and find out who was stationed where and who did this,
                but such sheets do not exist for the Provos, or the UVF, or the
                UDA, or the INLA, or for a whole lot of other people who have
                broken the laws of this society. But Mary&nbsp;Nelis wishes to
                go back to deal with the RUC.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Whatever happened to the new dispensation?
                Whatever happened to the fact that we are to leave our pasts
                behind us? Whatever happened to the argument that we too
                advocated that people have the right to change, that this
                society has the right to change and that all elements within
                this society, because of the polluted circumstances and
                difficulties under which we have lived, under a new
                dispensation, have the right to change? Everybody that is except
                the RUC.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I&nbsp;listened to that doyen of intellectual
                prowess, Mick&nbsp;Murphy, on the radio this morning. He was
                addressing a crowd of people in Carrickmore — 200&nbsp;&quot;Shinners&quot;,
                or whatever they were — and his cry was for disbandment.
                Mary&nbsp;Nelis was a wee bit more polite today, but really what
                they are saying is this: &quot;Let us offer no prize for
                Unionist pain.&quot;</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am reminded of listening to the Chief
                Constable when the Patten Report was published. The
                Progressive&nbsp;Unionist Party took its line from his, for he
                said something extremely pertinent and sensible. He said that he
                wished to live in a pluralist society where policing is about
                the protection of people and property, rather than being the
                political football which it has tragically had to be in this
                divided society. He said the important question was whether the
                prize fitted the pain.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The truth of the matter — as shown by the
                commentaries I have heard today from the SDLP and
                Sinn&nbsp;Féin — is that the prize does not fit the pain.
                Alex&nbsp;Attwood said &quot;if&quot; it has the potential and
                &quot;maybe&quot;. Sinn&nbsp;Féin was not even as open as that.
                Mick&nbsp;Murphy was certainly not open when he spoke yesterday
                evening. All of Sinn&nbsp;Féin’s utterances have been
                pathetic and extremely arrogant. Each one of them has further
                narrowed the ground on which moderate Unionism, the partner in
                the Good Friday Agreement, can walk.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The consequences have been such that this
                political process is in serious danger. It is in trouble for
                many reasons: the attitude of Sinn&nbsp;Féin; its implacability
                as perceived by the Unionist community; and the potential that
                this implacability will continue in the form of in-your-face
                politics. It does not allow us to deal with practical issues,
                but simply challenges Unionism consistently and tries to put it
                on the back foot. It has in its ranks those who want to take
                over Unionism, those who frankly enjoy the difficulties moderate
                Unionism faces. While saying it has entered a new dispensation,
                by its actions Sinn&nbsp;Féin offers fuel to those who do not
                like the Good Friday Agreement, who are not involved in the
                marriage. Indeed, as regards the Good Friday Agreement and
                relationships with Members in this House, it might well be
                carrying on outside the marriage. Essentially, it is working to
                the benefit of those who do not advocate the implementation of
                the Good Friday Agreement, wishing to see its destruction
                instead. And they are making a good job of it. One has to ask
                oneself what its long-term strategy is, and what gain might be
                derived from it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several Members mentioned the decommissioning
                issue. They might not all have used the word, although some
                certainly did, but one said that already, without a single
                bullet or ounce of explosives being handed in, the RUC has gone.
                They do not realise what they have been doing. The Secretary of
                State has seen the in-your-face agitation on the part of
                Sinn&nbsp;Féin and recognised the demand coming not just from
                David&nbsp;Trimble, who undoubtedly needs it, but from every
                Unionist in this Chamber, that decommissioning take place. Not
                only must it take place, but it must do so before
                12&nbsp;February&nbsp;2000.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I fear that the cause célèbre that
                decommissioning has become has created in the mind of the
                Secretary of State the need to pander to Mr&nbsp;Adams while
                Sinn&nbsp;Féin pursues its in-your-face politics. He does this
                in the hope that he can exact a price from Mr&nbsp;Adams to
                deliver Mr&nbsp;Trimble. Perhaps without realising it, they have
                created the circumstances where there is now a trade-off.
                Indeed, I certainly would not expect some elements in the House
                to realise this, since any argument against those who support
                the agreement will do, and any hurdle they can create is
                justified. As a result of this trade-off, we have lost the very
                thing we did not want to lose.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The name of the RUC, the oath and,
                potentially, the flag are to go, to some extent because we did
                not create a fierce enough battle to retain them. We must all
                accept responsibility for this. It happened against the backdrop
                of what was needed in the future, and who was in a comfortable
                position at the moment, for that is how the British Government
                play the game. I believe Mr&nbsp;Mandelson felt he had to pander
                to Mr&nbsp;Adams in order to bolster him, enabling him to make
                the move to assist Mr&nbsp;Trimble.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.15 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If he does assist Trimble what are the DUP,
                the UKUP, the UUAP and the NIUP going to do? Are they going to
                applaud Sinn&nbsp;Féin for having delivered on decommissioning?
                Are they going to think that they can make it easier for people
                when the police service of Northern&nbsp;Ireland takes its place
                amidst the sense of anger, hurt and frustration that will exist
                in the Unionist community? Will a token gesture of
                decommissioning do it? Will it be 1% or 5%? How much do you need
                to feel comfortable that you allowed the trade-off to take
                place? Because allow the trade-off to take place, you did —
                believe me, you did.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You tried it with prisoners; that did not
                work. The next two big issues — the only two big issues — on
                the agenda were the RUC and decommissioning, and you walked
                right into it. All the clever, exalted people walked right into
                it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, I want to make an appeal — if it
                can be heard, for I cannot guarantee that UTV or BBC will
                broadcast it. The ordinary people in the streets including,
                there is evidence to suggest, the vast majority of the Catholic
                people want the process of the Good Friday Agreement to work. I
                personally, as a representative of the PUP, am being sucked out
                of the process by Sinn&nbsp;Féin’s actions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Nationalist and Catholic community will
                have to make a decision. Is the in-your-face street politics of
                Sinn&nbsp;Féin acceptable, or does this new dispensation get
                the opportunity to carry on? The question and decision is for
                them. I do not mean that as a threat in any way; I am basing it
                on an analysis of where we are. If the IRA and Sinn&nbsp;Féin
                do not move to assist this new dispensation, it will fall. It
                will fall, and Sinn&nbsp;Féin might do all right out of it, but
                there are those waiting in the wings for them to say &quot;I
                told you so.&quot; However, be assured that those waiting in the
                wings for moderate Unionism are many; in fact they are in here,
                and they are joyous at the thought of what might not happen
                between now and 12&nbsp;February. We have but a short time to
                find out if Sinn&nbsp;Féin is serious about the new
                dispensation. The deadline was once May&nbsp;2000, but I fear
                that Gerry&nbsp;Adams has also made a blunder from his own
                perspective, because the deadline now, like it or not, is
                12&nbsp;February.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like to comment on the conduct of the
                debate. I did not impose a time limit for two reasons. The first
                was that I had not been informed by all the parties how many
                people wanted to speak, and that made it impossible. Secondly,
                if I were to have imposed a short time limit it would have been
                impossible for Members to develop their argument. Some Members
                have pushed the boat out regarding this, resulting in the fact
                that their Colleagues have had a shorter time to speak. I have
                been giving parties an opportunity to voice their views in
                respect of the report, and we will continue with that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another two Members wish to speak,
                Ms&nbsp;Monica McWilliams, and Mr&nbsp;Robert&nbsp;McCartney.
                That will end the debate for this morning — the morning having
                passed. We will resume at 2.30&nbsp;pm with questions, as
                Standing Orders require. From 4 o’clock until 6 o’clock, by
                leave of the Assembly, there will be a time limit of
                five&nbsp;minutes on all speeches so that as many Members as
                possible who are on the list may have their say. We will then
                proceed to the winding-up and the vote. That is the best
                compromise I can make. To have put a limit on at the beginning
                would have been unrealistic and unworkable.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Morrow:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Perhaps you would clarify a point for me,
                Mr&nbsp;Speaker. You have a list of Members who wish to speak
                and a considerable number are from my party, but they are not
                here yet.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is the problem. It is impossible for me
                to judge times, if the names of Members who wish to speak are
                not given in advance. It is also impossible to impose a time
                limit on people when other Members have been able to speak for a
                considerable time.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McCartney:</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As you said, Mr Speaker, since Members who
                have already spoken had no time limit placed on them, remaining
                Members should not have one either. I understood, upon enquiry,
                that the House was rising at 1.30&nbsp;pm. That was the
                information I was given. From what you say that does not appear
                to have been entirely accurate.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At an earlier stage, my intention was that we
                would rise at 1.30&nbsp;pm. I fondly hoped that we might have
                got through the run by then. Clearly we will not rise at
                1.30&nbsp;pm if both you and Ms&nbsp;McWilliams are to have the
                opportunity to speak. We will continue until you have spoken,
                and then we will rise, but we must resume at 2.30&nbsp;pm.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But that will put a time limit on the Members
                yet to speak. If we are going to rise before 2.30&nbsp;pm, and
                two&nbsp;Members have to speak before then, that will put a time
                limit on them.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McCartney is quite correct, but there is a
                problem. If everybody wants to speak and time limits are put on
                us, we cannot function. I am simply doing the best I can. If
                Mr&nbsp;McCartney wishes, we can certainly allow
                Ms&nbsp;McWilliams to speak and then rise. There will then be an
                opportunity for Mr&nbsp;McCartney to speak, but he will have to
                appreciate that that will eat out of the period between
                4.00&nbsp;pm and the vote at 6.00&nbsp;pm and that fewer Members
                will have an opportunity to speak then. I am doing my best to
                accommodate everyone.</p>

                the others operated without a time limit, theoretically you
                could speak — and I know from experience that you have the
                capacity — from now until 6.00&nbsp;pm and then claim that you
                wanted more time. We are using up time, and there are only
                two&nbsp;possibilities. Either we rise after Ms&nbsp;McWilliams
                has spoken and you speak after 4.00&nbsp;pm, or we do our best
                to see that you both get an opportunity to speak before lunch. I
                am going to rule now that we will go on for as long as is
                physically possible and that you will get time to speak. We are

                what you are saying. If I opt to speak at 4.00&nbsp;pm will I be
                restricted by the five-minute rule or will I have the same
                opportunity that has been afforded to everyone else? That is all

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If we do that, it will reduce the time that
                is available to the other Members, and I will have to consider
                that. That is not the proposition that I was putting to the
                Assembly. I said that we would complete this, that we would
                break for lunch and that when the debate resumed, there would be
                five minutes for each Member. That was the proposition I put. If
                that is not acceptable, I will have to reconsider it, and we
                will have to make a decision before we resume at 4.00&nbsp;pm.</p>

                said that if I chose to speak at 4.00&nbsp;pm and took up a
                certain amount of time it might limit other Members. You never
                ruled that if I chose to speak at 4.00&nbsp;pm I would be
                confined to the five-minute rule, which would be manifestly

                until 4.00&nbsp;pm. Then we will see what happens. I am quite
                clear about that. At this point I want to call
                Ms&nbsp;McWilliams. Then I will call you to speak, you will

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The debate has reflected the difficulties
                that we faced during the negotiations when the issue of policing
                was being discussed. Therefore, we made the right decision when
                we suggested that an independent international commission be
                established to review policing in Northern&nbsp;Ireland. We have
                not heard anything we have not heard before about the divisions
                that exist with regard to how we want to be policed in the
                future. Patten and his commissioners faced a number of
                questions, as, indeed, the Secretary of State does now. It is a
                unique opportunity to devise a new form of policing for a modern
                society. How many people in any country have that opportunity?
                It is one that should be welcomed. However, it was not just
                policing for a modern society that Patten was addressing. He was
                also addressing the issue of policing in a divided society.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are now having a different kind of
                discussion than we had prior to the Belfast&nbsp;Agreement. The
                discussion is now about the unacknowledged nature of the war.
                People are referring to the troubles, or the 30&nbsp;years of
                conflict as a war. The unacknowledged nature of that war also
                led to a discussion as to what should happen to prisoners. We
                hear too from the whole range of victims about what did or did
                not happen in relation to resources and services for them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Likewise we face the issue of policing. I
                always find it interesting to see how many Members are prepared
                to declare that they were members of the RUC. It reflects the
                nature of the debate in the Chamber. There are those who served
                in the RUC and therefore have a lot to add to the debate, and
                there are those who have no knowledge of the RUC and make
                judgements based on cases that appeared before the courts or the
                European courts. It would have been surprising if the police had
                not been made accountable. That is what happens in other
                countries. Cases of infringements of human rights exist
                elsewhere — for instance, in the United&nbsp;States and
                western&nbsp;European countries including the Republic of
                Ireland and Northern&nbsp;Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On top of that, there has been the
                30&nbsp;years of conflict. We should acknowledge that the police
                serving on the ground were operating in a quasi-military fashion
                because of the nature of that conflict which we are now
                beginning to acknowledge was a war, and we should also
                acknowledge those who were operating in a quasi-service oriented
                role.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I taught the police for 20&nbsp;years at the
                University of Ulster. When the bomb went off and killed
                three&nbsp;police officers, the staff and the police standards
                moved to the new police college at Garnerville. I remember
                having to take cognizance at that time of the fact that in front
                of me was a group of students who were no more homogeneous than
                students in any of my other classes. I had as much difficulty
                informing and educating that group of students about social
                policy, about the current ways of dealing with crime and about
                the changing social trends in relation to the family. In that
                group there were some who did not believe in changing attitudes
                or trends, and there were others who were prepared to understand
                the need for that and the need to be educated and trained in the
                workings of modern society.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There seems to be some idea in the House that
                the police service is somehow homogeneous and that police
                officers are antagonistic to the changes that are taking place,
                as recommended by Patten. That is not the case. We know from
                listening to police officers and to the Chief&nbsp;Constable
                that when a society makes the transition from war to peace,
                reorientation will have to take place. That applies to our
                police service and to any police force that operates in a
                society that was full of conflict.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.30 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I take issue with those who say that Patten
                did not research his work. He took an enormous amount of
                submissions from people in Northern&nbsp;Ireland, and he visited
                police forces elsewhere and heard from experts in the field. He
                took on board 95% of the Police Federation’s recommendations.
                That has not been emphasised sufficiently. I have carried out
                research on issues such as rape, domestic violence and child
                abuse, and I was always unable to get figures from the RUC on
                the number of cases that occurred in any particular year, on how
                many of them went forward for prosecution or on how many of them
                fell or were withdrawn. That is the kind of simple information
                that ought to drive any police service anywhere in the world. If
                we do not know the extent of the problem, we do not know how
                resources should be deployed to deal with it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Patten’s investigations made him realise
                the amount of work that would be needed to create a police
                service for a modern society. Many resources were diverted into
                dealing with political terrorism and, often as a result of
                attitudes in the police service, it could not or would not deal
                with crime such as domestic terrorism, as those who are the
                victims of such crime would call it. It is right for him to draw
                on good practice elsewhere and that we have the most modern
                computerised system and information technology available.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Patten also talks about changing the culture,
                the ethos and the operational structures so that policing is
                based less on that quasi-military function of the past or on the
                drilling that took up so much time in training. There must be
                more emphasis on a problem-solving approach.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am a little concerned about the
                recommendations that suggest that all education should take
                place in the police college. From what I&nbsp;hear and know of
                police officers lives, I&nbsp;am aware of the fact that those
                who talk only to other police officers and who live beside them,
                do not have the life education that is required. Such education
                should take place both in university and in the police college.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was surprised to find that there was little
                debate this morning on the name change. Much has been made of
                this in the media; it has led to an enormous amount of
                discussion and caused a great deal of pain for those in the
                Unionist community. In the 1920’s the name was changed from
                Royal Irish Constabulary to Royal Ulster Constabulary. That is a
                precedent, and no doubt the change then was as painful as this
                one it will be. In acknowledging that, Patten and the Secretary
                of State have concluded that to service a divided community a
                new name was required. Inasmuch as symbolic change may be
                required, organisational, structural and policy changes must
                also be a prerogative of any part of the legislation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have a major criticism of the part of the
                report which deals with the composition of the new police
                service. It should, according to the report, be fair, impartial
                and representative. It never ceases to surprise me that in
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland the focus, in respect of impartial
                representation, is on Catholics and Protestants. Monitoring
                figures are based on religion and denomination, but the
                representation of women, about 15%, is lower than in police
                services elsewhere. Now we have an opportunity to correct that.
                It is difficult to attract women into police services elsewhere,
                but here we have an enormous difficulty.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I take issue with Nigel&nbsp;Dodds,
                Sean&nbsp;Neeson, Denis&nbsp;Watson and, probably,
                Paddy&nbsp;Roche who said that the Patten recommendations, in
                seeking to promote the idea that there should be more Catholics
                in the new police service, go against the legislation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This question has come up also in relation to
                gender. The Equality Commission has looked at this. I attended a
                seminar organised by the Committee for the Administration of
                Justice, and it asked some of the commissioners why they felt it
                was so difficult to deal with the issue of the representation of
                women in the police service. The commissioners said that it
                could be ruled as being outside the current law. Fortunately a
                member of the Equality Commission was there and said that it was
                not outside of the European Equal Treatment Directive of 1976.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Indeed, if domestic law goes further than the
                text of that directive, but has the same purpose, then it may be
                possible to interpret its outcome as being in keeping with the
                spirit of that directive. In the treaty of Amsterdam,
                Article&nbsp;13 covers this issue. It is inside the purpose of
                that legislation to include targets and timetables, not just in
                relation to religion but also in relation to gender.</p>

                recommending career breaks, part-time working and other

                would obviously detract from the number of females who were
                currently in the RUC, and he took up the recommendation that the
                part-time Reserve should be retained.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree that the civilianisation of the new
                police service will increase the number of women, and it was
                useful for him to see that as a way of attracting recruits. They
                may come in as civilians and then move on to being full members
                of the police service. Different jobs will obviously be done by
                police officers and civilians, but potentially, this may
                increase the number of women.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is extremely important to recruit female

                example — want to speak to female police officers to whom they
                can relate. That is currently not possible in the police
                service.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">People need to be aware, not just in terms of
                Patten’s recommendations, that police officers are taking
                advantage of funding for retraining and rehabilitation. Over
                £3&nbsp;million has been set aside in the Peace and
                Reconciliation Fund — the European Fund — and that is
                currently being spent. Patten has not said that so many police
                officers are going to be made redundant, but that is going on
                already. Some are choosing to move out of the police service.
                Many have gained degrees and post-graduate qualifications and
                are now in a position to move on.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, there are two other points that the
                legislation should take up. One is that both the policing board
                and the district partnership policing boards are likely to be
                public bodies, so Section&nbsp;75 of the Northern&nbsp;Ireland
                Act should apply to them in that they should be looking at
                recruitment, the procurement of services and, indeed, public
                safety. These are all functions mentioned in Section&nbsp;75 of
                the Northern&nbsp;Ireland Act. We too will be looking at the
                legislation when it comes out to see if that recommendation has
                been taken up.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An oversight commissioner is essential, and
                we know that from other aspects of the agreement. If we create a
                vacuum and just expect that change to be implemented without its
                being monitored or evaluated by someone who has taken an
                holistic view of what is happening, justice will not be done to
                the amount of work that has gone into looking at how we want to
                be policed in the future. I am, however, concerned about the
                lack of focus on when that person should take up the post.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Human Rights Commission, the Equality
                Commission and the Police Commission have a role to play in this
                debate, and the legislation should refer to there being liaison
                with these bodies. We have such a reference for the Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I await the outcome of the criminal justice
                review. It is essential that this debate does not take place in
                isolation. As those of us who have worked in this field know,
                policing is only one aspect of the matter. There is also the
                matter of dealing with crime and with how a society ought to
                operate; the prosecution of and sentencing for a particular
                crime are also essential. What body will do that, and how
                accountable will it be?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It would be very difficult to have a debate
                on that without knowing what the recommendations of the Criminal
                Justice Review Body’s report will be.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also take issue with David&nbsp;Ervine’s
                comment that the only difficult issues in the Belfast Agreement
                were the issues of decommissioning and policing. There were many
                difficult issues in the agreement. There was the constitutional
                issue, and today we are dealing with an institutional one. But
                there were also the important issues of victims and how to
                create for the future a society based on tolerance.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Do these proposals promote effective and
                efficient policing? My answer, having reflected on the
                recommendations and on the comments of the Secretary of State to
                date, is yes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will they deliver fair and impartial
                policing, free from partisan control? Yes, they have the
                potential to do so.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Do they provide for accountability both to
                the law and to the community? Yes, potentially.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will they make the police more representative
                of the society they serve? With the addendum that I have given
                in relation to gender representation, the answer is yes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will they protect and vindicate the human
                rights and human dignity of all? This is probably the most
                important question of all. If we recognise the divisions that
                exist and begin to acknowledge them, and if we base respect for
                human rights at the core of any new police service, the answer
                is yes.</p>

                two&nbsp;Members from each of the major parties present, but
                those whom I particularly wished to address — those fronting
                paramilitary organisations such as Sinn&nbsp;Féin and the PUP
                — are not represented at all. That must be a matter of regret
                for everyone.</p>

                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There can be no doubt that the fundamental
                and driving principle of British policy in Northern&nbsp;Ireland
                has been to avoid the repetition of any bombs in the City of
                London. While I have been reiterating this principle for some
                five&nbsp;years, it is only in recent times — over the last
                four months — that it has become commonly acknowledged by
                almost every major political commentator. What effect has that
                principle had on law and order in Northern&nbsp;Ireland and on
                the police in general?</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.45 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let us look at Sinn&nbsp;Féin, the party
                inextricably linked with the IRA and capable of making good the
                threat to bomb the City of London. What have they received under
                the Belfast Agreement?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Their key issues were as follows. First, the
                release of all the prisoners, which has been virtually
                accomplished. Secondly, a place in the negotiations and,
                ultimately, a place in the Executive Government of
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland. That has been accomplished. Thirdly, a
                reform of the criminal justice system, which was brought into
                effect to deal with their terrorism. Fourthly, the destruction
                of the RUC, which they clearly regarded as an abiding bulwark
                between the preservation of the rule of law and the success of
                armed violent political terrorism. All of these have been
                delivered under the guise of a new political dispensation in
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is alleged, in relation to the RUC, that
                in terms of both their name and their composition, they are
                unacceptable to the Northern&nbsp;Ireland community. History has
                a curious way of repeating itself. During the period from 1918
                to 1921 the Royal&nbsp;Irish&nbsp;Constabulary (RIC) policed the
                whole of Ireland. No complaint was made against the RIC in
                respect of the discharge of their ordinary functions, in respect
                of what is now described as ordinary policing of ordinary crime.
                Certainly no critisicm was directed at the RIC in terms of its
                religious composition, even though nearly 70% of its constables
                were Roman Catholic. What it did attract — just like the RUC—
                was vilification and the most intense propaganda, and its
                officers were murdered and mutilated. That was because they were
                utilised by the Government of the day to oppose violent
                political terrorism and as a means of bringing about political
                change.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have personal experience of working with
                the police in the administration of justice in
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland. In my experience there has never been any
                real complaint from the Nationalist community about the actions
                of the police in discharging their duties in respect of what
                might be called their ordinary criminal jurisdiction — the
                detection of rapists, child molesters, house-breakers, burglars
                and those guilty of common assault.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There has been little or no complaint at all
                from the Nationalist community. Indeed, as the opening
                paragraphs of the Patten Report make clear, the RUC has as good
                an acceptance level from the entire community as any police
                force on the continent of Europe — indeed better than some in
                many other places. Only in England and Scotland was the level of
                acceptance exceeded. Why, therefore, does the RUC suddenly
                become unacceptable? They are unacceptable because they have
                provided an effective police force, essentially against
                political terrorism.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I can draw comparisons between the police and
                the judiciary. The integrity, impartiality and fairness of the
                judiciary that, day after day, disposed of domestic law and
                divorces, that settled compensation claims for road accidents
                and factory injuries, that settled land disputes and commercial
                problems, was never questioned. The very same judges, when
                discharging their duty in dealing with crimes arising from
                political violence and terrorism, suddenly grew horns. Like the
                police, they became objects worthy of assassination, of murder
                and the targets for bombs.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The real issue is not one of policing. The
                real issue is political. The British Government have addressed
                that. In order to appease violent Republicanism and to keep
                bombs out of the City of London, they have had to come to terms
                with the demands of Sinn&nbsp;Féin/IRA. One of their demands,
                which still exists to this moment, is the complete destruction
                and removal of the RUC. Mrs&nbsp;Nelis made it clear that she is
                not interested in a reformed RUC. She wants its complete
                removal.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let me move on. The British Government set up
                the Patten Commission within the terms of reference agreed by
                the Ulster Unionist leadership. Its remit was clear. Indeed,
                Mr&nbsp;Ken&nbsp;Maginnis, the security spokesman for the Ulster
                Unionist Party, claimed on television that he personally had
                been responsible for the inclusion of the issue of RUC reform in
                the agreement. Be that as it may, having provided the remit for
                reform, that party has now transformed itself into the defender
                of the RUC.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, it is plain that the anger which
                Mr&nbsp;Maginnis and Mr&nbsp;Trimble demonstrated in the House
                of Commons last Wednesday did not relate to 99·9% of the
                reforms. It was occasioned by the fact that the Secretary of
                State, Mr&nbsp;Mandelson, did not even leave them the fig leaf
                of a cap badge to cover their nakedness. They were left with
                nothing to take back to the grass-roots Unionists who will
                ultimately judge them for what they have done.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Trimble and Mr&nbsp;Maginnis signed the
                agreement. Mr&nbsp;Maginnis has, apparently, been a very strong
                defender of the RUC throughout. Yet, in a revealing response to
                the assumed anger of Mr&nbsp;Maginness in the House of Commons
                Mr Mandelson pointed out what everyone knows. He said &quot;What
                you, Mr&nbsp;Maginnis, are saying in a rhetorical fashion for
                the benefit of your listeners is quite different from what you
                tell me in private.&quot; He was making it quite clear, as
                Matthew Parris observed in the columns of ‘The&nbsp;Times’,
                that the Mr&nbsp;Maginnis who talked behind closed doors about
                the future of the RUC was very different from the one who beat
                his chest and rent his garments on the Floor of the House of
                Commons.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let me move on to some of the remarks made by
                Mr&nbsp;Ervine. He said, in a very interesting speech, that the
                &quot;in your face&quot; behaviour of Sinn&nbsp;Féin in rubbing
                salt in the sensitivities and wounds of the Unionist community
                did not augur well for the success of this new dispensation. One
                of the salt-rubbing exercises is Sinn&nbsp;Féin’s failure to
                deliver one ounce of Semtex or a single bullet. Mr&nbsp;Ervine
                berated Sinn&nbsp;Féin. However, who has given Sinn&nbsp;Féin
                its best excuse for not decommissioning, if not the paramilitary
                groups that Mr&nbsp;Ervine fronts? They have made it clear that
                even if Sinn&nbsp;Féin were to decommission, they will not.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was also interested by Mr&nbsp;Ervine’s
                statement that he and his Colleague are alive today only because
                of the RUC. That is an interesting paradox. Many other people
                would not be alive today if the RUC had not intercepted Mr&nbsp;Ervine
                carrying a huge bomb which was presumably destined for some
                Nationalist area or premises.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have to be thankful to the RUC for a
                number of mercies — not only for preserving Mr&nbsp;Ervine for
                posterity but also for preserving the lives that he might have
                taken at an earlier date had it not been for its assiduous
                discharge of its duties.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have much experience of the RUC and the
                security forces in general. For over 20&nbsp;years I acted for
                members of the RUC and the military in relation to their claims
                for criminal compensation. That experience carved on my mind
                some factors which make it impossible for me to have anything
                whatever to do with Sinn&nbsp;Féin while it is inextricably
                linked with the IRA.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have memories of bombs being thrown over a
                wall where some Army dog handlers were working — of a young
                man in his twenties without legs or genitals screaming to his
                colleagues to shoot him. I have memories of many of those young
                men in their teens who were in the bus that was blown up on the
                way to the Omagh depot — men without legs, arms and eyes,
                maimed for the rest of their lives.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have an even more vivid memory of the bomb
                that went off at the bus station on &quot;bloody Friday&quot;
                — I was then a barrister practising in the law courts — when
                RUC men shovelled up the remains of human beings, including
                those of the teenage son of the clergyman Mr&nbsp;Parker, and
                put them in plastic bags. Mr&nbsp;Gerry&nbsp;Adams, the leader
                of Sinn&nbsp;Féin — I wish he were here today — was the
                commandant of the Belfast brigade at the time of the
                &quot;bloody Friday&quot; massacre.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I think of those at Whitecross and Teebane.
                They were innocent workmen — not partisans, not people
                involved in any way in terrorism — sent to their untimely ends
                by Sinn&nbsp;Féin, an organisation which the British Prime
                Minister and his Ministers state is still inextricably linked
                with the IRA. &quot;Inextricably linked&quot; means that they
                can never be separated, and yet Mr&nbsp;Trimble has sent a
                round-robin letter to some MPs protesting that because they are
                unreconstructed terrorists, Mr&nbsp;Adams and Mr&nbsp;McGuinness
                should not be afforded the facilities of the House of Commons.
                That allows Sinn&nbsp;Féin to make the riposte &quot;Well, why
                in those circumstances are you sitting with us in the
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland Executive?&quot; Those are matters which
                the leadership of the Ulster Unionist Party will have to
                resolve.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Decommissioning is intimately connected to
                the issue of policing. Calls have been made for a civilian,
                unarmed police force. Certainly that is an aspiration of many.
                But can there be such a police force while vast arsenals of
                weapons of destruction — weapons that have been used to murder
                over 2,000 of the 3,000-plus people who have been killed in
                these troubles — are still in the hands of those who carried
                out those executions? Since the alleged ceasefire, these people
                have continued to commit acts of murder. They are attempting to
                murder people like Martin&nbsp;McGartland, and they murdered
                Charles&nbsp;Bennett and Mr&nbsp;Kearney. They are beating,
                intimidating and murdering — and we talk about recruitment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In its comments on the Patten proposals the
                Police Authority for Northern&nbsp;Ireland, which is composed of
                Catholics and Protestants and has a Catholic Chairman, made it
                absolutely clear that, in its view, the change of name would
                make virtually no difference to recruitment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Everyone knows the reason for the low
                percentage of Roman Catholics in both the RUC and the UDR. Roman
                Catholics who joined were put in danger of death, and those in
                the Nationalist communities who talked about joining were
                intimidated and threatened, and this extended not just to those
                people themselves but to their families who were boycotted and
                sent to Coventry.</p>

                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy First Minister (Mr Mallon):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The new TSN, as developed by the direct-rule
                Administration, aims to tackle social need and social exclusion.
                Draft plans were developed to address inequality and deprivation
                by refocussing resources within existing programmes towards
                those with the greatest social needs. The poorest people, groups
                and areas are identified using objective measures of need such
                as benefit dependancy or area-based measures of deprivation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Following the current consultation on these
                draft plans, Ministers will consider them and the consultation
                responses. The Executive Committee will then consider the new
                TSN policy, including the implementation and monitoring of the
                action plans.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank my ministerial Friend for his answer.
                Will he take into consideration the fact that the new targeting
                social needs document does not contain plans that are any
                different from those which existed to address social deprivation
                in isolated wards in particular council areas?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will the Minister undertake a review of that
                situation? Under the Robson indicators, the continuation of that
                policy will simply mean, for instance, that enhanced financial
                facilities for inward investors will not be available in those
                socially deprived areas.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy First Minister:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Member for his question. As he
                knows, the draft plans are out for consultation. All views
                received during the consultation period will be considered
                carefully and analysed, and they will include the concerns he
                has expressed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Robson&nbsp;indicators were developed to
                identify areas which are subject to multiple deprivation. They
                take into account pockets of deprivation, and they are more
                sensitive to local factors than some of the previous indicators.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I readily accept that the
                Robson&nbsp;indicators are based on figures from the 1991
                census. However, statisticians have identified ways in which
                they can be used in conjunction with other measures to take
                account of the changes since then. Also, consideration has
                already been given to future measures of multiple deprivation
                based on the 2001 census data.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Increasing use has also been made of
                administrative data in particular fields which can provide
                highly accurate local information.</p>

                defined to ensure that pockets of deprivation within otherwise
                affluent wards should not be disadvantaged in the review?</p>

                one of the problems of the very nature of TSN. It is a matter
                with which we have to grapple, but we must ensure that whatever
                measures we use, they will be adequate to identify specific
                areas of need in areas that are generally more affluent.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is there that the effects of targeting
                social need are most beneficial and, indeed, most needed.</p>

                First Minister’s reply to Mr&nbsp;McGrady. I had intended to
                pursue the question of the Robson indices further. If one must
                wait until the year&nbsp;2001 for the census, one needs some
                system to analyse deprivation now as opposed to waiting until
                then to draw up plans on the basis of the census figures, since
                current figures are already obsolete.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is obvious that we must wait until 2001
                for the new census and those figures. However, I feel that there
                are sufficient indicators from the previous census, from other
                sources of statistical information and, indeed, from the
                experiences of the various Government Departments. The
                Departments have put forward their proposals in the draft action
                plans. They are based on experience as well as statistical
                information. The combination of the three — the present
                method, the method which will be in use after 2001 and, indeed,
                the good sense and judgement of each Department — when taken
                together, will contribute to addressing the problems in this
                area properly.</p>

                many of which are in upland regions unsuitable for efficient
                dairy farming. Does the Deputy First Minister agree that this

                with a similar problem. It is not my desire to stray into
                matters agricultural, as it is not my brief. However, if I have
                misunderstood the thrust of the Member’s question, he may
                correct me. It seems to be that simply because of the
                predominance of disadvantage in urban areas, we sometimes forget
                that there is also substantial disadvantage in rural areas. As
                someone from a rural area, I will certainly not succumb to the
                temptation to ignore areas of deprivation in rural areas,

                opportunity to apologise to the Minister of Agriculture and
                Rural Development for the embarrassing actions of his office?
                Will he stop playing party politics with the lives and

                national fiscal policies on fuel excise duty on the Northern
                Ireland economy was raised with the Prime Minister at the
                British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference on
                17&nbsp;December&nbsp;1999. As the difficulty stems from
                differences between fiscal policies in Britain and Ireland, the
                matter is now on the work plan of the British-Irish
                Intergovernmental Conference. Separately, representations have
                been made to the Treasury on a number of occasions about fiscal
                policy, and a meeting involving the First Minister and the
                Deputy First Minister has been sought.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy First Minister referred to one of
                the areas that gives me great concern, but there are a number of
                other areas — for example, the proposed tax on aggregates, the
                climate change levy and air passenger duty. Our peripheral
                location leaves us in a disadvantaged position. If we are
                seriously to adopt a system of joined-up government, it is
                important that the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy
                First Minister take these issues seriously, and go directly to
                the Treasury and attempt to get some form of abatement for the
                people of Northern Ireland.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy First Minister:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I fully agree with the Member. It is a matter
                of how we can do that most effectively. In relation to many of
                these issues, representation has already been made by at least
                one Minister of the new Administration. The matter was raised by
                the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister at the
                British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, and it will be
                followed up in a meeting that I hope we will have very soon with
                the Treasury. The Member is quite right to say that it does
                affect a number of issues, the climate change levy being one of
                them. Corporation tax is another, and the differential in fuel
                is something that we in the North of Ireland know is causing
                great difficulties. These are matters that can only be resolved
                at Treasury level, and we are making representations in
                Westminster and Dublin to ensure that people in the North of
                Ireland are not penalised as a result of policies in either
                place, or both.</p>

                region in particular has suffered adversely as a result of the
                gross disparity in excise duties, and that it is therefore very
                important not to introduce the climate levy change to Northern
                Ireland as it will only add to our difficulties?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy First Minister:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I take the Member’s point that, though such
                may not have been intended, there are adverse impacts, which are
                most acute in the border areas. We referred to them in our
                report on the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference. The
                First Minister and I raised the issue at that meeting, which was
                attended by the Prime Minister and the Taoiseach, and we will
                continue to draw it to the attention of the Treasury. The
                proposed levy could have very serious effects on Northern
                Ireland. It could increase electricity prices, which are already
                substantially higher than those in Britain, and this could
                significantly inhibit our industrial competitiveness.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Furthermore, such an increase could frustrate
                current efforts to secure private sector investment for the
                development of the gas infrastructure in the north-west and the
                south-east, including any discussions between the North of
                Ireland and the Republic of Ireland on gas interconnection.</p>

                Southern counterpart because of the punitive taxation of diesel
                fuel in this part of the United Kingdom? What measures have the
                First Minister and the Deputy First Minister taken to make the

                collectively and individually with the Road Haulage Association
                on this matter. We have had discussions with various people
                connected with the industry, and two weeks ago there was a
                meeting on the matter between Members of Parliament from
                Northern Ireland and the Treasury Minister in Westminster.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am very aware of the problems facing
                Northern Ireland retailers as a result of the difference in fuel
                prices between Northern Ireland and the South. The differential
                results from the level of fuel excise duty levied in the United
                Kingdom, which is higher than that in the Republic of Ireland,
                and also from the strength of sterling against the punt. These
                matters are outside the control of the Executive Committee and
                are primarily the responsibility of the Treasury. Nevertheless,
                as I made clear in a previous answer, the issue has been raised
                with the Prime Minister, and we will continue to raise the
                problems that result from this and other matters.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Northern Ireland Executive Committee
                continues to explore the options available to mitigate the
                difficulties faced by Northern Ireland petrol retailers and will
                continue to keep UK Ministers aware of the problems facing local
                industry, particularly during the run-up to the next Budget. As
                someone who lives in a border area, I see the difficulties that
                the retailers, the haulage industry and many other people who
                are dependent on them for their livelihood are having daily.</p>

                creating a system of Government by political patronage?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy First Minister:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I refer the Member to the d’Hondt system,
                which we spent two years deciding upon. We all knew the
                implications of that system and how they would be applied in
                this Assembly. The system of government here is therefore quite
                different from that in Westminster. In Westminster there is
                single-party government. In Northern Ireland there is a forced
                coalition involving all the major parties. The use of d’Hondt
                determines how ministerial posts and Committee chairmanships are
                decided.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to the second part of the
                question, the process of the scrutiny of Government expenditure
                by the Public Accounts Committee in the United Kingdom was
                established in the nineteenth century — in the time of
                Gladstone — under UK parliamentary convention and has been
                followed since then. The main Opposition party has always
                appointed the Chairperson of the Public Accounts Committee. This
                custom and practice has no constitutional imperative, but it is
                perceived in the United Kingdom Parliament as enhancing the
                integrity and impartiality of the Committee.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is no Public Accounts Committee in the
                National Assembly for Wales. There is an Audit Committee. The
                rules of that Assembly say that the Chairperson of the Audit
                Committee should not come from the majority party, but that, it
                seems, would not preclude the appointment of a Chairperson from
                a party represented in the Government if it were not the
                majority party.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The public accounts arrangements in the
                Scottish Parliament mirror those of the Welsh Assembly. A member
                of a majority party is precluded from appointment to the
                chairmanship of the Audit Committee. In Dáil Éireann the main
                Opposition party holds the chairmanship. At Westminster and in
                Dáil Éireann the chairmanship of the Public Accounts
                Committees is drawn from the main Opposition party by
                convention. In Scotland and Wales, only the members of a
                majority party are precluded from chairing the Audit Committees.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must remember the distinction between a
                majority party in Westminster and a larger party here. That is
                where the crucial distinction lies.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The final part of the question refers to the
                First Minister and the Deputy First Minister governing by
                patronage. We do not govern; we try to serve. What is referred
                to as patronage is what is contained in the d’Hondt system
                that we all agreed.</p>

                anti-skid surfacing at the Reubens Glen junction. Work to widen
                a stretch of the road at Hillview farm is due to commence in the
                next few weeks, and improvements to road signing and lining are
                planned for the year 2000-01. Subject to the availability of
                funds, it is proposed to carry out further minor road works to
                improve this substandard section of the road over the next five
                years. The Roads Service has plans to replace Carland Bridge and
                realign one mile of adjacent carriageway. This scheme is
                included in the six-to-15-year forward planning schedule.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am well aware of the number of serious

                Friend Mr&nbsp;McCrea, the Member for Mid Ulster, has raised the
                issue with me on several occasions. The House will be aware
                that, sadly, it was on this section of the road that the niece
                of the Minister of Finance and Personnel died. Unfortunately,
                this section of road has a high accident record. During the
                period 1994-98, 30&nbsp;injury accidents were recorded, four of
                them fatal. Unfortunately, there is no distinct pattern to the
                road accidents or to where they take place. However, these are
                issues that the Department always keeps under review, and it is
                in our forward plan for work to be carried out in addition to
                the immediate work that I have already mentioned.</p>

                constituency of the road running from Armagh north to Coleraine.
                It was not given a high priority in the document. This route
                carries heavier traffic than the A4&nbsp;east-west road.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I shall take several of the points the hon
                Lady has made. With regard to the regional strategic framework,
                we have not got the final framework document. The Member and her
                Colleagues will no doubt have made the point during the public
                examination that greater emphasis should be placed on this road.
                I am concerned to see in my briefing that on one part of the
                road there is an advisory speed limit of 5&nbsp;mph. That is
                hardly what one expects on a significant trunk road.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to the timing of improvements,
                the Roads Service is happy to make improvements to any road in
                Northern Ireland that are felt to be desirable, though we must
                have the necessary finance. The more the Assembly gives to the
                Department for Regional Development for its roads budget, the
                more work I can do, and I am glad to have enlisted the support
                of the hon Lady in that struggle.</p>

                about the terrible carnage on our roads and, in particular, on
                the stretch of the A29 between Moneymore and Desertmartin. The
                Minister has said that his Department may be able to get finance
                from elsewhere. The Department of Health and Social Services and
                Public Safety is also very concerned about the carnage on our
                roads, and I therefore ask the Minister to work with the
                Minister of Health, whether on finance or on planning, to tackle
                this terrible problem.</p>

                responsible for road safety. There are targets to significantly
                reduce the carnage on our roads. And this is not a matter simply
                for Departments or elected representatives; it is for the whole
                community to take all the necessary steps to ensure safer
                driving. It is up to the Government to ensure that there are

                future investment, will the Minister try to make changes to the
                document with the aim of promoting more inward investment west
                of the Bann to make up for the job losses in Unipork in the next

                dealing with the A29. I will deal with the regional strategic
                framework, and it is important to point out that the draft plan
                was subjected to public examination. In the next few weeks I
                expect to receive the report from that public examination, and I
                hope to publish it as soon as possible for further consulation.
                The Assembly’s Regional Development Committee will also want
                to report on it. It would be premature for me to remark on what
                the outcome should be before I have seen both the public
                examination report and heard the views of the Committee.</p>

                Since he is aware that traffic speed is reduced to five mph, can
                he assure the Assembly that an attempt will be made to bring
                forward the plan for improving that section of road so that we
                will not have to wait another 15 years?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I said that Carland Bridge was on the
                six-to-15-year forward planning schedule. Perhaps the Member
                should not be so pessimistic as to assume that it will not
                happen before year 15. He argues that it should be brought
                forward. Of course, we have to use some objective criteria to
                determine priorities, and I will be happy at any stage, as will
                the Committee, to examine whether these have been properly
                applied in any case. But the Department is currently working to
                the six-to-15-year plan, and it will depend largely on resources

                which lies there and would give the sort of figures that the

                be taking every step to increase the use of our railways. I must
                point out to the Member that we have had such serious
                underfunding in transport that, excluding the railway line
                between Belfast and Dublin, most of the rolling stock is, to say
                the least, antiquated. It will require substantial investment,
                and until there is that kind of investment, it will be an uphill
                struggle to encourage people to use our existing rolling stock.
                So, once again, we come back to the one issue that is central to
                roads, water and transport and that is an increase in resources
                for the Department.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">May I remind the Minister that when the
                Chancellor announced the £12.5 million aid package for the A5,
                he did not realise that a backlog of work, amounting to £35
                million, had built up in the western region. To assist us in the
                north-west, and particularly in west Tyrone, we must have a
                proper infrastructure in place. In west Tyrone we do not have
                ports or airports so it is vital to have our main trunk road,
                the A5, which runs through Ballygawley, Omagh and Strabane to
                Derry, brought up to the necessary standard. Only yesterday one
                of my constituents, a young woman, was killed on the A5 between
                Derry and Strabane — my sympathy goes to her family. I ask the
                Minister to make the A5 his number-one priority.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I suspect that the supplementary question was
                prepared before the answer to the main Question was given to the
                Assembly. I have indicated that the Department deems the A5 to
                be such a priority and that we are proceeding with the
                Leckpatrick element. Effectively, there were four schemes for
                the A5 in the Chancellor’s initiative. Apart from Leckpatrick,
                there was the Strabane bypass (stage two), the Newtownstewart
                bypass and the Omagh throughpass (stage three). These schemes
                are currently being progressed through the various design and
                public consultation processes, which include the publication of
                direction orders, environmental statements and vesting orders,
                all of which require public consultation and may even result in
                a public inquiry.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The timescale for the implementation of these
                schemes is dependent on both the successful completion of the
                necessary statutory procedures and the availability of funds.
                The Roads Service is, however, pressing ahead with the
                completion of the statutory procedures for each scheme so that
                contracts can be awarded as soon as the finance has been
                confirmed. The direction orders and environmental statements for
                the Strabane, Newtownstewart and Omagh schemes are expected to
                be published within the next few weeks, while the Leckpatrick
                scheme is ready to start.</p>

                an essential element. Because of the EC’s challenge to the
                British Airport Authority’s golden share, clearly we want to
                be satisfied that any golden share proposal contained in a
                privatisation package would ensure, in the long term, that the
                public interest was safeguarded. I can assure the Member for
                North Belfast that I will not recommend to the Assembly any
                privatisation of Belfast port unless the public interest is

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker, with your permission I will take
                these two questions together.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The current criteria for salting roads in
                West Tyrone are those which are applied consistently across
                Northern Ireland. They provide that main through routes carrying
                1500 vehicles or more per day are salted during wintry
                conditions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition, some routes that carry more than
                1,000 vehicles per day are salted provided that there are
                special circumstances, such as sharp bends or gradients. I
                appreciate the concerns about this matter. Gritting costs
                approximately £4.5 million each year and deals with the roads
                that carry 80% of all traffic. Any significant increase in
                gritting could only be achieved by diverting resources from
                elsewhere in the roads’ budget. I will, therefore, be
                consulting the Regional Development Committee about the priority
                which this aspect of roads expenditure should have and in
                particular, about the weighting to be given to rural areas.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Gallagher:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Minister for his response. As he
                has outlined, the setting of the criteria is a complicated
                matter. I would draw the Minister’s attention to the
                Comptroller and Auditor General’s report a few months ago,
                which indicated that a mere 20% of roads in rural areas in the
                west of the Province were included in the gritting programme.
                That is a significantly lower percentage than applies to other
                areas in the North of Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will the Minister accept — and I speak as a
                member of the Health, Social Services and Public Safety
                Committee — that a great deal can be done to improve safety at
                very little cost? As he has referred to costs several times I
                suspect that his advisers are still in direct-rule mode —
                concentrating on costs above everything else. In the new
                situation, does the Minister agree that Roads Service policy
                needs to move from &quot;savings first&quot; to &quot;safety
                first&quot;?</p>

                underlying his question that the gritting of roads is a safety
                matter and that other areas of expenditure by the Department are
                not safety related. Many of those matters are safety related,
                and difficult choices have to be made.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am aware of the issue, particularly in
                Fermanagh. I visited the council there, and it was brought to my

                specifically at whether some weighting should be attached to
                rural and remote areas when deciding whether roads should be
                gritted.</p>

                is he aware that in much of rural West Tyrone many of the minor
                roads are awash with water because of the flow of surface water
                from adjoining lands? Department of Environment roads and
                drainage officials tell me that it is a common problem. Ground
                drainage, which is essential, was carried out 15 to 20 years ago
                under grant schemes, but much of the pipe work is silted, and
                the culvert apertures may be inadequate. Therefore, much of the
                salt, at £22 a tonne, does not even last 22&nbsp;minutes on
                some of the roads. Will the Minister take this concern up with
                other Ministers to stop the roads of West Tyrone from becoming
                burns and sheughs?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am glad to hear Ulster-Scots being used. I
                say to my hon Friend that there are drainage-related problems,
                and the possibility of salt being washed off the road is one of
                them. It is also frustrating for officials that when salt is put
                down, rain washes it away. There is more than one way of having
                salt washed off a road, with the consequent waste. I have asked
                officials to place a very useful leaflet that has been prepared
                by the Department and gives an explanation of a number of
                gritting problems in Members’ pigeonholes.</p>

                major problem that needs to be dealt with. However, if we could
                deal with 90% of the roads and have them salted, as opposed to
                80%, the additional 10% would actually double the cost to road
                users.</p>

                difficulties.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Within the overall strategy is a wide range
                of specific planning policies. These deal with different types
                of developments: single houses in the open countryside, villages
                and rural settlements, ribboning, and so on. Overall, cognisance
                is taken of the need to protect the countryside, but we also
                have to deal with the present huge demand for houses there.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs Carson has referred to hamlets. We do not
                oppose them; in fact, we welcome them. There is a hierarchy of
                settlements — the hamlet, the village, the town, the large
                town and the city. We seek at all times to provide for a vibrant
                rural community which will strike a balance between development
                in and protection of the countryside.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We used to enjoy challenging a Minister who
                came here from his 6,000-acre or 7,000-acre holding in England
                and laid down rural policies for us, but perhaps we will not get
                the chance to do that now.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are talking about people versus places. I
                have talked before about the clearly defined rural applicant —
                the applicant who wants to live on the farm. Not all farms are
                80 or 100 acres.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It could be a 30-acre farm, but if a father
                or mother wishes to give a site to a son or daughter in a rural
                area, we have to do something to accommodate them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are forcing migration on rural people. I
                know that the Minister is new to his post and probably has the
                same problems in Fermanagh that we have in South Down. This
                problem must be dealt with. Perhaps this is an opportune time,
                now that the Newry area plan, in my case, is coming into being.
                I will be making the strongest representations in that regard
                and seeking the Minister’s support for rural applicants.</p>

                endeavour to provide where we can, taking into account the issue

                Minister responsible for the environment, conducted a review of
                quarrying on Black Mountain. This was, on one hand, to minimise
                the environmental damage being caused by the quarry and, on the

                10&nbsp;years and the probability of at least 20 more years of
                quarrying on the mountain, to carry out a review aimed at

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I intend to bring a Bill before the Assembly
                as soon as possible, after consultation with the Environment
                Committee. This will, of course, be subject to the Executive

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Is the Minister aware that the general public
                and livestock have been endangered by inadequately controlled
                wolves in my constituency of East Antrim and by big cats in
                other parts of Northern Ireland?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Foster:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I sympathise fully with the owner of the
                sheep recently attacked by timber wolves in the Larne area,
                which is in Mr Beggs’s constituency. I am also aware of the
                concerns of local people about the keeping of big cats in the
                Seskinore area, which is in Mr Gibson’s constituency. I am
                pleased that the animals in question are being cared for by the
                USPCA at its compound at Benvarden.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At present my Department has no real power to
                stop people from keeping such animals, and so I call on owners
                to act responsibly. In Great Britain the keeping of dangerous
                wild animals by private individuals is controlled under the
                Dangerous Wild Animals Act 1976. We have no such legislation.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Dr Ian Paisley:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker, you remind us of examples from
                another place, but today at Question Time most of the
                supplementary questions were read. Secondly, with regard to
                supplementary questions, statements were made prior to questions
                being asked. We only got to number 6 on the last page. If
                Members have urgent questions we are not going to reach them. Do
                you rule against the reading of supplementary questions?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was interesting that some Ministers were
                reading replies to supplementaries, which they were supposed to
                have just heard. One Minister’s private secretary was going
                around those asking questions and saying &quot;Please tell me
                your supplementary&quot;. That is not good parliamentary
                procedure. If it continues, these Question Times will not give
                Members the information they need.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member raises a number of important
                questions. For me and, I suspect, for Members and Ministers,
                there is an element of learning. We will take our time to get
                into the way of it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members at least ought not to have to read
                supplementaries. In other places even reading speeches is not
                the thing to do. But Members ought at least to be able to
                memorise supplementary questions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With reference to the making of statements,
                it is not unreasonable that the preface — and by that I mean
                the first part of a sentence — might make a statement that
                places the question in context, but Members should move on
                quickly to the question. That question ought to be a question,
                and not something with two or three parts. The asking of the
                centipede questions that one sometimes gets, with hundreds of
                legs, is not the proper way to go about things.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the House of Commons this past week one
                Minister took 11 minutes to respond to a question. Madam Speaker
                made her displeasure known, not only to the Minister and to the
                House but also to the Members whose questions were neither clear
                nor to the point.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Everyone here is learning, and we do not get
                it right immediately. We try to keep to a limited number of
                questions, and the shorter the questions and the responses, the
                more questions Members may ask. Then we may get beyond question
                4 or 5 or 6, which we have been unable to do until now. I value
                the Member’s intervention. We will all keep it in mind.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During last week’s discussion, I was struck
                by the words of Bishop&nbsp;Mehaffey, the Church of Ireland
                Bishop of Derry. I agree with him that many elements in the
                Nationalist tradition have failed to appreciate the sense of
                hurt and loss felt in Unionist circles over the Government’s
                decision to implement, almost in full, the Patten Report. Nor do
                they understand the Protestant — and I use the word advisedly
                — sense of policing which differs from the concept of policing
                held by most Nationalists.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The first duty of the police is to uphold law
                and order; its purpose is not to be owned by any section of the
                community — by the Unionist tradition any more than by the
                Nationalist tradition.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When I spoke in the Ulster Hall in support of
                the RUC, I made the point that the name of the force was hated
                by those who had reason to fear retribution for their murderous
                activities. It would be a shame if the SDLP were to find common
                cause with them today — I hope this does not occur.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Since that rally, there has been a new factor
                in the equation. The most cherished award for civilian bravery
                — the George&nbsp;Cross — has been awarded to the Royal
                Ulster Constabulary. The designation &quot;Royal&quot; was also
                vouchsafed by the sovereign. Neither award can be removed by
                political sleight of hand. Would it be right for the RUC to be
                treated in the same fashion as the traitor Anthony&nbsp;Blunt?
                The presentation of the George&nbsp;Cross will be an
                extraordinary occasion.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But will the present plan proceed? Even in
                its attenuated state, the Lords threw out the jury Bill last
                week. I know that some will say that Blair has a 170-seat
                majority, but if the Lords show the same virility over Patten’s
                plan and reject its worst features, will the Government want yet
                another battle with them? We shall have to wait and see.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Surely even Patten’s power, which we have
                already seen has had the effect of reprieving his dogs Whiskey
                and Soda from quarantine, must not be invulnerable to the
                persuasive power of those who see the injustice and obeisance to
                hatred which the name change represents.</p>

                the UUP to withdraw from the Executive. If they feel so strongly

                the courage of their convictions and take the lead?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While I support the spirit of today’s
                motion, we must understand what it represents is an attempt to
                rend asunder the middle ground in this Assembly, to create a
                split between the UUP and the SDLP and to undermine confidence
                in the new arrangements. I urge the SDLP not to fall into that
                trap but instead to heed the advice of the Catholic bishops and
                show some generosity of spirit. It can best do this by
                addressing Msgr&nbsp;Faul’s suggestion of a dual name — a
                name that both traditions can feel comfortable with and identify
                with. Any lack of confidence in the police on the part of
                Nationalists should not be replaced by a lack of confidence in
                another section of the community.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As it stands, the Patten Report in its
                entirety has not received cross-community approval. That should
                be no less of a concern than if the situation were reversed. It
                would be folly for constitutional Nationalists to forget that
                the agreement talks of a police service acceptable to all —
                Unionists as well as Nationalists. We on these Benches have
                taken on board the need for police reform and a changed security

                SDLP has never had common cause with paramilitaries of any kind,
                nor will it in the future.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The debate has been disappointing. I was
                dismayed by some of the remarks by Unionist&nbsp;Members,
                particularly among the DUP. Perhaps that is not surprising. The
                reality is that there seems to be a blind failure by the DUP and
                the general body of Unionism to realise that police reform is
                essential to our future. The DUP made no attempt to admit that
                there was something wrong with the way in which the RUC was
                constituted, that it was not representative and that it was far
                from being an effective policing service.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The criticisms of the SDLP and, indeed, of
                Seamus&nbsp;Mallon who acted for many years as our justice
                spokesman, were unwarranted. The SDLP has given consistent
                leadership on the policing debate. It has consistently
                criticised the RUC and policing in Northern&nbsp;Ireland. It has
                highlighted the inadequacy of the RUC as a policing service and
                its failure to provide effective and representative policing in
                Northern Ireland. That case has been consistently put over the
                past 25&nbsp;years. The Patten&nbsp;Report vindicated our
                position because it recognised the inadequacy of the RUC.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our position has nothing to do with
                Sinn&nbsp;Féin, which has adopted an unrealistic stance in
                calling for the disbandment of the RUC. We want to see a
                transformation of policing in Northern&nbsp;Ireland through the
                implementation of the radical policing reforms which Patten
                represents. Patten provides an opportunity and a challenge for
                all Members. Our reputations as politicians could be determined
                by how we respond to this issue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Naturally, we are divided in the Assembly and
                have different political points of view. But I suspect that we
                are united by a common vision of creating a police service that
                would naturally attract and enjoy, rather than command, the
                loyalty and support of the widest possible spectrum of our
                society.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Much has been said today about the gardaí.
                It is useful to look at the history of the gardaí which was
                formed in the midst of a civil war in the Irish Free State. It
                managed successfully to establish itself as a legitimate police
                service despite the political turmoil of the early 1920s. Part
                of its success was due to the decision to abandon guns for
                normal duties and to create a truly civilian police service for
                the whole community. As Commissioner&nbsp;Staines, the first
                Commissioner of the gardaí, said</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The civic guard will succeed not by
                force of arms, or numbers, but on their moral authority as
                servants of the people.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that the new policing service will
                learn that lesson and create a moral authority as servants of
                all the people of Northern&nbsp;Ireland, irrespective of their
                political viewpoints.</p>

                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is little doubt that throughout its
                history the RUC was not acceptable to the Nationalist community,
                and the Hunt report illustrated that. At its highest, Catholic
                membership of the RUC was at 11%, very little different from the
                level during the course of the troubles.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">May I end by saying that an American police
                expert who visited me recently was of the opinion that Patten
                was a blueprint for the policing of any society in today’s
                world. That is a great tribute to Commissioner&nbsp;Patten and
                his esteemed colleagues such as Senator&nbsp;Maurice&nbsp;Hayes,
                Miss&nbsp;Kathleen&nbsp;O’Toole and
                Mr&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;Smith&nbsp;QC. These are men and women of
                learning and wisdom to whom we owe a great debt of gratitude.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Dr William McCrea:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The 19&nbsp;January&nbsp;2000 was a dark day
                for the people of Ulster. On that day the gravy train of
                concessions to the IRA continued firmly on the Belfast Agreement
                track, and the gallant members of the RUC and the RUCR were
                bundled together to be led as lambs to the slaughter. The
                Secretary of State had the audacity to tell the House of Commons</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;In the last 30&nbsp;years, the Royal
                Ulster Constabulary has faced demands completely unlike those
                faced by any other force in the United Kingdom or, indeed,
                elsewhere in the developed world. I would like to place on
                record the Government’s deep admiration for the courage,
                resilience and professionalism with which the RUC has met these
                challenges. The accounts that I have heard of personal tragedy,
                pain and loss in the RUC family are profoundly moving and
                humbling. Three hundred and two officers have been killed, and
                many thousands injured. We all owe the RUC a huge debt of
                gratitude.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This all sounds wonderful, and with such a
                recommendation one would have expected a different announcement
                from the one that followed that statement by the Secretary of
                State. He said that, in spite of its professionalism, courage
                and resilience, it had to go. And not only did it have to go,
                but every vestige of it had to go too — the badge and every
                other recognisable RUC symbol.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One must ask this question: how did we ever
                get ourselves into this mess? The answer lies with those yes-men
                of the Belfast Agreement. Mr&nbsp;Ken&nbsp;Maginnis claimed that
                he had achieved an outstanding success in getting the police
                issue on to the agenda — it was not there, but he got it on.
                Now, having got it on and having read the Patten Report, he
                tells us that he is totally dismayed because the RUC has been
                degraded, demeaned and denigrated by the Secretary of State.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is interesting. Did the Secretary of
                State not say in the House of Commons that the security
                spokesman for the UUP was using rhetoric in the House and that
                his remarks were more hostile in public than those he made in
                private. In other words, he says one thing in public and another
                thing in private. That was an interesting confession by the
                Secretary of State.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Then Mr&nbsp;Trimble was asked about the RUC.
                He referred to the police controversy as</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;a very difficult issue that is bound to
                cause problems.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He said</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Many people feel — and I share the
                feelings myself — that we did not get the mixture just right
                yesterday.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What is he talking about? Whom does he think
                he is talking about? They &quot;did not get the mixture just
                right&quot;. But he says that he will continue to work at it —
                put a little more salt into the wounds of those who are already
                hurting. Concerning the &quot;mixture&quot; that Mr&nbsp;Trimble
                says &quot;we did not get just right yesterday&quot;, an RUC
                member whose legs were blown off in a booby-trap bomb said</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The dirty tramps. They paid no heed to
                our feelings, but then I always suspected they would get their
                way. It has been concession after concession after concession.
                It seems that the bomb and the bullet win every time.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We call this a peace process, but in reality
                what is it? It is a piece-by-piece process on the road to
                Dublin, a process that will destroy not only the
                United&nbsp;Kingdom but everything that is recognised as being
                good and decent in our society, such as the RUC and the RUCR.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We should not be surprised when
                Sir&nbsp;John&nbsp;Gorman tells us that the Ulster Unionists are
                going to take a stand for the RUC. That will be interesting.
                What about the stand they took for the Ulster Special
                Constabulary? What about the stand they took for the Ulster
                Defence Regiment? Is this the type of stand that is going to be
                taken for the RUC?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I heard others talking pious words today. It
                was interesting to hear Sinn&nbsp;Féin talking —indeed, the
                Member for Foyle spoke. What she did not tell us, when she said
                that the RUC must go, was that her son was sentenced to
                imprisonment for trying to murder an RUC man. The gun did not
                fire. Also, she did not say that her husband was a member of the
                UDR. We ought to be proud of the RUC. It is time for Ministers
                to do the decent thing and resign. The First Minister should
                give the lead — his resignation would really mean something.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr G Kelly:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A Chathaoirligh, I see they are calling for
                resignations again.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is no surprise that the DUP is defending
                the RUC — it is a Unionist force and has been since partition.
                It was put in as an armed political force to represent Unionism
                and to be used against Nationalists and Republicans. There is a
                myth — and the DUP and other Unionists are in denial of this
                — that the RUC served the whole community in the North. I
                would like to know where that myth came from. From the inception
                of partition the make-up has been 90% Protestant.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is another myth which says that
                Catholics were intimidated out of the RUC, or were intimidated
                from joining it. Again, I refer to the statistics. Well before
                the last 30&nbsp;years that people keep referring to, the
                figures were very consistent. From the inception of this
                statelet the make-up of the RUC has been 90% Protestant.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It used emergency laws during the whole of
                that time. Incidentally, one of the South African Presidents,
                before the end of apartheid, said that he would give up all of
                his past laws, and emergency law, for one clause in the
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland Emergency Provisions Act. That is the type
                of emergency law and paramilitary policing that we have been
                faced with over the past 80&nbsp;years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The DUP and the Ulster Unionists deny this.
                They have never even admitted doing anything wrong politically,
                never mind the RUC. They have come through a series of
                organisations including the RUC Reserve and the UDR, all of
                which were sectarian in their make-up. They were looked upon by
                Nationalists — and there is a lot of evidence to support this
                view — as a very political police force over that time. The
                DUP and Ulster Unionists are in denial because they do not think
                that anything ever went wrong here, so why should they want the
                RUC done away with?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The RUC has been criticised and condemned by
                many reputable human rights groups, and we cannot ignore that.
                Whatever I may say about it, why ignore those groups? They are
                the European Court of Human Rights, the United Nations Human
                Rights Committee, the United Nations Committee on Torture, the
                United Nations Special Rapporteur, the European Parliament’s
                International Relations Committee, the International Relations
                Committee of the US Congress and Amnesty International, among
                others.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a strong desire, as shown by the
                Good Friday Agreement, for a real policing service that will
                serve the whole community. That desire — and I have listened
                to the DUP — is greater in the Nationalist heartland because
                they are the people who have suffered its lack. The desire for a
                policing service is very genuine and important. It was an
                essential part of the Good Friday Agreement that we all signed
                up to — except the DUP, of course. The litmus test for any
                police service that may emerge lies not with me or with anybody
                sitting on these Benches. The litmus test is whether young
                people in Ardoyne, or Ballymurphy, or the Bogside, or South
                Armagh believe that this is a policing service that they can
                join.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Why did Catholic youth not join the RUC?
                Because the combined force of the RUC and the British Army has
                been directly involved in 360&nbsp;deaths, half of them
                civilians. No member of the RUC has ever been convicted of
                murder in all that time.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is evidence of collusion between the
                RUC and Loyalist death squads, and the sheer volume of personal
                details that have been released can only be guessed at. We have
                documentation that proves collusion through a number of
                informers and agents such as Brian&nbsp;Nelson, who is probably
                the best-known of them. The Pat&nbsp;Finucane killing; the
                Robert&nbsp;Hamill killing; and the Rosemary&nbsp;Nelson killing
                all show the depth and extent of the collusion. The famous wall
                of silence within the RUC in the face of belated inquiries shows
                again what type of organisation it has been and why Catholics do
                not join it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are all sorts of reasons why the RUC is
                not acceptable and why Nationalists should not join it. Through
                the Stalker and Sampson inquiries we learned that the RUC was
                trained by the SAS.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Birnie:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many of the original 175 Patten Report
                proposals make sense. That is not surprising, since roughly 160
                of them were anticipated by previous studies, such as the RUC’s
                own fundamental review. However, there are two basic flaws in
                both the Patten Report and the Secretary of State’s recent
                statement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, there is the assertion that the
                proposals follow on from the terms of the Belfast Agreement.
                Secondly, there is the idea that the changes now proposed are
                either necessary or sufficient to engineer the wider community
                acceptance of policing that all of us here wish for.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will deal initially with the relationship
                between the Belfast Agreement and the Patten Report. It has been
                asserted that there is a strong link between the two, but the
                Belfast Agreement simply laid down the terms of reference for
                the Commission. The final recommendations do not follow
                inexorably or necessarily from the agreement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In this debate we have witnessed an unholy
                alliance between Chris&nbsp;Patten — who has argued that the
                Belfast Agreement is the cover, as it were, for his
                recommendations — and those people who represent the
                &quot;No&quot; side of Unionism and who will use the Patten and
                Mandelson reforms as further ammunition to hurl against the
                structure of the Belfast Agreement. All this is rank hypocrisy
                from members of a party who have often hurled verbal abuse, or
                worse, against the same RUC whose best defenders they now claim
                to be. I noted earlier the strong rhetoric from the Minister for
                Social Development, among others, but if the DUP really felt so
                strongly about the Mandelson statement, why were its MPs not
                present in the Commons when he made it? The image of the DUP as
                the guardian of the future of the RUC brings to mind the idea of
                Charles&nbsp;Manson endorsing Barnardo’s.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, on the acceptability of the police,
                my argument is that the proposals from Patten and the statement
                by the Secretary of State are not logical, given the evidence in
                the Patten Commission’s report. I quote from
                paragraph&nbsp;3·14. In a random sample survey</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;77% of Protestants and 69% of Catholics
                expressed overall satisfaction with the way they had been
                treated&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">by the police.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Paragraph 3.11 states that 70% of Catholics
                in the same survey</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;cited intimidation ... as the main
                reason why Catholics were deterred from entering the

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sadly, that spirit of intimidation still
                stalks the land, as in Carrickmore. I would argue, in the light
                of such evidence coming directly from Patten, that it is
                misguided to make suggestions about a change of name and badge.
                The Mandelson changes will, if implemented, massively alienate
                the Unionist section of the population, yet they will never be
                enough to win over those who have the Republicans’ objection
                to the police. For such persons the real objection to the RUC is
                not its name, oath, or human rights record —</p>

                the United&nbsp;Kingdom. The Belfast&nbsp;Agreement has
                confirmed Northern&nbsp;Ireland’s position as part of the
                United&nbsp;Kingdom, subject to the consent principle. Given

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When a political party puts down a motion for
                debate it is assumed that all of its members feel sincerely
                about it. It was interesting to note that for most of the
                morning there were no more than three members of the DUP present
                in the Chamber. Once again it could be claimed that the RUC is
                being used and abused for political purposes. But what is new?
                Reference was made to the fact that the first policeman to die
                in the present troubles was murdered by Loyalists. In the days
                before his death, the Paisley bandwagon was screaming
                &quot;sell-out&quot; following the publication of the Hunt
                report, which the Rev&nbsp;Dr&nbsp;William&nbsp;McCrea referred
                to earlier. That policeman died in a riot that followed a rally
                organised by that same party. It made the balls, and when its
                members went home safely to their homes the police were left to
                take the brunt as the balls were thrown at them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The gardaí were criticised this morning, and
                that merits comment. May I remind the same politicians that
                while they were safely in their beds and protected by the RUC in
                the North, members of the gardaí were manning police stations
                along the border and protecting people on both sides of it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many of them were far away from their
                families for long periods, working in conditions that were far
                from favourable. Indeed, the Republic spent more per head of
                population on border security than the British. Surely
                Peter&nbsp;Robinson must bear testament to that tight security,
                given his little sortie to Clontibret.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thirty&nbsp;years later and things have not
                changed much. In the last few years people have still been be
                wound up to hate by the same people who were responsible for the
                death of the first policeman.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the absence of agreed political
                institutions it is impossible to have a police service which is
                broadly based. That is not just a Northern&nbsp;Ireland
                experience; it is the experience of countries in many parts of
                the world. It is therefore very worrying that people like
                John&nbsp;Taylor talk about a return to direct rule. That would
                be a disaster for the future of policing in the North — a
                disaster for the North.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Never again must the police service be
                dependent on people who pretend that they support it and then
                say the most outrageous things about it when it does not follow
                their narrow, bigoted, sectarian views.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After the signing of the Anglo-Irish
                Agreement there was the usual cry of &quot;Sell-out&quot; by the
                DUP. And just as in the 1969 case, to which I referred earlier,
                the paramilitaries responded with a drilling session on a beach
                in Portrush. The reaction of the DUP leader was interesting. Did
                he send for the RUC? Certainly not. He went to the beach and had
                his photograph taken with the paramilitaries. He predicted more
                deaths, and he called the RUC prostitutes, claiming that its
                members were now being paid in punts. His predictions about the
                deaths were deadly accurate — Castlerock, Greysteel and
                Loughinisland pay tribute to this. No police force should have
                to rely on that type of support.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At a recent rally in Coleraine, organised by
                the DUP, 350&nbsp;chairs were put out to enable people to hear
                how Dr&nbsp;Paisley and Mr&nbsp;Robinson were going to save the
                force. People will be relieved to know that most of the seats
                remained empty, for there is a maturity in Northern&nbsp;Ireland
                that understands that the police service cannot be the property
                of any political party and, most certainly, not the property of
                those parties that are extreme.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For the first time we have an opportunity to
                take policing out of the political arena where its friends were
                highly unreliable and unrepresentative of the whole community.
                The new police service must not be vulnerable to extreme
                elements, irrespective of where they come from. We should never
                again have rotten apples in the service, who, by their actions,
                or lack of actions, bring disgrace to it, and the new political
                structure will prevent that from happening.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Patten Report’s recommendations point
                the way forward. For the sake of the men and women who serve in
                the police and for the sake of the community who will depend on
                them, I hope that we can move swiftly to a new era. I hope that
                no more people will have to die either in uniform or out of
                uniform.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Policing was sadly abused in the past, and
                there are still people who care nothing for the harm and hurt
                caused, not only to the people in the police, but also to the
                people in the two communities whom they were charged to serve.
                Now is the time to move on. The Patten Report is not perfect. It
                can be improved upon, but that can only be possible when each
                individual sees the police, not as my police or your police, but
                as our police.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Gibson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have listened with interest to the
                speeches. My party has been accused of being negative, but I
                have never heard anything more negative or condemnatory than
                what has come from the SDLP Benches. I have referred to the SDLP
                as the Fairy Liquid party — it is green, slippery and soapy,
                but the scum has gone down the sink. However, by its association
                with and support for those who have murdered and created
                anarchy, it has got itself to the point where it can no longer
                differentiate between right and wrong. Its members are unable to
                condemn or distance themselves from the Provos; rather, they
                have piggybacked on their success. I have seen this night after
                night in various council chambers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A section of this community declared from the
                word go that it would not accept Northern&nbsp;Ireland, that it
                would not accept anything that pertained to keeping
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland British. Yesterday Gerry&nbsp;Adams
                reminded us very forcibly of this stance in his speech at
                Milltown when he said that the Republican agenda or focus
                remains the same. Its aims and determinations have not altered
                one whit. People talk about this wonderful agreement and this
                great shrine of peace, but Sinn&nbsp;Féin has never been party
                to it. It has deliberately pretended to support it, but peace is
                just another conveyor belt towards Republican goals. To be fair
                to Sinn&nbsp;Féin, it has been more honest about its intentions
                than its political neighbours in the SDLP.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is much hypocrisy about not accepting
                the police, but let me give one example. In Pomeroy, which is in
                the constituency next to mine, there was a large anti-RUC
                meeting, and on the way home from it, two of its very staunch
                supporters had an accident on the Inishative&nbsp;Road. They
                could not agree on who was right and who was wrong. How did they
                settle it? They sent for the RUC. So much for those who do not
                accept the RUC.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We hear a great deal of hypocrisy from
                members of the SDLP, some of whom sit on the Police Liaison
                Committee. They would be the first to say &quot;No, I&nbsp;am
                not here&quot; or &quot;I&nbsp;am wearing another cap&quot;, but
                they are back-door SDLP members of the Police Liaison Committee.
                The truth will come out.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Take the example of the foot soldiers who are
                not content just to wait for the peace process to deliver the
                goods. There is an idea around that these foot soldiers can walk
                on a headmaster’s lawn and tell him that he cannot have a
                guest in his school, or that they can walk into a meeting and
                threaten and intimidate. Let us look at the civil rights issue
                here. There is no right to free association.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Then take the case of the parents of the
                policeman in Melmount in Strabane who had to be moved out on
                Friday night because of threats and intimidation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When I look around the countryside in my
                constituency, I see 97&nbsp;tombstones, put there by people
                whose business was anarchy and murder, people who, in their
                hearts and minds, were always determined to bring anarchy to
                this country. There was only one line of defence, and that was
                the RUC. The RUC defended the majority of people — both the
                Catholic and the Protestant communities — and we have a
                responsibility to defend those who defended us.</p>

                reserve constable in the Royal Ulster Constabulary for
                14&nbsp;years, and I was proud to do so. Those of us who served
                in the Royal Ulster Constabulary did so to the best of our
                ability, no matter what our politics, religion or views, because
                it was an honour to serve the community.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have a piece of information for
                Gerry&nbsp;Kelly. While patrolling in Stewartstown, Coagh,
                Ardboe and Coalisland in the ‘70s and ‘80s, I found that
                Nationalists, Unionists, Loyalists and even Republicans were
                very willing to avail of the RUC’s services. Even though we
                were shot at and bombed, we tried to help, no matter how trivial
                the problem, and we did so in an impartial and fair way.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I&nbsp;listened to comments from
                Sinn&nbsp;Féin Members today — they made much of the RUC’s
                failings. No one pretends that any police force is perfect, but
                let us not forget the reality. Sinn&nbsp;Féin’s sister
                organisation — the IRA — is responsible for 40&nbsp;times
                the deaths that the RUC is responsible for, and every one of
                those RUC killings has been subject to proper investigation.
                Most were of terrorists on active service. What investigations
                have there been of IRA killings? The Republican movement demands
                change and wants to move the process forward, but it has not
                changed.</p>

                think that she should temper her comments about the
                51&nbsp;deaths that the RUC has been responsible for, bearing in
                mind that the IRA has killed more than 275&nbsp;RUC men and
                women over the last 30&nbsp;years? Is it not time that the
                Republican movement addressed not only the complete immorality
                of its campaign, but also its unbalanced nature? How can this
                overkill be justified, let alone the taking of one human life?</p>

                is coming into line and will support law and order in
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland. However, having listened to remarks from
                its Members today, I can only conclude that they seek not so
                much a police force as a weakened security apparatus, which will
                be vulnerable to some future Republican terrorist campaign when
                their campaign for a united Ireland fails.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is my analysis, so I was totally
                disgusted with the UK Government when, having acknowledged the
                excellent achievements of the RUC with the award of the
                George&nbsp;Cross, they proceeded to dishonour the members of
                the RUC, including those thousands of injured members and, most
                of all, the widows and widowers of those who were killed.
                Instead of supporting the RUC, the Government are going so far
                as to remove the name of this fine force and the badge which so
                well represents the two&nbsp;traditions. It looks as though the
                RUC is going the same way as the Ulster Special Constabulary and
                the UDR.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Change is inevitable in view of a changing
                and peaceful Northern&nbsp;Ireland, but this change must take
                place naturally and in a way which takes into account the
                evolving security situation. Instead of this, the Government
                have dishonoured themselves by continuing along the road of
                appeasement. They have bowed down to the threat from terrorists
                who may in future emerge from the Republican movement, and it is
                a shame and a disgrace that the Nationalist SDLP has chosen to

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr A Doherty:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Government’s response to the Patten
                Report on policing is welcomed as one essential element of the
                complex series of processes which must be implemented together
                if we are to achieve the peaceful and just society which all but
                the most perverted long for.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Good policing and the proper administration
                of justice are most important in any society. How much more
                important are they then in a society with a sorry history of
                division, sectarianism and violence? It is because of that
                history that change is imperative and urgent. It is inevitable
                that it will give rise to strong emotions, and it is
                irresponsible and dangerous to heighten or play on those
                emotions either to oppose change or to demand the impossible or
                the unattainable.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is not surprising that so much opposition
                and so many demands relate to symbols and titles and an ethos
                that inevitably reflect the values of those who held power in
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland from its inception. They were people whose
                values found expression in the slogans &quot;A Protestant
                Government for a Protestant people&quot; and &quot;Not an
                inch.&quot;. They needed institutions of government — a police
                force in particular — to help them sustain that power. The
                cost was the alienation of a high proportion of the population
                and the creation of a gulf between the police and many of those
                whom they were meant to serve.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A police force of necessity reflects the
                ethos of those who control the Government. This was as true with
                Nazi Germany’s Gestapo and Stalin’s KGB as it is in more
                enlightened and humane times, and even the most enlightened
                Administration, such as the one we are trying to create, must
                work diligently to ensure that its police service is such that
                it will</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;enjoy widespread support from, and is

                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In a statement on 19&nbsp;January&nbsp;2000
                the Taoiseach said</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;It is in the interests of everyone in
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland that the police service be able to
                function fully and freely in all areas and across all
                communities&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">People from both traditions want to be able
                to give their unqualified support to a police service which is
                unequivocally of and for the whole community. They want the law
                to be upheld in an atmosphere of normality and security, and
                policemen and policewomen to be made welcome in every home.
                Furthermore, a career in policing should be fully open to
                talented and committed people, irrespective of their political
                beliefs and identities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is a sad reflection on our society that,
                because those words were spoken by the Taoiseach of the Irish
                Republic, they will be belittled and rejected by some people of
                influence in our community. It is even sadder that, had they
                been spoken by our own First Minister, those same people would
                call him a traitor and demand his resignation. However, do those
                words not describe something worth working and making sacrifices
                for? The SDLP believes that all reasonable people wish to live,
                and see their children grow up, in a community with such a
                police service.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Shannon:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We live today in the twilight of law and
                order in Northern&nbsp;Ireland. The publication of Patten’s
                opinions on the future of policing here have confirmed the very
                worst of which we had warned Official Unionism. We can now read
                in black and white the sordid intentions of the so-called
                independent commission to exterminate the RUC. We all know where
                John&nbsp;Taylor stood on these issues. He was the
                yes-no-yes-man. He was the man who made the 40-foot bargepole
                disappear in seconds. He is also one of those responsible for
                the Patten Commission’s being here today. He is one of those
                who voted for the agreement and gave it his endorsement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Two things must be said about Patten’s
                opinions. First, the RUC, as it stands, commands respect and
                support from the overwhelming majority of people in
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland — and that is cross-community support
                — and with no significant change in the terrorist threat it
                should not be reformed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, as spawn of the Good Friday
                Agreement, Patten propagates its message, sacrificing the very
                principles of democratic society purely to appease the gunmen.
                When Patten seeks to create a police force which satisfies
                everyone, that includes the terrorists and the law-breakers. One
                need hardly be a brain surgeon to figure out that a force which
                satisfies the law-breakers would be anything but a force able to
                maintain the rule of law. The Patten Report is sodden with
                proposals which would neutralise the police’s efficiency,
                integrity, identity and ability to tackle violent terrorism
                effectively. From the very outset, it is quite clear that the
                basis upon which these proposals were made was not that of
                operational requirement or necessity. Rather, the basis was the
                need to make concessions to satisfy the desires of
                IRA/Sinn&nbsp;Féin and the wider pan-Nationalist agenda.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Patten’s report is founded upon the
                corruption of what is possibly one of the most respected and
                effective anti-terrorist police forces in the world. At this
                stage in the overall implementation of the Belfast Agreement, we
                have seen practically all IRA/Sinn&nbsp;Féin prisoners released
                from jail. The Maze prison should be resounding to the noise of
                incarcerated murderers and thugs. Instead, it lies empty. Its
                staff, who have seen the unrepentant spokesmen for fully armed
                terrorism walk unhindered into the Government of this country,
                their hands still dripping with the blood of 30&nbsp;years of
                carnage, are redundant. We have a commitment to corrupt the
                judicial system.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An unprecedented level of cultural apartheid
                now exists, where the flag of this country, and all signs of
                British identity — and we saw this in Down Council last week
                — are being systematically removed and defiled while we have
                the violence continuing and the IRA rearming. When IRA members
                go to Florida it is not to visit Disneyworld or get a suntan but
                to buy guns. At the same time we see security bases closing
                constantly and troop levels decreasing. We are now witnessing
                the decommissioning of weapons belonging to the legitimate
                forces of law and order without any similar commitment from
                IRA/Sinn&nbsp;Féin.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The RUC has been most successful in
                strangling IRA activity in Northern&nbsp;Ireland, and
                consequently has acted as both first and last lines of defence
                for the UK mainland against Republican atrocities. Many of us
                were annoyed to see on television yesterday the large rally in
                West Belfast to commemorate a murderer who killed a Roman
                Catholic policeman a number of years ago. This flies in the face
                of many of the Province’s law-abiding people.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is absolute madness in effect to disband
                the force which has protected this community over the past
                30&nbsp;years, preventing the expansion of the Republican
                control base and, ultimately, preventing the organisation from
                functioning successfully in Northern&nbsp;Ireland. This madness
                is illustrated by the fact that IRA/Sinn&nbsp;Féin continues to
                rearm, retrain and recruit, refusing to give any commitment to
                peaceful means or to constitutional and democratic principles.
                Should Patten be implemented, society will pay the price, and
                all those who supported the agreement and voted &quot;Yes&quot;
                to it will have to admit their responsibility.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Blair’s Administration and the NIO are
                quite prepared to sacrifice democracy and the rule of law in
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland to keep the bombs out of London. They are
                prepared not only to ignore and disregard the lives of those
                brave officers who have been brutally murdered and maimed while
                trying to maintain law and order but to insult their memory by
                paving the way for their murderers to become part of the new
                force. They have stated that police reforms are an essential
                part of the new democratic society in Northern&nbsp;Ireland, and
                under the Belfast Agreement they are not wrong. The agreement,
                as everyone knows, is a list of concessions aimed at silencing
                the Republican movement’s bombs in London. The findings of
                Patten’s Commission are an integral part of the agreement and
                could not be anything but pro-Republican.</p>

                that the organisations which caused the mayhem are still active
                —</p>

                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Ford:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the amendment proposed by my party
                Colleagues which acknowledges the degree of hurt among police
                officers and their families over the Patten reforms. Unionist
                spokesmen have reflected that hurt today, perhaps with a greater
                or lesser degree of genuine apprehension.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to one of the more than 170
                recommendations of Patten, I agree with Mr&nbsp;Dodds on the
                opposition to proposed recruitment quotas. However, it is not so
                much a case of my agreeing with Mr&nbsp;Dodds as of Mr&nbsp;Dodds’s
                agreeing with me, since the initial response from the DUP and
                other Unionists seems to be almost totally based on the issues
                of symbolism — the badge and the name. For Alliance, the focus
                of our consideration of Patten has always been on the need for
                an effective police service for all the people of
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland in a new and peaceful society.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In this respect it is regrettable that
                leaders of Nationalism have said nothing on the issue of quotas.
                I was disappointed to hear this morning that the Catholic
                bishops had issued a statement calling for what one might term
                accelerated Catholic recruitment into the new police service. If
                that means that they are encouraging members of their flock to
                join the police service it is welcome, but to suggest that we
                could achieve a 30% Catholic balance in three to five&nbsp;years
                seems to me to require direct discrimination, and that would
                risk losing the experience and expertise in ordinary policing
                within the RUC.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to see a fully representative police
                service, inclusive of every section of this society — every
                geographical section, both genders and all ethnic groups, and
                not just the two main religions. I want to see a professional
                police service in which every member is appointed on merit and
                not through some form of quota. That is the only way to ensure
                that people gain respect for being professional police officers
                rather than Catholic or Protestant policemen or — and this is
                another minority — policewomen.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It has already been said that quotas are
                illegal under fair employment law in Northern&nbsp;Ireland, the
                rest of the UK and the EU. That is one reason to oppose them. It
                is also quite clear that quotas are ineffective. They are
                intended by Patten to apply at the final appointment stage, but
                it has never been a problem to draw 50:50 from a pool of
                qualified applicants. The problem is to attract a balance in the
                applicants in the first place. That is another reason to oppose
                quotas.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the reform is out to succeed, there is no
                need for quotas. A career in the police service should be an
                attractive option to well-qualified young men and women,
                whatever their community background. If that happens, there will
                be balance in applications because the population proportions in
                the age group from which recruits are largely drawn are almost
                even between Protestants and Catholics. And 10% decline such
                categorisation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Quotas would create major problems for the
                officers of the service and under employment law. The Government
                must think again. The concerns about quotas and local policing
                boards which Sean&nbsp;Neeson mentioned are not a reason for
                rejecting Patten overall, but they do give us a reason for
                seeking amendments to his proposals.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a real need for policing to be
                transformed in style from the armed force that has been
                necessary for 30&nbsp;years to a first-class community police
                service. Patten has set out how that can and should be done,
                building on the existing force. The police and the Police
                Authority are already implementing many of Patten’s proposals.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Fundamentally, what we should all be
                concerned about is the ethos, and Patten envisages a single
                unified police service for the whole of Northern&nbsp;Ireland.
                This is not about Catholics policing Catholics or Protestants
                policing Protestants. It is not even about a two-tier service or
                a regional force arrangement, which would amount to the same
                thing.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must seek to produce the kind of unified
                service which will meet the needs of all of us in the future.
                Patten also stresses the need for a strong human rights ethos to
                be prominent in future policing. That contrasts with the minimal
                role that human rights have in police training at present. That
                is essential for this society and for the service itself. It
                would also be a defence against some of the more ludicrous
                allegations about paramilitary involvement in the police in the
                future.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is every reason for welcoming this
                emphasis on human rights in training, in staff appraisal and in
                the monitoring role of the new policing board. Although the
                Alliance Party will wish to see amendments to some of the
                proposals which are being made, the report does provide an
                opportunity for new beginnings in policing, and there is every
                reason for giving the proposals broad support in the community
                and in the Assembly.</p>

                the SDLP, who mocked the supposedly small attendance at the
                rally, that over 400,000&nbsp;signatures opposing the
                destruction of the RUC were handed into

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The reward for the more than 300&nbsp;RUC
                officers, who made the supreme sacrifice and laid down their

                lengths to appease. It is appalling that representatives of
                fully armed terrorist organisations will be in control of
                policing through the new policing board.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The proposal to abandon the proud name and
                insignia of the RUC is grossly insulting to most people in
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland. It dishonours those who have served and
                died so bravely over the years, bearing that name and wearing
                that insignia. Yet it is clear that such changes will have very
                little bearing on the attitude of the minority community to the
                police.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Roman Catholics have not joined the RUC in
                greater numbers because of intimidation by the IRA. Patten’s
                ban on the flying of the national flag on police buildings is
                disgraceful. The proposal that recruitment should be based, not
                on the &quot;merit&quot; principle, but on the filling of
                sectarian quotas, runs counter to current fair employment
                legislation. The abolition of the full-time Reserve is totally
                misconceived.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Most people in Northern&nbsp;Ireland are
                deeply angered by proposals to emasculate and destroy the RUC
                when terrorist organisations remain intact and fully armed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Furthermore, at a time when the Chief
                Constable is warning of the seriousness of the terrorist threat,
                it is madness to be considering a reduction in the capabilities
                and resources of the RUC. The thoughts and sympathy of my party
                and myself are with the families of the RUC officers who, in
                defence of law and order, were murdered and maimed by
                terrorists. The Patten Report is a gratuitous insult to the
                professional integrity and operational efficiency of the RUC in
                its defence of the citizens of Northern&nbsp;Ireland over the
                years of terrorism. The Patten Report, if implemented, would
                achieve in a matter of months what Sinn&nbsp;Féin/IRA failed to
                achieve in 30&nbsp;years — the destruction of the RUC. If the
                RUC means anything to the Ulster Unionist Party its leadership
                should resign from the Executive in protest at the actions of
                the Secretary of State.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The ultimate responsibility for the report
                rests with Mr&nbsp;Trimble who negotiated the terms of reference
                for the Patten Commission which determined the outcome of the
                report. The line being put out that plans were being made before
                the agreement was made will not wash. The finger of blame is
                pointed at the Ulster Unionist Party, and hundreds are phoning
                Glengall Street on a daily basis.</p>

                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The RUC Has Been Saved.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thanks to the UUP the section of the
                agreement was rewritten with recognition now given to the RUC
                with authority delegated as the Chief Constable should decide
                within a unitary structure. The RUC’s position has not been
                negotiated in the Talks and the Commission in the Agreement
                looks towards the adjustments which would naturally arise if
                terrorism ends&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I challenge anybody in the Ulster Unionist
                Party to say to me how — to use their words — &quot;the RUC
                has been saved&quot;.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Ulster Unionist Party has failed the
                Unionist people miserably. The empty words of condemnation of
                the report from Mr&nbsp;Trimble will ring hollow in the ears of
                the law-abiding citizens of Northern&nbsp;Ireland unless they
                are matched by his immediate withdrawal of support for the
                Belfast Agreement. The implementation of the agreement, in
                combination with the Patten Report, puts Sinn&nbsp;Féin/IRA in
                government without IRA decommissioning and places
                Sinn&nbsp;Féin/IRA at the centre of policing in
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let us look at the Alliance Party’s
                amendment. It is typical Alliance waffle — all things to all
                people. The party’s ink is on the destruction of the RUC. That
                cannot be denied. Sean&nbsp;Neeson talks of the pain and the
                hurt, yet his party on Belfast City Council refused last
                September to allow the mother of Const&nbsp;David&nbsp;Johnston,
                murdered by the IRA in 1997, to lay a wreath on behalf of her
                murdered son and all the others who made the supreme sacrifice.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Douglas:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion. If implemented, the
                recommendations outlined by the Secretary of State last week
                will not only make justice in this Province a mere semblance of
                law and order but will render worthless the supreme sacrifice
                made by those members of the Royal Ulster Constabulary who gave
                their lives to defend law-abiding people against IRA and
                Loyalist terror. It stands to reason that the RUC and its
                Reserve, prime targets of terrorists during the so-called war,
                would remain so during the farcical peace process.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The RUC is internationally renowned for its
                intelligence service and has successfully defended this Province
                against terrorism and, in effect, Fascism for many years. The
                terrorist organisations found it impossible to defeat the RUC by
                butchery, torture and the most callous murders and intimidation.
                The Government, through Patten, have delivered the victory to
                them by concession and appeasement. Those on the other side of
                the House should remember that they did not earn the victory or
                defeat the RUC — they have gained that victory through a
                pay-off.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The RUC, in defence of democracy, has borne
                the brunt of those who would eradicate democracy, yet how ironic
                it is that it should be democracy that has signed, sealed and
                delivered its fate. Those Unionists who voted &quot;Yes&quot;
                would not be told or warned. They bolstered each other and
                convinced themselves that they could not be out-manoeuvred, that
                the Government would not let them down by dismantling or
                reforming the RUC too much. Indeed, they even boasted of being
                the saviours of the police. They should take to heart this harsh
                lesson, instead of trusting terrorists and those who seek to
                appease Republicanism. They should stand firm on Unionism and
                defend their Unionist principles, or at least those precious few
                that they still have left, and not put their country and its
                laws up for negotiation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We will never know the true extent of lives
                saved by the RUC, either here or on the mainland. We must not
                forget the courage and bravery of its members, who every day
                face the prospect of death and whose families have long lived in
                fear of the unthinkable happening. We must never gloss over the
                pain suffered by those to whom the unthinkable did happen or
                ignore the traumas endured by those who witnessed the carnage
                — scenes that will remain forever in their memories.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So how are these brave officers honoured and
                thanked by society and the Government whom they have protected?
                They are insulted by the changing of the cherished and respected
                name of their force. They look on powerless as those they locked
                up are released and laugh in their faces. As the officers become
                further demoralised, in spite of reassurances to the contrary,
                they will indeed be forced to co-operate and work with those
                they suppose to be actively linked to terrorist organisations,
                since not all terrorists have been convicted. They — a
                legitimate force — lose their weapons and protection while the
                caches of illegal arms are enlarged by airmail. Worst of all,
                the RUC will be forced to answer to those who have murdered and
                maimed them and their colleagues and who have waged a relentless
                propaganda campaign of scurrilous lies aimed at discrediting the
                moral integrity of and slurring the name of a much respected
                constabulary.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It appears that this weak and spineless
                British Government is incapable of distinguishing between the
                two. It is time to desist from the serious folly of appeasing
                apologists for terror — those who pocket concession after
                concession and have no intention of giving anything in return.
                It is time to stop supporting everything which gives credence to
                this pathetic farce of a peace process, that has let law and
                order degenerate into a nonsensical game of defending murder.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is time to recognise the real reasons for
                Roman Catholics’ reluctance to enlist in the RUC rather than
                change the RUC to allow unconvicted criminals to join and police
                Northern Ireland in the way they know best. Our community has
                been threatened enough. It does not deserve to have terrorists
                being legitimised and policing it.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I rise to support the motion. My Colleagues
                have outlined most of the flaws in the course of action that the
                Secretary of State proposes to take. My remarks are directed to
                the Secretary of State, and I trust that he will read a
                transcript of the debate. He might get a better feeling for the
                views of the people in Northern&nbsp;Ireland from that than from
                what he gets from officials in the Northern&nbsp;Ireland Office.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In his lengthy peroration Mr Dodds failed to
                address the most fundamental point that Westminster is
                sovereign. Was that because he is still in the time warp of the
                referendum campaign when the DUP assured us that the repeal of
                section&nbsp;75 of the Government of Ireland Act would mean that
                Westminster was not sovereign? Westminster would not be able to
                reform the police force, contrary to the wishes of the majority
                of the population, if it were not a sovereign Parliament. Nobody
                knows this better than Mr&nbsp;Dodds and his Colleague
                Mr&nbsp;S&nbsp;Wilson, who told us this again and again in a
                debate in the Chamber on 9&nbsp;November&nbsp;1998, with a note
                of triumph in his voice.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Roche:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will the Member give way?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Leslie:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No. This side of the House did not give way
                to my party, and in the short time available I will not be doing
                so.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is both to the benefit and burden of
                Unionism that Westminster is sovereign. The Secretary of State
                needs to take into account that we will not know for some time
                whether the reformed police force he envisages, at some cost,
                will be as effective in upholding the law. It is therefore
                essential in framing the legislation that provision is made to
                regularly review the progress of the reform to see if the police
                are able to uphold the law satisfactorily.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr&nbsp;Neeson made a highly relevant point
                about the need to link the pace of police reform to the creation
                of a peaceful society. This was not evident in the Secretary of
                State’s statement last week. I hope he will review the matter.
                It is not just that this society needs to be free from actual
                violence; it needs to be free from the threat of violence.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the Secretary of State wants to emphasise
                that the police are in charge of upholding the law, perhaps he
                would like to address himself to the law itself. It would send
                the right signal if Westminster — as criminal law in Northern
                Ireland is a reserved matter — were to introduce a mandatory
                25-year jail sentence without remission for the possession of
                arms and explosives. That might provide an incentive for the
                move towards decommissioning.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In looking at the amendment, which has
                received very little attention in this debate, I welcome the
                fact that the SDLP is going to support it and that it will be
                giving its full support to the proposed reformed police service
                and will be encouraging people to join it. I hope the SDLP will
                take its views to the Roman Catholic clergy, who seem to have a
                rather more equivocal view on the matter.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We welcome any Roman Catholic recruits to the
                RUC. We look forward to their coming forward and trust that they
                will pass the selection procedures and go through training.
                However, it needs to be borne in mind that it takes time to
                train a police officer, and it takes time for a police officer
                to acquire the experience to make him effective. It is simply
                not practical to turn over a great number of personnel in a very
                short period.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In conclusion, Mrs&nbsp;Nelis suggested that
                the nightmare of the RUC must be a thing of the past. For nearly
                all of the people of Northern&nbsp;Ireland, except perhaps for
                those who support her party and the terrorist IRA, the nightmare
                we want to see ending is the nightmare of the 30&nbsp;years of
                terrorism. I support the motion.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr ONeill:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am glad to have the opportunity to take
                part in the debate, although perhaps &quot;debate&quot; is too
                generous a word. As I listened to it, here and in my office, I
                got the distinct impression that very few people are really
                listening to what others are saying. Maybe that is because it is
                a debate about what is really going on between two brands of
                Unionism rather than about the Patten Report or policing.
                Therefore we get this internecine squabble instead of a debate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, there are points to be made. Some of
                these have been covered by my Colleagues earlier, but it does
                not do any harm to repeat some of them. I would like to
                emphasise one or two things, because it is an opportunity for
                the SDLP to show quite clearly that we have been in the
                forefront of arguing for fair, neutral and available services to
                all. We have argued for a form of government that is open to all
                and for a form of policing that goes along with it. We have been
                arguing for those things for many years, and eventually we are
                beginning to get that argument across to those who count. For so
                long there has been a lack of identification with the police
                force. No one in the Chamber can honestly say that this is not
                true. If Members do, they are missing the reality of the
                situation, which has been there for a long time.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We want to create a policing service that is
                wholeheartedly supported by all sections of the community. We
                see that as one of the most essential and valuable goals of the
                whole political process because the policing problem is a
                deep-seated political one which goes to the very heart of the
                political entity that is Northern&nbsp;Ireland. Our analysis has
                shown that this issue is very deep and fundamental to the whole
                political approach. Political and policing problems in Northern
                Ireland are intertwined and interlocked. One cannot be solved
                without the other. If we fail to solve one, it is our fear that
                the other will be incapable of resolution.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are conscious of the need to create a
                system of policing which commands the support of Unionist and
                Nationalist communities for the first time. To be meaningful,
                that support must be more than the verbal declarations that
                often pass for policing reform. Support implies people from
                Nationalist and Unionist areas joining a police service with a
                sense of pride, not guilt, and without censure from a community.
                It means serving and protecting the community as an indigenous
                part of it and, in turn, being protected by the community.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It means that Nationalists as well as
                Unionists will be involved in policing in a way which has not
                been possible since Northern&nbsp;Ireland was created. For
                Nationalists it will, for the first time, be the granting of
                allegiance to a system of policing with which they can identify
                politically and ideologically. That is an important point. That
                will be a quantum leap for Nationalists, and I recognise that.
                That is why we support the Patten&nbsp;Report. We believe that
                the Patten&nbsp;Report provides that opportunity, and for that
                reason, we welcome Peter&nbsp;Mandelson’s recent statement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a result of the agreement, there is great
                expectancy amongst people that we will get a peaceful,
                acceptable and agreeable form of government. In tandem with
                that, there is a great expectancy that we will have whole
                systems to which we can give our allegiance, including the
                police service. If we are not able to deliver that, then I fear
                for the consequences with regard to getting all our political
                views and all our political processes together.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After four and a half hours of debate I still
                have a very substantial list of Members from a number of parties
                who wish to make contributions. Clearly, that is not possible.
                We also have to have the vote, and I have to assume that there
                will be a vote on the amendment as well as a vote on the
                substantive motion before 6.00&nbsp;pm. The winding-up speeches
                for the amendment and the substantive motion also have to take
                place, and those who are winding up have to respond to some four
                and a half hours of debate. I therefore intend to call the
                Members who will be winding up on the amendment and on the
                substantive motion, with the intention of moving to the votes at
                5.40&nbsp;pm. This will give us approximately 10&nbsp;minutes
                for each of the votes. This, I fear, will be very tight, so I
                must ask for your co-operation.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Close:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The one thing that has become clear from
                today’s debate is that there has been, and still is, a great
                deal of pain throughout society. The other thing that is equally
                clear and obvious is that no one section of the community has a
                monopoly on that hurt and pain. If we all recognise those facts,
                then this debate will have served a useful purpose.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another word which came through from a number
                of Members was the word &quot;anger&quot;. I feel that the anger
                is often more painful than the injury that caused it in the
                first place, and I ask Members to take account of this fact.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It has to be recognised that the Patten
                Report has caused, in some of its recommendations, a degree of
                pain and hurt throughout society. However, it equally has to be
                recognised that there is a Patten&nbsp;Report because of this
                society’s past failures in finding an acceptable and
                democratic method by which to govern Northern&nbsp;Ireland. The
                point must be made that the old mentality of &quot;Not an
                inch&quot; or &quot;No change&quot; is exactly what got us into
                the mess in which we found ourselves.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Policing has been contentious, by and large,
                because the whole essence of politics in Northern&nbsp;Ireland
                has been contentious.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The consent principle, which is surely the
                effective cornerstone for policing in any democracy, has been
                absent. The Patten Report says that in contested space the role
                of those charged with keeping the peace has itself been
                contested.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Having listened to what has been said, I have
                no doubt that the areas that have caused the greatest hurt and
                pain, tugging hard at the heartstrings and at the emotions, are
                those that deal with the name and the badge. I can empathise
                with those who have lost relatives or friends because they were
                members of the Royal Ulster Constabulary. I can understand the
                feelings of almost betrayal felt by those who have lost limbs or
                whose senses have suffered some terrible injury because they
                wore the badge and the uniform. Yes, there has been a feeling of
                hurt and, yes, there are memories. People can take anything else
                away, but they can never take away those memories. I believe
                that those memories, those sacrifices can be enriched and
                enhanced.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That would happen if all the leaders in this
                society did their utmost to ensure that the pain was not in
                vain, that the pain of some could be translated into gain for
                the entire community. The gain to which I refer would be a
                police service that has the consent of the entire community,
                where the police and the public work in partnership. Why?
                Because policing, in my opinion, is too important a job to be
                left to the police alone.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This can and will be achieved, not by quotas
                but by leadership, not by the hypocritical rantings of
                politicians who jump to the defence of the badge and the name of
                the RUC because they consider it politically expedient. Leaders
                who in the past, by their words and actions, physically and
                verbally abused the person, the individual, the man or woman who
                was wearing that badge and uniform simply because those
                individuals did not comply with their political or other agenda.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is hurt and there is pain, but there is
                also the stench of hypocrisy from what I would refer to as the
                whited sepulchres masquerading as defenders of the police. There
                is also the stench of hypocrisy from those who condemn the
                police for, for example, alleged brutality. Leadership today is
                the vital catalyst that will change the pain into gain. That
                leadership must come from right across the entire spectrum of
                the community, but in a particular way. It must be seen to come
                from those who are regarded as the leaders and as the
                opinion-formers in the Catholic, Nationalist and Republican
                sections of the community.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The composition of the police force has been
                disproportionately Protestant and Unionist. This imbalance, for
                which there are many reasons, can only be addressed by more
                recruits from what is euphemistically referred to as &quot;the
                other side&quot;. The type of leadership that I am calling for
                today can only enhance the chances of that happening, and
                happening quickly. Those who have been in the vanguard in
                calling for change have now got to put up or shut up. It is not
                good enough to advocate a wait-and-see policy. It is time for
                active, not passive, leadership.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The GAA, for example, should come off the
                fence and encourage its supporters and activists to enlist now.
                It can do that by changing rule&nbsp;21. It can call a special
                meeting of its organisation, if necessary, to enable that to
                happen quickly. Republicans, who could show Oliver&nbsp;Twist a
                thing or two about asking for more, should embrace the
                sentiments in the motto of the city of Belfast —
                &quot;Pro&nbsp;tanto quid retribuamus&quot; — and ask
                &quot;For so much, what return can we make to this
                society?&quot;</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.30 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">They should stop their begrudging, stop their
                whingeing. It is time for generosity of spirit. It is time for
                give and take, not just take. It is time for the entire
                community to help the police emerge from their metamorphosis
                strengthened and improved, having the support not just of part
                of this community, but rather the confidence and support of the
                entire community. I call on the House to take the first step
                now.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are two certainties. One is that the
                police are not going to be disbanded; the other is that the
                Patten Report is not going to be scrapped. Let us deal with the
                realities. Let us support this amendment and send out a message
                of hope rather than the negative messages of &quot;No
                movement&quot; and &quot;Not an inch&quot; that are the essence
                of the motion. I appeal in particular to the Ulster Unionists,
                who have sat here this afternoon and had the stick dragged
                across their backs by the Democratic Unionists, to support the
                amendment. The changes they want can be brought about by changes
                in legislation. Do not throw the baby out with the bathwater.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr P Robinson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will not be deflected by the pious
                preaching of the holier-than-thou, whiter-than-white Alliance
                Party. It is sufficient to leave on record its view that a
                motion to safeguard and retain the Royal Ulster Constabulary is
                a negative motion. We will see what its electorate has to say
                about its judgement on that issue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was wise of my Colleague Mr&nbsp;Dodds,
                when he was asked to move the motion last week, to withdraw it
                in favour of a fuller debate. The House has benefited from that.
                On top of that, of course, the recent announcement by the
                Secretary of State has made this issue all the more urgent and
                topical. If the House had not addressed the issue at a time when
                everyone outside was addressing it, we would have looked very
                foolish indeed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is a deep wound for the pro-British,
                law-abiding community in Northern&nbsp;Ireland. It is a
                self-inflicted wound. Its derivation is very clear. It comes
                directly and unmistakably from the Belfast Agreement. That is
                unquestionable. Is it any wonder that Chris&nbsp;Patten should
                cry out in exasperation &quot;What did they expect?&quot;? When
                one looks at the section of the Belfast Agreement dealing with
                policing, and in particular at the terms of reference for the
                Patten Commission, what else could one have expected?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The terms of reference are clearly defined.
                Let anybody who suggests that the change of the RUC’s name and
                badge came as a bolt out of the blue tell me what was meant by
                the agreement that was signed. It stated that a new police force
                should be designed. It dealt with issues such as policing
                arrangements including composition, recruitment, training,
                culture, ethos and symbols. What else could have been expected?
                Chris&nbsp;Patten went on to say</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;I don’t say this provocatively, but
                it really does seem to me that we were given a very clear
                agenda, and I’m surprised that those who gave us that agenda
                did not understand what the consequences would be.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I take issue with him on only one aspect of
                his statement. They could not but have understood. They were
                told over and over and over again. They were told by all of my
                colleagues who were opposed to the Belfast Agreement, and this
                was one of the four&nbsp;key areas that we highlighted during
                the referendum campaign.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We told people very clearly that this would
                lead to the destruction of the Royal Ulster Constabulary. Many
                people may well ask themselves &quot;What advice did our
                politicians give us during that campaign? We did not know that
                this was going to happen.&quot; The advice of the Ulster
                Unionist Party was that it would not happen. It wrongly analysed
                the issue, or else it sought to deceive the people. But then
                deceiving the people is an interesting phenomenon. I notice that
                the Secretary of State had something to say about that in the
                House of Commons to the Member of Parliament for Fermanagh and
                South Tyrone, Mr&nbsp;Maginnis. He said</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;I am surprised that he chooses to say
                something different in public from what he has said to me in
                private.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The people of Fermanagh and South Tyrone —
                indeed, the people of Northern&nbsp;Ireland and, more
                particularly, the Royal Ulster Constabulary, whom he is paid to
                represent — have a right to know what he was saying in private
                that is so different from what he is saying publicly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The next day in ‘The Times’,
                Mathew&nbsp;Parris perhaps hit the nail on the head when he said</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;You could feel Mr&nbsp;Mandelson’s
                anger rise. ‘I’m surprised he chooses to say these things’
                he observed with cold fury. The punch which followed was hardly
                pulled, the implication inescapable: that behind closed doors
                together, Mr&nbsp;Maginnis had offered support to Mr&nbsp;Mandelson’s
                hopes for the RUC, but here, perhaps for show at home, he was
                making a display of opposition, speaking ‘differently in
                public from what he says in private’.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr&nbsp;Parris then observed</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Mr&nbsp;Maginnis looked gobsmacked, did
                not come back for more, and stayed gobsmacked for the rest of
                the session&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The people of Northern&nbsp;Ireland deserve
                an answer. What was the distinction between the private messages
                that the Ulster Unionist Party was giving to the Secretary of
                State about the acceptability of these proposals and what it was
                saying in public? And the synthetic anger of the leader of the
                Ulster Unionist Party in Westminster fools no one. He could not
                have been surprised. He is at least an intelligent man. He must
                therefore have understood what he was signing up to, and he must
                have understood that this was the outworking of the agreement
                that he had reached.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to the name of the Royal Ulster
                Constabulary, I note also the basic principle enshrined in the
                Government’s argument that this will be a factor in
                encouraging the Catholic and Nationalist community to join the
                new force. Not so, according to the Police Authority, and
                I&nbsp;put on record its views from its statement on this issue:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Our view remains that the name is
                arguably one of the least significant factors deterring
                Catholics from joining the RUC. There is no reliable evidence to
                show that changing the name would produce any significant
                increase in recruits from the Catholic community and in the
                absence of this we have a real fear that the proposal will
                alienate a large section of the community without having any
                appreciable impact on the problem it is designed to solve&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I ask for support for this motion. It is of
                critical importance not just to the Royal Ulster Constabulary
                but also to this Province. My Colleague, in opening this debate,
                challenged the House with a question. He asked if anybody
                conceivably thought that if all of Nationalism was united
                against a proposal being considered by the Government, that the
                Government would proceed. Everyone knows the answer. However,
                during the debate Nationalists have not been prepared to face up
                to that question.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The reality is that if Nationalists had been
                opposed to it — and opposed as vociferously and strongly and
                passionately as Unionists are — it would never have seen the
                light of day. The Secretary of State would never have stood up
                in the House of Commons to advance it. Everyone knows that that
                is the case.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But it is the Unionists who are against it.
                Have we less right to be heard and to be taken into account than
                Nationalists? The Assembly by its vote today can give a clear
                message to the Secretary&nbsp;of State and to the
                Prime&nbsp;Minister. If every Unionst in the Chamber votes in
                favour of the motion, we are putting to the Government that they
                do not have the support of at least this section of the Unionist
                community. If the Belfast Agreement meant anything when it said
                that widespread support was required and that there had to be
                greater support for the new structure than the old, the
                Secretary&nbsp;of&nbsp;State and the Prime&nbsp;Minister could
                not conceviably proceed with this proposal.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Royal Ulster Constabulary has a proud
                record which deservedly won for the force the George&nbsp;Cross.
                No police force, especially not one serving in the circumstances
                that apply in Northern&nbsp;Ireland, could be stainless. No
                political party, no Church, no organisation anywhere in this
                Province can say that it has never made a mistake. Certainly no
                politician could say that. On balance, the role performed by the
                Royal Ulster Constabulary outshines many organisations and
                certainly outshines its detractors.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must take into account not only the role
                that the force has performed under difficult circumstances but
                also its gallantry. We must remember the sacrifice by so many of
                its members — 302 of whom were killed defending our streets
                and our homes. Some 9,000 members of the RUC were maimed or
                mutilated. More than 400,000&nbsp;people signed a petition to
                the Secretary of State in support of the Royal Ulster
                Constabulary. In UK terms that represents between
                15&nbsp;million and 20&nbsp;million people. In those
                circumstances would the Secretary of State have proceeded?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let us make the vote a clear message from the
                Unionist Benches and let us see whether Tony&nbsp;Blair and
                Peter&nbsp;Mandelson are prepared to listen to the Unionist
                community’s — I hope — united voice.</p>
