    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The Assembly met at 10.30 am (Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr  McClarty] in the Chair).</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Members observed two minutes&rsquo; silence.</p>
    <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="1"></a>Assembly Business</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Maskey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. On a point of order, Mr Deputy  Speaker. I draw your attention to yesterday&rsquo;s Hansard report, in which Mr Basil  McCrea made a couple of remarks about the Minister of Education during Question  Time. Perhaps a ruling can be made on his remarks, the first of which was:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;She is, in fact, discriminatory, and is dealing  unfairly with many people in our society.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">He went on to say:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;She is sectarian, she is trying to divide us&rdquo;. &mdash; <span style="font-style:normal; ">[Official Report, Vol 40,  No 3, p138, col 2].</span></p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">I wish the Speaker to make a ruling on my point of  order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Thank you, Mr Maskey. I will refer that point of order to the  Speaker, and he will make a ruling at a later date.</p>
    <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="2"></a>Ministerial Statement</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">Swine Flu Outbreak in &nbsp;Mexico  and USA</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I inform Members that the Speaker has received notice from the  Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety that he wishes to make a  statement on the current status of the swine flu outbreak in Mexico and the United States.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety (Mr McGimpsey)</strong>: I wish to make a  statement to the House on the current status of the swine flu outbreak. I  report to the Assembly that, as a result of the evolving global situation and  spread of cases, the World Health Organization (WHO) has changed the level of threat  for swine influenza from phase 3 to phase 4. The change to WHO phase 4 means  that there is evidence of increased human-to-human transmission and indicates a  significant increase in the risk of a pandemic, but it does not necessarily  mean that one is inevitable.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Given the concern about that development, my Department and  the Public Health Agency are monitoring the situation extremely closely to  assess the implications for public health in Northern Ireland. We continue to  liaise closely with the Health Protection Agency and Departments in the UK, particularly the Cabinet Office and the  Department of Health, as well as with the Department of Health and Children in Dublin.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Yesterday, I took part in a meeting of the Civil  Contingencies Committee. It was chaired by the Secretary of State for Health,  Alan Johnson, and involved input from all devolved Ministers. After I have made  my statement, I intend to participate in a further meeting of that group.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I also held extensive discussions with my chief professional  advisers, and I briefed the First Minister and deputy First Minister. The issue  of swine flu cuts across all Departments, and I will regularly update my  Executive colleagues.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have also spoken to Mary Harney TD, the Minister for  Health and Children in the Republic   of Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Northern    Ireland has robust plans in place to deal  with this development. I have issued contingency plans for hospitals, the  Northern Ireland Ambulance Service and social care providers. Over the past few  days, I have issued urgent advice to GPs and hospital clinicians, and I will  continue to update them as the situation evolves. We will continue to ensure  that we are prepared and that the public are protected to the maximum level  possible. Northern Ireland  has stockpiles of antiviral drugs for a worst-case scenario, and those drugs  will cover up to 50% of the population. Current evidence suggests that, other  than those in Mexico,  the cases to date have had a mild flu-like illness that responds well to the  antiviral drugs that we have stockpiled.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My Department will now put in place a number of steps to  maintain our own vigilance and responsiveness. Those steps include advising the  public on the public health risk and the measures that they need to take in  preparation for a potential pandemic. That advice will comprise information  leaflets for every household and an advertising campaign, which are both being  finalised. We will also continue to advise health professionals on identifying  suspect cases, and regional policies and pandemic-management arrangements will  be reviewed and refined.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I reiterate the simple but very effective measures that  everyone can take in these circumstances. Influenza spreads easily from person  to person when an infected person coughs or sneezes. It also spreads through  hand-to-face contact if hands are contaminated. Therefore, good hygiene  practices, such as frequent hand washing and using tissues to cover the mouth  and nose for coughs and sneezes, will be the most effective measures that  people can take to protect themselves.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Individuals should listen carefully to Government advice,  which will be made available via the media and distributed on printed material.  People should consult the Foreign and Commonwealth Office website if they are  considering travelling to any affected areas. The current advice is against all  but essential travel to Mexico.  Information and advice for travellers will be available at all airports and  ports. Our enhanced monitoring and reporting will identify people with symptoms  that need to be investigated further.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At this point in time, no confirmed cases of swine flu have  been found in Northern    Ireland. However, as the Chief Medical  Officer said, we should expect that there will be cases in due course. The  Government have prepared detailed plans and procedures already to ensure that  the country will be able to deal with cases of swine influenza. GPs across the  country have been notified and made aware of the symptoms and of what to do if  they suspect that a patient has pandemic flu. Hospitals are well prepared and  have specific plans to deal with a pandemic. We have stocks of antiviral drugs  that will be used to treat all those who become ill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I trust that Members will understand that, as a result of  these exceptional circumstances, I will be unable to respond to the motions  that have been scheduled for today. It is essential that I participate in a  number of important planned meetings on this serious public health threat.  However, I will be pleased to respond to any issues that Members may have on  those motions if they write to me about the matters in question.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName">The Deputy Chairperson of the Committee for Health,  Social Services and Public Safety (Mrs <strong>O&rsquo;Neill)</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for coming  back to the House today to keep us up to date with what is happening. I have no  doubt that the robust plans that the Minister outlined are in place. However, a  number of cases, albeit unconfirmed, has been identified on this island. What  will be the implications for us if those cases are confirmed?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: It has been reported from the Irish Republic  that none of those cases has reported positive. At the moment, there are no  confirmed instances of swine flu in Northern   Ireland or, as I understand the information from Dublin, in the Irish   Republic. Scotland has two confirmed cases, and England and Wales have no confirmed cases. I  have no doubt that there will be an increase in the number of people being  tested, because people who have concerns will contact their GPs. I also do not  doubt that tests will be run on a number of occasions. We will have to wait and  see how many positive tests arise and then decide what the consequences and  specific counter-measures will be with respect to the prescribing of antiviral  drugs.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Easton</strong>:  How close are the experts to developing a vaccine for this type of flu? I  noticed that some tour operators were cancelling flights to Mexico. Is the  Minister&rsquo;s Department advising people not to travel to Mexico, and does that advice include travel to  the United States?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: As I said in my statement, when  it comes to travel we follow the advice of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office,  which is advising people that they should travel to Mexico only if it is essential to  do so. I am not aware of any advice to people that they should not travel to  the United States.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is estimated that it will take between three and six months  to identify and develop a specific vaccine. There are sleeping contracts in  place with manufacturers so that production can begin as soon as the vaccine is  identified. Through those sleeping contracts, an order is in place for vaccines  to protect the population. All of that has been planned for and is in hand, but  we have to wait for the specific virus to be identified and for the vaccine to  be developed before it can go into production. The UK  is acting as one unit on the issue, and sleeping contracts have been put in  place on behalf of England, Scotland, Wales  and Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Hanna</strong>: I  thank the Minister for coming back to the House to update us and for his  continuing vigilance. Given the increased human-to-human contact, the fact that  the virus appears to be attacking mainly healthy young adults whose immune  systems are at their optimum and the concern that the virus is becoming more  virulent, is the Minister confident that the antiviral drugs will be effective  should they be necessary?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: In the worst-case scenario,  antiviral medicine would cover 50% of the population, and we have stockpiled  that amount. All the UK  countries are stockpiled to that level. The Mexico flu virus is susceptible to  those antiviral drugs, so we have that protection. Clearly, the best step after  that is to develop a vaccine quickly. As everyone is aware, viruses mutate, and  that is an ongoing battle in the area of antiviral drugs.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  I thank the Minister for returning to keep the Assembly informed of what is  happening on this important issue. I noticed that he mentioned the media. Is  the Minister in contact with the media, and are there communications with the  general public? It is fine for the Minister to inform the Assembly yesterday  and today, but communications with the general public are of vital importance.  Does the Minister have easy and immediate access to the media to keep everyone  informed of the position?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: Public information is one of our  key pieces of work. Leaflets will be issued to every household, and that will  be supported by a major advertising campaign. The Civil Contingencies Committee  will agree a UK-wide media and public information plan. I have also taken steps  to ensure that there will be posters and information at ports and airports.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am also having discussions with Mary Harney, because many  people who travel to Northern Ireland  come through Dublin   Airport. Therefore, we  must ensure that we have complementary processes for the provision of  information.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">10.45 am</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Certain protocols are in place. For example, a pilot who  flies an aircraft into Belfast  or elsewhere and has a passenger who reports feeling ill must radio ahead to  the airport to arrange for a doctor to be waiting there. The same protocol  applies on ships. Those are long-standing protocols that are still in  operation. Public information is important and is a key issue in our UK-wide  discussions.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Buchanan</strong>:  I thank the Minister for coming to the House to update Members further on the  swine flu situation and for the robust measures that the Department has already  put in place to counteract the virus should it come into Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Will the antiviral drugs that the Department has in  stockpile be able to eradicate the flu virus in humans, should it come into Northern Ireland?  Although the Minister has already touched on that issue, it does no harm to  reaffirm it.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I can give Mr Buchanan only the  advice that I have received, which is that that virus is susceptible to the  antiviral drugs that the Department has stockpiled.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms S Ramsey</strong>:  Like other Members, I thank and commend the Minister. I understand that he is  working 24/7, which demonstrates the importance of having a local Minister in  control of such a matter.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">When does the Minister hope that flyers will be available?  I am sure that he agrees that there is much public concern. The sooner that  correct information can reach people&rsquo;s homes, the easier it will be on them. It  may also be useful for the Minister to speak to the media to ensure that their  reporting is measured, not only in news bulletins but in talk shows. We do not  need the media to add to concern on the issue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Given that the Assembly will not meet in the Chamber during  the rest of the week, I ask the Minister to keep Members informed so that we  can act as conduits of information to our constituents.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I agree with Sue Ramsey&rsquo;s  comments, and information is important. Flyers will be available, and the  Department is currently approving the information that will appear on them.  Public information will be made available through the Civil Contingencies Committee&rsquo;s  UK-wide campaign. An emergency control centre is already up and running, and a  telephone helpline will be set up soon so that people can ring for information.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member raised a point about the media: it is important  that public information is disseminated rather than the media issuing  adversarial, political-type information. Specifically, the aim is to ensure  that the public understands the importance and seriousness of the situation  without any undue scaremongering.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The situation is still a long way from a flu pandemic, and  we hope that it will not reach that level. However, as I said in the Chamber on  Monday 27 April 2009, we will prepare for the worst and hope for the best.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his statement to the House this morning. I welcome the  fact that a helpline will be established, which will be useful; I hope that it  is set up soon. Is the Minister satisfied with the level and exchange of  information, not only between this Assembly, the national Government at Westminster and the  various devolved institutions but between Governments and health agencies throughout  the world?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: The response is international,  national and local. Internationally, it is being led by the World Health  Organization, which collates information from Governments worldwide. Nationally,  we collate that information and work together through the Civil Contingencies  Committee, which is part of COBRA, and that work is a team effort. Locally,  work is focused on the dissemination of information through the health and  social care system, acute primary care, the Ambulance Service, and so on. That  is what the Department is doing.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is a need to spread information widely among the  public, and all Members and Departments have a part to play.</p>
    <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="3"></a>Ministerial Statement</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">North/South Ministerial Council</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">Agriculture Sectoral Format</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I have received notice from the Minister of Agriculture and Rural  Development that she wishes to make a statement regarding the North/South  Ministerial Council (NSMC) meeting in agriculture sectoral format.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development (Ms Gildernew)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a  LeasCheann Comhairle. With your permission, I will make a statement, in  compliance with section 52 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998, on the tenth  meeting of the North/South Ministerial Council in the agriculture sector.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The meeting was held at Farmleigh House, Dublin, on Friday 20 March. The Executive  were represented by the Minister of the Environment, Sammy Wilson MP MLA, and  by me, and the Irish Government were represented by Brendan Smith TD, Minister  for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. The statement has been agreed with Sammy  Wilson, and I make it on behalf of us both.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At the NSMC plenary meeting on 23 January, Ministers noted  the discussion of the recent animal feed contamination incident and its impact  on farmers and producers across the island. We agreed to continue to work  closely to complete the measures that the Irish Government and the Executive  have put in place to tackle the matter. We also agreed to strengthen our  co-operation in dealing with major incidents of this nature and requested our  officials to review and, if necessary, revise the existing arrangements.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Ministers welcomed the consultation on the development of  the draft all-island animal health and welfare strategy and agreed to convene a  cross-border event in 2009 to bring together key stakeholders to discuss the  delivery of the strategy. The Council noted the progress on the development of  the strategic approach to plant health and pesticides. Senior officials from  the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Department of  Agriculture and Rural Development are reviewing and identifying current and new  areas of interest in plant health and pesticides and are developing a programme  of work. The Departments will submit a joint report to the Council in early  autumn 2009.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Council discussed the outcome of the health check of  the common agricultural policy (CAP), including increased modulation and  related implications, changes in market management mechanisms, the management  of milk quota expiry and simplification of the single farm payment scheme,  including cross-compliance. Ministers broadly agreed on those issues; any  differences in approach arose from the different circumstances that apply North  and South. Simplification is one area in which both Administrations recognised  the possibility of useful gains.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Council also referred to the current state of play in  the World Trade Organization (WTO) negotiations. Ministers shared the view that  they wanted a fair, balanced and ambitious outcome that would not undermine  Irish and EU agriculture and acknowledged that the EU had made a significant  contribution to the negotiations. The Council noted the benefit of continued  discussion among Ministers on issues of common concern on the EU common  agriculture policy and the WTO and requested that officials remain in close  contact on such issues. The Council agreed that its next meeting in agriculture  sectoral format will take place in June 2009. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development (Dr W McCrea)</strong>: In  the Minister&rsquo;s statement and in the press release that was issued after the  meeting on 20 March, she said that both jurisdictions:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;agreed to strengthen our co-operation in dealing with  major incidents of this nature and requested our officials to review and, if  necessary, revise the existing arrangements.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development  agrees that a review of the existing arrangements is necessary, particularly  given that, in their own words, the authorities in the Irish Republic were  aware from the middle of November 2008 of the high level of dioxins in samples  and informed the Department in Northern Ireland three weeks later in December  after they had taken steps to protect their own industry. Will the Minister  therefore confirm that there was a complete absence of co-operation on that  incident, the conseq&shy;uences of which still reverberate throughout the pig  production and processing sectors in Northern Ireland?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, will she tell us which parts of the processes  are weak and outline what action is being taken to rectify those weaknesses?  Finally, will she explain how our industry can trust and co-operate in an  all-Ireland animal health strategy, given that the dioxin incident demonstrated  the absence of trust and co-operation and the desire of one partner to rush to  save its industry at the possible expense of our industry in Northern Ireland?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: The Member asked a number of questions.  One thing that I certainly agree with is that a review is needed, and there  will be a review, both in the South and in the North, to see what lessons can  be learnt. I welcome the fact that the Committee will take part in that review  and will make its experiences known and its views heard in the South.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have already discussed with Brendan Smith, my counterpart  in the South, the need for an early warning mechanism so that there is no lack  of communication in future. Such a mechanism would allow us to automatically  let each other know when something happens in one area that has an impact on  the other. We will certainly do that. I have a commitment from Brendan Smith  that, when both reviews are completed, we will discuss how we can organise  ourselves better to ensure that we learn valuable lessons from the dioxins  incident and that it does not happen again.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As Members will know, significant consultation has been  ongoing on the all-island animal health and welfare strategy. Stakeholders are  keen on that strategy, because it can help to deliver less bureaucracy and can  simplify arrangements for the majority of trade on the island, which is  North/South. Farmers like the fact that they can trade with more ease on the  island in cattle, sheep and pigs. Farmers want the strategy. It is a Programme  for Government (PFG) target, and it will help us to help the industry in the  future.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Lessons have been learnt from the dioxin incident, and the  strategy is now more important than ever, as it will ensure that we have the  tools to enable us to protect our industry. Whatever is happening on this  island, on other islands or around the world, we need to have the effective  tools to help us to protect the industry and trade on the island.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms S Ramsey</strong>:  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement. She mentioned co-operation across the  island, which should be welcomed. The Chairperson of the Committee mentioned  the review. When does the Minister expect the officials to report on that  review? When does she anticipate that the cross-border event planned for 2009  will happen? Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: We recognised that the review needed to  happen after the incident had taken place and had been effectively dealt with.  The culling and disposal have now been completed, so I hope that the review  will begin shortly and that we will be able to learn lessons from it as quickly  as possible. The stakeholder event will take place later this year, either  during the summer or in early autumn. It is a useful mechanism through which we  can discuss the delivery of the strategy on the island, what it means for us  and how it can help us. I look forward to that event.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  I thank the Minister for her statement and for keeping us informed. Was there  any discussion on the expiry of the milk quota system? Is there a difference in  policy between the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development here and the  relevant Department in the Republic   of Ireland as regards the  proposed ending of the milk quote regime? Is there any difference of opinion on  that?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: There is a difference of policy and  opinion, because the milk quota systems, North and South, are very different.  Our farmers have benefited from the ability to buy in milk quota from England, Scotland  and Wales.  We are in a stronger position in relation to the milk quota, and our dairy  industry has benefited as a result.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I see Mr McCallister shaking his head. I know about the  prices, but the fact is that we are in a stronger position in relation to the  quota.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Officials in the South were keen to have an increase in  milk quota so that they could work towards the ultimate abolition of the milk  quota system and attempt to ensure a soft landing. They achieved a favourable outcome  at the WTO. However, the present circumstances and the current auction price of  milk would not give anyone confidence in investing in additional quota at this  time. We are aware of the difficulties in buying cheap heifers from the  continent. There must be a difference of policy on the milk quota, North and  South, because there is a difference in practice.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We want to ensure that our farmers do not suffer as a  result of the abolition of milk quotas and are best placed to take advantage of  the new regime. I understand and accept the difficulties that dairy farmers are  facing, including poor auction prices. It will take time to overcome those  difficulties.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">11.00 am</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P J Bradley</strong>:  I thank the Minister for her statement. The SDLP&rsquo;s view is that nothing short  of North/South, east-west animal-health hotlines should be set up. Does the  Minister concur with that view, and if so, will she agree to put that issue on  the agenda of the next meeting of the North/South Ministerial Council in  sectoral format in June?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Earlier in the year, the Minister advised the House that  she was seeking compensation from the Republic&rsquo;s Government for the  consequences north of the border of the contaminated feed incident. She now  appears to have rowed back. Why has the Minister dropped that follow-up action?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: As the Member pointed out, we asked the  South to meet the cost of the losses that were suffered by producers and  processors in the North, and I discussed the matter in detail at meetings with  Brendan Smith and at the recent NSMC plenary. The South have responded by  saying that for legal and financial reasons, they are unable to help.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In my response to the Committee Chairperson&rsquo;s question, I  said that an early warning system will be put in place and the two  Administrations will have the ability to let each other know when something is  happening. The issue is already being discussed and the project will be taken  forward by officials. We all agree that that is the right thing to do.  Communication is very important, and the project is timely, given the nature of  Mr McGimpsey&rsquo;s statement this morning. The more communication we have, the  better we can protect ourselves, and in this case our industry, from the threat  of disease wherever it originates.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  thank the Minister for her statement. She is well aware of the House&rsquo;s desire  for new animal welfare legislation in Northern Ireland. We appreciate  that she wants to do things on an all-Ireland basis. However, is she conscious  of the dangers of North/South co-operation in this instance, where the  situation in Northern    Ireland is being determined by the lowest  common denominator and the person moving at the lowest speed?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Given the desire to have a fair and balanced outcome for EU  and Irish agriculture, will the Minister assure the House that her Department&rsquo;s  approach in conjunction with the Irish Government to the World Trade  Organization (WTO) talks will not be at the expense of agricultural development  in the Third World or the living standards of people in those parts of the  globe that are based on agriculture?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: As I said, we want a fair, balanced and  objective outcome from the WTO talks for Irish and EU agriculture. No one wants  policies that will have a detrimental effect on people in developing countries  or on farmers in the North of Ireland and on the island of Ireland.  We are trying to avoid an imbalance in the negotiations whereby trade could  happen with other parts of the world &mdash; not, in this instance, with developing  countries &mdash; and that other countries would benefit from the negotiations and  our farmers would lose out. That is not in anyone&rsquo;s interest.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although it is not lucrative, I am proud of the fact that  many processors and farmers in the North contribute to milk supplies that go to  developing countries. We export milk and other dairy products to more than 100  countries around the world, some of which are the poorest and some of whose  people are most dependent on those products. The fact that developing countries  are receiving milk powders based on our grass, air and water quality is  something of which we should be proud. The outcome of the WTO negotiations will  not be at the expense of the developing countries; the purpose is to ensure  that our farmers will not be disadvantaged by other agricultural states.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I believe that full co-operation on animal health and  welfare issues can help reduce and prevent animal disease, facilitate trade and  improve the sustainability of farming in the North.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The ultimate objectives of North/South trade should be to  facilitate co-operation and trade through the free movement of animals on the  island and to optimise animal-health status through alignment of policies to control  animal disease. Therefore, the strategy is timely.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The island should be internationally recognised as a  separate unit for disease-control purposes and for ensuring effective  traceability of livestock in the event of a disease outbreak. During the  foot-and-mouth disease outbreak in August 2007, we saw at first hand how  recognition of the fact that our animals were not affected meant that we could  continue to trade. As a consequence, we did not feel the pain of that outbreak  as much as England, Scotland and Wales did.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We are one of the very few countries in Europe  that is not struggling to cope with the threat of bluetongue. It is incumbent  on us to work together to do everything that we can to keep bluetongue out of Ireland for as  long as is possible.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brolly</strong>:  Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Seo &iacute; mo cheist don Aire. To  date, what positive outcomes has all-Ireland co-operation on animal health and  welfare produced?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: Various positive outcomes have been  achieved to date, including the development of a largely similar system for  sheep identification; co-operation on the exchange of data to facilitate trade  in bovine animals after the BSE export ban was lifted; broad alignment of  border-control policies aimed at preventing the introduction of animal disease;  co-operation on contingency planning for outbreaks of exotic diseases,  including agreement on a common chapter in the respective epizootic contingency  plans for foot-and-mouth disease and avian flu; and initiation of a draft  common chapter for bluetongue, which I expect to be agreed formally very  shortly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We have also got agreement on a protocol on welfare during  transport breaches, and co-operation on testing regimes for TB and brucellosis  in border areas. The strategic approach will enable further positive outcomes  to be achieved over the next year, all of which provide for meeting the key aim  of free animal movement.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Savage</strong>: I  thank the Minister for her statement. One part of the statement, which Mr P J  Bradley touched on, concerns me. What impact will increased modulation and its  related implications, as well as changes in market-management mechanisms, have  on the local farmer?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: I was very pleased that the modulation  that was introduced in our negotiations on the CAP health check meant that we  could balance our modulation against what was happening in Europe and that we  did not have to increase modulation for farmers here. I was also keen to avoid Europe&rsquo;s insisting that we return to the rural  development programme and use that modulation for what it wanted us to.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We successfully negotiated to keep the rural development  programme as it is and our modulation rates as they are so that farmers do not  experience an increase. We can, therefore, proceed as we had hoped. That was a  very positive outcome of the CAP health-check negotiations. I am very pleased  that officials and, in that instance, Minister Murphy were able to negotiate  that outcome, which benefits farmers in the North very much.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Burns</strong>: I  thank the Minister for her statement. Were the possibilities of EU changes to  the less favourable areas discussed?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: No, they were not discussed at that  meeting; however, we will discuss them in future, because EU requirements for  the less favoured areas will affect all of Ireland. We will want to discuss  what each other is doing.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will use this opportunity to plug our current  consultation. Anyone who has an interest in the issue should read the  consultation document and give us his or her views. It is very important that  everyone tie into that consultation and that views be heard.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I thank the Minister for her statement and for her pro-Union policies on milk  quotas. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Was there any further discussion on compensation from the Republic of Ireland for those farmers who were  affected by the recent dioxin scare; and why on earth was fishing not on the  agenda, too?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: Fishing was not on the agenda. We were  supposed to be talking about agriculture and rural development, but the Rural  Development Minister was not able to attend, so we stuck to agriculture. The  Member will be pleased to hear that a marine sectoral meeting will be held on  Thursday in Carlingford at which fishing will be discussed. However, the  North/South Ministerial Council agriculture sectoral meeting is generally not  the forum for discussing fisheries issues.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Compensation was not discussed. We had talked about that  and received an answer from the South, and we are carrying forward the review  to see what comes out of that. At this stage, though, I think that compensation  will not be forthcoming. However, we submitted an emergency support measure to  the EU and hope to receive money as a result of that to help us with  compensation. The Executive dealt pragmatically with the issue of compensation  and did their utmost to try to help the farmers and food processors who were  affected by that incident.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I thank the Minister for her statement. She spoke about simplifying the single  farm payment process. Did she have discussions with the unions to see how that  could be done, and does she have their full co-operation in moving the process  on?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In her statement, the Minister also referred to the state  of play with the World Trade Organization. Will she confirm that there is  fairness and balance in the discussions that have taken place at the World  Trade Organization? I ask that because it is important that the Minister and  her Department ensure that Northern    Ireland, which depends on exports for the  vast majority of its business, is treated with fairness and balance in all  World Trade Organization discussions. It is also important that other countries  do not close their borders to Northern    Ireland products.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: Single farm payments were not discussed  at the meeting. Although we spoke briefly about the CAP and the WTO, we did not  get into that detail. Obviously, if we are considering moving to a flat rate  for single farm payment, I will want to consult widely on that. However, that  was not discussed in any detail at the meeting.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I breathed a sigh of relief at the fact that the WTO failed  to reach agreement on a deal, because my fear was that the deal that was on the  table would not be fair, balanced and objective, and that it would have  disadvantaged our farmers. There were further attempts to reach agreement in  December 2008. We have taken every possible opportunity to express the  agriculture industry&rsquo;s concerns about the adverse impact of an unbalanced  agreement, and emphasised that the interests of Irish or EU agriculture should  not be sacrificed for the sake of achieving a deal.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have, obviously, discussed that with my counterparts in Dublin. I have also  discussed it with the Scottish and Welsh Ministers. Although we are all very  much in agreement, unfortunately the Department for Environment, Food and Rural  Affairs (DEFRA) takes a contrary view, and it is DEFRA that is at the  negotiating table. At times, it is very frustrating trying to get the points of  the devolved Administrations across to DEFRA, which wants to make policy  without any consultation or input from us. That is not fair, and if the WTO had  gone ahead with a deal, we would be facing a very difficult time for farmers.  We continue to insist that a WTO agreement should not be at the expense of  Irish farmers.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dallat</strong>: I  add my thanks to the Minister for her statement on a day when there seems not  to be an awful lot of business happening in the House. I want to return to the  issue of the World Trade Organization and the need to protect local farmers.  Does the Minister agree that we need to import many agricultural products? We  are not very good at growing bananas, coffee and tea. Are there opportunities,  now or in the future, for a concerted and combined effort to ensure that  agricultural products from the Third World are  protected under fair trade? I will be most grateful to the Minister if she does  not mention Peter Mandelson&rsquo;s name in her reply.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">11.15 am</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: I thank the Member for his question. I  try not to think about that individual, so I do not intend to mention him in my  reply.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member is right in saying that we need to import some  of our food, because some products that we enjoy in Ireland cannot be grown here. Equally,  we are very good at producing products such as beef, milk, pork and lamb, and  we need to stick to what we are good at. Ultimately, we will continue to export  food from the island   of Ireland that we can  grow well and we will continue to import food from developing countries and  other countries.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I believe in fair trade, but I do not believe that that  stops with imported goods: I believe in fair trade for our farmers too, and, at  the moment, they are struggling. We know about the price of milk, but dairy  farmers are not getting a return on the milk that they produce. Therefore, fair  trade works both ways. We want to see a fair price for the produce that we  export to other countries.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: That concludes questions to the Minister of Agriculture and Rural  Development on her statement.</p>
    <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="4"></a>Private Members&rsquo; Business</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">Health Provision for Older People</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Business Committee has agreed to allow up to one hour and 30  minutes for the debate. The proposer of the motion will have 10 minutes in  which to propose and 10 minutes in which to make a winding-up speech. All other  Members who wish to speak will have five minutes.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The following motion stood in the Order Paper:</p>
    <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly calls on the Minister of Health, Social  Services and Public Safety to reconfigure and enhance services for older people  to ensure that these services are integrated, person-centred and well staffed;  that the dignity of the individual is promoted; that information is  communicated effectively to patients and relatives by health professionals;  that inpatients receive a nutritional diet; and that personal care is provided  free of charge to all those with medical need. &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Mr  Buchanan.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. I see that the Health Minister is not  in his place. Have you been given any indication that he will be available  today?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Had the Member been in the Chamber earlier he would have known  that the Minister indicated that he will not be available for the rest of the  day. Apparently, the Minister is participating in a videoconference with the  Prime Minister on the current health crisis.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  Further to that point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker, I am sorry that I was not in  the Chamber to hear that statement. Does that mean that all business relating  to the Minister of Health cannot be taken today?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: It is my understanding that the two motions that the Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety was to sit in on will not go ahead.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  Further to that point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker, does that mean that the  business is not being taken solely because of the unavailability of the  Minister today?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: That is a matter for the proposers of the motion. If they wish to  move the motion, they can do so, but, if they do not wish to move it, they do  not have to do so.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  Further to that point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker, does that mean that if the  motion is moved, there will be no response from the Minister today?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: That is correct. The Executive have not nominated another Minister  to respond on the Minister&rsquo;s behalf. I call Mr Buchanan to move the motion.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Motion not moved.</p>
    <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="5"></a>Assembly Business</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. Given the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public  Safety&rsquo;s announcement that he will be unable to be present to respond to the  health-related debates today, and the indication that some of those items will  not now be moved, the Speaker has agreed, by leave of the Assembly, to suspend  the sitting for the remainder of the morning. The sitting will resume &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: On  a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. Before you move to suspend the sitting, I  wish to raise a point of order regarding the ministerial statement on  agriculture.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It has always been the policy and rule of the House that if  Members are present for all or part of a statement and wish to ask a question,  they will be called to ask a question. I was here for part of that statement,  albeit a short part. I spoke to the Clerk at Table while the Minister was still  on her feet, but, in spite of that, you refused to call me to speak. I want it  to be recorded that you refused to call me and that you have discriminated  against me in that respect. I also want the matter to be raised at the Business  Committee.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Mr Poots, you are quite right to say that it is normal practice  here that if a Member is present in the House for a statement, or part of a  statement, they are called to ask a question. The part of the statement for  which you were present was when the Minister was on her way to sit down again.  You did not hear the statement; therefore, you could not ask a question.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr W McCrea</strong>:  Further to that point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. It is a fact that the  Minister was not sitting when Mr Poots entered the Chamber. She was reading the  final paragraph of her statement when he entered, and he was refused the right  to ask a question.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">An hour was set aside for the statement and questions, and  it was closed after 22 minutes. I feel that that is an absolute disgrace, given  that we are dealing with a sufficiently weighty matter and that a further 38  minutes remained for that issue. There was no pressure of time; there was  certainly no pressure of business, and you know that. Therefore, I ask that  this matter be referred to the Speaker.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I thank the Member for his point of order. A Member should be  present for the substantive part of any statement &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr W McCrea</strong>:  It does not state that &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: A Member cannot ask a question if he or she does not know what has  gone before. That is my ruling.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr W McCrea</strong>:  Further to that point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. I ask you to tell me where  it says that a Member must be present for a &ldquo;substantive part&rdquo; of a statement.  I was told by the Clerk that a Member must be present for a statement or part  of a statement, not a substantive part of a statement.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I have made the ruling. If you wish to refer the matter to the  Speaker, you are free to do so.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr W McCrea</strong>:  I stated already that I wish the matter to be referred officially to the  Speaker.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: And so it shall be.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Maskey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. On a point of order, Mr Deputy  Speaker. Francie Molloy, a Sinn F&eacute;in Member, also requested permission to ask a  question on the Minister&rsquo;s statement. Although he missed the start of the  statement, he was in the Chamber for part of it, and it was ruled that he would  not get to ask a question. I want the Speaker to make a ruling on that matter,  as Mr Molloy was in the Chamber before the Minister finished her statement.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I thank the Member for his point of order. Those circumstances are  exactly the same as those for Mr Poots.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Maskey</strong>:  Further to that point of order. I was always of the opinion that if a Member  was not in the Chamber for the start of a ministerial statement, they would not  be heard. However, you made an earlier ruling to Mr Poots to the effect that if  a Member is present for part of a statement, they would be allowed to ask a  question. One of the Sinn F&eacute;in Members was present for part of the Minister&rsquo;s  statement, but was refused the opportunity to ask a question.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: It is the ruling of the Speaker that if a Member is in the Chamber  for part of a statement, the Speaker may call them to ask a question. In both  of today&rsquo;s instances, the Members were not in the Chamber for the substantive  part of the statement; therefore, I ruled that a question could not be asked by  either Member. I will not take any further points of order.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As I said, the sitting will resume at 2.00 pm, when the  motion on the revised recommendations report of the Local Government Boundaries  Commissioner will be moved. The sitting is, by leave, suspended.</p>

    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">On resuming (Mr Speaker in the Chair) &mdash;</p>

    <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="6"></a>Private Members&rsquo; Business</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">Local Government Boundaries</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The next item on the Order Paper is the motion on the revised recommendations  report of the Local Government Boundaries Commissioner. The Business Committee  has agreed to allow up to one hour and 30 minutes for this debate. The proposer  will have 10 minutes to propose the motion and 10 minutes to make a winding-up  speech. All other Members who wish to speak will have five minutes.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: I  beg to move</p>
    <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly expresses its concern over the  implications for strong, accountable local government and a shared future, in  light of the Revised Recommendations Report of the Local Government Boundaries  Commissioner.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At the outset of the debate, I declare an interest as a  member of Carrickfergus Borough Council.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">On 13 May 2008, DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in Ministers backed the  11-council model for local government in Northern Ireland. Subsequently,  unamended legislation was disgracefully rushed through the House. Part of that  legislation set the role and remit of the Local Government Boundaries Commissioner.  Public consultation on the revised recommendations of the Local Government  Boundaries Commission ended on 9 April, and a final decision is expected before  the summer.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I fully recognise the work that has been put into that  report to date by the Local Government Boundaries Commissioner and his team.  Therefore, none of my comments should be construed as criticism of the  commissioner or his professional team as they set about their task. Rather, it  is a criticism of the terms of reference that they were given and the way in  which the review of public administration (RPA) has been mismanaged since the  return of devolution and the emergence of the Sinn F&eacute;in/DUP axis at the heart  of the Executive.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Ulster Unionist Party has placed on record many times  and today restates its opposition to the 11-council model for local government  in Northern Ireland.  The lack of local identity provided for in the 11-council model and the  resulting sectarian carve-up between the mostly unionist north and east and the  mainly nationalist south and west concerns us. That does not lend itself to a  shared future.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>:  Allow me to develop some of my ideas, if I may.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The original aims of the RPA were sound and worthy.  However, recent developments indicate that it is becoming less and less likely  that central functions will be devolved to the proposed new councils. Reports  passed to me suggest that many Departments appear to be clinging to  responsibilities and the associated budgets &mdash; so much for strong, accountable  local government. Many people question whether the process is worth the candle.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Ratepayers pose more basic questions about whether their  rates will go up or down as a result of the review. There is little mention of  the savings that were expected to be passed to those ratepayers; what we hear  of is the costs involved in this process. However, strong local government  requires that councils have robust finances and that supposed savings are  shared by all.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: On  a point of order, Mr Speaker.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member has referred to the need for local government to  have &ldquo;robust finances&rdquo;, but the motion concerns the revised recommendations of  the Local Government Boundaries Commissioner. It must surely be outside the  motion to talk about rates bases, finances and the transfer of powers. Those  subjects are all very pertinent, but they do not fall within a debate on local  government boundaries.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I take on board what the Member has said. The Speaker affords some latitude in  debates on private Members&rsquo; motions. However, I remind Members that it is  important that they stay within the remit of the motion, at least in principle.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: To  join the dots for Mr Weir, defining local government boundaries dictates the  amount of rates that can be raised by councils &mdash; the two are directly related.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As we examine where we now are, Members should recall that  accelerated passage was originally used to force through the Local Government  (Boundaries) Bill in record speed and that the DUP/Sinn F&eacute;in axis knocked down  amendments proposed by SDLP, Alliance Party and Ulster Unionist Members, each  of which would have added weight to local identity issues considered by the  Local Government Boundaries Commissioner in coming to his decisions.  Legislation in Great Britain  requires the Electoral Commission to take account of electoral equality and  local community identity. To be more precise, its website states that:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;When making our recommendations we also take into  account community identity, convenient and effective local governance and the  electoral cycle&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The Ulster Unionist Party tabled amendments, and we  warned of the dangers of rejecting some of them. We proposed that identities  should be more readily identifiable in the ward structure; that the identities  and interests of local communities should also be recognised; and that the  commissioner should consider secure, effective and convenient local government  models. However, the DUP/Sinn F&eacute;in cabal rejected even that parity proposal.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We also sought to amend the Local Government (Boundaries)  Bill to increase the powers of the commissioner so that he would be able to  take into account local community identities, as is the case in England. We  also tabled an amendment to clause 1(2) of the Bill to remove the word &ldquo;major&rdquo;.  Again, however, the DUP/Sinn F&eacute;in cabal rejected that amendment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Was that an issue during the consultation on the boundary  review? Clearly, local identity was an issue that cropped up time and again  when the redrawing of local government boundaries and wards was discussed.  However, there remains a lack of clarity about whether the commission can use  local community identity as a factor in producing the new ward boundaries. That  is borne out by transcripts of the oral hearings. Arguments that were made on  the basis of community identity were deemed to be out of order. At the  mid-Antrim hearing on 21 November 2008, the assistant commissioner, Ian  McCafferty, said:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;I take your points about community identity, social  cohesion and so on, however, there is no regard in legislation for boundaries  to be drawn with that alone.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">In his report, Mr McCafferty stated clearly that:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;there is nothing in respect of services or social  ties specifically listed as criteria in legislation governing the review of  Local Government boundaries.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">However, when my colleagues Danny Kennedy and Ken  Robinson raised that issue during Question Time on 3 November last year, they  were told that:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;If individuals, communities or their representatives  wish to comment on the provisional recommendations, in relation to local  identities or any other matter, they have an opportunity to make  representations to the Commissioner&rdquo;. &mdash;<span class="Italic"><span style="font-style:normal; "> [Official Report, Vol 34,  No 5, p244, col 1].</span></span></p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister of the Environment repeated that pledge to my  colleague George Savage last month. The question is whether the Environment  Minister was really inviting elected Members and members of the public to make  representations to the Boundary Commission about local identity in the full  knowledge that that was not a criterion that was listed in the legislation and  that they would be engaged in a relatively futile exercise. Surely that is not  the case. At best, there is confusion about whether social ties and community  identity could have been used when the Commission drew its boundaries. At  worst, this House was misinformed by the Minister.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">What are the practical outworkings? The Ulster Unionist  Party feels strongly that the boundaries of Belfast were treated badly during the review.  Our party&rsquo;s main grievance is the bizarre transfer of the Dundonald and  Ballybeen areas to the new Lisburn and Castlereagh area instead of to Belfast, which would have  been the pragmatic choice. Dundonald and Ballybeen are on a main arterial route  into the city, and their residents are Belfast  people. I understand, to a degree, the Lisburn representatives who wish to  expand their rates base, but is that the best way to provide effective local  governance for the Dundonald area? I believe not. That poor decision is another  outworking of the DUP/Sinn F&eacute;in axis.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Ulster Unionist Party&rsquo;s response was clear in its  attempt to ensure that the new Belfast  boundaries reflected the city that exists in the twenty-first century. The  review of the parliamentary boundaries endorsed that position, recommending  that the parliamentary boundaries of the Belfast  constituencies be extended to cover areas to the north, south, east and west of  the existing city boundary. Unfortunately, the city of Belfast will be constrained by the outdated  Victorian boundaries to the east and the north, some of which date back to  1892.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I must raise another issue that is exercising many of my  constituents. Currently, there is talk of efficiency savings and cutting down  bureaucracy and administration. In many instances, that is code for  centralising service provision. The feeling in Carrickfergus and Larne, which  already have the lowest proportion of Civil Service jobs, is that teaming up  with Ballymena is likely to mean only one thing: the centralisation of many  jobs and the location of services in the bigger population centre of Ballymena.  The Social Security Agency has already announced the location of a new  processing centre there, and back-office jobs in Larne and Carrickfergus are  earmarked for transfer. A range of other services are also affected.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The plan to govern Dundonald and Ballybeen from Lisburn  with Larne and Carrickfergus in danger of being governed from Ballymena does  not bode well for strong, accountable local government, so I ask Members to  support the motion.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: It  will come as no surprise to the proposer of the motion that the DUP opposes it.  This motion is, perhaps, one of the most ludicrous to have come before the  Assembly, and there has been strong competition. It is ludicrous for a number  of reasons. First &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Cobain</strong>:  You can talk.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: Mr  Cobain will get his chance to speak later, should he desire to put together  some cogent evidence, which I would be interested to hear.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The motion is ludicrous for a range of reasons. First, the  process that is being undertaken by the Local Government Boundaries  Commissioner is ongoing. Consultation may have finished, but the final proposals  have not yet been put forward, so there is an issue even about the  appropriateness of tabling the motion.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, the motion is ludicrous because, at the end of  the day, parties across the Chamber will disagree about various aspects of the  commissioner&rsquo;s findings, which, like those of any boundary commission, will be  a bit of a curate&rsquo;s egg. For example, I welcome the numerous changes that have  been made in the proposed North Down and Ards district council area. There was  a great deal of cross-party support for those changes, and, to be fair, the  commissioner took advantage of that support. On the other hand, there are  aspects of what the commission has put forward with which I disagree, such as  the proposals for Dunmurry and for Belfast&rsquo;s  northern boundary. However, the reality is that if one puts work out to an  independent com&shy;missioner &mdash; that is how things are done in this Chamber; we are  not in the business of gerrymandering boundaries &mdash; the findings must be  independent.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, the idea that the Local Government Boundaries  Commissioner&rsquo;s decision about whether to place a town or a village within one  boundary or another has a significant impact on strong, accountable local  government and a shared future is also ludicrous. There is a debate to be had  on those issues, and had the proposer of the motion bothered to consult his  colleagues on the proposals for a shared future he would know that protections  for both communities are built into the governance arrangements, which have  also received cross-party support. The two matters are not linked.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: I  see that the Member is keen to get in, so I will give way.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I am interested in the Member&rsquo;s point about cross-community support. Is it not  true that a minority population must comprise at least 10% of the overall  population to have some of those protections, and that what we are actually  seeing is an attempt to gerrymander boundaries in order to create majority  communities that can ignore people in other places? As a result of that, we  risk turning Belfast  into a contentious city.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>:  First, if the Member knew anything about the RPA process, he would know that  the 10% threshold relates to matters of an entirely different nature. With the  best will in the world, however one draws boundaries, there will always be some  parts of Northern Ireland, such as North Down and Ards, in which heavy unionist  majorities will be created. There is no way not to create that situation.  Belfast will be balanced under these proposals &mdash; as it is under the existing  arrangements &mdash; so I am not sure how that will create a &ldquo;contentious city&rdquo;. I  notice that the Alliance Party seems very pleased at that prospect.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">With respect to some of the criticisms about the process,  questions were asked about the term &ldquo;major part&rdquo;. However, the Ulster Unionist  Party acknowledged the legislation in its submissions to the Local Government  Boundaries Commissioner, and every one of its proposals was compatible with  that legislation. Indeed, had the Local Government Boundaries Commissioner been  so minded, he or she could have made those changes. The Ulster Unionist Party&rsquo;s  submission stated:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The major part of Castlereagh, even under our  proposals, will still be going into Lisburn and Castlereagh because it is still  the major part of the territory - which is exactly what the Commissioner has  said.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That acknowledges that the party had the scope  within the process to propose changes, and, indeed, that fact was acknowledged  by the commissioners. Some of us will be disappointed about some of the  proposals, but such is the nature of an independent commissioner.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">2.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">One wonders why some of those changes were not made, when  such a case was made by the Ulster Unionist Party. However, if one looks at the  transcripts again and considers the Ulster Unionist Party&rsquo;s performance with  regard to its submissions to the Boundaries Commissioner, one will get a clue.  Indications were given about a green wedge around Dundonald, but what evidence  was provided? In fact, the Boundaries Commissioner said:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The Commissioner could not take into account such a  factor in the absence of any cogent evidence.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">If Members read the Ulster Unionists&rsquo; submissions,  they will see evidence of a complete shambles. The Ulster Unionist mayor of  Lisburn contradicted the Ulster Unionist submission on Lisburn and Castlereagh,  and two Ulster Unionist colleagues cross-examined each other on the same issue.  Furthermore, in its submission on Castlereagh, the Ulster Unionist Party stated  that Castlereagh was being decimated, but then it wanted more of Castlereagh to  go into Belfast. It seems that the Ulster Unionist Party was contradicting  itself.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At the hearings regarding Castlereagh and Belfast, we  received various bits of anecdotal evidence. We were informed that one member  had spoken to people in their offices about the boundaries. Furthermore, we  received the pertinent evidence that taxi drivers had even been asked whether  they supported Lisburn Distillery. However, not a single petition, opinion poll  or survey of the schools to which parents in the catchment area were sending  their children was produced; the evidence was appalling.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Having said that, however, there was at least some evidence  provided on the Castlereagh and Belfast boundaries. The Ulster Unionist Party  rightly decried the fact that the boundaries to the northern end of the Antrim  and Newtownabbey district councils had not been changed. However, the Ulster  Unionists did not even show up at the hearings regarding Newtownabbey and Antrim.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: Not  a single minute of evidence was given.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Boylan</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I am glad that the Minister is in the  Chamber to suffer through the debate with the rest of Members. I oppose the  motion; in fact, when I read it, I wondered where the Ulster Unionists were  going with it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In our constituencies, Members hear people&rsquo;s real concerns  about job losses, house repossessions and many other issues. Members must grasp  the public&rsquo;s opinion on the Assembly, especially in light of public expenses.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">After listening to the concerns of my constituents, I find  myself speaking on a motion such as this and wondering whether the proposers of  the motion realise what is happening around them. I do not mean to be  condescending when I say that, but Members should remember that parties and  individuals had ample opportunity to contribute to the process.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Members should be providing strong representation. Members  who are successful in subsequent Assembly elections will be voted in to  represent their constituents. I do not know whether the Members in the Ulster  Unionist corner will be representatives or not, but there will be  representation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The successful and strong Newry identity campaign managed  to retain the core identity of Newry city. I mention that because most of the  debate so far has been about Belfast. Perhaps the issue should have been tabled  as a subject for an Adjournment debate rather than a motion.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The most recent revision process, which is referred to in  the motion, provided opportunities for many people to contest the boundaries.  One of the key decisions on the future shape of local government, which was  agreed by the Executive in March 2008, was to provide a framework for stronger,  more effective and more responsive local government in the North. At the heart  of any local democracy, the administrative system must address both representative  and participatory democracy. Decisions should be based on the principle of  services being delivered to the citizen as close to the ground as possible.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The new function of community planning will ensure that,  for the first time, communities, local representatives and statutory agencies  will assist in shaping the future of their local areas in a collective and  combined manner. Regardless of the number of new council units, the most  important aspect must be effective and efficient delivery in the operation of  the councils.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Equality, transparency and value for money for the  ratepayer must be firmly embedded in the new structures. Any councillor who has  ever asked for a breakdown of exactly what a ratepayer pays will, under the  current system, not have received specific details. In future, we must ensure  that people receive value for money.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Any new council will always have majorities and minorities.  In my own area, for example, we will be in the minority, but we must work  together. The rights of minorities, whether east or west of the Bann, must be  protected. Strong safeguards, which will allow for the protection of minority  rights and the unhindered operations of the new councils, must be built into  the future governance arrangements.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">To conclude, two of the most important elements in the  delivery of strong local government are the requirements for genuine community  participation in the new councils and the need for equality and transparency in  the new structures. I remind Members that the decision on the recommendations  is not final; however, we must now decide on and continue the process of  transition. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  I agree that the new council arrangements should provide better services for  ratepayers and aim to improve the quality of life of the people who live in the  areas that the councils will serve. However, one of the concerns that arises  from the proposed 11-council model and, indeed, from the anticipated findings  of the Boundaries Commissioner&rsquo;s report is that, instead of providing what I  outlined, we shall see the Balkanisation of Northern Ireland. It is for that  reason that I support the motion.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A key issue for the SDLP with any new council arrangements  will be the governance system that will be put in place. I am sure that many Members  will agree that new councils should operate in a system of governance that can  build trust and promote partnerships, particularly between the nationalist and  unionist traditions. The system should also ensure the inclusion of smaller  groups and their fair representation in the top posts and appointments to all  outside bodies. Furthermore, the arrangements should be such that all members  of the new councils are duty-bound to put the interests of the people whom they  are elected to serve at the forefront, rather than their own narrow party  political interests. I am sure that I do not need to remind Members that, in  the old councils, we witnessed far too many bad examples of party interests  being put first. The reform of local government should move us away from that.  Furthermore, it should develop new partnerships, build trust and confidence and  build a new, shared future for the people of Northern Ireland. That will not be  realised under the 11-council model, with its proposed new boundaries.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: Will  the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  I will not give way.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As was said earlier, what we are witnessing here is a crude  carve-up of power between the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in. In its submissions to the  review, the SDLP maintained that a more appropriate model for Northern Ireland  was the 15-council model. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We are in Northern Ireland, and we can predict the make-up  of the new councils. Down and Ards have been mentioned. A new council for those  areas will probably consist of 82% representation from the unionist tradition,  approximately 15% from the Alliance Party and independents, and 3% from the  nationalist tradition. A 75% weighted majority or a 20% call-in mechanism will  not protect minorities in the event of abuses of power.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Similarly, it is likely that a new council for Ballymena,  Larne and Carrickfergus will consist of 80% unionists, 12% nationalists, and 8%  Alliance Party and others. A new council for Newry and Mourne in the south-west  will have approximately 26% nationalist representation and approximately 23%  unionist representation. Once again, in that case, unionists would not be  protected by a 75% weighted majority for voting or a 20% call-in mechanism &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  I have made my position clear in relation to that. Sorry, Mr Weir.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: On  a point of order, Mr Speaker. Is it in order for the Member to mislead the  House with the figures that he is quoting? Different figures have been agreed  at the strategic leadership board &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order, order. I ask the Member to reflect on what he is saying. Is he &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Order. Is he directly accusing the Member of misleading the  House?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: It  may well be that the Member has been misinformed; he is giving figures that are  not accurate. There has already been cross-party agreement on different  thresholds as regards both call-in mechanisms &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: He  is giving information that is wrong.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. That is not an appropriate point of order. Mr Gallagher, carry on.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  Mr Speaker &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McClarty</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Speaker. Has Mr Weir withdrawn his remark regarding the  word &ldquo;mislead&rdquo;?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member has completely clarified his point. Mr Gallagher, please carry on.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  I believe that Mr Weir should withdraw that remark, but I want to move on. I  was about to make the important point that the governance arrangements should,  in the SDLP&rsquo;s view, be based on an 80% weighted majority, with a 15% call-in  mechanism. We know that already &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  Already in place &mdash; Mr Speaker &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order, order. The convention in the House is clear. If the Member who is on his  feet does not wish to take an intervention &mdash; it is absolutely clear that Mr  Gallagher does not wish to take an intervention &mdash; the Member should not  persist.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  Thank you, Mr Speaker.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We all know about the work of the voluntary transition  committees, which have been in place for some time. I remind Members that in  Lisburn City Council, for example, the unionist block took six of the eight  posts available and excluded the SDLP from the voluntary transition committee.  Those committees are to be replaced by statutory transition committees, which  will have extensive powers. I am calling on the Minister to ensure that this  time round the appointments to the statutory committees will be based on  fairness and the principle of inclusion.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  am somewhat at a loss to understand why we are debating this motion. It seems  to me &mdash;<span class="Italic"> [Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. The Member has the Floor.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: It  appears to me that Ulster Unionists not only do not listen but do not read in  advance either. To put forward a motion that has a general complaint about  legislation passed in the House some months ago, dress it up as concerns about  the behaviour of the Boundaries Commissioner and say when proposing the motion  that it is not actually a complaint about the commissioner and his staff does  not seem to be any way of conducting rational business.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I might well agree with many of the criticisms that have  been made from the Ulster Unionist Benches of the way in which the process  operated. Certainly, as one who proposed a number of amendments to the Bill at  Consideration Stage, I agree with them about the mechanisms that went through.  However, to suggest that we can now somehow revisit it as a private Member&rsquo;s  motion and undo what was passed as legislation in the House seems to be a tad  naive. In fact &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  will be grateful to if I can hear any &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>:  Does the Member recognise that, when the legislation was going through the  House, others indicated that local identity was an area that the Boundaries  Commissioner could deal with under the current legislation? Therefore, was it  not appropriate to highlight the fact that it has not been appropriate  legislation that has allowed the commissioner to deal with those areas  satisfactorily?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member has an extra minute.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  agree with the Member that the process was not satisfactory, but that is not  what the motion says. The motion seems to be unclear as to whether it is  criticising the Boundaries Commissioner or criticising the entire process or  exactly what it is doing. The proposer complained about a sectarian carve-up.  Anyone who has observed elections over the past few years will find that people  in the west and the south are slightly more likely to vote nationalist, people  in the north and the east are slightly more likely to vote unionist, and people  in greater Belfast are slightly more likely to vote Alliance, regardless of  whether there is one, 26, 11, 15, or 17 councils &mdash; slightly more likely than  the general population. Regardless of the number of councils, that is how  people will vote. It is nonsense to suggest that the new boundaries represent a  sectarian carve-up.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">2.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Another complaint is that Belfast will be a contentious  city. Funnily enough, I thought that, back in the 1980s, there was a fair  amount of contention in Belfast. It is generally accepted that Belfast is a  significantly less contentious city than it was. As Mr Weir said, that is  because the Alliance Party holds &mdash; and has held for a couple of terms &mdash; the balance  of power in the city and is likely to continue to do so with the new  boundaries. Those Ulster Unionist fears can be done away with.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In Belfast, there are issues about whether the boundaries  have expanded enough to represent the capital city and its growth properly,  although the boundaries, in some places, are not 1890s boundaries but 1970s  boundaries, so there is good reason to examine that matter.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There are also issues about preparations for good  governance. As I understand it, the transition committee in Belfast has no  representation from Castlereagh Borough Council or Lisburn City Council,  despite the significant number of people who will transfer to the Belfast  district from those two authorities. There are issues about the better  governance of Belfast, but they are not the issues that are being dressed up in  the Ulster Unionist Party&rsquo;s claim that, somehow, Belfast will be contentious,  because it is getting realistic, modern and up-to-date boundaries.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The other key point in Mr Beggs&rsquo;s speech is his concern, as  stated in the motion, for a shared future. I am delighted to know that the  Ulster Unionist Party &mdash; or UCUNF or whatever it is called this week; the name  may have changed &mdash; is committed to a shared future, because we have not  witnessed that from the party in the past. Nor does it tally with the behaviour  of a number of Ulster Unionist councillors in different places.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I am surprised to hear Mr Ford say that. The Ulster Unionist Party is  non-sectarian. It is political in the sense that it wants to stand for all the  people of Northern Ireland. I challenge Mr Ford personally. As my record on  speaking up for a shared future shows and as my colleagues from the SDLP will,  perhaps, confirm, the Ulster Unionist Party believes in a shared future for all  the people of Northern Ireland. Is that clear?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  am delighted to hear the Member state that so clearly and specifically. We will  have to examine his record on education and the records of other Members from  his party on other matters to ascertain the validity of that statement.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Instead of whingeing about what has happened in the past,  we must now get on with the real issues, such as ensuring that local councils  have a process of governance that instils trust. That will be done by  incentivising co-operation and partnership, not by the sort of sectarian  head-count in which some Members have indulged by adding up numbers. At one  point, I thought that Mr Gallagher was going to demand that the single  prospective SDLP member of the new council area covering north Down and Ards  ought to have a veto over anything that that council might do. We have reduced  that to a 20% veto, but it must be seen that, if we are truly to build a shared  future, we will do so on the basis of building trust rather than dividing  people and creating artificial divisions in which some people are rewarded.  That is what must be done if we are to carry the changes through.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I wish to correct Mr Weir on one point. He claimed that no  Ulster Unionist turned up at the local boundary hearing for the  Antrim/Newtownabbey area. He is wrong: a local councillor turned up to  contradict the submission that had been made by the Ulster Unionist Party  centrally.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>: I  agree with many of Mr Ford&rsquo;s points. I do not know whether that comes as more  of a shock to Members on his Benches or on mine.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Today&rsquo;s debate is nothing new, in the sense that the  Assembly has debated the issue on a number of occasions. Today, we heard many  of the same arguments about what constitutes strong, accountable local  government and other issues that we have heard previously.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The RPA is one of the most important and significant pieces  of work that the Assembly will undertake. However, as I listened to Mr Beggs&rsquo;s  opening comments, it seemed that his party had had some sort of conversion or  that it wanted to stick with the 26-council model. We want to modernise local  government and make it suitable for the twenty-first century and a new Northern  Ireland that is more peaceful and stable, with an established Assembly at Stormont.  Local government must change to reflect that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The process has not been easy, and, indeed, any process  that will reduce the number of councils from 26 to 11 will not receive 100%  agreement. However, most people see the 11-council model as a reasonable  balance between the need for locality and the requirement for efficiency. That  is not to say that there are not differing views. As my colleague Mr Weir said,  there are differing views even in the Ulster Unionist Party. Some Ulster  Unionist members of Lisburn City Council argued one thing in respect of the  eastern part of the Belfast City Council area; other party members took a  different line. Mr Ford referred to a similar scenario in Antrim.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The process is not yet complete, and the final decisions  have not been taken. There was widespread public consultation after the  original recommendations and, again, after the revised recommendations. Political  parties also had an opportunity to contribute to that process. It is important  that we remain focused on the goal of achieving more efficient and effective  local government in which councils can genuinely deliver for ratepayers.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Ulster Unionist Party tabled the motion, but it must  know that the Minister cannot comment on specific arguments about boundaries  because the process is not complete and the independent commissioner still has  to make recommendations. Therefore, one wonders why the Ulster Unionist Party  put the motion forward. Perhaps today&rsquo;s debate has more to do with the fact  that the Assembly rejected an Ulster Unionist amendment some time ago than  anything else.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In recent debates on the issue, we heard much from some  Members about the lack of community or local identity and social cohesion;  however, few of those Members attempted to explain what that means. Most people  are not exercised about what council they belong to, and they will not protest  about the name of their council; they want a council that can deliver the  services that they require effectively and efficiently.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That is not to say that the local community is not  important; indeed, it is imperative that councils are not remote. However, our  primary driver should be the creation of an economy of scale and effective and  efficient local government. The term &ldquo;local&rdquo; means different things to  different people &mdash; it can refer to someone&rsquo;s street, village, town or townland  &mdash; and the new councils will not alter that in any way.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The process has been a major piece of work. We must now get  on with the job of delivering the type of local government that our  constituents want, which is one that delivers services efficiently and  effectively. In a few years&rsquo; time, people will not judge the RPA on boundaries  or names; they will judge it on how the changes have affected the services that  they receive. I oppose the motion.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McKay</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I speak against the motion. Indeed,  the motion is a bit of a nonsense, given that, as the previous Member to speak  said, the process is not yet complete. The motion has more to do with the  forthcoming European elections than any elections to new councils.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Sinn F&eacute;in believes that equality must be at the heart of  local government. Equality has not been in the remit of local government in  this place before, and we all know the history of that. For Sinn F&eacute;in, the key  issue is how local councils are governed in future, and that includes the  protection of minority communities. Our focus throughout the review of public  administration has been to reduce bureaucracy; to have strong legal protections  for minorities; for power sharing to put an end to the politics of exclusion;  and to ensure genuine community involvement in decision making through  community planning.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">People living on, and close to, the border have suffered  economically and socially as a result of partition. The fact that community  planning will be allowed to take place on a cross-border basis between the new  councils in the Six Counties and the county councils in the Twenty-six Counties  represents common sense as well as progress. We need streamlined, efficient and  effective local government that delivers for its citizens, and one that has  cohesive communities and a balance that supports effective representation. The  most important local government issues concern its operation, what services are  delivered to ratepayers and how those services are delivered. It is critical  that we get a system of local government that allows all sections of the  community to participate and work together effectively.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is regrettable that, in the initial report, the boundary  commissioner refused to look at the inclusion of the Irish language in ward  names and failed to take account of the views of many communities that want  Irish to be recognised and promoted. We want to put it on record that that  matter still needs to be addressed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">During the consultation period in my constituency of North  Antrim, Sinn F&eacute;in was the only party to call for the name of the new council in  the north-east to be changed to take account of the fact that the glens wards  form part of the council area. It is now recommended that the name be changed  from the causeway coast district council to the causeway coast and glens district  council. That is welcome because it will help tourism in our local area.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The level of agreement reached thus far represents a real  advance in how local councils are governed, in particular, and in the  protection of minority communities. Today, as we all know very well, unionists  in some councils, such as Lisburn and Coleraine, are still operating the  politics of exclusion. We now have ample opportunity to bring all of that to an  end.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Cutting the number of councils will reduce bureaucracy;  involve communities in decision-making through community planning; join up  local and central government; provide legal protections for minorities; and end  the politics of exclusion through power-sharing. At the end of the day, as  other Members &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  What about Santa? Is he real too?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McKay</strong>: I  cannot hear the Member anyway.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. Members will please address their remarks through the Speaker and not  across the Chamber.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McKay</strong>: At  the end of the day, Sinn F&eacute;in will not take any lectures from the Tory boys in  the corner. Sinn F&eacute;in will listen to the people, and what the people want is  protection for all minority communities. They also want value for money. All in  all, the proposals represent value for money and efficiency, and it is common  sense to back them. I oppose the motion because that is the only common-sense  thing to do.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McClarty</strong>:  I declare an interest as a member of Coleraine Borough Council. Under different  circumstances, the motion might represent one of the last chances to influence  the debate on the shape and meaningfulness of local government reform in  Northern Ireland. Unfortunately, to date, we have witnessed a charade of a  process that has taken place solely to solidify a DUP/Sinn F&eacute;in carve-up that  is not in the best interests of local government in Northern Ireland or of  local communities.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The proposals outlined in the revised recommendations of  the Local Government Boundaries Commissioner&rsquo;s report represent nothing more  than rubber-stamping the flawed back room deal negotiated by the DUP and Sinn  F&eacute;in. What we are left with today was agreed a year and a half ago. The Local  Government Boundaries Commissioner ensured that the agreement between Sinn F&eacute;in  and the DUP remained largely intact. There is growing concern that democratic  processes, media freedom and the best interests of the people of Northern  Ireland are being eroded to maintain the stability that the two major parties  have deigned to give us with their smiling face-off. However, in this instance,  the people of Northern Ireland and especially those of Belfast have been left  with second-best in order to appease two mutually opposed partners.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Ulster Unionist Party has long supported a 15-council  model, as that largely delineates the existing electorate and real communities.  It ensures proportionality of the electorate and citizens combined with a  single representative structure that enhances accountability of services. A  15-council model has reduced electoral confusion, for people have now to  grapple with three electoral areas; and it boosts coterminosity of services.  However, due to the DUP/Sinn F&eacute;in deal, we are now past that stage.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McClarty</strong>:  No. You did not listen to us when we put forward amendments, and I will not  listen to you now.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Throughout the process, we have witnessed Northern Ireland  being treated as a place apart, which is unfortunate. Legislation in Great  Britain requires the Electoral Commission to take account of electoral equality  and local community identity. However, the natural development and opinions of  local communities have been largely removed from the process, which is deeply  regretted. Rather than giving people influence over the shape of their new  local government, the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in have arrogantly imposed decisions from  on high.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We attempted to alter the situation by trying to amend the  Local Government (Boundaries) Bill to ensure that the Boundaries Commissioner  had the power to make meaningful changes and to take into account local identities.  However, by rejecting our amendments, the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in ensured that that  did not happen. Arlene Foster, the then Environment Minister, irresponsibly  stated that the commissioner would have the power to make meaningful changes.  The present Environment Minister, Mr Wilson, likewise told the Assembly that:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The Local Government Boundaries Commissioner can make  small or larger changes to boundaries.&rdquo;<span class="Italic"><span style="font-style:normal; "> [Official Report, Vol 29,  No 8, p351, col 1].</span></span></p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Both were wrong, as the Boundaries Commissioner  interpreted the legislation in the way that we warned that he would have to, by  concluding in his provisional recommendations report that:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;no major geographical part of any existing local  government district has been transferred&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That has left us with an absurdly constructed  framework for local government in Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">2.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The absurdities are particularly pronounced in Belfast,  where the residents of Dundonald, who use the Metro bus service and who largely  work and socialise in and associate themselves with Belfast, have been forced  into Lisburn City Council. We are led to believe that the people of Dundonald  have more in common with the people of Glenavy, Ballinderry, Moira and those  who live on the shores of Lough Neagh than they do with the people of Belfast.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although large parts of west Belfast have been moved from  Lisburn City Council to Belfast City Council, the same cannot be said for  significant parts of east Belfast. It appears that, in order to create a  super-council in Lisburn, Peter Robinson and the DUP have sold out the people  of Dundonald, and, in effect, a good deal more than that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The proposals for local government are not good for  Northern Ireland. The blatant DUP/Sinn F&eacute;in trade-offs will in no way secure  any meaningful shared future or deliver us from our segregated past. That  perpetual carve-up is no way to do business. However, it is now fast becoming  the only way that we expect government in Northern Ireland to be done, and that  is to everyone&rsquo;s long-term detriment. I support the motion.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr McDonnell</strong>:  I thank the Members who tabled the motion for doing so, because it raises an  issue about which I feel strongly. It is an issue that has affected my  constituency and my constituents, who also feel strongly about it.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>A Member</strong>:  No, they do not.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr McDonnell</strong>:  Mr Speaker, was I supposed to respond to that?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We were told that the review of public administration would  deliver all sorts of benefits. It was supposed to deliver significant savings  to people across Northern Ireland and create an improved, efficient and  effective public service. I might have got it wrong, but, from where I stand,  all those intended benefits have been abandoned, marginalised and forgotten  about. What I have seen delivered is largely a gerrymandering exercise that is  reminiscent of the bad old days and that has been worked on by the DUP in  collusion with Sinn F&eacute;in.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That is the only reason that I can arrive at to explain the  bizarre and bewildering composition of the new Belfast local government  boundary that the Boundaries Commissioner announced. I do not blame the  Boundaries Commissioner, because, whatever promises and statements were made in  the House about the Boundaries Commissioner, his hands were tied. He was told  what to do, where to go and what decisions he had to take. He was allowed to  make a few adjustments around the edges.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In the case of my constituency, which extends to the outer  reaches of Belfast, the clear instruction was that all of Castlereagh had to go  into the Lisburn area. To echo the words of Mr McClarty, that not only created  a bizarrely shaped local council area that ranged from the Dromara hills to  Dundonald and on to the shores of Lough Neagh but it provided little cohesion  or coherence and was against the explicitly stated wishes of the people. If a  person were to suggest that there is a remote sense of cohesion or common  interest between the Dromara hills and Dundonald, their sanity would need to be  considered.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Staff from my office carried out an extensive survey of the  people living in the Newtownbreda and Cairnshill area of south Belfast, which  is less than three miles from Belfast city centre. They surveyed 1,000 people  who live along the Saintfield Road, which is adjacent to Belfast, and &mdash;  surprise, surprise &mdash; 96% of them said that they wanted their area to be part of  Belfast City Council. We presented that evidence to the Boundaries Commissioner  and even backed it up with the opinions of planners and professional people who  do not have a party political axe to grind. However, all that evidence was  discarded and ignored. Therefore, people&rsquo;s opinions did not matter. The exercise  simply rode roughshod over the public interest and individuals&rsquo; interests to  ensure that a cabal was created in Lisburn.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is not only that overwhelming response&rsquo;s being ignored  that concerns me. To make matters worse, some of those same residents, who come  from across the political spectrum and represent all the political parties,  attended the hearings in Malone House and the Ramada hotel, and again they made  felt their genuine opposition. I neither stoked nor promoted their opposition.  Yes, I sought answers, but I tried to do so as objectively as possible. I did  not prompt people to attend the hearings; they came of their own volition. The  Boundary Commission ignored every one of their suggestions and requests.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I thought that the reorganisation of local government was  intended to make it work better for the people, in which case the commission  should have listened to those directly affected. There will be no shared  future, not even in a sectarian sense, although I am not looking at the issue  from that angle. Little can be shared between people in Dundonald and the far  end of Lisburn, the shores of Lough Neagh or the Dromara hills. Serious  questions must be asked of the two parties that orchestrated that carve-up.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I ask the Member to bring his remarks to a close.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr McDonnell</strong>:  I could talk about broader issues that arise from how some of the boundaries  were created, but I do not have a chance to do so today. I am deeply concerned  that the report serves no one.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  declare an interest as a member of North Down Borough Council. My colleague Mr  Ford asked me to inform the House that he meant to declare an interest as a  member of Antrim Borough Council and to convey his apologies for his oversight.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have some sympathy with those who raised the problem  under discussion. However, I am bewildered that the discussion should take such  a format. Essentially, the motion does nothing other than to look back on what  has happened. I would not be so generous as to say that it even tries to  rewrite history. The motion does not call for any action but proposes that the  Assembly express its concern. However, should the Assembly go down the route of  expressing concern, so what? What would happen next? The motion does not call  for the Minister or the Assembly to do anything.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Notwithstanding all the confusion that would have been  caused, the motion could, for example, have called for the repeal of the  legislation on local government boundaries. Equally, it could have called for,  or demanded, a rejection by the Minister of the final recommendations when they  land on his desk. The motion contains neither, so it is a waste of time and  represents a wasted opportunity.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Alliance Party was extremely unhappy with the  legislation that was passed in the Chamber last spring. The delay in the  parties in the Executive reaching agreement resulted in a curtailment of the  normal legislative process to allow the legislation to be rushed through.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My party supported a reduction to 15 rather than 11  councils because that number struck a better balance between local  representation and the need for efficient services. Some of the council  pairings, such as Fermanagh with Omagh rather than with Dungannon, did not make  sense.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The terms of reference for the Boundaries Commissioner were  too narrow, and the Alliance Party could have anticipated many of the problems  that have since emerged. However, as far as the legislation is concerned, that  ship has sailed. The Assembly followed the proper process, and the DUP and Sinn  F&eacute;in voted through the tabled amendments. Although I disagree with what they  did, that is their prerogative, and I respect their ability to do that in the  Chamber. That is democracy, and the Assembly must now move on.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The several anomalies that have emerged in the system  clearly existed last spring; none of them is new. We knew that the pairing of  Fermanagh and Omagh would be problematic, as would the establishment of a  single council area running from Saintfield to Crossmaglen, which makes no  sense. We knew what would happen in Lisburn and Castlereagh, and that Belfast&rsquo;s  council area would be too small to enable it to grow and punch above, rather  than below, its weight as a city and as a driver of the regional economy. All  the problems that were known about last spring have been confirmed, because  nothing new has been brought to the table.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I could criticise the Local Government Boundaries  Commissioner for the way in which he interpreted his mandate and the scale of  some of his modifications to external ward boundaries or even to internal ward  boundaries. However, the proposers of the motion have not gone down that route.  They have not engaged in technical discussions about what happens at a local  level, which is the meat and drink of what the Local Government Boundaries  Commissioner should be doing.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My only conclusion is that the motion is, in effect, a  retrospective whinge about legislation that was passed by the Assembly last year.  I agree with the complaints being made: it is not productive to cry over spilt  milk, especially if we are not proposing to do anything about the matter.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will make two comments on the issue of a shared future.  There has been a lot of talk about governance. I want to stress that, although  we can design all the fancy formulas in the world, nothing will get us away  from the fact that the only way to build and sustain a shared future is through  building trust and co-operation between people. For example, in North Down  Borough Council, we rely on a majoritarian vote; however, we very rarely go  down that avenue. There is a culture of trust and of working together among the  parties in that council. Establishing that culture throughout Northern Ireland  is what we aspire to.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I hear what the Ulster Unionists are saying about their  commitment to a shared future in Belfast. I would like it if, when winding on  the motion, they would give the House a commitment that a shared future is of  genuine concern to them. If the proposed new boundaries create a situation in  which Belfast happens to go nationalist, I hope that we will not see a battle  emerge between unionists over who lost Belfast. That is the essence of  sectarianism, not the essence of a shared future.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment (Mr S Wilson)</strong>: When I first read the motion, I, too &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>:  Will the Minister give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: Give me a chance to start.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Do you want to make a point of order, or are you asking the Minister to give  way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: On  a point of order, Mr Speaker. Before making a statement, do the Minister and  any other Members who also serve as councillors not have to declare that fact?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  If any Member or Minister wishes, for whatever reason, to declare an interest,  it is up to the Member or Minister to do that.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: I think that we are stooping to the depths of pettiness,  something for which the Member for East Antrim is known. Anyone in the House  who does not know that I am a councillor on Belfast City Council must be  suffering from Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease, given that the Member who sits in that  corner and who made the point reminds me of it every Question Time. However, if  it pleases the Member, I will state it: Mr Speaker, I wish to declare an  interest in so far as I am a member of Belfast City Council. I hope that the  Member is satisfied; he will probably again remind me of that fact on Tuesday  of next week.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>:  Will the Minister give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: I suppose that it will fill the time.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>:  Just in case the Member decides to report me to the Committee on Standards and  Privileges or some such body, I will state that I omitted to mention that I am  a member of North Down Borough Council.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: It is confession time now, Mr Speaker.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As many other Members have mused, when I first read the  motion, I, too, wondered what its purpose was. I thought that the motion was,  perhaps, designed to have a go at the Local Government Boundaries Commissioner,  given that it states:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;this Assembly expresses its concern over the  implications for strong, accountable local government and a shared future, in  light of the Revised Recommendations Report of the Local Government Boundaries Commissioner.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">I thought that we would hear some comments about  the report and about what the commissioner had done. Yet the Member who  proposed the motion had hardly risen to his feet when he said that he did not  wish to criticise the Local Government Boundaries Commissioner. We have to then  ask why the man is even mentioned in the motion. That is an example of the  usual hand wringing that we expect from the Member for East Antrim.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">3.00 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member for South Belfast Dr McDonnell went even  further. He said that he did not wish to criticise the Local Government  Boundaries Commissioner, yet he proceeded to say that that man had ignored  local democracy, that he had been told where to go and what to do and that he  had ridden roughshod over the views of the Member&rsquo;s constituents. If that is  not criticism, I would not like to be criticised by the Member for South  Belfast.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The implication was that the Local Government Boundaries  Commissioner must have been told what to do, where to go and how to do his job  by the Minister. I wrote to the Local Government Boundaries Commissioner  telling him of his appointment. Since that day, we have not spoken to each  other; he has jealously guarded his independence, and I have respected his  independence. That is the way it has to be. He was not told where to go or what  to do, and what he has done and how he has interpreted the rules has been  entirely his job and his responsibility.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr McDonnell</strong>:  Does the Minister agree that the Local Government Boundaries Commissioner was  given very tight instructions that all or most of Castlereagh Borough Council  had to be amalgamated with Lisburn City Council, whether that made sense or  not?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: I will come to the instructions for the Local Government  Boundaries Commissioner in a moment. The rules that were laid down were agreed  by the House, and when I come to talk about the rules, I shall demonstrate that  he did have discretion.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Major changes to boundaries were not defined. However,  given that the Executive and Assembly had decided that there would be 11 local  councils that would cover the boundaries of a certain number of existing  councils, the Boundaries Commissioner had to work inside certain parameters in  order to respect the democratic wishes of the Assembly. He could not subvert  the wish of the Assembly to have 11 councils to encompass, approximately, the  areas that had been agreed. That was the circumscription and the democratic  parameter within which he had to work.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Several Members, including Mr McClarty, said that the  debate may be the last chance for change. I see nothing in the motion that  recommends that any change should be made. The motion includes no instruction  to the Minister, there is no demand from the Assembly, and no changes are  recommended.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, the Members who proposed the motion mistakenly  think that it will be a mechanism to change what they see as the wrong  decisions of the past. If those Members wanted change, perhaps they should have  made some recommendations in the motion. If they are so incompetent in drawing  up a motion, perhaps they have only themselves to blame for what happened in  the past and for the votes that were taken in the past.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Will the Minister give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: No; I have already given way, and I want to get on to  other issues. The Member will have a chance to speak when he makes his  winding-up speech.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There seems to have been general criticism of the  Boundaries Commissioner&rsquo;s recommendations for Belfast: he has been criticised  over whether Dundonald or Rathcoole should have been part of Belfast City  Council; whether Belfast will become a nationalist city; and whether local  identity has been ignored. The Members of the party that mostly made that  criticism have had every opportunity to make recommendations and to argue their  case to the Boundaries Commissioner.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">When they went to the Boundaries Commissioner, members of  that party contradicted their own colleagues; as was pointed out, councillors  from Castlereagh Borough Council said one thing, while the Mayor of Lisburn  said the total opposite.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I shall give the House an idea of the quality of evidence  that was given by members of the party that is now so concerned with Belfast&rsquo;s  boundaries. Some of them told us that they had spoken to taxi drivers who never  took anyone from Dundonald to Lisburn. I do not believe that that was the issue  under discussion. Indeed, it shows the confusion that exists about the question  of identity.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although he did not use the word on that occasion, another  member of that party swore that he had been &ldquo;inundated&rdquo; &mdash; I am sure that  Members will be aware about whom I am talking when I use that term &mdash; by representations  from east and west Belfast. When asked whether he had any evidence of those  representations, he replied: &ldquo;Oh yes, people have spoken to me.&rdquo; What about a  petition? He said that those people wanted him to present a petition, but he  told them: &ldquo;It is OK, because I am going to the Assembly.&rdquo; His party&rsquo;s adviser  then intervened and said that it was already organising petitions, not  realising, of course, that, as the assistant boundaries commissioner had to  point out, the deadline had passed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">If that party is serious about saving Belfast, one would  have thought that it would organise itself a little better. I suspect that,  perhaps, the motion is not about change or criticism, but about covering up the  party&rsquo;s own incompetence and inability to make, as the commissioner said, a  cogent case.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There has been criticism of the Boundaries Commissioner&rsquo;s  ability to take local identity into consideration, but, although the Boundaries  Commissioner was given instructions, problems arose. The first is what is meant  by local identity. Is it something that is shared by those who gave evidence?  Is local identity measured by where people shop or by what football team they  support?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I noticed in the evidence that one Ulster Unionist Party  member said that he could not find anyone in Dundonald who supported Lisburn  Distillery Football Club. End of story. His argument was, therefore, that  Dundonald should not be included with Lisburn and Castlereagh. Is that how the  Boundaries Commissioner should make a decision on local identity? There would  have been much more criticism of the report had it recommended that, because no  Lisburn Distillery supporter could be found there, Dundonald must remain part  of Belfast. He would have made a laughing stock of himself.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That is the sort of problem that we get into when we start  to talk about local identity. How is it measured? Does local identity mean  different things to different people? When the Office of the First Minister and  deputy First Minister (OFMDFM) carried out its initial report into the review  of public adminstration (RPA), one matter that it considered was how to measure  local identity. The report said that often people do not identify with their  local council; sometimes they identify with their street, estate, town or townland  instead. That uncertainty and difficulty in defining local identity presented  the commissioner with a problem.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I noted that the Member for East Antrim remarked that the  commissioner said that, in creating a possible new mid-Antrim district council,  local identity could not be considered alone. There were provisions in the  instructions that the commissioner was given that allowed him to have  discretion where it was felt that local identity should be taken into  consideration.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The commissioner could not split townlands unless he  considered it unavoidable, but of course he had the opportunity to split  townlands in areas where he identified possible local identities. As far as  practical, he had to ensure that a district was not wholly or substantially severed  by a boundary of another district. Again, there was enough discretion to allow  him to make considerations about local identity.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The commissioner had to ensure that wards should, as far as  was practical, have the same number of electors. However, again, the  commissioner was allowed to exercise discretion if people made strong arguments  to be part of a particular ward. Therefore, I reject the argument that  instructions were so tightly worded that the commissioner was unable to  exercise discretion or to consider the subjective idea of local identity.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Many other arguments that have been made have focused on  the shape and number of local councils, and what will happen to them in future.  The House has been told that no savings have been made to date. Some Members  might not have noticed, but the councils have not yet been reorganised.  Therefore, it is difficult to measure savings. Mr Gallagher, whose science and  politics are always behind the times, said that he was concerned about the  threshold.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Minister should bring his remarks to a close.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: If he had spoken to his party colleagues, he would have  found out about that. We must wait until the final decisions are made, after  which the Assembly will discuss the matter.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Minister&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: In future, I want strong local government under  reorganised boundaries with reorganised powers.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I declare an interest as a councillor for Lisburn City Council. Today is a  grave and sorry day. It is a sad day for democracy when two sectarian parties,  aided by the fig leaf of the Alliance Party, conspire to destroy the democratic  future of Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">One benefit of the Chamber is that everything that is said  here is recorded. No amount of ridicule, fairy stories, and Members&rsquo; claims of  having been misunderstood will erase what is written in black and white. In the  future, Members will consider this debate and will assess the reasons for the  failure of our shared future. Members will decry the situation and, as Mr Farry  said, will ask what happened to Belfast, to our local towns and to our local  democracy. The people of Northern Ireland will point the finger at the parties  opposite. You have failed, ladies and gentlemen. You have failed to protect all  that is good about Northern Ireland. I was disappointed &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: On a point of order, Mr Speaker. I do not think that you  have failed. The Member should, perhaps, learn some parliamentary decorum and  not blame you for what you have not done. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  That is not an appropriate point of order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I was surprised and disappointed by Mr Wilson because when he wants a  reasonable debate, he is normally prepared to take an intervention from me and  to argue the points. Perhaps he was unable to argue the point today and,  therefore, did not take an intervention. He raised certain points on which he  asked me to comment. I will now respond. When he took issue with my colleague  Mr Beggs for criticising &mdash; or not criticising &mdash; the commissioner, he missed the  point completely.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Members to my right pointed out that when terms and  conditions are tightly set, only one or two issues can be concluded. I will  make the point time and again that if we are serious about building a shared  future, taking sectarianism out of politics, and building the future that the  Alliance Party claims to want, we must build trust. The current proposals are  not the right way to go about that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Members can make jibes, fight petty little battles and score  points on these issues, but at end of the day, it will be writ large: &ldquo;Who did  this deed?&rdquo; The answer will be the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in, and they were warned.  Frankly, I am surprised by the stance of the Alliance Party.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  The Member mentioned the Alliance Party. Does he agree with me that at a time  when that party should stand up for principles such as inclusion and fairness,  it appears to be prepared to set them aside in the hope of taking any crumbs  that are on offer from the grand alliance?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I could not possibly say what has just been said, but the Member makes a fair  point. I was about to come to the point that was highlighted by Mr Gallagher &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  If your contribution is short.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: It  will be shorter than yours, anyway. Does the Member accept that there is a  difference between the constructive role that the Alliance Party played when  engaging in debate on the Local Government (Boundaries) Bill, and simply having  a rant today, which has no effect whatsoever, other than to allow certain  people to let off steam?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I normally give way to Members when they have something useful to contribute. I  see that I made a mistake in the case of Mr Ford.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have witnessed the steady, long-term decline of the  Alliance Party&rsquo;s stance on sectarianism and a shared future. That party has  sold out for the prospect of being offered the post of Minister of justice, and  now all that its members want to do is to be friends with the two big boys in  Parliament. That is what this is all about.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  No; you have had your chance. This is about party-political posturing in order  to gain political advantage. It is a disgrace, a shame and a travesty, and,  frankly, I am astonished that that party would sink to that. Mr Farry even said  that he agreed with many of the points that have been made, but that he would  not vote for the motion.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Farry</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  No, I will not give way, because members of that party have had enough  opportunities to speak. I will address a question that the Minister of the  Environment, Mr Wilson, asked: what is the point of this debate? Mr McKay said  much the same thing &mdash; I think he used the word &ldquo;nonsense&rdquo;. The question that I  wanted to ask in an intervention to the Minister concerned whether any Minister  is bound by the outcome of any debates in the Chamber. Is there anything other than  &mdash;<span class="Italic"> [Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am glad that Mr Weir has discovered his voice. If he  wishes to make an intervention, I will allow him to do so.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: I  will ask the Member two questions. First, what is the motion calling for? How  can it bind the Minister when it does not actually call for anything? Secondly,  which of his colleagues on Lisburn City Council does the Member agree with, Mr  Crawford or Mr Dillon, who made contradictory submissions to the Local  Government Boundaries Commissioner?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  For the record, I agree with my party&rsquo;s position. Individuals may make  individual submissions. The reason that the motion was brought to the House was  to hold people to account, to put it on record that things are not going the  way that we wish to see them go, and that the current proposals are not a good  way to build a future.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Parties will rely on their mandates, but in five, 10, 15 or  25 years from now, they will have to look back. Mr Wilson spoke about Members  who reuse phrases; I will use one of which I am fond: people will rue the day  when they put the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in in charge of our democratic process. That  is the real travesty, and the truth will out.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have said in this House before that I may be in a  minority of one but that the truth is still the truth. Let us listen to common  sense. It beggars belief that some Members say that Castlereagh is not part of  Belfast but is part of Lisburn. That is nonsense. As a member of the Northern  Ireland Policing Board, I have discovered that the police stations in Dromara  and Whitehead are to close. Somehow, when the command structure was being drawn  up, those stations were connected. That sort of fallacy will lead us nowhere;  it brings places such as this into disrepute.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Assembly must start to examine how it works genuinely  with people and takes on board the views of Members. It must actively work with  people and not against them for petty, party political progress reasons. This  is not the way forward for Northern Ireland. I applaud my colleagues to my left  and I appreciate the support of Members to my right who will stand up and shout  out loud that we will not be dictated to by the massed, dictatorial voices of  the DUP/Sinn F&eacute;in axis. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I conclude by saying that when it comes to the people who are prepared to tell  it how it is &mdash; the people who can point things out in black and white, as Mr  Gallagher has done &mdash; those issues will not be sorted out through some sort of  back room deal. They will be resolved only if we can come together as fellow  Members and seek to build a future and deliver services in the most effective,  efficient and acceptable way for all the people of Northern Ireland. That is  the challenge that I put forward.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">To the Members who say that the motion is nonsense, I say:  I do not give you the liberty to tell me that what I think is important is not  important. If I wish to table a motion on behalf of my party, I will do so. You  will not silence us. This is a travesty; this is wrong; and you are mistaken.  The future will prove us correct.</p>

    <p class="H5StageHeading">Children Missing from Care</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>:  The Business Committee has agreed to allow up to one hour and 30 minutes for  the debate. The proposer of the motion will have 10 minutes in which to propose  and 10 minutes in which to make a winding-up speech. All other Members who wish  to speak will have 15 minutes.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The following motion stood in the Order Paper:</p>
    <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly notes with concern the failure of the  Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety to monitor and maintain  baseline figures relating to the number of children who go missing from care  and the number of such incidents per child; demands action to address the lack  of access to specialist therapeutic support services for these children across  all Health and Social Care Trust areas; recognises the pressure on police resources  and time in retrieving these children; calls on the Minister of Health, Social  Services and Public Safety to place greater emphasis on the needs of missing  children and to ensure that his Department accurately accounts for these  children in its role as corporate parent; and provides a clear strategy and  resources to address the reasons for these children going missing and the risks  to which they are exposed during their absence. &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Miss  McIlveen.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Miss McIlveen</strong>:  In light of the decision by the Minister of Health not to be present this  afternoon, and due to the seriousness of this motion and the fact that there  will be no ministerial response, unfortunately and reluctantly I am not moving  the motion.<span class="Italic"> </span></p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Motion not moved.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: On  a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. We are now in the ridiculous position in  which the Assembly not only has no Executive or legislative business today but  two serious motions under private Members&rsquo; business have had to be withdrawn,  yet we have two junior Ministers who are supposed to have responsibility for  children, and we are supposed to have a joined-up Executive. Will you please  discuss with the Speaker and your colleagues whether it is possible to ensure  that when Ministers cannot be present for good reasons, the business of the  House can still take place?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: It is up to Members to decide whether they wish to withdraw  motions. As the Member will know, the Speaker has already been made aware of  the situation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Motion made:</p>
    <p class="Q3Motion">That the Assembly do now adjourn &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Mr  Deputy Speaker.]</span></p>
    <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="8"></a>adjournment</p>
    <p class="H5StageHeading">Non-acute Hospital Provision &nbsp;in Armagh City</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Once again, in light of the  absence of the Minister of Health, and since the Adjournment debate pertains to  the closure of hospitals in the Newry and Armagh constituency, I will await a  date when the Minister will be present before I speak to my Adjournment topic.  Therefore, it will not be happening today.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Adjourned at 3.38 pm.</p>
