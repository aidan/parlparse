                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have received notice from the Minister of
                Culture, Arts and Leisure that he wishes to make a statement
                about the North/South Ministerial Council on inland waterways
                meeting held on Friday 23 November 2001 in Carrick-on-Shannon. I
                call the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure (Mr
                McGimpsey):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wish to report to the Assembly on the
                fourth meeting of the North/South Ministerial Council on inland
                waterways, which was held in sectoral format in Carrick-on-Shannon,
                County Leitrim, on Friday 23 November.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Following nomination by the First Minister
                and the Deputy First Minister, Dr Seán Farren and I represented
                the Administration at the meeting. In the absence, due to
                illness, of Minister de Valera, the Irish Government were
                represented by Ms Mary Coughlan TD, Minister of State at the
                Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, who
                chaired the meeting. This statement is made on behalf of Dr
                Farren also and has been approved by him.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The meeting opened with a progress report
                from the chief executive of Waterways Ireland, Mr John Martin.
                The Council noted that Waterways Ireland has continued with its
                new works and maintenance programmes. Three major navigation
                projects at Limerick, Ballinasloe and Boyle have been completed
                and opened to boats. Other major capital projects on the Grand
                Canal, the Royal Canal and the Lough Erne moorings are
                progressing, and a contract for a major road bridge on the Royal
                Canal was let recently.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council noted that work on the Erne
                system and the lower Bann continues to be undertaken on behalf
                of Waterways Ireland by the Department of Agriculture and Rural
                Development’s Rivers Agency under a service-level agreement
                which has been extended until the end of December 2001.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council noted that consultants had been
                appointed to prepare a marketing and promotions strategy. To
                complement this initiative, Waterways Ireland will arrange for a
                series of consultation seminars at various locations to
                encourage input on relevant user issues by interested parties.
                In parallel, consultants have also been appointed to develop a
                corporate image for Waterways Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Organisationally, Waterways Ireland has
                continued to establish itself, with 250 staff currently in post.
                A newly appointed director for finance and personnel has joined
                in recent weeks, and two other new directors will be taking up
                their posts shortly. Consultants have also been engaged to
                manage the recruitment process for the remaining administrative
                and technical posts.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council received a progress report on
                accommodation matters, which focused on the acquisition of
                permanent accommodation in Enniskillen, Scariff, Carrick-on-Shannon
                and Dublin. It is envisaged that the full process from selection
                of the preferred Enniskillen headquarters option to occupation
                of the chosen building will be completed by the end of 2003.
                Separate negotiations for permanent regional offices in Scariff,
                Carrick-on-Shannon and Dublin are also well advanced. The
                Council noted that the projected expenditure to the year ending
                31 December 2001 is £20·24 million, representing an estimated
                underspend in 2001 of £3·88 million. That projected underspend
                was attributed to a combination of delays in staff recruitment
                and information technology implementation, and reduced capital
                works on account of planning appeals in the Republic of Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council noted Waterways Ireland’s first
                annual report covering the period 2 November 1999 to 31 December
                2000. The report will be published shortly. The Council approved
                Waterways Ireland’s operational plan for 2002. It contains
                specific targets and incorporates the following main objectives:
                the effective management and operation of the inland navigations
                for which Waterways Ireland is responsible; the full
                establishment of the organisation; the starting of work on new
                headquarters and regional offices; and the implementation of the
                capital development programme.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The chief executive has undertaken to present
                the North/South Ministerial Council with a draft corporate plan
                at the next sectoral meeting. The chief executive provided the
                Council with an illustrated presentation of the existing inland
                waterways infrastructure. The Council received a report on the
                outcome of the recent competition to select a chief executive
                for Foras na Gaelige. The Council agreed to meet again in
                sectoral format in March 2002.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Committee for Culture,
                Arts and Leisure (Mr ONeill):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As Committee Chairperson, I express my
                pleasure at the progress made on the organisational and
                administrative aspects, and on the project work.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the most exciting projects, with
                far-reaching implications for major tourism development on the
                island, is the Ulster Canal project. Can the Minister update
                Members on the progress of that project since the last Council
                meeting in June?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGimpsey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member is aware that the two Governments
                received an updated feasibility study report, and Waterways
                Ireland’s assessment of it, for detailed consideration at the
                previous North/South Ministerial Council sectoral meeting held
                on 27 June. It is a substantial report with major financial
                implications, and we have embarked on a comprehensive assessment
                process.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We all agree that the project is exciting. It
                has clear financial implications, which means that we faced the
                difficult challenge of determining how to provide the necessary
                resources to develop it. An important aspect of the project is
                the route of the Ulster Canal. It flows through one of the most
                socially and economically disadvantaged areas, not only in
                Northern Ireland but in the Irish Republic. There is a strong
                case to be made with regard to targeting social need that would
                outweigh any negative impact of a viability study. The project
                will not stand up to a scrutiny that is concerned purely with
                pounds and pence or with viability. However, there is a strong
                argument to be made in favour of the project when the wider
                benefits are taken into account. We are currently making a
                detailed assessment of the feasibility study report. We are
                taking it one stage at a time. I remind the House that work on
                the section of the Ulster Canal that runs from Lough Neagh could
                be undertaken reasonably cheaply. We are carefully considering
                that at present. We could do that work quickly and with minimal
                cost, and that would indicate our commitment to developing the
                whole canal. However, it is a major project that will take many
                years to implement.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Hilditch:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Regarding new works and maintenance
                programmes, can the Minister assure us that all measures are in
                place to protect areas of special scientific interest,
                endangered species, protected breeding grounds and other
                environmental issues relating to inland waterways and increased
                cruising?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGimpsey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those environmental considerations are, of
                course, important factors for waterways. Looking at the
                ecosystem around each waterway is vital. For example, a detailed
                environmental impact assessment of the Ulster Canal will be
                carried out before a consensus is reached. An environmental
                scoping operation has already been completed. That applies
                continuously to all the waterways for which Waterways Ireland is
                responsible. Waterways Ireland is responsible for the
                management, maintenance, development and restoration of inland
                navigable waterways. The Member’s points are well made and are
                important for the operation of that body.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McMenamin:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My local council, Strabane District Council,
                recently carried out a feasibility study on the reopening of
                Strabane Canal, which runs from Strabane, through Donegal, to
                Derry. I ask the Minister’s Department to assist my
                constituency in every way to reopen that historic canal and
                potential major tourist attraction.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGimpsey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am not aware of the details of the Strabane
                Canal, but I will certainly enquire about it in the Department,
                to find out what it knows and what are its plans for the canal.
                Obviously, we have a long way to go with regard to inland
                waterways and potential navigable waters in Northern Ireland to
                catch up with the Irish Republic. While the focus is currently
                on the Ulster Canal and the Lagan navigation, the Strabane Canal
                undoubtedly merits a closer look.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The aim of this relatively short Bill is to
                provide much-needed additional help and support for carers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As announced in the Programme for Government,
                my Department is developing an overall carers’ strategy in
                consultation with various statutory bodies, voluntary
                organisations and carers. I expect to receive the report and
                strategy proposals by the end of the year.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The aim of the strategy is to identify
                practical matters that will make a real difference to the lives
                of carers. In the meantime, the Bill will allow support to be
                provided to carers in a way that is not possible under current
                legislation. The original title of this Bill was ‘Proposals
                for a Carers and Disabled Children Bill’, and a consultation
                document with that title was issued last March to a wide range
                of interested parties. Responses to the consultation indicated a
                broad welcome for the proposals, particularly by organisations
                representing carers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Carers play a vital role in looking after
                those who are sick, disabled, vulnerable or frail. It is
                estimated that there are 250,000 carers here, and that 18% of
                households in Northern Ireland have a carer. Without them, many
                more elderly, frail, sick or disabled people would need the
                support of the statutory services, and might need to enter a
                residential or nursing home or go into hospital.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Caring can be stressful and can involve
                sleepless nights and physical and emotional exhaustion. If we
                want carers to continue in their role we must ensure that they
                feel valued and that they have access to high- quality, reliable
                and responsive support from the statutory and voluntary
                services. It is crucial that carers can make informed choices
                about the extent of their role. It is also vital that they
                maintain their own health and well-being and have sufficient
                freedom to maintain other relationships, interests and
                commitments alongside their caring responsibilities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Carers need to feel informed, prepared and,
                where appropriate, they must be trained for the tasks involved
                in caring. They must have a say in the way that help is provided
                and have their expertise recognised. Health and social services
                trusts can already do much within existing community care
                legislation to increase flexibility and choice for carers, but
                legislative obstacles prevent them from making provision that
                could be of direct benefit to carers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The way in which the current legislation is
                cast prevents carers from receiving help in their own right. For
                example, where a person who needs care has been offered, but has
                refused, a community care assessment, it is not possible for a
                trust to assess the carer’s needs, even if that is what the
                carer wants.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bill will give carers a statutory right
                to</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;an assessment of their ability to
                provide and to continue to provide care for the person cared
                for.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Under the Bill, health and social services
                trusts must take into account the results of that assessment
                when deciding what services need to be provided to the person
                being cared for and to the carer. For the first time, therefore,
                trusts will have the power to provide services to a carer
                directly, and that power will prevail even if the patient cared
                for has refused an assessment or actual services. The services
                can be wide-ranging and can include any provision that a trust
                considers would help the carer to provide care. That might take
                the form of physical help such as assistance around the house, a
                mobile phone or other forms of support such as training or
                counselling.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bill includes provision to enable the
                Department to make regulations that allow health and social
                services trusts to issue vouchers for short-term breaks for
                carers. Vouchers will enable the carer to take a break while
                someone else provides the services for the person cared for. To
                allow flexibility the regulations will include provision for the
                vouchers to be expressed either in money or by the delivery of a
                service for a certain period. That creates flexibility so that
                the carer can arrange for replacement care in ways and at times
                that are best suited to his or her needs.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bill will also amend the Children
                (Northern Ireland) Order 1995, giving someone with parental
                responsibility for a disabled child the same statutory right to
                an assessment of his or her ability to provide and to continue
                to provide care for the child. A health and social services
                trust must take into account the results of that assessment also
                when deciding what services to provide under the Order. The
                voucher scheme will allow the carer of a disabled child to take
                a break also.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department of Health, Social Services and
                Public Safety introduced a direct payment scheme in 1996. Direct
                payments are cash payments given to persons in lieu of services
                that would otherwise have been arranged for them by trusts, so
                that they may arrange the provision of their own services.
                Direct payments give greater flexibility to service users,
                allowing them to make arrangements with providers of their
                choice and at times that are convenient to them. So far, the
                scheme has covered only those personal social services for
                adults provided under the Health and Personal Social Services
                (Northern Ireland) Order 1972. The Bill will make the scheme
                available to carers also. Other service users who will be
                entitled to direct payments following an amendment to the
                Children (Northern Ireland) Order 1995 include a person with
                parental responsibility for a disabled child, a disabled person
                with parental responsibility for a child and a disabled child
                aged 16 or 17.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Clauses 8, 9 and 10 contain technical and
                formal provisions relating to the commencement and
                interpretation of the Bill, and which enable the Department,
                through the regulations, to make any necessary or consequential
                provision.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am sure that Members will have points to
                raise, and I will try to answer as many of them as possible in
                my winding-up speech. If there are any points to which I cannot
                respond, I will write to the Member concerned. The Bill is
                targeted at improving the well-being and quality of life of
                those receiving care and of carers, who make sacrifices to care
                for relatives or friends. I commend it to the Assembly.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Health, Social
                Services and Public Safety Committee (Dr Hendron):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I apologise for missing the initial part of
                the Minister’s address. The brevity of the discussion on the
                statement about the North/South Ministerial Council meeting
                caught me out.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As Chairperson of the Committee for Health,
                Social Services and Public Safety, I welcome the introduction of
                the Bill, and I look forward to considering it during the
                Committee Stage. As with all proposals for legislation, the
                Committee is carrying out its own consultation exercise.
                Although the legislation was welcomed generally, several points
                were raised about its implementation. It would be inappropriate
                of me to mention those in great detail today, but it might be
                helpful to the Minister if I were to mention some of them
                briefly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bill proposes to give boards and trusts
                the power to provide services for carers, but there is no
                requirement for them to do so. The power to supply services is
                meaningful only if there are sufficient resources to meet the
                demand. The Committee will wish to consider this matter
                carefully. The Department claims that the proposals are broadly
                cost-neutral, but significant resources may be required to
                undertake assessments of carers’ needs. Resources will also be
                needed to finance the extra services that will be required
                following the assessments. The administration of the direct
                payments scheme will also add to the cost.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The voucher scheme is to be welcomed, but the
                availability of sufficient high-quality respite care places is a
                concern. Before the voucher scheme is introduced, we must be
                sure that enough places are available, or expectations will be
                raised that cannot be met.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The general opinion of boards, trusts and
                interested organisations is that the proposals will not prove to
                be cost-neutral as the cost of administering the assessment
                process must be met within existing resources. Current resources
                do not meet the identified need, so the expectations of carers
                may be raised at the assessment stage but may not be fulfilled
                because of financial constraints. The legislation must be backed
                by adequate finance. Increased workloads without increased
                funding will lead to cuts in services elsewhere.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The complexity of general and financial
                accountability, which accompanies the co-ordination of direct
                payments, would require a change in the structures and an
                increase in personnel to manage the payments. Uptake for the
                introduction of direct payments has been low. The Bill does not
                make any reference to the provision of support services for
                clients or carers who receive direct payments. An independent
                living support group might be needed to support carers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although the legislation gives the trusts the
                power to provide service for carers, it does not impose a duty
                to do so. Carers’ views and their ability to care form an
                important part of all assessments in social care. When a social
                service is provided it is done so in agreement with clients and
                carers. Some trusts feel that the proposal to give them the
                power to run short-term voucher schemes must be explored in more
                detail. Pressures in the social care market might limit carers’
                and clients’ choice. It is interesting that Mencap Northern
                Ireland is not sure whether any real change can be achieved by
                imposing a duty to provide services based on carers’
                assessments.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Carers should be offered an assessment of
                their needs, rather than their having to ask for one. Efforts
                should be made to ensure that carers are aware of their right to
                an assessment. The Carers’ National Association (Northern
                Ireland) says that, since the introduction of ‘Guidance on
                Carers’ Assessments’ in 1996, experience shows that most
                carers who are in touch with health and personal social services
                have not been informed of their right to ask for an assessment.
                Since the onus is on the carers to ask for an assessment, they
                do not have a proper opportunity to avail of the provision. This
                seems to be the real difficulty with the current provisions —
                even more than the fact that the right to an assessment is based
                on guidance, rather than statute. Carers and carers’ groups
                feel that, rather than the onus being on carers to request the
                assessments, trusts should be required to offer an assessment
                when they identify someone who is providing, or intending to
                provide, regular and substantial care.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Carers’ National Association (Northern
                Ireland) welcomes the recognition that carers need proper
                support to undertake their work and continue in their roles. It
                also welcomes increased access to creative and responsive
                support services that enable carers to be confident and
                effective in their roles and maintain a life outside of caring.
                However, if most carers are to continue to fulfil this function
                effectively, they will need good-quality, tailor-made services
                to be delivered to the person being cared for. Most critically,
                that may include services that enable carers to take short
                breaks or have respite from caring. It is difficult to envisage
                a large range or volume of services that would support the
                carer.</p>

                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It seems that the proposals for young carers
                and disabled parents are designed to support young carers as
                children, rather than carers. The Carers’ National Association
                (Northern Ireland) wholeheartedly welcomes that approach.
                Advocacy might be needed to ensure that support is genuinely
                geared towards freeing young carers up rather than tying them
                down. It is interesting that the Carers’ National Association
                (Northern Ireland) feels that it would be valuable for everyone,
                including the Health Committee, to hear directly from young
                carers and the organisations that work closely with them in
                Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Children’s Law Centre broadly supports
                the Bill, but it made several comments on the provision of
                services to young carers. The Bill is not resource- neutral and
                must be backed by adequate finance. Ring-fenced budgets are
                needed to meet the needs of young carers aged 16 and over who
                would be entitled to an assessment under the proposed Bill, and
                of young carers who are assessed as being children in need under
                the Children (Northern Ireland) Order 1995. The proposal to
                entitle 16- and 17-year-olds to request a carer’s assessment
                and to receive direct payments is welcome, and I hope that it
                will lead to more flexibility and choice for young people. I
                look forward to discussing those and other matters with my
                Committee colleagues during the Committee Stage of the Bill.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McNamee:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle.
                Cuirim fáilte roimh an Bhille seo ón Aire Sláinte agus ba
                mhaith liom a rá ar dtús go bhfuil géar-ghá leis.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Bill. There is a real need for
                such a Bill, given that successive Government policies have been
                aimed at reducing the number of people in residential care. One
                such policy was aimed at improving the quality of life of those
                who need care by encouraging their families to care for them at
                home with professional assistance. However, to date, the
                Government have not provided the necessary assistance to enable
                carers to provide that support, nor have they properly
                recognised the enormous commitment and dedication of carers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must examine briefly the role of carers,
                particularly of individuals who care for a family member.
                Although caring might not involve constant attendance, it is a
                24-hour responsibility, which, for those providing long- term
                care, is ongoing. The state does not give sufficient recognition
                to their role and their contribution to the welfare of the
                person whom they care for, nor has it recognised the economic
                value of those carers to the Health Service. When a person is
                cared for at home as opposed to a residential institution, the
                state makes an enormous saving.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Bill and its provision of
                support and training for carers to enable them to continue their
                good work. I especially welcome — and perhaps the Minister can
                clarify this issue — the financial assistance to enable those
                who provide long-term care to take a break. Carers carry a heavy
                burden, because caring is a 24-hour responsibility that can last
                for weeks, months or years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will the Minister ensure that financial
                assistance, training and support will be available to all carers
                and that the system of assessment will be clear and easily
                understood? When undergoing assessment, carers should not feel
                that they are being scrutinised, examined, or questioned about
                their ability. They should be encouraged to avail of the help
                being provided. Go raibh maith agat.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs Courtney:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I apologise for not being in the Chamber at
                the start of the debate. I welcome the Bill. It is taken for
                granted that carers play a vital role looking after those who
                are sick, disabled, vulnerable or frail. As the Minister has
                stated, there are over 250,000 carers in Northern Ireland, and
                18% of households here contain a carer.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bill’s objective is to give a statutory
                right to a carer’s assessment, and that will enable them to
                receive adequate payment for caring. This is a change. Many
                families never got that type of support and depended on the
                younger members in the family to look after a parent or relative
                who was disabled or incapable of looking after themselves.
                Often, children had to look after a person and make sure their
                needs were attended to before they went to school or could even
                think about their own needs. That is why it is important that
                the Bill is passed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Trusts will have a statutory obligation to
                carry out assessments, and there will be an onus on them to
                provide the necessary help for carers. That is why we should
                support the Bill.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must recognise that the finances are not
                something that we can run away from — they must be provided.
                Training for the carers must also be provided. We must be
                careful that carers who are in a vulnerable position, especially
                16- and 17-year-olds and parents with disabled children, have
                sufficient training and financial support to enable them to do
                what they are trying to do.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The short-term voucher scheme will be
                welcome, but the problem is that there are not enough respite
                care spaces available. It is all very well to give the carer a
                break, but if there is nobody to provide cover, or there are no
                respite care spaces available, it becomes extremely difficult to
                provide that break. Nevertheless, this is a step in the right
                direction. I ask the Minister to take on board the fact that
                there must be some kind of financial compensation given to
                trusts to enable them to carry out assessments accurately, and
                with the knowledge that the carer will get the help required. If
                it is necessary to bring someone in to care for a person on a
                short-term basis, that is what should happen.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If we get these things into place, and if the
                Minister and the Committee take responsibility for ensuring that
                finance and training are available, I welcome the Bill. It will
                make a big difference to people’s lives. We all are aware of
                family members who have cared for people without any recompense.
                Their task has been made much more difficult by what seems to
                them to be an uncaring health board that was unwilling either to
                give an assessment or to go along with the terms of an
                assessment that was given. I am happy to support the Bill, and I
                look forward to its introduction.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For somebody who is 79 that seems a long time
                away. However, many of my constituents fall into that category,
                and the number is increasing. As the years go by, there will be
                a higher proportion of people in their seventies, eighties and
                nineties, provided that we have people who need them and feed
                them. Those people are nearly always family members, and the
                Bill recognises their sacrifices. It would be churlish and
                lacking in understanding were we not to support the Bill and its
                motivation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many people in my constituency worry about
                having to sell their homes in order to provide funding for
                commercial care. That is an enormous problem. I understand why
                people who struggle to pay their mortgages and support their
                families resent that owners of a valuable asset, in the form of
                a home, do not necessarily fund their own care. It is
                politically impossible to accept that funding should be given
                under those circumstances, but perhaps a compromise could be
                reached, one that represents good value and the wishes of
                elderly people and their families and allows them to stay in
                their own homes for as long as possible. The provision of
                assistance could prove advantageous for the families, the old
                people and, indeed, society.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not have a magic answer as to how that
                could be achieved, however, perhaps an understanding of its
                concept, which is demonstrated so well in the Bill, could be
                developed to the greatest degree possible. Thank you.</p>

                the debate. I was delighted to hear that the Committee for

                Committee Stage the important points that were raised by Dr
                Hendron. In the past, I have been grateful to the Committee for
                its assistance in bringing forward legislation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department will publicise widely the
                right to a carer’s assessment and will make carers aware of
                their rights. That is important.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir John Gorman raised the issue of nursing
                care. I shall introduce legislation in the future regarding
                nursing care, so I shall answer his question then. Following the
                Budget announcement, free nursing care will be available once
                the legislation is in place.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McNamee raised the issue of recognition of
                the role that carers perform. The Bill goes some way towards
                recognising that role. I was happy to make that point this
                morning; it is important that such a point be made. We
                specifically sought to give recognition to the important role of
                carers by enshrining their right to an assessment in law.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The carers strategy, which is being developed
                in full consultation with carers and their representative
                organisations, will seek to make a practical difference to their
                lives by putting in place some of the support structures that
                they need. In the context of that developing strategy and the
                proposals that I hope to have brought forward to me by the end
                of the year, we will look at many of the other resource
                questions raised by the Chairperson of the Committee for Health,
                Social Services and Public Safety, Dr Hendron, and Mrs Courtney.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the issue of young carers, it is important
                that young people are not faced with such responsibility for the
                provision of care that their own welfare is prejudiced. Trusts
                need to ensure that the person cared for is receiving sufficient
                services so that no one aged under 18 is undertaking a regular
                and substantial caring role that adversely affects his general
                welfare. Services should be provided to parents to enhance their
                ability to fulfil their parental responsibilities. Existing
                departmental guidance on the assessment of need under the
                Children (Northern Ireland) Order 1995 draws attention to the
                needs of young carers. Guidance that will be prepared under this
                legislation will reinforce this important point.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs Courtney also raised the question of
                respite care spaces. Before the voucher scheme is introduced, we
                will consult further on the type of respite care needed. Not all
                of this will be residential, because carers also need access to
                short-term and emergency respite care. This will be addressed.
                People will be made aware that this is happening before the
                vouchers are brought forward. It is important that people know
                what is available.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In relation to the imposing of duties on
                trusts, the resources will always be finite, and they must be
                prioritised toward those whose needs are greatest. It is
                important to know that if there is no similar duty on trusts for
                other services, it would be difficult to bring that forward here
                in this respect.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that that covers the variety of the
                points that Members raised today. If I have missed any points, I

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I am
                concerned about appointments to Invest Northern Ireland, the
                agency that is being set up under the Bill. Last week it was
                reported in ‘The Irish Times’ that the posts of director of
                business international and director of corporate services for
                Invest Northern Ireland would not be publicly advertised.
                Equality Commission guidelines state that all new posts should
                be advertised as widely as possible and should be subject to
                open competition. This is a matter of serious concern and
                disappointment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of
                Employment) Regulations 1981 (TUPE Regulations), which cover the
                protection of contracts with transferred employees, has been
                cited by the Department as justification for not advertising
                these posts. Although we all support workers’ rights, TUPE
                Regulations should not be used to sidestep equality obligations.
                No doubt the Department has checked out the legal position and
                will be able to say that the law has not been broken. However,
                we must move away from a minimalist position and attitude, and
                remember that we are leaders in society. The Assembly and
                Government Departments need to set and maintain the highest
                standards. Is this the new beginning that we were all promised?
                What message is being sent out? Fair employment and equality
                issues have been at the centre of politics, and indeed at the
                centre of the political conflict in the North of Ireland, for a
                long time. Those issues have been central to the make-up,
                activities and policies of the development agencies,
                particularly the IDB and LEDU. What does the Department do? It
                simply continues on in the same old failed ways of the past.
                That is not good enough.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Invest Northern Ireland will play a central
                role in industrial development in the future, and it is crucial
                that we start with a clean slate and get the structures right
                from the beginning. Equality obligations and the need for
                openness and accountability have been the subject of numerous
                discussions with the Minister and with departmental officials.
                They are all well aware of the concerns of Members on this
                issue. It appears that those concerns have once again been
                ignored, and instead we are being given empty promises and empty
                rhetoric on the issues of equality, fairness, openness and
                accountability.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I urge the Minister and the Department to
                rethink the matter and to open up these two posts to open
                competition as obliged by the Equality Commission guidelines and
                section 75 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998. Go raibh maith agat.</p>

                had several opportunities to discuss the amalgamation of the
                industrial promotion agencies. All parties in the House have
                given the matter their full support and wish it every success.
                The sooner the legislation is passed, the better. Anything that
                the House can do to encourage that should be taken on board.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee for Enterprise, Trade and
                Investment has already met with the new board. However,
                Committee members have not yet met with the chief executive
                designate, Mr Morrison, and we look forward to that. I am
                concerned about the make-up of the board. I am surprised that of
                the eight members who have been appointed so far, only one is a
                woman — and a very capable woman at that. The reason we were
                given was that there had been very few applications from women.
                I subsequently discovered that at least one very capable woman
                from my constituency of South Down had applied, and I am
                surprised that people of her calibre were not considered.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am also concerned that there is an urban
                bias in the make-up of the board. I hope that this is a
                temporary hiatus, and that when new members are appointed an
                attempt will be made to spread the positions around the
                Province. We still have this &quot;the world ends at Glengormley&quot;
                syndrome, or if we are feeling really adventurous, the world
                ends at Dunmurry. Many might believe that to be true, but there
                is much talent in rural Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like to see people from Fermanagh,
                north Antrim or south Down being considered for appointment to
                this board. I am concerned that the great and the good and the
                usual suspects will be appointed, and much of the talent that is
                out there will not be harnessed. I urge the Department, when it
                considers the additional appointments, to try to ensure a
                spread.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Apart from that one concern, this is very
                good news for industrial promotion in Northern Ireland. It is
                long overdue, and the sooner it is implemented the better.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In common with Dr O’Hagan and Mr Wells, I
                want to see Invest Northern Ireland up and running and
                functioning at full speed. We need it badly, and we need it
                yesterday. In the light of the events of 11 September, we need
                to redouble our efforts on jobs.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I share the concerns about directors or key
                executives being appointed without public advertisement. While
                we must protect jobs, and while the acting director of IDB and
                the chief executive of LEDU are very worthy and capable people
                who perhaps deserve the jobs, it would have been better if the
                appointments had been made after a process of public
                advertisement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am also concerned about the ability of
                civil servants to join Invest Northern Ireland and then change
                their minds two or three years later. That might not be in the
                best interest of Invest Northern Ireland. It might create a
                situation of instability that would last three or four years. We
                should be looking to the long term, and trying to ensure that
                the people who take the jobs today will stay in them as long as
                they have a contribution to make.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Like Mr Wells, I am concerned about the
                membership of the board of Invest Northern Ireland. I do not
                wish to show disrespect to the very worthy people who have
                already been appointed, but we need to ensure that the very best
                and most able people in Northern Ireland, or indeed elsewhere,
                are on that board to make sure that it can engage in business
                development at a world-class level. If we miss that opportunity,
                Invest Northern Ireland may not function in top gear. I urge
                those responsible to appoint to the board the best people
                available to ensure that the organisation hits the ground at
                full throttle in April 2002.</p>

                remarks made by Dr McDonnell and Mr Wells on the concept of a
                single agency and the important role that it will play in
                ensuring the future well-being of Northern Ireland. The specific
                issue that Dr McDonnell, Mr Wells and Dr O’Hagan raised is a
                matter for the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First
                Minister. The Committee for Enterprise, Trade and Investment, of
                which Dr O’Hagan is a member, has already acknowledged that.
                Sir Reg Empey informed the Assembly during last week’s
                Consideration Stage that he had referred the correspondence he
                had received on the matter to the Office of the First Minister
                and the Deputy First Minister for consideration. I have no
                further comment to make on that, other than to say that this is
                not a case of empty rhetoric and empty promises. This is about

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am sure that all Members would agree that
                the following remarks by teachers sum up the profession. The
                teaching profession is charged with the education of all our
                young people to carve them into citizens of the twenty-first
                century and the demands that society will put on them. It is
                recognised by us all that teaching is by its very nature a
                vocation. Teachers in schools are vital contributors to the
                future. A male teacher said that</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;A teacher affects eternity. He can

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is all very well until one sees how the

                does not give them equal opportunity.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To be eligible for the threshold allowance,
                teachers must be on point 9 of the pay scale for experience and
                qualifications before or on 1 September 1999. That assumes that
                long service equals quality teaching. All Members know that that
                is not always the case. Young teachers who are newly qualified
                or have up to six years’ experience are not eligible for the
                threshold allowance. The Government have launched a highly
                publicised campaign to draw graduates into the teaching
                profession and to attract more male teachers into primary
                schools. However, the Government then introduce a threshold
                allowance for which those teachers cannot qualify because they
                do not have enough experience.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The threshold assessment (Northern Ireland)
                does not give young teachers the opportunity to apply for the
                salary uplift. Graduates are being encouraged to join the
                teaching profession, only to be told that they are too young —
                that is a nonsense. We need to decide what we want from young
                teachers. Everyone knows young teachers who are well qualified,
                and that their inexperience does not inhibit them from being
                good teachers. That must be recognised, yet it is not.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some young teachers are studying for
                professional qualifications so that they can become head
                teachers. That means that they will be the future leaders of our
                schools. Despite that, they are told that they cannot be
                rewarded under the threshold assessment. Young teachers’
                pursuit of further qualifications shows their commitment. They
                return to university to obtain diplomas in education or masters
                degrees, in their own time and at their own expense, because
                they want to enhance their qualifications. Such people, who are
                hungry for further educational awards, are being told that they
                do not qualify for the threshold allowance. This is
                disappointing to young teachers and has the potential to
                demotivate them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must recognise that the assessment also
                affects principals and vice-principals, who are not entitled to
                a threshold payment even though they assess other teachers. A
                decision by them that a teacher is not eligible for the
                threshold payment can be overruled by an external verifier. We
                are paying such verifiers £240 per day to decide whether to pay
                teachers £2000. We must recognise those points. The reason that
                I raised the issue of young teachers rather than that of
                principals and vice-principals — and most people would agree
                with me — is that the latter case has been well argued.
                Principals and vice-principals should receive the payment also.
                We have not focused on young teachers, and we must do so.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As regards redundancy, teachers who reached
                point 9 by 1 September 1999 can take a redundancy package or
                qualify for the threshold payment. A long-term substitute
                teacher can qualify for the payment, but a young teacher cannot.
                That does not make any sense, and there is no equality of
                opportunity.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Teachers who have accepted redundancies or
                who have been substitute teachers for a long time were assessed
                according to their length of service. It was not about the
                quality of their teaching, as mentioned in the quotations that I
                cited from ‘Threshold Northern Ireland’ earlier. The length
                of time that a teacher is in a job suggests nothing other than a
                commitment to that job. One person is not necessarily better
                than another because he has been in his job longer. We have to
                examine the matter from the young teachers’ perspective and
                consider why we use this type of assessment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Four core standards have to be met: core
                values, understanding of the curriculum and professional
                knowledge; teaching and assessment of learning; contribution to
                raising standards through pupil achievement; and effective
                professional development. When teachers qualify, they sign up to
                the Jordanstown agreement, irrespective of their age, and each
                of the core standards is written into that agreement. Therefore,
                when a newly qualified teacher signs up to the agreement he is
                effectively stating what he wants to achieve. He has decided to
                teach in order to achieve those four standards. However, when it
                comes to giving someone a threshold payment, a teacher is told
                that because he had not reached point 9 on the salary scale on 1
                September 1999 he is not eligible. Once again, this is about
                length of service; it is not about quality of teaching.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is the feeling that some perverse
                judgement is taking place. The Regional Training Unit is seen as
                having set up the scheme to acknowledge length of service by
                teachers. Once a person qualifies as a teacher and goes to a
                school, he signs up to the Jordanstown agreement, which
                incorporates the four standards.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to return to principals and
                vice-principals, as I know there are several of them in the
                Chamber. In smaller schools, the wages of a senior teacher can
                be very close to those of the vice-principal or principal —
                the difference can be only £200 per annum. It is a disgrace,
                particularly given the duties and responsibilities of
                vice-principals and principals. That nonsense must be changed.
                There is no justice, equality, or opportunity for
                vice-principals and principals. To add insult to injury, a
                principal’s assessment of applications for threshold payments
                can be overruled by someone who is paid £240 a day to carry out
                assessments. We need to value the leaders in our schools — the
                principals and vice- principals. They are there because of their
                qualifications and experience. They have shown that they are
                good teachers and have gone on to become leaders in the schools.
                We must recognise that by recompensing them appropriately.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Boards of governors, who have the
                responsibility for managing schools, have no authority in
                relation to the threshold assessment. They are not asked for
                their opinions, nor are they allowed to give them. This is a
                dichotomy, and it raises the question of where the money will
                come from for future assessments. The Department of Education is
                funding threshold payments and will continue to do so for a
                two-year pilot period. After that we do not know will happen.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">People are concerned that schools are being
                run on local management of schools (LMS) budgets — and I know
                that the Minister is examining that aspect at the moment.
                However, many schools are strained, and it would be unthinkable
                to fund threshold payments from LMS funding. Two difficulties
                would result: first, that of teachers making other teachers
                redundant, secondly, in many cases the redundancies would be
                those of young, vibrant professionals who were not eligible for
                the threshold payment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I ask the Minister and the Department to deal
                with the problems so as to recognise the value of the young
                people who are being educated in our schools and universities to
                be teachers and leaders. It is a case of denying them £2000
                because they were not at point 9 on the scale by September 1999.
                It is a disgrace that we are not looking at the quality of
                teachers but simply saying whether they are experienced enough.</p>

                he cannot he will read Hansard and will answer Members’ points
                in writing.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In moving the amendment I was endeavouring to
                highlight the need to deal with the problem facing young
                teachers. Billy Hutchinson covered many of the points. It is
                important that those who negotiated to reach this position
                should take another look at what we are being told by young
                teachers who feel that they will not receive equality of
                treatment. They want to know what they should do, and what will
                happen in a couple of years’ time. I would like a review of
                the matter soon. Talking about the situation might help, but it
                may not be enough to assist those who have been speaking to us
                and who wish to be heard.</p>

                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The current threshold arrangements were
                agreed last January by the teachers salaries and conditions of
                service negotiating committee. No doubt, teachers looked forward
                to a significant pay rise after years of erosion of their
                salaries. However, several teachers have expressed serious
                concerns about the agreed threshold arrangement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Teachers pointed out that the completion of
                the application form added another bureaucratic task to their
                considerable workload. In addition, new teachers receive no
                incentive for the first eight years of their career. Some regard
                the threshold as a form of performance related pay. That is a
                dangerous road to go down, because teachers’ results depend
                upon a wide variety of factors, including pupils’ social and
                educational needs at the start of the period under examination,
                the circumstances of the school and the neighbourhood.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department of Education has yet to
                publish its views on educational added value, which would be
                useful as a means of measuring the true educational performance
                of a given school.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another fear that teachers expressed about
                the threshold arrangements was the prospect that a quota to
                limit the number of teachers who would be eligible for the
                payment might be introduced. They feared that that would lead to
                jealousy and destroy team spirit in schools. We know how
                essential it is that teachers work together. Gone are the days
                when a teacher worked alone in the classroom.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, teachers said that they needed to
                carry out much more research on the issue, and that the
                Department should examine where the money would come from to
                meet the needs of younger teachers, who might otherwise be put
                off the idea of working at a school at all. We do not want to
                affect those entering a profession that has such important
                outcomes. Education influences everything from industry to
                pupils’ well-being and ability to survive in life. Therefore,
                teachers’ jobs are of prime importance.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have been examining the LMS system in the
                context of the overall schools’ budget. At present, the
                schools’ budget is a so-called flexible budget. However, no
                matter how flexible it is, the budget comes from the block
                grant, and it is inadequate. Considerable top-slicing occurs
                before the funding reaches us. It is a question of money and
                then value for money.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members who are on the Committee, or who have
                an interest in education, must examine the issue from the point
                of view of the pupils, in particular, and parents and teachers.
                Delivery in the classroom is of prime importance. It will not
                happen if teachers are under pressure, if they are jealous of
                one another or if principals are given total power. The
                relationship between a teacher and a principal for seven or
                eight years is crucial, and its failure will have an impact on
                individual teachers. Many teachers have told me that that is a
                dangerous road to go down.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We spoke to officials in Scotland about their
                budgetary provision. Scotland’s system for delivering the
                budget seems to be more in keeping with the needs of the schools
                and teachers than Northern Ireland’s. School principals in
                Scotland seem to be happy with the arrangements, and the money
                is ring-fenced. Their whole budget process seems to be much
                better than ours. Every teacher should be paid on an equal
                basis. Young teachers feel that they are equal to those who have
                been teaching for some length of time. They should not have to
                face the difficulties of keeping things together for eight years
                until a decision is made about whether they have the right to an
                extra £2,000. Teachers, and young teachers in particular, will
                be going through a time of considerable change after the
                replacement of the 11-plus. Teachers’ pay is one thing that
                they like to be able to rely on, at all ages. They like to know
                what the outcome will be.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I introduced the amendment to take the
                Assembly to a point at which we can review the situation. I take
                into account the fact that the negotiating bodies — the
                management and the unions — are best placed to decide their
                own future. However, the interest of the House is the need to
                look at the matter from the point of view of those teachers who
                are being neglected at present.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am unsure as to whether I should declare an
                interest. I was once a principal, but I was once a young teacher
                as well.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr B Hutchinson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Did you get any threshold pay?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr K Robinson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I did not. I remember starting off as a young
                teacher in a school in the north of the city. I was envious of a
                senior member of staff who was paid the wonderful sum of
                £1,400. He was at the top end of the scale. I was paid just
                £42 per month. In those days there was no talk of threshold
                payments.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have taken many of Billy Hutchinson’s
                points on board. Young teachers are the lifeblood of schools.
                With the current LMS arrangements that Mr McHugh referred to,
                the possibility of recruiting and retaining young teachers is
                diminishing every year. Young teachers have the opportunity to
                influence people far beyond the walls of the school. However,
                the benefits of that to the profession, and to education, are
                being minimised each year.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Young teachers bring several benefits to a
                school. They are invariably the staff members who are involved
                in games, who take the children away on trips, who stay behind
                to ensure that the school choir is on song for Christmas, who
                work night and day, and who cut up pieces of cloth and turn out
                those wonderful angels that we see in Nativity plays at this
                time of the year. They do it because they are committed to their
                profession. At that point in their careers they are full of
                enthusiasm and do not seek rewards.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As they grow older, however, marriage and
                other factors intervene. They have responsibilities. They need
                money in order to bring home the bacon. Money, therefore,
                becomes important. I sympathise with what Billy Hutchinson is
                suggesting. Young teachers do need some financial reward.
                However, I am not sure what the purpose of introducing threshold
                payments really is. Is its purpose to retain staff in schools?
                Older teachers get tired, but they bring experience to schools,
                and schools need to retain that experience, to blend the
                enthusiasm of young teachers with the experience of older
                teachers. Is it to reward staff for outstanding accomplishments,
                for moving through a threshold, as it were?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My understanding of the threshold was that
                when teachers reached point 9 — the top of their scale —
                they then had to apply to move through the threshold. They would
                then be assessed on whether they bring something extra to the
                school. If that assessment were positive, they would then be
                rewarded at that scale. I am not sure that that is the perfect
                way to reward either the enthusiasm or the expertise of those
                who have reached point 9 and the threshold.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The assessment has brought to teachers’
                attention what other teachers are earning. Members of a team,
                therefore, start looking around and wondering how much their
                colleagues are getting paid and whether they are earning less
                themselves. The old green-eyed monster starts to prey. That is
                not good for education.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Principals and vice-principals are taking on
                an ever- increasing role. They have held the education system
                together for the past 15 years. Many of them have grown weary of
                that task and have retired. Some of them are fortunate enough to
                still be alive, despite the awful toll on their health. That has
                not been recognised by the introduction of threshold payments.
                The differential between the salary of a senior teacher on point
                9 of the scale, who then moves on to a threshold payment, and a
                vice-principal or, in many cases, a principal is minuscule. The
                outcome — whether it was perceived or not — is that
                principals and vice-principals are asking themselves if the
                extra work is worth it and if it is appreciated.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Principals are vital in assessing teachers
                who are moving through the threshold. Again, they are put in an
                invidious position. The threshold assessment was badly thought
                out. I do not know its real purpose, but the outcome has been to
                cause further dissension in the teaching profession and in
                schools. That is the last thing that we want.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Lewsley:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will start by stating the obvious:
                education is a vital element in society, coming close in
                importance to food and shelter. It is a basic human right. I do
                not need to tell the House of the key role of education in the
                development of young members of society. It is second in
                influence only to the family and the values that are taught
                there.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Teachers are an intrinsic part of the
                education system and, as such, are entitled to equality. The
                threshold assessment exercise most definitely does not provide
                equality for all members of the teaching profession. It is yet
                another example of the Department of Education applying English
                solutions to Northern Irish problems. Education in Northern
                Ireland is very different to that in England.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The teaching force here is of the highest
                quality. For example, an entrant to a higher education
                institution for teachers in Northern Ireland requires 21 points
                at A level, while the English entrants require 13 points.
                Teachers here are highly trained and motivated. The slavish
                duplication of English solutions to English problems merely
                exacerbates the position of teachers here, yet the Department of
                Education argues that it must maintain parity of teachers’ pay
                here with England and Wales.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There should be financial parity. Northern
                Ireland should be given the equivalent resources on a pro rata
                basis. Surely, the whole point of devolution is that we have the
                wit and intelligence to spend resources better without
                sacrificing the &quot;parity at least&quot; principle that is
                espoused by the Northern Ireland Teachers’ Council.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">How do teachers reach the threshold
                assessment? Over 8,000 teachers have been denied access to the
                upper range or the so-called threshold assessment during their
                first seven years in the profession. The threshold assessment is
                supposed to be about the quality of teaching and learning
                experience that is provided by the teacher. What magical
                manifestation deprived teachers in the first seven years of
                their teaching career from crossing the threshold? The exclusion
                of 8,000 young teachers from the threshold assessment is an
                affront to equality, decency and justice. On that basis alone,
                the Assembly should pass this motion.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Other Members said that the introduction of
                the threshold assessment in Northern Ireland has also led to a
                major increase in workload and bureaucracy, not just for
                teachers, but also for principals. The Department for Education
                and Skills, in its evidence to the School Teachers’ Review
                Body, stated that an average teacher must spend 20 hours
                completing a threshold application form and gathering evidence
                in support of it. Principals must then read all the applications
                and make critical judgements that can quite easily jeopardise
                the industrial relations in their school if they get them wrong.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The training of principals in a large one-day
                seminar was plainly inadequate for the task. The process was,
                and is, bureaucratic. As Billy Hutchinson said, it is expensive
                both in teaching time and resources. It has succeeded in
                lowering the morale of teachers in Northern Ireland. That, in
                our awful circumstances, is a unique achievement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In previous responses to my questions, the
                Minister of Education has confirmed that the bureaucracy of the
                threshold process will cost £1 million. Fifty-three assessors
                have been employed — mostly retired principals and education
                and pension administrators — to gainsay the professional
                judgements of principal teachers. Given the need in our school
                system for the professional development of all our teachers, the
                long delays in attending to the maintenance of the school
                building estate, and the current reliance on public-private
                partnerships to resolve the crisis in school capital building,
                is that expenditure not excessive?</p>

                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The introduction of threshold payments erodes
                the differentials between the pay of principals and vice-
                principals and that of teachers. That was not difficult to
                foresee. One wonders about the judgement of the Department of
                Education and the employing authorities if they did not realise
                that the erosion of differentials would cause serious problems
                with principals and vice-principals.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That unnecessary problem is caused by the
                slavish adherence to parity with England. The English school
                system is in crisis, with a massive shortage of teachers and of
                applications for vacant principal posts. Why is our Department
                of Education not thinking smart, thinking differently and
                creating an environment in the Northern Ireland school system
                that does not replicate the manifest failures in the English
                system?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In June 2001 the Assembly’s Education
                Committee endorsed the Northern Ireland Teachers’ Council’s
                claim for an independent inquiry into teachers’ salaries and
                conditions of service. A similar inquiry was approved by the
                Scottish Executive to cover teachers in Scotland. I am dismayed
                to learn, from reports provided by teachers’ union
                representatives, that employers on the management side have been
                dismissive of the determination of the Assembly Education
                Committee. At best, that perspective represents naivety.
                Demonstrably, threshold assessment does not provide equality for
                the Northern Ireland teaching profession.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I stand by the Education Committee’s
                determination for an independent inquiry into teachers’
                salaries and conditions of service. That is the best route,
                rather than to review the inequality of the threshold
                assessment. I support the motion.</p>

                already been said and very eloquently put. There is, however,

                reference to the shortage of principals and vice-principals in
                England. There is already a shortage of principals and
                vice-principals here in Northern Ireland. I know of many schools
                which have advertised for principals but have received very few
                applications. In some cases, no applications were received.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That shortage may be made worse by the
                threshold payment. If a senior teacher were earning more — or
                only a few hundred pounds less — than many vice- principals, a
                case would arise where many such senior teachers, who logically
                would wish to progress to vice-principal or possibly principal
                posts, may well wonder what is the point in progressing. What is
                the point of their taking on extra responsibility and an extra
                workload if they are going to be financially worse off than they
                are now, or perhaps only a few hundred pounds better off? If the
                situation is allowed to worsen, there is a danger that the
                filling of vice-principal and principal positions will become
                even more difficult than it is already. Many members of the
                teaching profession at that end of the scale are already
                reluctant to take on the extra workload associated with
                vice-principal and principal posts.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In reference to Billy Hutchinson’s remarks,
                younger teachers have not approached me about threshold
                payments. However, many senior teachers have approached me, and
                next week I will meet with three or four principals and
                vice-principals from the Strangford area who wish to express
                concern about their salaries being eroded by the introduction of
                threshold payments.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members must take the matter seriously,
                because teaching is the core element that provides the next
                generation with an education. I commend Billy Hutchinson for
                bringing the matter to the House.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Gibson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The motion states that there is concern about
                equality in the teaching profession. A Green Paper, ‘Teachers:
                Meeting the Challenge of Change’, was introduced in England
                three years ago. At that time, over 197,000 teachers applied for
                threshold payments. Concern was expressed, and the National
                Union of Teachers mounted a legal challenge to the process. The
                matter was reviewed, and it was only in November 2000 that
                threshold payments became a reality.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The main objective of threshold payments is
                to contribute to the overall process of improving the quality of
                teaching and learning in schools — to use an anachronism, to
                improve teacher performance at the chalkface. A broad view was,
                therefore, taken that those teachers who could improve the
                quality of education should receive rewards.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As other Members have said, it is normal to
                reward teachers with posts of responsibility. That usually means
                that a teacher is appointed head of department, or he or she is
                given the responsibility of an extra-curricular activity.
                However, threshold payments would reward directly those teachers
                who are extremely good at their actual teaching duties. In other
                words, the payments would reward those teachers who could
                improve outcomes for their pupils. Billy Hutchinson rightly
                pointed out the core values that currently exist. They are the
                common core values that one would expect of any teacher.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The application of the process is causing
                some concern. Under LMS, all money is given directly to a school
                and is allocated by the board of governors. That includes the
                payment of teachers’ salaries. Currently, the Department of
                Education excludes threshold money from that allocation. It
                makes the threshold payment of £2,001 directly to the eligible
                teachers. There is concern about how that will be handled in the
                future. Is it possible that threshold money could be included in
                the LMS budget, thereby limiting the ability of small schools,
                within their LMS budget, to reward those teachers who perform
                more than adequately?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Doubts have rightly been expressed about the
                assessment process. The Department issued a warning recently
                that</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;all individuals involved in the
                assessment process must not act unfairly to any individual and,
                in particular, must not unlawfully discriminate on the grounds
                of a person’s sex, marital status, race or disability.
                Part-time staff should not be treated less favourably than a
                member of staff working full-time&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The application has caused some concern. Last
                year, the teaching unions agreed on the method. It is timely,
                one year later, for the House to point out that concern to the
                unions and make it a matter for public discussion. I worked in
                the teaching system. There was always one young, energetic and
                genuine teacher who had the ambition to strive to improve his
                professional standards. Having to wait to reach point 9 of the
                teaching scale can thwart teachers who have the ambition to be
                excellent in their field. I ask the unions, the Minister and the
                Department to examine the concept of the threshold point for
                consideration for that award.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank Billy Hutchinson for bringing the
                matter to our attention. It is worthy of discussion, and
                anything that can be done to enhance the position of those
                teachers who deliver levels of excellence well above the norm
                should be supported. Such teachers should be properly rewarded.
                We must take note of the matter and ask the unions, the
                Department and the Minister to look again for the inequalities,
                or the deficiencies, that arise in any new introduction. Those
                must be ironed out as quickly as possible to give the profession
                every chance in the future.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr ONeill:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion. There has always been a
                dilemma in the teaching profession as to how to recognise
                competence among its members. The old system of promotional
                points had many unsavoury qualities, not least of which was that
                it often set one colleague against another — it introduced the
                green-eyed monster that has already been referred to. If someone
                wanted to achieve promotion they could do so only by taking on
                more and more administrative duties. The result was that good
                classroom teachers were often not in the classroom — they were
                administrators, which was not why they had become professional
                teachers. After education had suffered the ravages of
                Thatcherism, many teachers were doing the work of a civil
                servant rather than the work of a teacher.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, not all good classroom teachers were
                rewarded thus. Many teachers complained that there was always an
                opportunity for the professional, educational whizz-kids to zoom
                up the promotional ladder because of their ability to sell
                themselves well in interviews. Quite often, good teachers who
                did not have those particular skills, or who perhaps were not
                even interested in them, remained in the low bands of the scale
                and never got the recognition that many people felt that they
                were due.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">12.15 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That kind of situation gave rise to the
                examination of the whole area and the attempt to introduce
                threshold payments. The Westminster Green Paper which led to all
                of this stated that the teachers in the classroom were to be
                placed at the heart of the salary structure by ensuring that the
                vital importance of their work, as opposed to all the other
                activities in school, was properly reflected in salary terms.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That system has created considerable problems
                and, in many cases, has not solved the problems identified with
                the old system. From my long experience in teaching and in
                school management, I believe that to ask already hard-pressed
                principals and vice-principals to adjudicate in that way creates
                a serious problem and places a heavy burden on teachers. I note
                that, towards the end of October, some 232 schools had been
                through the system, and only 10 of those applications were
                rejected. I am surprised that the figure is even 10 — I would
                have thought that none would have been rejected as most
                principals and vice-principals would have been careful not to
                create problems with staff and morale. I am even more surprised
                and concerned that many schools must find the money for those
                already agreed threshold arrangements out of their own budgets.
                The boards do not, as yet, provide that money. I understand —
                and I am subject to correction — that the Department has not
                provided the boards with the funds to supply schools with the
                budget required to make the necessary adjustment. My information
                is that that situation is widespread, and it requires immediate
                attention.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There has also been much concern about the
                amount and quality of training available to those carrying out
                the assessment. If the current system continues – and I fear
                that we must endure it for some time — it should be our top
                priority to ensure that all those involved are properly trained.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An additional problem has emerged with regard
                to the backdating of teachers’ salaries, in some cases, to
                September 2000 — the supply of money required to reinforce the
                LMS budget. Some teachers will also experience tax problems as a
                result of moving from one tax bracket to another because of
                excessive back pay. That problem should be more sensibly and
                sympathetically dealt with.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members have already mentioned the
                differential that occurs between principals and vice-principals
                and the rest of the staff. In some cases that differential is
                unprotected under the new threshold arrangement. The Department
                must move to protect it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The final problem, which has been well
                covered already by quite a few teachers, is the equality issue
                — particularly the problem about young teachers articulated by
                Billy Hutchinson at the outset. There is no doubt that we need a
                system, and the only credible way to do it is by the creation of
                a salary scale, high enough to attract able young people into
                the profession, which progressively rewards teachers as they
                move on in their professional career. I am not making it a big
                demand, but I am really concerned about the uncertainty that
                faces professional teachers. A clear system would remove that,
                leaving people able to get on with their job of teaching and not
                being constantly concerned about fighting with each other and
                worrying about the promotion ladder. In no uncertain terms, this
                must mean that once teachers have manifestly shown their
                competence, they can move forward on a clear promotion ladder.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are things about the amendment that are
                reasonable, but I am supporting the motion. The amendment
                detracts from the main impetus of the motion, and I want to be
                with the motion in this debate. As has already been pointed out,
                the present system has not been well enough thought out. It
                causes dissent and is already demotivating teachers. As Ms
                Lewsley said, it is not particularly applicable to teaching in
                Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that the Minister will re-engage with
                the unions, as he has either started to or is about to, in their
                call for an independent inquiry into teachers’ pay and working
                hours. Through that we might get a system for teachers in
                Northern Ireland that could satisfy us — well, maybe not
                everybody, knowing teachers as I do. It could gain the greatest
                degree of satisfaction among the teaching profession, and remove
                this demotivating series of problems from the profession.</p>

                I apologise to the House and to Billy Hutchinson for not being
                here at the beginning of the debate. I was on my way to an
                important event in a school in north Belfast when I was told
                that this had been brought forward. Unfortunately, quite a few
                people are waiting for me in north Belfast, and I will go there
                as soon as this is finished.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Equality is a central tenet of the Good
                Friday Agreement, and as Minister of Education I am fully
                committed to ensuring that my Department’s policies and
                actions promote equality for all our citizens. In taking forward
                my Department’s responsibilities for the education of our
                children, I am determined to provide all our children with the
                best possible education — one that, in all respects, equips
                them to be citizens of the future. Raising standards in all
                schools is one of my key objectives, and I am taking forward a
                range of initiatives with that aim firmly in sight. This
                includes capital investment in our schools — including
                investment in information and communications technology — and
                the school improvement programme. That programme is designed to
                raise standards in all schools. It addresses issues such as
                literacy and numeracy, discipline, target setting, school
                development, planning, low achievement and underachievement, the
                massive expansion of pre-school education and the three major
                reviews of aspects of our education system — the post-primary
                review, the curriculum review and the consultation on LMS
                commonality.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Of course, investment in educational
                resources for the purpose of raising standards counts for little
                without highly skilled and motivated teachers. It is for that
                reason that I place great importance on our ongoing work to
                maintain and enhance the quality of teaching.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Teachers are the key to good education, and
                we are particularly fortunate in the quality of our teaching
                force. I have met many teachers in my position as Minister of
                Education, and I have been impressed constantly with their
                professionalism and dedication. Teachers should have a career
                and salary structure which recognises their skill and
                commitment, encourages their professional development and offers
                a tangible reward for their achievements.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The pay award negotiated in January 2001 by
                the teachers’ salaries negotiating committee put in place a
                new salary structure. This was not imposed by me or by my
                Department. It was achieved through discussion and agreement
                with representatives from the education and library boards, the
                Council for Catholic Maintained Schools, the Governing Bodies
                Association, the Council for Integrated Education and the five
                accredited teaching unions. It is applied irrespective of
                religion, race or gender and in all schools — special, nursery
                and primary, secondary and grammar, controlled and maintained,
                integrated and Irish-medium.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The new structure is intended to complement
                the professional development of teachers and to give them the
                opportunity to advance their careers while remaining in the
                classroom. New teachers are required to complete an induction
                period of one year and two years early professional development.
                Following that they are encouraged to avail of continuing
                professional development opportunities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The professional development of younger
                teachers is complemented by annual progression on the main
                salary scale, until the maximum is reached, usually after seven
                years. The introduction of threshold assessment allows those
                teachers to progress to a new upper salary scale, giving them an
                immediate annual increase from September 2000 — £2,076 from 1
                April 2001 — with opportunities for further progression.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Before moving from the top of the nine-point
                main scale to the new upper salary scale, teachers must
                demonstrate that they have developed the competences required to
                become a teacher in the first place, so, in a sense, it is a
                standard of competence which is derived directly from the
                initial teacher training competences.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Threshold assessment is available to all
                teachers who have been at the top of the main salary scale for
                one year, based on their qualifications and experience. Those
                who apply must meet the four agreed threshold standards and
                produce practical evidence to show that they have met those
                standards for the past two or three years. The standards are
                core values — understanding of the curriculum, professional
                knowledge, teaching in assessment of learning, contribution to
                raising standards through pupil achievement and effective
                professional development. It is important that these standards
                are applied consistently and fairly and that the scheme is
                transparent, which is why the assessments are validated by
                external accredited assessors. Unsuccessful applicants receive
                feedback to help their professional development, and they have a
                right of appeal.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The assessors have been trained and
                accredited by the regional training unit (RTU). That unit also
                provided training for principals, who then trained the teachers
                in their schools. In most schools training was completed before
                the end of the summer term, and completed application forms had
                to be submitted to the principal by the end of September.
                Assessments by principals are now completed, and the external
                validation is under way. Several schools have already completed
                the assessment process, and many successful teachers have now
                received their increases, which were backdated to September
                2000.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The assessment process for the first cohort
                of applications is expected to be concluded by Christmas. More
                than 13,000 of the 20,000 teachers here were eligible to apply
                in the first round, and almost all of them have done so.
                Indications from the applications processed so far are that the
                success rate will be high. Those teachers who were not eligible
                to apply this time may do so when they have progressed to the
                top of the main salary scale, and those who were unsuccessful
                may reapply.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several issues were raised before I arrived.
                I will check Hansard and reply to the Members concerned.
                However, I want to mention some of the points raised.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">12.30 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Éamonn ONeill raised the issue of costs. The
                cost in the current financial year will be approximately £50
                million, and that includes the cost of arrears from September
                2000. The expenditure is being met from additional funds held
                centrally by my Department for this purpose. Provision for
                implementation costs and threshold payments was added to the
                Department’s budget in the comprehensive spending review.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Tom Hamilton and Éamonn ONeill raised the
                issue of principals and vice-principals. As we all know, the
                threshold arrangements do not apply to principals and
                vice-principals. However, the management side of the negotiating
                committee is considering their salary levels and differentials
                so that suitable candidates are not discouraged from seeking
                leadership posts. That is important.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Patricia Lewsley raised the issue of an
                independent inquiry. I think Éamonn ONeill also mentioned it.
                The call for an inquiry was made by the teachers’ side as part
                of the 2001 pay claim and is still progressing through the
                negotiating committee. I have agreed to meet with both sides on
                13 December to examine whether I can help advance matters
                further.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important to emphasise that the
                threshold arrangements were negotiated between the management
                side and the teachers’ side after detailed discussions through
                their existing negotiating machinery. I welcomed their
                agreement, which both sides worked hard to reach last January. I
                want to assure the House that I am committed to ensuring that
                our teachers are properly awarded for their important
                contribution to society.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McHugh:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.
                People may not have entirely indicated their willingness to
                support the amendment, but its objective was to achieve an
                outcome. It mentions the serious concerns that have been brought
                to me by teachers about the threshold assessment. Those concerns
                include equality issues and urging representatives from both
                sides to reach a situation where everyone feels equal. That was
                the thrust of the amendment. If people do not feel that they
                want to support it, I want Billy Hutchinson’s motion to bring
                the need for a review to the attention of the Department. I
                accept the points that the Minister has made concerning the
                meeting that is to take place on 13 December.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Earlier, I stressed the point that both sides
                have negotiated this position. It will cost a considerable
                amount of money, and some other area of education may have to
                lose out — at least that is the way budgets normally work. It
                is important that all involved take another look at this matter.
                Negotiation can bring people to a point where everyone is
                dissatisfied. As far as we are concerned, the issues are
                outstanding, and they are of prime importance.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister mentioned that equality is
                central to the Good Friday Agreement and that we are working for
                the benefit of all citizens. Our Republican belief that we
                cherish all our children equally is one that we carry strongly.
                The Minister mentioned raising standards and he spoke about
                pre-school education. That is where young teachers often start
                their career. They must wonder where their future will lie, and
                they must be looking at this particular situation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ken Robinson asked whether the issue was
                about retaining older staff or rewarding people for long service
                or particularly good service.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I cannot agree with some of the points made
                by Mr Gibson about the differences in the delivery of service.
                It is hard to say whether a young teacher is delivering on an
                equal basis with someone who has been teaching for a long time.
                Quite often it is about teamwork, and not about an individual
                teacher working in isolation in a school. Teachers must be able
                to work in an atmosphere where they are not at odds, and their
                future is not at odds, with what they do on a day-to-day basis.
                They want to be able to come up with good, new ideas, and not to
                have to keep them from others just in case those ideas would end
                up on the CV of another teacher who would get the extra £2,000
                at the end of the year.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Teachers should be left to self-assess and to
                set their own targets. Female teachers are often overcritical of
                their own work and need support to self-assess positively.
                Teachers must be trusted to set targets and to self-assess with
                appropriate support that is unrelated to the immediate financial
                award. The outcome of the McCrone report in Scotland offers at
                least one alternative.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have had a useful debate. Various issues
                have been raised, and I want to see them taken on board. I hope
                that the meetings with the Minister and those involved will
                achieve that. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr B Hutchinson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have had a very encouraging and informed
                debate, and I thank all Members who took part and those who
                listened. I accept that the Minister had a reason for being
                late. I realise that he missed my opening remarks, and I hope
                that when he has read Hansard he will answer any points that he
                may have missed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am concerned at Gerry McHugh’s opening
                remarks about the amendment. There seems to be some confusion
                about the debate. There is an assumption that the local
                management of schools (LMS) is about money only. We have two
                main problems with LMS. If a school has low pupil numbers and
                the teachers are on point 9 of the scale, that school is
                crippled because the top wage has to be paid. If there are 12
                teachers and 10 of them are on the top wage, the bill is
                crippling. Teachers who have been at a school for a long time
                have to be paid more, and that causes problems with a shrinking
                school. That must be recognised. It is not just a question of
                money, but of how we assess where the teachers should be on the
                pay scale.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Today’s debate is not about teachers’ pay
                — it is about the bonus and what that should based on. The
                bonus is based on the premise that anyone who has reached point
                9, because they have served more than seven years as a teacher,
                is a good teacher, and they are going to bring the four
                standards that are outlined. My argument is that when young
                teachers qualify they sign up to the Jordanstown agreement — I
                nearly said the Good Friday Agreement — and those standards
                are contained in that agreement. From the day that a teacher
                starts work, he or she has already signed up to those four
                standards and should be meeting them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Éamonn ONeill gave us some very helpful
                numbers — 232 and only about 10 rejections. A teacher who has
                been deemed unsatisfactory by the Department of Education can be
                paid that money — not because he is a good teacher, but
                because he is on point 9 and has given a certain length of
                service.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is an inequality and an injustice here
                that need to be resolved. A principal can fail a teacher as far
                as a threshold assessment is concerned, but he can be overruled
                by an external validator. I know that there are difficulties
                with principals and vice-principals carrying out this role.
                However, they know their teachers best, and they know how they
                are performing on a daily basis. It is wrong that an external
                validator can contradict a principal.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank Ken Robinson for his recognition of
                young teachers. He gave a graphic description, which I could not
                give, as I was not a young teacher. I believe that Ken was a
                young teacher — some time ago. It is important that we
                understand what young teachers do without remuneration. We
                should recognise their enthusiasm and their contribution to the
                lives of many children.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I accept Ken Robinson’s explanation of the
                reasons for the introduction of the threshold. However, once
                point 9 has been reached, we are effectively saying that there
                is something different about those people, and that they have
                reached the standard. If they then take redundancy, they are
                still entitled to the threshold payment. There is something
                wrong with that. Long-term substitute teachers also qualify for
                the payment. Should it be that a threshold is set at point 9,
                and once a teacher reaches that point and accepts redundancy, he
                can have his redundancy and the £2,000 threshold payment that
                he has qualified for? There is a contradiction in that premise,
                and it must be re-examined.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Lewsley is correct when she says that
                differentials are being eroded by the exclusion of principals
                and vice-principals. In my opening remarks I mentioned that in a
                small rural school, there might be a difference in salary of
                only £200 per year between a principal and a teacher. As Tom
                Hamilton commented, who would want to take on all of those
                responsibilities for an extra £200 per year?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr ONeill gave us a timely history lesson. We
                should remember that the problems in teaching and in our schools
                go back to the era of Thatcherism. Thatcher destroyed the whole
                notion of education, even though she believed in
                &quot;education, education, education&quot;. We now have people
                competing against one another. Education should not be about
                competition. It should be about producing fully rounded
                individuals and how we can get teachers to assist in that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have gone on about giving people bonuses.
                If this is a bonus, that is OK, but let us give people bonuses
                because they are good at their job, and not because they have
                been there for a long time.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Gibson highlighted my point about
                improving teacher performance. Talking about threshold
                assessment in the same breath as improving teacher performance
                is making the assumption that length of service raises
                standards. Regardless of profession, excellence depends on the
                quality of the person and how good they are at the job, and it
                cannot be measured by experience or length of time in a job. It
                is handy to have experience, but it does not necessarily mean
                that you are better at the job than someone else.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr ONeill made the valid point that schools
                have always been in a dilemma about recognising competence. How
                do we recognise competence? Mr ONeill is correct, as was Ms
                Lewsley, on the issue of differentials. Differentials must be
                protected. Mr ONeill’s point about using a salary scale as a
                progressive reward is correct.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The only way to reward teachers is to provide
                that they may start at a particular point and end up at another.
                Teachers should be rewarded because of the work that they do and
                what they achieve in their school. A review of teachers’ pay
                may be the way forward, but progressive reward should be
                re-examined.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">12.45 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy Speaker is sitting upright in his
                Chair so I assume that he wants me to hurry.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I recognise the work that the Minister of
                Education has done since he took office. I do not want to take
                away from what he and the Department of Education have achieved.
                He has made some brave decisions. The Minister mentioned raising
                education standards, school improvements and pre-school
                education. Those are all recognised as being valuable, as is the
                notion of post-primary education and the recent review of that.
                However, the motion is about the threshold agreement for
                Northern Ireland. It does not give equality to all members of
                the teaching profession. The Assembly must focus on that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am disappointed that the Minister focused
                on the other good things that he has done. However, I recognise
                those and I am sure that all Members recognise them and would
                not want to take away from those achievements.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Nevertheless, the motion is concerned with
                equality, and the threshold assessment does not give equality to
                all the teaching profession.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are a number of problems in the
                teaching profession, and I tabled the motion because of the lack
                of equality within it. I emphasised the inequality shown to
                young teachers. Members must recognise that young teachers are
                working hard to attain additional qualifications to those they
                had when they entered the profession. They do it without any
                financial reward or support from the Department of Education or
                others.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Experience does not necessarily make good
                teachers; we must lay that ghost to rest. Mr McHugh mentioned
                that teachers meet the changes in the curriculum and everything
                else on a daily and yearly basis. It is therefore a difficult
                job, because the curriculum can change from year to year, or
                every couple of years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Younger teachers bring new skills and new
                methods of teaching to the profession. A teacher should not have
                to wait seven years until he or she is on point 9 before
                receiving recognition for doing a good job in teaching. Young
                teachers are the leaders of the future and they will become
                leaders in our schools only because they themselves have
                qualified and have had the experience of teaching young people
                in classrooms.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members must support the motion which will
                provide equality across the board, not only for vice-principals
                and principals, but for those young teachers who have to wait
                seven years before they qualify.</p>

                closure at the earliest possible date of the nuclear-processing
                activities carried out at Sellafield.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank my fellow Assembly Members for giving
                me the opportunity to bring this important issue to the Floor of
                the House. In so doing, they have allowed other Members to
                contribute to an important and ongoing debate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">From the outset, it has been acknowledged
                that the Assembly has no power or authority over what happens at
                Sellafield. However, we can at least express all our fears
                loudly and clearly. It seems that everyone in these islands and
                further afield is having his or her say, and demands are being
                made. If Prime Minister Tony Blair’s statement in Dublin last
                week is anything to go by, many people still need to be
                convinced before there is real movement towards meeting the
                demands of this motion.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sellafield is sited on the Cumbrian coast, a
                few miles across the Irish Sea from places such as Portavogie
                and Portaferry in east Down. When the plant first opened in the
                mid-1950s, it was called Windscale. Shortly after its opening, a
                reactor caught fire and created havoc, sending a dangerous cloud
                of fallout into the air over many towns in the north of England.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the early 1970s, Windscale had another
                near miss. There was an accident in a plutonium-handling
                compartment, which had the potential to start a nuclear reaction
                similar to that experienced at Chernobyl. Swift reactions by
                staff prevented a full-scale disaster. After these mishaps, the
                site changed its name to Sellafield.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On this side of the Irish Sea, we have always
                had our suspicions about activities at the site and the possible
                consequences for marine life in the Irish Sea. In Northern
                Ireland, particularly along the east coast, we used to have a
                thriving fishing industry. Unfortunately, that is not the case
                today. It is possible that Sellafield may have had a hand in the
                demise of the fishing industry. There have been high levels of
                instances of cancer and leukaemia on the east coast, and the
                finger has been pointed at Sellafield.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On 3 October 2001, the Department for
                Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) in London announced
                that the manufacture of mixed oxide (MOX) fuel is justified in
                accordance with the requirements of European Community law. That
                statement is incredible, given that there has been widespread
                opposition to activities at Sellafield since the start of its
                operations. That announcement, coming some three weeks after the
                horrendous events of 11 September, is beyond belief. Have people
                in the Government taken leave of their senses? They must be
                aware of the concerns of a great many individuals, not only
                those on this side of the Irish Sea, but also those who live
                near the Sellafield plant.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In response to a journalist’s queries about
                the risks associated with Sellafield, I referred to the number
                of jobs at the plant and the economic benefits of the
                enterprise. That aspect of the problem must be considered, and
                efforts must be made to attract more and safer employment to
                that area.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are inconsistent reports on the
                introduction of the new MOX plant. It is said that the economic
                benefits of the new operation have been distorted. There is
                insufficient evidence to prove that the plant can attract enough
                customers. The viability of the plant is in doubt. There are
                also concerns about past data falsification incidents. A recent
                report by the Health and Safety Executive’s Nuclear
                Installation Inspectorate revealed that individual workers had
                faked safety records. Furthermore, the continuous transportation
                of large cargoes of this substance across the Irish Sea would be
                extremely dangerous. If there were ever to be an accident
                involving one of these vessels, the consequences would be
                unthinkable.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Further alarming revelations have come to
                light in relation to security at the Sellafield plant. It has
                been alleged that a firm employed to guard Sellafield is partly
                owned by someone with close links to the Afghan terrorists. It
                has also been revealed that the person in question has a stake
                in a firm that supplies security systems to Sellafield and has
                intimate knowledge and access to highly sensitive data about the
                running of that plant. If there are suspicions attached to
                security at Sellafield, surely the public have a right to know.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Irish Government have recognised the
                problem and are working to convince the British Government of
                the consequences of any disaster at Sellafield. We welcome their
                efforts to halt its expansion.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Friends of the Earth, Greenpeace and other
                environmentalists are working to see the MOX operation at
                Sellafield cancelled. A senior director of Greenpeace said that
                expanding the global trade in plutonium was dangerously
                irresponsible, especially at a time of huge global insecurity. A
                Friends of the Earth director also said that it beggared belief
                that the British Government could give the go-ahead to a process
                involving the use and transportation of plutonium, which can be
                used to make weapons. Producing MOX at Sellafield will make the
                world much less safe.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those of us who live on the Ards Peninsula,
                with Strangford Lough on one side and the Irish Sea on the
                other, are particularly alarmed at the proposed MOX expansion.
                After the events of 11 September, public representatives have a
                duty to enlist the support of everyone who values a clean, safe
                environment to get the message across to the British Government.
                I note that our own Minister of the Environment, Mr Foster, is
                present, and I hope that he will question the Government’s
                actions. We hope that the appropriate Department in London will
                take seriously the outcome of this debate, withhold any new
                licence for further activities at Sellafield and start the
                process of rundown and final closure of the plant.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members must recognise that we have a
                potential time bomb only a few miles across the Irish Sea. After
                the events of 11 September and even this weekend’s suicide
                bombings in Israel, anything is possible. God forbid that
                Sellafield should ever become a target. Not only this country
                but the entire British Isles and even further afield could be
                obliterated. Let us stop it now. I ask for the Assembly’s
                support.</p>

                for the proper decommissioning of all nuclear reprocessing
                activities, leading to the rundown and closure of the plant at
                Sellafield in Cumbria.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I commend Mr McCarthy for giving us the
                opportunity to debate this important issue. It is very timely.
                The amendment stands in my name and that of my Colleague Arthur
                Doherty. I apologise on his behalf. He is absent, not out of
                disrespect to the House, but because his brother died yesterday.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Sellafield nuclear reprocessing site has
                been the centre of controversy for decades; it is not a new
                problem. Many years have been spent trying to publicise the
                dangers inherent in such a site. Sellafield, with its
                multiplicity of operations, represents a potentially serious
                threat to these islands — to the environment, to public health
                and to safety.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My concerns about Sellafield include the
                continued reprocessing of spent nuclear fuels; the continued
                operation of old magnox reactors; the continued discharge of
                radioactive material into the Irish Sea; the storage on land of
                high-level radioactive waste in liquid form; the transportation
                of nuclear fuels up and down the Irish Sea to and from the site;
                safety management at the site, as mentioned by Mr McCarthy; and,
                particularly since 11 September, the risk of catastrophic
                accident or deliberate attack.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The commissioning of the mixed oxide plant
                — which is currently the subject of two legal cases, besides
                that which was heard at Hamburg last Monday — is an
                unjustified and unnecessary expansion of nuclear operations at
                Sellafield. The British Government approved licensing on 3
                October despite opposition from Ireland, the Nordic countries
                and non-governmental organisations. It was clear that the
                permission was driven by the Exchequer and the public purse in
                the UK. Believe it or not, the MOX plant has yet to obtain
                consent from the Health and Safety Executive, yet it has been
                licensed to operate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When the British Government issued the
                licence, they took advice from a low-level section of the
                Department of Trade and Industry. They did not wait for the
                report of the committee that they had appointed for that
                purpose, which is called OSPAN. The report has not yet been
                published, but there is an interim report that is
                disadvantageous to the decision that was made.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">According to eminent scientists, particularly
                those of the Oxford research group, who have consistently
                asserted that there is no economic case for MOX, there is no
                economic justification for commissioning the plant. We must
                remember that the British Government keep arguing for that
                economic case.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In a critique of the Arthur D Little report,
                nuclear consultant Mike Sadnicki pointed out that the data
                falsification incident in September 1999 that Mr McCarthy
                mentioned significantly reduced the likelihood that Japanese
                utilities will sign MOX contracts with British Nuclear Fuels Ltd
                (BNFL). He concluded that if &quot;very plausible&quot;
                assumptions are made about Japanese markets and, more
                appropriately, the discount rates now being used, the plant
                might fail to cover even its own operating costs.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Only last week, one of Sellafield’s main
                customers told a parliamentary subcommittee at Westminster that
                it wants to terminate its reprocessing contracts with BNFL
                because they are too costly.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">British Energy told MPs that it</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;has never re-used any of the material
                produced because it would be uneconomic to do so, and this is
                likely to remain the case in the short to medium term.
                Reprocessing fuel is an unnecessary and costly exercise that
                British Energy cannot afford. Reprocessing produces materials
                that have no current economic value. There is no technical need
                for reprocessing&quot;.</p>

                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those arguments have been enunciated by the
                Oxford research group as reasons why the British Government
                should not have commissioned the mixed oxide plant. In the light
                of such professional advice and evidence, we must ask why the
                British Government and British Nuclear Fuels Limited persist
                with the operation of the thermal oxide reprocessing plant
                (THORP) and with the licensing of the MOX plant now coming into
                vogue. Available evidence from all sources flies in the face of
                the judgement made.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Irish Government also believe that there
                is no economic justification of the commission of the mixed
                oxide plant. Their Minister for energy asserted last month that
                the British Government have</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;bowed to spurious economic arguments by
                British Nuclear Fuels Ltd in favour of the MOX plant, and has
                ignored or rejected the real and genuine concerns about the
                plant expressed by over 2,000 respondents to the consultation
                process, including Ireland&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Government of the Republic of Ireland and
                all other non-governmental organisations are fully justified in
                bringing legal actions against the British Government in respect
                of Sellafield and the commissioning of the new MOX plant.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is no doubt that the level of
                radioactive discharges into the Irish Sea will increase. In 1985
                a House of Commons Environment Select Committee report stated
                that Sellafield pumped a quarter of a tonne of highly
                radioactive plutonium into the Irish Sea. How much has gone into
                the Irish Sea on a day-to-day, month-to-month, and year-to-year
                basis since the early 1950s? A leaked British Nuclear Fuels Ltd
                document from June 2001 indicated that radioactive discharges
                from Sellafield will increase over the next three years. Such
                discharges will increase either two-fold or four-fold, peaking
                in time for the next meeting of the Environment Ministers at the
                OSPAR (Oslo-Paris Commission) North Atlantic Convention in 2003.
                The increased discharges fly in the face of the commitments that
                the British Government gave in 1998 to the OSPAR conference in
                Sintra, Portugal, to undertake to reduce radioactive discharges.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the subsequent OSPAR conference in
                Valencia in June 2001, the countries decided that the policies
                agreed at the previous conference — to review discharge
                authorisation from the reprocessing plants with a view to
                implementing the non-reprocessing options for spent fuel —
                should be carried out as a matter of urgency. However,
                significantly, the UK, French, and Swiss Governments abstained
                from the vote. It was in fact a veto of the implementation of
                the policies of reduced discharges, on which they had already
                agreed. It was a technical loophole by which the two major
                nuclear powers, France and Britain, frustrated the agreement
                that had already been made — a total lack of honour on their
                part.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In July, the UK Environment Agency published
                its long-awaited proposals for the future regulation of
                radioactive waste disposal from Sellafield. The consultation
                period for those proposals ended yesterday. That is why this
                debate is so timely. It has been argued that none of the new
                liquid discharge limits imposed by the Environment Agency will
                in any way constrain British Nuclear Fuels Ltd from reaching
                full throughput in its two reprocessing plants. There must be
                progressive reductions in the actual discharges of radioactive
                and toxic wastes from Sellafield into the Irish Sea until they
                are totally eliminated.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Only last week, Britain’s Minister of State
                for Industry and Energy, Brian Wilson, claimed that the Fianna
                Fáil advertisement in ‘The Times’ on 24 November against
                the MOX plant at Sellafield was not backed up by the Irish
                Government’s own monitoring of Sellafield.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Wells:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I notice that the hon Member is drawing his
                remarks to a close — he will be glad to know that there is no
                time limit, so I am not cutting in on his allocation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGrady has spoken eloquently on the
                motion, but I cannot detect any great difference between the
                thrust of his argument and that put forward by Mr McCarthy, nor
                has he yet addressed the reasoning behind his amendment. It may
                be a tactical amendment and if so, that is fine. Is there any
                difference between what he is saying and what Mr McCarthy is
                saying? Will the Member be pushing his amendment to a vote?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGrady:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, I assure the Member that the amendment
                is not tactical. In fact, I could have argued that the original
                motion was not competent because British Nuclear Fuels Ltd does
                not process materials at Sellafield — it reprocesses them.
                There is a huge technical difference.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, the amendment discusses the licence
                from the British Government to British Nuclear Fuels Ltd for the
                new MOX plant and calls for the complete rundown and closure of
                Sellafield. These are fundamental differences. I assume that my
                amendment would not have been accepted had it not been
                substantively different to the motion. I will proceed and not be
                presumed to be winding up, as Mr Wells thought.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The British Government accused the Irish
                Government of bad faith in that the former said that the latter,
                in their advert, had not heeded their own monitoring reports
                from Sellafield. It should be pointed out that the Radiological
                Protection Institute of Ireland (RPII) stated in its last report
                that discharges of radioactive waste into the Irish Sea from
                Sellafield continue to be a dominant source of contamination.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The RPII mentioned the re-mobilisation from
                sediments of historic discharges. That wonderful phrase simply
                means that the radioactive material that was theoretically meant
                to be embedded in the mud of the Irish Sea has been re-mobilised
                and is circulating. It was never intended that that should
                happen. There are several cases pending against the British
                Government, and I hope that they will come to fruition.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As Mr McCarthy said, this debate comes in the
                aftermath of the terrorist attacks in New York on 11 September.
                It is interesting to note that the World Information Service on
                Energy (WISE), which is a group of scientists based in Paris,
                undertook an assessment of the security risk at Sellafield prior
                to the terrorist attack in the USA. The report was published
                just after the horrific and horrendous events of 11 September.
                The report mentioned Sellafield as having one of the highest
                inventories of radioactive waste in the world. The report also
                presented Sellafield as an enormous security risk. That report
                was written before 11 September, although it was only published
                after that date.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For these reasons, and many others that would
                take too long to articulate, I commend the amendment to Mr
                McCarthy. At the end of the debate, there may be a composite
                motion that will be satisfactory to all Members.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Shannon:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sellafield is an issue that concerns us all,
                not only because we live on the Irish Sea coast but because, as
                Mr McGrady said, it highlights our direct concerns. We in the
                Ards area have talked about Sellafield often in recent weeks,
                not because we have nothing else to talk about, but because it
                is of great concern to people in the area. Ards Borough Council
                has debated it on three occasions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Since the tragedies of 11 September, our fear
                has been that Sellafield would become a target. Before then,
                some people might have thought that our fears were extreme. It
                might be thought outrageous to suppose that Sellafield would be
                attacked. However, the Americans thought it was so incredible
                that anyone should decide to attack the twin towers that they
                used the World Trade Centre as a flight simulator crash
                exercise. That is, perhaps, an indication that they thought it
                would never happen. But it did happen. Think how easy it would
                be to hire a light aircraft out of a small airport —
                Newtownards airport being one example — and to fly across the
                Irish Sea to the nuclear power station. Again, some would
                suggest that that is ridiculous, but it is not. It could happen.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A few weeks ago, the press reminded us of
                Sellafield’s vulnerability. RAF fighter jets were scrambled to
                patrol the skies over the plant for some five hours. Had
                anything happened they might have been just a little late, but
                they did respond. The call turned out to be a hoax, but it
                highlights the fears and misgivings of people in our Province,
                particularly the residents of my Strangford constituency and of
                the Ards borough.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For years we have worried about the health
                problems that may have been caused by the plant’s proximity to
                our coast, but no one ever thought in their wildest dreams that
                the plant could be used to wipe out Northern Ireland in one foul
                act of inhumanity. The fallout from a nuclear explosion would
                kill everyone in the Strangford constituency — and a brave few
                other people as well. The land would be unable to sustain any
                life for hundreds, perhaps thousands, of years. That is the
                doomsday scenario, but it could happen if terrorists were to
                appoint themselves to carry it out. It is unlikely that any of
                us could survive the holocaust of a nuclear explosion and the
                resulting fallout.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Northern Ireland is one of only two parts of
                the United Kingdom without a nuclear bunker for shelter in the
                event of such an incident. That highlights — and is
                symptomatic of — how the rest of the United Kingdom views the
                people of Northern Ireland. In its debate, Ards Borough Council
                urged the Government to give strong, solid assurances that
                Sellafield is protected.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is typical of the English to persist with
                a white elephant, even though the rest of the world tells them
                to stop. We have seen that stubbornness in the ruin of our
                National Health Service by an idiotic policy that has been
                pressed into service by Governments. The peace process in
                Northern Ireland is riddled with skulduggery and cheating to
                make it work and make it fit, even though the people can see
                that it is a fallacy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Government want to expand the Sellafield
                plant. They have tried to assure us that any emissions from it
                will be minimal and have no impact. I asked the Minister of the
                Environment that very question, and his response was that they
                are of &quot;negligible radiological significance&quot;. What
                does that mean if, in perhaps ten years’ time, we find out
                that that &quot;negligible radiological significance&quot; is
                greater than scientists thought today?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The coast of County Down has the highest
                incidence of cancer in the United Kingdom. There are clusters of
                cancer groups where people feel a greater impact from cancer,
                more have the disease and more receive treatment than in other
                parts of the Province.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.30 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Are the Government’s statements as truthful
                as they would have us believe? They have a less than brilliant
                track record for honesty; Members need only look at the BSE
                crisis, which continues to cause trauma.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The reprocessing plant’s emissions are in
                excess of the recommended European Union levels. Members must
                take that issue on board, because we are concerned about the
                fact that the emissions recorded along the coast of County Down
                and in the rest of the United Kingdom are above accepted levels
                in other parts of Europe and elsewhere. Can we, therefore,
                deduce that the Government are telling us one thing and the
                European Union is telling us another? Who should we believe?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Given the British Government’s track
                record, we should consider the European Union’s advice. We
                should support the motion and the comments that Members put
                forward. Members should agree with Mr McGrady’s amendment; it
                is acceptable. We should collectively support the campaign for
                the closure of Sellafield.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The press have reported that the radioactive
                discharges from Sellafield are to increase, and that is of deep
                concern to us. The increase could be detrimental both to the
                communities that live near the Irish Sea and to the fishing
                industry. Mr McGrady, Mr Wells, Mr McCarthy and I represent
                areas with sizeable fishing communities, and we are concerned
                about the impact that increased emissions would have on them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sellafield poses an unacceptable risk to all
                those who live and work close to it. I have fears about the
                security around the site as the war on the Taliban threatens to
                escalate. The fact that the RAF scrambled jets is a good sign
                that the Government consider the threat to be real, but for jet
                fighters to appear after there has been a threat is insufficient
                to prevent an attack. If the threat had been real, the plant
                would have already erupted into flames, emitting radioactive
                material. The planes would have arrived too late, and the
                population of Strangford and the Down coast would have been
                decimated. The only way to prevent such an accident — whether
                that be as the result of human error or terrorist attack — is
                to close the plant until such times as the Government can be
                trusted to tell us the truth and guarantee us the safety that we
                demand.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chernobyl incident in the 1980s was a
                shock to us, yet we may have become a bit complacent about it.
                Were Sellafield to close today, we would still have to live with
                its legacy for thousands of years. However, were the move made
                to close it today, at least that would be a start.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Can any Member imagine people in other parts
                of the world campaigning for the children of Ards, Strangford
                and the Down coast in the way that they do for the children of
                Chernobyl? After Chernobyl, we were afraid, and we were told to
                be cautious about drinking milk in case radiation had filtered
                through the grass into the food chain.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the past, we were eager to accept
                Government statements as to whether things were OK. However,
                recently the Government have proven to be unreliable, and we
                must demand that action be taken because we, as citizens of the
                United Kingdom, deserve to have our national security taken
                seriously. I agree with Mr McGrady’s amendment.</p>

                I support the motion. It is welcome to see that the DUP and the
                Alliance Party are concerned about an issue that affects the
                people of Ireland. Perhaps, we will be able to convert them to
                an all-Ireland agenda.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I view the SDLP’s amendment with deep
                regret. The Assembly should unite on the issue. Instead, for
                personal reasons, Mr McGrady has chosen to table an amendment
                that adds nothing to the debate. At the same time, I recognise
                that he has been at the forefront of those who have raised the
                issue of Sellafield over the years. I welcome the fact that
                Ireland can unite on this important issue. However, it would be
                more effective if all parties could unanimously support the
                motion.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the post-11 September climate, when the
                British Government are rightly working closely with other
                nations, the danger posed by their reluctance to close down the
                disaster-in-waiting known as Sellafield is too enormous for most
                rational people to contemplate. The British Government
                apparently think that, should a successful attack on Sellafield
                occur, the loss of possibly one million lives is an acceptable
                risk to take. Some argue that the number of lives that would be
                lost is unknown. However, what is known is the high incidence of
                leukaemia in children living close to Sellafield.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The facts contained in a recent report
                prepared for the European Parliament on the possible toxic
                effects of nuclear reprocessing plants at Sellafield and Cap de
                la Hague are damning. The rate of leukaemia in those children is
                eight times higher than normal. The report states that</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Radiation exposure due to radionuclides
                release from Sellafield cannot be excluded as a cause for the
                observed health effects.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Is that not an attack on the innocent? The
                report is the most damning ever produced on the operations of
                Sellafield. It challenges the economic activities of the
                reprocessing industry, as well as the extremely casual approach
                of the EU Commission towards its duty to verify activities at
                Sellafield.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Nuclides released into the air and sea
                contaminate the food chain, and people may receive radioactive
                contamination from radioactive aerosols, inhalation of
                radioactive gases and ground shine from nuclides deposited on
                land. The linear no-threshold model adopted by the scientific
                community states that there is no level of radiation exposure
                below which there is no effect. Even the smallest possible dose,
                such as a photon passing through a cell nucleus, carries a risk
                of cancer.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is outrageous that the European Commission
                cannot even guarantee that basic safety standards will be met.
                Britain seems to think that it does not have to worry about such
                mundane concerns as safety, because it did not request the
                European Commission’s opinion under article 34 of the Euratom
                Treaty.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There has been a reduction in radioactive
                emissions. However, other, more harmful, emissions are
                increasing. The increase of key radionuclides from Sellafield,
                and expected future discharges, are totally inconsistent with
                the obligations of the British Government under the Convention
                for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East
                Atlantic (OSPAR Convention).</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ireland is not a distant land, although I
                often suspect that the British would like that to be the case.
                The fish along our coastline live in extremely polluted waters,
                but the British dismiss Irish concerns about the dangers of such
                pollution as if a fish with two heads were something to marvel
                at.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a clear day it is possible to see the
                Sellafield plant from the majestic Mournes — it is not a
                comforting sight. The Sellafield nuclear plant is closer to
                Belfast than it is to Glasgow, and it is closer to Dublin than
                it is to London. It is vitally important that all parties on
                this island work together to force the British Government to
                close this death trap at Sellafield immediately. Britain should
                suspend MOX plant operations until the full hearing of the Irish
                case in February 2002. No one group, person or political party
                will have all the answers or can win the battle alone, but if we
                work together in the Assembly and in the island of Ireland with
                the campaigners in Britain and Europe, we will all have a
                stronger mandate and a stronger voice. Go raibh maith agat.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sellafield is a problem that directly impacts
                on the people of Northern Ireland. Located on the coast of
                Cumbria, it is almost directly across the Irish Sea from
                Belfast. It is known by many environmentalists as &quot;the
                nuclear dustbin of the world&quot;. The survey by the University
                of Bremen commissioned by Greenpeace states that</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The area around the Sellafield
                reprocessing plant (UK) is as heavily contaminated with
                radioactivity as the zone around the stricken Chernobyl reactor
                in Ukraine&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mike Townsley of Greenpeace International
                said that</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Sellafield is a slow-motion Chernobyl,
                an accident played out over the last four decades. While an area
                of 30 km radius around Chernobyl is prohibited access for people
                and any agricultural activity, there are no such restrictions
                around Sellafield&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Worryingly, more than a third of the
                plutonium pumped into the Irish Sea from Sellafield over the
                past 40 years is said to be missing. Plutonium dust washed
                inshore is thought to be a potential cause of cancer and birth
                defect clusters.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A study by Dr Patricia Sheehan published in
                ‘The Lancet’ showed links between the fire at the Sellafield
                plant — when it was known as Windscale — and instances of
                Down’s Syndrome, stillbirths, Asian flu and cancer. Another
                study by a leading scientist, Gardner, showed that contaminated
                Sellafield workers could pass on genetic damage to their
                children resulting in leukaemia and stillbirths. Leukaemia
                clusters have been found near Sellafield and the Dounreay
                nuclear plant in Scotland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sellafield also has a notoriously poor safety
                record and, according to the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate,
                data on fuel given to Japan had been systematically falsified.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The opening of the MOX plant will herald a
                plethora of new disasters waiting to happen. A MOX plant
                reprocesses plutonium, one of the most toxic substances known to
                mankind. Stephen Tindale, the executive director of Greenpeace
                in the United Kingdom, said that</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;expanding the global trade in plutonium
                is dangerously irresponsible, especially at a time of huge
                global insecurity&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Using the Irish Sea as a transport route to
                and from Sellafield puts Northern Ireland at even greater risk.
                It is clear that the Prime Minister, Tony Blair, is more
                concerned with the loss of jobs than with the health and
                well-being of the population. The Prime Minister is on record as
                saying</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;I totally understand the concerns of
                people, but our difficulty is that we end up in a situation
                where there will be a lot of people who will lose their
                jobs&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is a totally irresponsible policy of the
                Prime Minister and the Government.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mention has already been made of the
                potential for terrorist attacks and the possibility of
                terrorists obtaining MOX fuel. The fear, heightened by the
                recent terror attacks in the United States, is that terrorists
                could extract plutonium from MOX, which could be used in nuclear
                weapons or in &quot;dirty bombs&quot; — conventional devices
                containing the substance. They do not explode like a nuclear
                bomb but can spread radiation over a large area. Charles Secrett,
                director of Friends of the Earth, said</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The Government’s decision to allow
                the MOX plant to open….makes the world an even more dangerous
                place&quot;.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I therefore support the motion.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister of the Environment (Mr Foster):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It seems as if the British Government are
                taking a bashing today from so-called adherents. I prefer to say
                &quot;Her Majesty’s Government&quot;. Mr Mick Murphy’s talk
                of an attack on the innocent was poignant; there was an attack
                on the innocent in this country for 30 years, and, in many
                instances, the silence was deafening.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.45 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am aware of the public concern surrounding
                Sellafield. For that reason, I am grateful for the opportunity
                to speak on this motion. It is extremely important that the
                Assembly and the Northern Ireland public are given clear
                information about Sellafield — about its discharges into the
                Irish Sea and how responsibility for the regulation of
                Sellafield has been allocated under the law of Her Majesty’s
                Government.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As most Members will be aware, responsibility
                for regulating the discharges from the Sellafield complex rests
                with the Environment Agency for England and Wales. Regulation of
                the wider security aspects is the responsibility of the Office
                of Civil Nuclear Security, an agency under the United Kingdom
                Department of Trade and Industry. The citizens of Northern
                Ireland, as of Cumbria and other parts of the United Kingdom,
                rightly look to these agencies to safeguard their health and
                environmental interests. Those agencies, and the UK Ministers
                for Environment and Trade and Industry, bear a heavy
                responsibility towards the citizens of these islands.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The powers of the Northern Ireland Executive
                and Assembly are necessarily more limited. My Department has a
                vital role in monitoring the impact of discharges from
                Sellafield into the Irish Sea on the Northern Ireland coastline.
                We have had a comprehensive monitoring programme to assess these
                impacts for many years. My Department reviews this monitoring
                system annually to ensure that it is sufficiently robust, taking
                into account any changes at the Sellafield complex. I am glad to
                say that the results of the monitoring are published annually.
                The availability of objective scientific information is crucial
                to a clear understanding of the issues surrounding Sellafield.
                At this point, I should emphasise that the results of this
                monitoring have consistently shown minimal amounts of
                radioactivity, at levels that are consistent with normal
                background levels.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department has also undertaken joint
                studies with the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland
                and with University College Dublin on the impact of discharges
                from Sellafield. These studies also consistently show low
                radioactivity levels on the Irish coastline in counties Down,
                Louth and beyond. It has been calculated that the most exposed
                members of the public would receive around 0·002 microsieverts
                per year from the operation of the MOX plant. This equates to
                around two seconds flying on a transatlantic flight. People in
                Northern Ireland receive, on average, 2,500 microsieverts of
                radiation per year from all natural and artificial resources.
                Fifty per cent of this is due to exposure to radon in the home,
                and 12% is from medical exposure. Nuclear discharges account for
                less than 0·1%. While we must never be complacent about the
                risks, equally we should avoid alarming people unnecessarily.
                For that reason, it is my duty to repeat the broad thrust of the
                scientific evidence so that the Northern Ireland public is made
                aware of it.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr McClelland] in the
                Chair).</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important to note that in addition to
                the regular monitoring of discharges on the marine environment,
                my Department continues to play a part with other Departments in
                planning for dealing with nuclear accidents. Following the
                Chernobyl accident, the Northern Ireland technical advice group
                was set up to oversee and advise on our response to an overseas
                nuclear accident. This group draws its membership from all
                relevant Northern Ireland Departments, including those
                responsible for countermeasures in regard to public health,
                drinking water and the food chain. My Department also has a
                radiological emergency response plan, which deals with a range
                of actions to be taken in the event of such an incident. Of
                course, the Northern Ireland emergency plan is fully integrated
                into the UK one.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That said, I want to emphasise to Members
                that I fully understand that there is widespread public concern
                about Sellafield. I realise that this concern has been
                heightened as a result of the recent terrorist incidents in the
                USA. The recent decision to approve the MOX plant at Sellafield
                was, of course, taken jointly by the Secretary of State for
                Health and the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and
                Rural Affairs. Both carry important responsibilities to all
                citizens of the United Kingdom and beyond.</p>

                Nuclear Inspectorate will also be required before plutonium can
                be introduced into the plant. These are important safeguards.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is also of some relevance that the UN
                Tribunal on the Law of the Seas has recently refused the
                Republic of Ireland Government’s case for having the
                Sellafield MOX project halted. The scrutiny of this important
                body should provide some further assurance to us. However, I
                have also noted its injunction that the UK Government should
                share information on Sellafield and that the UK Government has
                agreed to do so.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is to be welcomed.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not intend to give way. I will be kept
                fully informed about consultations between the two Governments
                following the tribunal’s decision, and Sellafield will be a
                subject of consideration by the British-Irish Council.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After the attacks on 11 September in the
                United States, my Department contacted the Department for
                Environment, Food and Rural Affairs in order to seek assurances
                that, amongst other things, the potential impact of a terrorist
                incident at Sellafield would be taken into account when the
                decision on the MOX plant is made. That correspondence will be
                copied to the Environment Committee of the Assembly. Recently, I
                also wrote to Margaret Beckett, the Secretary of State for
                Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. A copy was sent to Stephen
                Byers, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, who is
                responsible for civil nuclear safety matters at Sellafield. My
                purpose was to seek further information and assurances about the
                regulation of Sellafield, particularly the security arrangements
                after 11 September. I look forward to receiving the UK
                Government’s response in due course and will convey as much of
                it to the Assembly as national security constraints will allow.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to be satisfied that Northern Ireland’s
                interests are taken into account and protected by the competent
                UK authorities. To that end, I will continue to pay close
                attention to radiological monitoring and to seek information
                from the relevant UK authorities on the safety and security of
                operations at Sellafield.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGrady:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I appreciate the contributions made by
                everyone, which will join the similar comments made by the
                proposer of the motion. There have not been many disagreements
                about the cause that we are pursuing, except that I have been
                accused of two things: first, bashing the British Government
                over the issue — and yes, I admit to that and plead guilty,
                and I will continue to do so; secondly, there was a rather
                strange alliance between Sinn Féin and the DUP to bash me and
                my Colleague for daring to table an amendment. I am glad to see
                that there is some unanimity between the two parties, as Sinn
                Féin accused the DUP and the Alliance Party of such unanimity.
                There is a lovely triangle at work in the Chamber today.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mick Murphy attacked me personally by saying
                that I had proposed the amendment for personal reasons. That is
                an insult not only to me but also to my absent Colleague to whom
                I earlier offered my condolences on the bereavement in his
                family.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The motion is in respect of
                nuclear-processing activities. The stoppage of
                nuclear-processing activities will not give a result. It is
                necessary to stop nuclear- reprocessing activities, which is a
                very different scientific concept. The amendment was tabled
                yesterday after an announcement at 11.00 am from the tribunal of
                the International Law of the Sea in Hamburg regarding the case
                that the Irish Government brought against the British Government
                over the licensing that is pending full implementation. That is
                not contained in the motion, and it is important that we address
                the issue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I like to think that there is no disputation
                in the Chamber. It might be presumptuous of me, but when the
                proposer and the seconder are winding up, could they amalgamate
                the two into a composite motion, so that we will have total
                unanimity?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The proposer of the motion drew our attention
                to the enormous potential health risks of cancer clusters. These
                were also mentioned by Mr Shannon.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important that some of the Minister’s
                comments are dealt with in a short winding-up speech. I have
                already dealt with the accusations of bashing the British
                Government. I have admitted to that and pleaded guilty, and I
                will continue the bashing as an unrepentant sinner. However, as
                a protection for relative inaction, the Minister says that he is
                happy to depend on the safeguards of the Health and Safety
                Executive of the United Kingdom.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Perhaps he did not listen to what I said. The
                Health and Safety Executive in England has not yet given advice
                to the British Government; neither has it made its conditions
                appropriate to the issue of the licence. The British Government
                went ahead of its Health and Safety Executive.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister also quoted the Radiological
                Protection Institute of Ireland as an argument for relative
                inactivity. Perhaps I spoke too softly, but the Radiological
                Protection Institute of Ireland clearly stated in a recent
                report that Sellafield is</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;the dominant source of this
                contamination&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">in the Irish Sea. A further report from the
                Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland stated that along
                the Irish coastline, the highest activity concentrations of
                radioactive material are observed in the north-east — the area
                for which the Minister is responsible.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He should not be able to hide behind these
                two important protection bodies if those bodies have concerns or
                have not made a commitment to approving the licensing. Licensing
                is one of the most important and immediate issues, as it will
                multiply enormously the reprocessing capacity and, therefore,
                the generation of high, medium and low-level radioactive
                material.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister said that there is great public
                concern. I am glad that that is recognised. The House recognises
                it, and the Minister must show by his actions that he recognises
                it too. What more will be done about it?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister also referred to the assurances
                that he is getting from the British Government — rather he is
                awaiting a reply from them — that the security risk is
                containable. Before 11 September, the World Information Service
                on Energy described the grave security risks attendant on
                Sellafield, information that has since been published. I am far
                from convinced that the British Government took the scale of
                security risks into account when they made their decision. I
                repeat, the OSPAN committee — as distinct from OSPAR — which
                was appointed to advise the Government, has yet to report. The
                British Government even went ahead of it. This was a hasty
                decision made for particular reasons.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is especially important today because of
                the decision taken at Hamburg yesterday morning. This is an
                important week. It is important that we realise what happened in
                this one of the two or three pending cases. We now have interim
                findings from the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea
                with regard to the Irish Government’s bid to prevent the
                commissioning of the mixed oxide plant. The international
                tribunal refused the Irish Government’s request to force the
                British Government to withdraw the licence.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, it did other things. The president
                of the tribunal ordered the British and Irish Governments to
                co-operate and consult on measures in the coming weeks. The
                tribunal insisted that both Governments report to it before 17
                December. The tribunal further prescribed that both Governments
                shall exchange the necessary information to enable a reasoned
                judgement to be made. It also insisted that both Governments
                establish a mechanism to monitor the operation and the effect
                that this plant will have on the Irish Sea. It gives latitude to
                the president of the International Tribunal for the Law of the
                Sea to ask for further reports. This is not a clean sheet; this
                is not a blanket refusal from the tribunal. It is saying,
                &quot;We shall not halt the licensing now; but we want to be
                assured by your urgent reporting that you are satisfied that the
                international law is required&quot;.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We will be looking for that report before
                Christmas and for a further report in January 2002. It is not a
                lost cause, and it is important that we follow it to its
                conclusion.</p>
                <i>

                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This debate has been held many times, and I
                make no excuse for rehearsing it. If the commissioning of the
                MOX plant goes ahead, that will affect and perpetuate nuclear
                reprocessing activities at Sellafield and add dramatically to
                the level of radioactive discharges to the marine environment.
                It will also increase the volume of worldwide shipments of
                nuclear fuels, with the obvious risks to traffic in the Irish
                Sea.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Other European countries, particularly the
                Nordic countries and Iceland, have increased their pressure on
                the British Government through the EU. The International Energy
                Agency and the WISE group of scientists in Paris have emphasised
                the need to rethink the issue. The Northern Ireland Executive,
                and particularly the Minister’s Department, must take
                concerted action and reflect the opinion expressed in the
                Chamber and that of the people of Northern Ireland, to strongly
                oppose the licensing of the MOX plant.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support Mr McCarthy. We must continue the
                process of decommissioning and eventual closure of the entire
                plant at Sellafield. That is what our constituents want. It is
                not just a wish; it is substantiated across all agencies.
                Britain has flouted the OSPAR agreement made at Sintra as
                regards the discharge levels that it undertook to reduce. It
                went ahead of its own environment and health and safety
                executive report, and it went ahead of the WISE security report.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That has all been driven by dubious financial
                considerations, because it can now be proved — given the views
                of one of the main contractors, British Energy — that it is
                too expensive to reprocess nuclear waste. It is not
                cost-effective. No one uses the end product of reprocessed
                uranium and plutonium.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important that the Department of the
                Environment, through the North/South Ministerial Council, the
                British- Irish Council and the Council of the Isles, gets the
                message across that we cannot, and will not, accept what is
                happening to the environment. There are potential health and
                security risks.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I had no intention of diminishing the main
                motion. My aim was to exploit the licensing situation that was
                created yesterday morning; to make our objections known and to
                correct a couple of words in the motion. The winding-up speech
                should show that we have a commonality of approach and a common
                motion to propose and accept.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Wells:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGrady’s words have fallen on fertile
                ground. After consulting Mr McCarthy we are mindful, with the
                will of the House, to accept Mr McGrady’s amendment. That
                proves that we do sometimes listen. I can say that with double
                certainty because, until this afternoon, I had lost the hearing
                in my left ear. In the middle of his speech, my hearing came
                back. — <i>[Interruption]</i>.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Not only am I listening but today Mr McGrady
                has given me the ability to listen fully. We accept that his
                amendment is clarifying a difficulty that he had with the
                original motion and adds to it. It is important that, as an
                Assembly, we go forward united on this crucial issue. There is
                no unholy alliance between Sinn Féin, the Alliance Party and
                the DUP. The DUP has consulted the Alliance Party, and we are
                happy to accept the SDLP amendment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is very sad that a Minister can come
                before the House, read from a prepared text given to him by his
                officials and refuse to accept the intervention of a Member who
                wants to ask crucial questions about the welfare and health of
                the people of this Province. How are we ever going to perform
                properly as an Assembly if Ministers are not prepared to give
                way when there is a time limit on an issue as crucial as this? I
                will ask the three questions that I intended to ask the Minister
                had he given way. I will give him the opportunity to intervene
                at any time during my speech, and for as long as he likes, to
                answer those questions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Was Mr Foster, as Minister of the
                Environment, consulted before the decision to go ahead with the
                MOX plant at Sellafield was announced? The people of Northern
                Ireland need to know, because we will be directly affected by
                the implications of the opening of that plant.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If he was consulted, what comments did he
                make to his counterpart at Westminster on this vital issue? If
                he was not consulted, did he protest in the strongest possible
                fashion that the Assembly was being ignored and that its views
                were not taken into account before the decision was made? The
                people of Northern Ireland have a right to know the answers to
                those questions. I want to give the Minister the opportunity to
                answer them, if he feels that that is appropriate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sellafield is closer to Belfast than it is to
                Sheffield or Birmingham. This is a reserved matter, and the
                Assembly has no direct control over the licensing of Sellafield.
                However, the implications of anything going wrong at Sellafield
                are more important to the people of Belfast than they are to the
                people of Birmingham, because we are that much closer.
                Sellafield was opened in 1956 and is literally across the Irish
                Sea. It has produced the most radioactive, contaminated sea in
                the world. All the risks associated with Sellafield fall on the
                people of Northern Ireland, but none of the benefits. Nobody
                from Northern Ireland is employed at Sellafield. None of the
                power produced at Sellafield goes onto the Northern Ireland
                grid. However, it is the folk on the east coast of the Province,
                in Portavogie and Portaferry, Ardglass, Kilkeel and Newcastle,
                who will be directly affected by the continuing radioactivity of
                the Irish Sea, or if something goes drastically wrong.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A recent issue of ‘New Scientist’
                magazine predicted that a terrorist attack on Sellafield would
                produce a radioactive cloud of dust 44 times bigger than the
                cloud that escaped from Chernobyl. Chernobyl is many thousands
                of miles away from Northern Ireland, but as older Members will
                remember, there were major implications for agriculture, even in
                Northern Ireland, as a result of the fallout from that accident.
                Scientists predict an impact 44 times greater.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I suppose that some would have said, before
                September 11, that this speculation was fanciful, and that it
                would be incredible that anyone should think that a plane could
                be crashed into a tall building, killing many thousands of
                people. Now, unfortunately, we see all too clearly that that is
                indeed a real threat. If some lunatic terrorist decided to bomb
                Sellafield, the implications for Northern Ireland would be
                horrendous. It was my hope that we would have heard an
                announcement that Sellafield was to be run down as safely as
                possible.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The reason that the announcement regarding
                the MOX plant is so important after five years of consultation
                is that the £470 million that has been spent on developing it,
                and the decision to continue using it, means that there is
                little prospect of running Sellafield down. The MOX plant is an
                entirely new process in which there has been much investment.
                The Government will feel that they simply have to continue
                pumping in large amounts of money to keep that plant going.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The MOX plant cost £470 million. It is
                predicted that even on the most optimistic basis, it will make a
                net profit of £200 million over its lifespan. No matter what
                happens, this new plant is a white elephant that will cost
                British taxpayers, including ourselves, a significant amount of
                money. Even that estimated profit is based on the assumption
                that BNFL will secure all the markets that it has predicted will
                be secured. However, that is far from the reality. As things
                stand, BNFL has markets for only 11% of the produce that it
                intends to manufacture. What will happen if it is unsuccessful
                in obtaining new markets? There will be huge stockpiling of MOX
                products at Sellafield, which is only a few miles from the east
                coast of Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Japanese market appears to be rapidly
                drying up. As a result of the falsification, deliberate or
                otherwise, of some of the information given to the Japanese, it
                seems that they are getting cold feet about purchasing any
                further reprocessed material from Sellafield. Sweden is also
                getting cold feet, and other markets are far from secure. Will
                that lead to stockpiling of vast amounts of radioactive
                material? The chances are that it will.</p>

                correspondence, because I hope that if he wrote to his
                counterpart Minister in Westminster, it was to protest in the
                strongest possible fashion about the lack of consultation. He
                has now admitted that there was no consultation with the

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What the Minister has said is very revealing.
                This part of the United Kingdom has been affected for years.
                This debate did not start yesterday. In the European committee
                on which I served, I learnt that Sellafield had been polluting
                the Irish Sea for years, and that there was danger in that. Now,
                with Sellafield’s new departure to try to keep doing its work
                under another guise and a different name, we learn that the
                Minister with responsibility to the people of Northern Ireland
                on this issue was not even told about it. He was not consulted.
                That is ridiculous.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The British Government must be called to
                account. I will be asking a question in Westminster about this,
                and I am sure that Mr McGrady will do the same. Even though the
                Assembly does not have powers on this issue, it should not have
                been ignored. Our Minister should have at least been consulted
                and informed of what was happening. That is how the British
                Government act — they do the job and then the people hear
                about it.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Wells:</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the hon Member for his comment.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I must emphasise that I have nothing to hide.
                I wrote to my Westminster counterparts because I was concerned
                that I had not been consulted on the matter, and I knew that the
                people of Northern Ireland were concerned.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Wells:</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I appreciate the Minister’s comments. I am
                glad that the deafness that left me did not transfer to him. He
                heard my questions, and he has answered them. However, I am not
                reassured by the news that a Westminster Department decided to
                go ahead with a decision that has major implications for the
                health of the people of Northern Ireland and did not even think
                it worthwhile to write to the counterpart Northern Ireland
                Department.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While it is true that the Department of the
                Environment has no direct control over the licensing of
                Sellafield, it has direct control over the testing and
                assessment of the water and air in Northern Ireland for
                radioactivity. Therefore, if for no other reason but to give him
                his place, Mr Foster should have been consulted. I hope that the
                message sent by the Assembly and the Minister to Westminster is
                that we will not tolerate that sort of treatment in regard to a
                matter that is so directly linked to our people’s welfare and
                health.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several Members raised the issue of
                transportation. As well as the dangers of a terrorist attack on
                Sellafield, large quantities of nuclear material will be
                transported to and from Sellafield, mostly by boat, sometimes by
                air. There could be a natural disaster, with a ship running

                material. If there were a MOX plant, more ships would be sailing

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not want to be alarmist and scare
                people. However, if a heavily laden plane is hijacked at an
                airport in the north of England and is directed towards
                Sellafield, almost nothing can be done to stop it. Events in the
                United States are evidence of that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What is happening at Sellafield is deeply
                alarming. As a community we are united on this issue, and those
                of us who represent communities on the east coast of Northern
                Ireland are particularly concerned. We receive none of the
                benefits of Sellafield, but we have all the worries and
                penalties. I hope that the Assembly sends out a united message
                that we must be consulted in the future and that the ultimate
                aim of the UK Government — our Government — is the gradual
                and safe rundown of nuclear reprocessing at Sellafield.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, if Sellafield is so safe, why is it
                not located in the Midlands, and if it is so watertight, how
                many of its executives live within a 30-mile radius of the

                euro to be officially recognised as a second currency alongside
                sterling in Northern Ireland after 1 January 2002.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I draw Members’ attention to the fact that
                despite many attempts on my part, this is the first time that
                the Assembly has debated the vital issue of the single European
                currency. The debate is long overdue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although Northern Ireland is not part of the
                euro zone, the impact of its arrival on the local economy will
                be tremendous, and we must be prepared. Just four weeks from
                today, the greatest single economic event in the history of the
                European Union will swing into action. It will affect 300
                million people in tens of millions of homes in hundreds of
                thousands of villages in 12 European countries, and it will
                affect us. The United Kingdom may have chosen to &quot;wait and
                see&quot;, but in Northern Ireland it must be recognised that we
                will be touched by the euro phenomenon whether we like it or
                not.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Northern Ireland is the only area of the
                United Kingdom that has a land border with a euro zone.
                Undoubtedly, Northern Ireland will feel the effects more than
                any other region of the United Kingdom. We are in a unique
                position, and we need special arrangements to allow us to take
                advantage of our situation. Our experience with dual currency
                has been restricted to pound/punt transactions in the border
                areas. However, we should not forget that there are only three
                million people using punts in the world. From January 2002, no
                one will be using punts, Deutschmarks, pesetas, lire or any
                other of the currencies of the 12 European countries involved.
                There will be more than 300 million people using euros. Northern
                Ireland, whether we like it or not, could find itself awash with
                euros in the months and years to come.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What should our traders, tourist
                establishments, businesses and bankers do? Should they operate a
                dual currency system? Can they afford to take on the exchange
                rate risk? Can they afford not to? Do they simply say &quot;No
                euros served here&quot;? I believe that those days are gone. Our
                farmers, businesses, industries and the public need guidance and
                support. Above all, they need clear political direction. That is
                why urgent action is needed. By calling on the Government to
                make the necessary legal and financial arrangements for the euro
                to be officially recognised as a second currency alongside
                sterling — I emphasise &quot;alongside&quot; sterling — we
                are simply asking for arrangements to be made to accommodate,
                facilitate and, where is it in the interests of business and
                industry, encourage the use of the euro in financial
                transactions in Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are not calling for laws to be imposed to
                force people to accept euros against their will. It should be
                done on a voluntary basis, and it should be demand-led and
                market-driven. The difference between that situation and what is
                being called &quot;cross-border currency creep&quot; — which
                will inevitably take place — is that we would be giving the
                euro an official welcome and preparing ourselves for what will
                happen.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The motion, as it currently stands, is
                calling for the euro to be recognised as a second currency
                alongside sterling. That would mean that the euro would be legal
                tender and that any shop in Northern Ireland would have to
                transact business based upon it. The motion is, therefore, not
                introducing the euro on a voluntary basis, but rather putting it
                on a compulsory footing. That would add additional costs to
                every retail and tourist outlet in Northern Ireland. Does the
                Member accept that her motion, as it currently stands, is not a
                means of introducing the euro on a voluntary basis?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Morrice:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member’s comments give me the
                opportunity to explain matters. It is important that Members
                understand the situation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I asked the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and
                Investment, Sir Reg Empey, about the euro and the matter of
                legal tender, and he explained that the euro is legal tender in
                Northern Ireland already. Foreign currencies are legal tender,
                so legal recognition does not mean that a currency is imposed
                upon traders, and I am not calling for it to be made compulsory
                tender. From the point of view of a party that is pro-European,
                there is no point in trying to force the euro upon shopkeepers.
                That would hardly endear them to the currency. The euro is legal
                tender, and it is treated in the same way as the dollar and the
                yen. Sterling is the only legal currency of the United Kingdom.
                I am asking for the euro to be given special status, for its
                &quot;foreign currency&quot; label to be removed and for it to
                be treated differently from the dollar and the yen. I say again
                that it would not be compulsory — it would be on a voluntary
                basis, demand-led and market-driven.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Dr Ian Paisley:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Is the Member drawing a distinction between
                legal tender and a double currency? The Member seems to be
                defining what is legal tender, then saying that she does not
                want it to be legal tender, although she claims that it is so
                — she wants it to be a second currency.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Can the Member explain that? It will take a
                good deal of explaining. Does she think, in the name of all good
                fortune, that the British Government will listen to a debate
                attended in this manner in the Assembly, and make a drastic
                change to the entire financial arrangements of the United
                Kingdom before the referendum takes place? If she thinks so, she
                must be living in a country whose name I do not even know.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Morrice:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will go to great pains to explain matters
                to Members who do not understand them. Sir Reg Empey informed
                the House that the euro is already legal tender in Northern
                Ireland — Members can refer to Hansard on that. I went to
                great pains to phone the Treasury and ask for an explanation.
                The explanation was given to me, and I was grateful for it. All
                foreign currencies are legal tender because they can be traded
                in this country. The UK has a very liberal regime in that
                regard. The euro should not be treated as foreign currency. My
                next remarks are for the benefit of Rev Dr Ian Paisley in
                particular. I do not know whether the Bank of England has been
                listening to the previous discussions in Northern Ireland, but
                it has decided to remove the foreign currency label from the
                euro. That important step has been taken in the City of London.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are practical benefits. Members will
                understand the plight of the farmers. They are crying out for
                help. Their exports have been crippled by the strength of
                sterling, as we know well. They are sympathetic towards the
                United Kingdom’s entry into the single European currency. It
                would be a positive move for the farmers. Why should we make
                them wait for the outcome of a referendum?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not know whether Members are aware of
                it, but earlier this year the European Council of Ministers
                agreed that subsidies to farmers could be paid in euros.
                However, the UK Government have so far applied that form of
                payment to export refunds only. In other words, only the large,
                exporting farmers can benefit. What happens to the small
                farmers? Why can they not receive all their subsidies — which
                can make up as much as 100% of their wage packets — in euros?
                If that is allowed by Europe, why are the UK Government
                preventing it? I understand that the Ulster Farmers’ Union
                would be very pleased to see subsidies paid in euros.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Big businesses — and not just those in the
                border areas — will move to a dual-currency regime themselves.
                They recognise that it is in their interests to do so. That,
                however, could leave the small businesses, which cannot afford
                to operate in two currencies, high and dry. Euro customers will
                flock to the large retail outlets, which will be offering goods
                and change in euros. The small businesses will be bypassed. We
                need a level playing field.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The United Kingdom Government have got us
                into this situation. It is the duty of the Treasury to provide
                appropriate financial support to allow our small businesses to
                operate in euros and sterling if they so desire. I want to
                underline that — if small businesses want to use euros, they
                should be allowed to do so, and they should be given appropriate
                financial support directly from London.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Tourism is vital to our economy, and we want
                it to grow. The Minister in charge of tourism, Sir Reg Empey,
                has said that he expects two thirds of our tourists to come from
                the euro zone this year. That is as a result of the slowdown in
                transatlantic traffic in the aftermath of the events of 11
                September. We are also attempting to market Ireland — North
                and South — as a tourist destination. Sir Reg Empey has said
                that it will be difficult to do that because we are dealing in
                two currencies.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">By encouraging our large and small hotels,
                our restaurants and our tourist facilities in Northern Ireland
                to operate in euros as well as in pounds, we send an important
                message to our guests: Northern Ireland is open for all
                business.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.30 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must also send an important message to
                foreign investors. Allowing them to operate in euros would
                encourage them to regard Northern Ireland as a special place to
                do business, either in euros or in pounds. They can use Northern
                Ireland as a stepping stone to a European market of 300 million
                people, and do so in the currency of their choice. They will
                avoid the huge cost of foreign exchange. That is something that
                the new super-agency should look into.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I could talk forever about the benefits of
                moving towards a dual currency system — in cross-border trade,
                for example, which we are trying to promote. With regard to
                cross-border transport, do we want Ulsterbus to become
                &quot;Ulster bureau de change on wheels&quot;? Bus drivers
                should be allowed to take their money in euros and to give their
                change in euros. Should not students who study abroad be
                entitled to receive their grants in euros if they wish? What
                about people who regularly travel abroad? The list is endless.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to stress, to Mr Beggs in particular,
                that a dual currency system cannot be imposed upon those who may
                be reluctant Europeans. It must be operated voluntarily. We must
                recognise that the euro is a reality. We must stop playing King
                Canute; we must stop trying to stem the rising tide of the euro
                onto these shores; we must stop treating it as a foreign body.
                It is in the best interests of all to facilitate its arrival and
                to get the best of both worlds.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Women’s Coalition’s motion is not an
                attempt to pre-empt the decision of a referendum. As a party we
                are pro-European; however, we are also pragmatists. We respect
                the will of the people. By supporting the motion, Members will
                be supporting a pragmatic solution to accommodate the euro in
                Northern Ireland, and they will be sending an important message
                to our European partners. The motion is not intended to
                introduce the euro by the back door. Rather, it places Northern
                Ireland at the front door of the euro in the United Kingdom and
                at the forefront of investment in Europe.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Birnie:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The subject of the euro is a very important
                one. When the history of Europe since the second world war is
                written, the introduction of the euro will stand alongside the
                collapse of the Berlin Wall as one of the most significant
                events of the past five or six decades. To that extent I
                congratulate Ms Morrice, and I am grateful to her for moving the
                motion.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Beyond that, I am struggling with the sense
                (or otherwise) of the motion. As about 20% of Northern Ireland’s
                manufacturing output is sold to the prospective &quot;Euroland&quot;
                — the countries that will make it up from 1 January 2002 —
                it clearly does make commercial sense for exporting firms to
                prepare themselves for the euro. No doubt they will do so.
                However, I doubt, and this is my quarrel with the motion, that
                we need such a motion to encourage firms to do that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must bear in mind that introducing a new
                currency entails a large administrative cost. The same costs
                will apply if the euro is introduced as a dual currency in the
                Province.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The estimated potential cost of that varies
                between £200 million and £750 million. Those figures derive
                from the Small Firms Association in the Republic of Ireland,
                adapted to the size of the Northern Ireland economy, and the
                House of Commons Select Committee on Trade and Industry report
                on the single currency.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Are the proposers of the motion entirely
                happy that the Northern Ireland economy should have such a cost
                imposed on it, which will inevitably follow the introduction of
                a second, officially recognised currency?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Morrice:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important that I immediately clear up
                any misunderstanding. The Member will recall that I said that
                there will be administrative costs, but I am calling on the UK
                Treasury to pay those costs. The UK Government got us into this
                situation. They will pay those costs if we get into the euro,
                and they should be paying them in advance now. I am not calling
                on the Northern Ireland economy to pay those costs — I am
                calling on the Treasury to do so.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Birnie:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Member for her contribution.
                However, with all respect, it is entirely incredible that HM
                Treasury would stump up between £200 million and £750 million
                on the self-indulgent introduction of a dual currency in a
                single region of the United Kingdom. Week after week in the
                House, there are repeated calls to reform Barnett and to get
                extra money from HM Treasury for policing, railways, gas
                pipelines and hospitals. If we add the euro to that, I imagine
                that Gordon Brown will start to chew the carpet and say,
                &quot;Get these mad Northern Irish people away from me&quot;.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is quite clear that the proposers of the
                motion favour the entire euro project. That is their right, but
                the majority of public opinion in the United Kingdom is against
                the introduction of the euro. Indeed, even in Germany — the
                powerhouse of the Continental European economy — it seems that
                the majority of opinion, if given a free choice, would vote to
                retain the Deutschmark. Perhaps the proposers imagine a creeping
                euro status whereby the Province is half in and half out of the
                single currency, and that that will forward eventual adoption of
                the euro.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The economic case against full UK membership
                of the euro is overwhelming. Therefore, the same arguments
                surely apply to any formalised dual currency status. A
                publication entitled ‘The Economic Case Against the Euro’
                was issued last month by a group called New Europe. That
                document proves demonstrably that, under the five economic tests
                that were set by Chancellor of the Exchequer, Gordon Brown,
                there is little or no case for either the UK as a whole, or
                Northern Ireland in particular, joining the euro in the
                foreseeable future. If that is true for total adoption of the
                euro, it surely applies to the implication of the strict wording
                of the motion.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The trade cycles of the UK and the
                Continental European Union remain out of line, and a common
                European monetary policy of &quot;one size fits all&quot; will
                not work. Contrary to Ms Morrice’s argument, neither the euro
                nor, by implication, dual currency status are needed to promote
                foreign direct investment into either Northern Ireland or Great
                Britain. Of IDB-backed external investment into the Province in
                recent years, 97% came from non-euro countries — only 3% came
                from the euro zone.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In short, the euro would not be good for jobs
                for the United Kingdom financial sector or for the overall
                health of the economy. Before we back the motion, we should
                remember that the recent experience of the Southern Irish
                economy’s preparation for the adoption of the euro has not
                been a happy one. During the 1990s, the Republic experienced
                rapid economic growth. Much of that can be explained by the free
                exchange rate that existed at that time. In 1993, the punt was
                devalued by a substantial amount, which increased
                competitiveness. Many economists believe that that led to much
                of the growth of the &quot;Celtic tiger&quot; economy.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Dr Ian Paisley:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member will recall that the Republic
                received a heavy subsidy from Europe — something like £6
                million a day was poured into the Southern Irish economy.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Birnie:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree with the Member that that was a
                contributory factor, but many Southern Irish economists feel
                that the devaluation of the punt was of even more significance.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Notwithstanding a favourable macroeconomic
                performance, the Southern Irish Government have this year been
                repeatedly subjected to what can only be described as bullying
                from the European Commission. That is part and parcel of the
                loss of autonomy — the ability to set policy to fit regional
                or national conditions. An eminent Southern Irish economist,
                Prof Peter Neary of University College Dublin, said in 1997
                that, as far as he knew, every university economist in the
                Republic of Ireland was concerned at the harm which would be
                done to the Southern economy through joining the euro in a
                position where sterling was not doing so. As the Nobel
                prizewinning economist Milton Friedman has argued recently about
                the Southern Irish economy, the euro experiment has represented
                a case of locking itself to the rest of the EU economies while
                throwing away the key.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While the aspirations behind this motion are
                in part worthy, the motion is unnecessary. Where businesses find
                it beneficial to adapt to a multicurrency set-up, they will do
                so. They have been doing that for years, especially in the
                border regions. I can see no advantage in officially recognising
                a second currency alongside sterling, to use Ms Morrice’s
                words. She has failed to explain how her motion will differ from
                what will happen in any case. I oppose the motion.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs Courtney:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the motion, which calls on the
                United Kingdom Government to make the necessary legal and
                financial arrangements for the euro to be officially recognised
                from 1 January 2002 as a second currency in Northern Ireland
                alongside sterling.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I come from Derry, the second city, which is
                geographically next to Donegal. Since partition, Donegal has
                suffered economically by being cut off from its natural
                hinterland. However, being practical, the people of Donegal and
                ourselves on the other side of the border have got used to
                living with it and, occasionally, have used the border to our
                advantage. I could, for example, quote the difference in punt
                and pound. We know we will get a better rate for sterling if we
                change it and spend it across the border, and considerable
                savings can be made. We all notice the queues at filling
                stations across the border, and that proves my point. We can
                also save on holidays; everyone wants a bargain and to get the
                best possible rate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, the downside is that for the last
                year all bills in the Republic of Ireland have been in dual
                currency — punts and euros. The Republic has got used to it,
                but we across the border still endeavour to work out rates.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Why should that concern us? After all, the UK
                Government have still to decide when to join the EU currency and
                adopt the euro. It concerns us because traders and business
                people in every border area are gearing up for the euro. It is
                happening in my city, and it will be more obvious in the run-up
                to Christmas. To encourage business and to attract customers
                from the Republic of Ireland, traders traditionally give a very
                good rate for the punt. In many instances that means punt for
                pound, and that continues into sale time, after 1 January.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">From 1 January 2002 three currencies will be
                in operation — the punt, the pound and the euro. That will add
                further confusion. We have the added problem that the punt will
                no longer be legal tender, North or South, after 9 February.
                From 1 January 2002 to 9 February 2002, there will be a period
                of dual circulation when both punt and euro will be accepted.
                After that, banks in the North will accept punts until 15
                February. That will help traders in border areas, as shoppers
                attempt to get rid of their punts.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In my area, we are aware that individuals are
                offered large loans in punts, interest free — provided they
                are paid back in euros. The black market is already in
                operation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Banks have also advised business that cheques
                made out in punts after 31 December will not be accepted.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At a recent seminar in Derry, traders were
                informed that automated teller machines in Derry will dispense
                both euros and sterling from the beginning of the new year. Less
                than 40% of small businesses in the North are prepared for the
                euro, and 27% are adopting a wait-and- see approach. Therefore,
                issues such as the exchange rate must be addressed now. The
                exchange rate is currently set weekly; when the euro is adopted,
                it must be set daily. Dual pricing must also be addressed, so
                that customers know how much an item costs. The currency in
                Northern Ireland needs to be regularised. For us to achieve
                proper economic stability, the euro must be officially
                recognised as a second currency.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What is the euro? It is the single currency
                of the European monetary union, which was adopted by 11 member
                states on 1 January 1999. Those 11 member states are Belgium,
                Germany, Spain, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the
                Netherlands, Austria, Portugal and Finland. On 1 January 2001,
                Greece became the twelfth member state to adopt the euro. The
                name &quot;euro&quot; was chosen by the European heads of state
                at a conference in Madrid in December 1995.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What will it be like to use the euro? We
                shall have to get used to it irrespective of whether we are
                pro-European. It is similar to the existing national currency
                except that the bank notes and coins will be different. After
                January 2002, people who cross the border to spend money in the
                Republic will receive their change in euros.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We shall experience the real difference when
                we travel to countries that have adopted the euro, because it
                will no longer be necessary to exchange currency and, therefore,
                we shall not have to pay commission. We shall not have to spend
                time calculating price comparisons, and we shall not have to
                waste time shopping around for the best exchange rate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Other countries are adopting the euro. We
                must prepare for that now. It will, as Ms Morrice said, be a
                challenge for small businesses. The onus is on the UK Government
                to provide small businesses with the necessary finance to cope.
                They will have to make complicated changes to their information
                technology systems, their pricing and marketing policies and
                their financial management and accounting systems.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To prepare for that, I ask the Executive to
                note today’s debate and mandate all Departments to, if
                requested, pay bills in euros from 1 January 2002. It is
                imperative that the Assembly show the way forward. I represent a
                pro-European party, and it is clear, from listening to the
                debate, that there are few pro-Europeans in the Chamber. I
                congratulate the mover of the motion, and I support it.</p>

                our heads. We were told that we can have a referendum, but the
                euro will be in place before we are allowed to make our
                decision. The previous speaker told the House that the euro
                would be adopted anyway. However, the British people stand
                before the introduction of the euro, and they, through the
                ballot box, have the right to say whether they want the euro. No
                one can tell us that we must have it. The referendum will give
                the British public the opportunity to say either yes or no.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the British public vote no, what becomes
                of the hon Lady’s speech? It is utter nonsense for Ms Morrice
                to tell us that in the cloud cuckoo land in which she lives, the
                British Government will pay millions of pounds to bring her
                stupid little motion into effect. We cannot get enough money
                from the British Government to deal with bed shortages in
                hospitals. Does Ms Morrice really mean to tell the House that a
                couple of hundred million pounds will be set aside to fund a
                part-time euro to dance in tandem with the pound simply to
                please her?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I shall not give way, because I have been
                told that I have little time. If the Member wishes to use the
                motion to create a back door for the adoption of the euro, she
                is welcome to do so. However, she should acknowledge that it is
                a back door. She should not tell us about a house with the euro
                standing at the door.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member wants to push the euro in through
                the back door. I am told that I should write to the Speaker to
                request that I be paid in euros in future.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must get down to brass tacks — this
                motion deals with something that will not happen. There are good
                reasons why it will not happen: Northern Ireland is part of the
                United Kingdom. The decision to enter or not to enter the single
                currency will be made as a result of a UK-wide referendum. The
                decision will be a political, economic and constitutional one of
                fundamental importance. This debate divides all the parties in
                Westminster. To listen to some people, one would think that
                everyone was convinced that we must go down the euro road.
                Everyone is not convinced, and to say that the farming community
                wants to follow this route is nonsense.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The farming community is worried about why it
                does not get the same money as the middlemen. The farmers do not
                care whether the money is paid in euros or in pounds — they
                simply want the money, and they deserve it. Farmers do not get
                the money that they deserve for the job that they do. It is
                nonsense to say that they want the money to be paid in euros.
                Not one farming organisation has mentioned that issue to me. The
                Member must be a miracle woman if she thinks she knows what
                farmers want.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Prime Minister and the Chancellor are at
                odds on this issue. Only last week, the chairman of the Labour
                Party, Mr Charles Clarke, said that the Government should
                recommend entry into the euro even if the Treasury cannot prove
                that the single currency would be good for the economy. Members
                of the Cabinet are in public debate about what will happen.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Co-operation between nation states in Europe
                is to the benefit of those states, but I oppose the creation of
                a European superstate. Before a country gives up its currency,
                it should remember that he who pays the piper has the right to
                call the tune. A country can have independence in nothing if it

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members must examine the facts about British
                trade. The rest of the world is far more important to British
                trade than the euro zone, and we must remember that. I welcome
                Sir Reg Empey’s visit to China. If the salvation of our
                economy lies in Europe, why does he visit China? He does so
                because he realises that investment in Northern Ireland will not
                come from the euro zone. We shall not receive vast investment
                from Europe now. Those days are over, and we must look to other
                places. We trade as much with America as we do with Germany and
                France. How can the American Government do well when it pays in
                dollars and not in euros? Why does the Member not advocate that
                they change their dollars into euros and start trading in
                Europe?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The population of the euro zone is slowly
                decreasing, while the population of the rest of the world is
                rapidly increasing. The pound and the dollar are overwhelmingly
                more important for British trade than the euro. The Treasury
                itself reveals that only 19% of our exported goods are invoiced
                in euros, while 27% are exported in dollars and 52% in sterling.
                The pound/ dollar rate is the most stable in the world, so
                joining the euro would not increase stability for foreign trade
                — it would probably destabilise it. Although the euro zone
                will remain an enormously significant trading block, future
                changes in population and income levels per head mean that its
                relative significance in the world is at its high-water mark.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">New markets will become increasingly
                important. It is ironic that, as the UK considers abandoning its
                independent currency for the euro, the importance of trade with
                the euro zone may be about to fade.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member for North Down claims that the
                motion is about giving guidance to people when the euro arrives.
                I do not understand what she means. The euro is replacing the
                Irish punt, but there has never been any need for a dual
                currency system while the punt was legal tender. The idea that
                the euro will flood across the border and that people will not
                know how to deal with it is nonsense.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">She argues that farmers want the euro. What
                does she base that argument on? Farmers want a fair deal for
                their products from those who buy them in the production chain.
                It is regrettable that the Member believes that the introduction
                of the euro will cure the ills of the farming community. It will
                do nothing of the kind.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The people of the UK will decide if, and
                when, they will enter the euro zone — no one will decide for
                them. Judging by what the hon Member from the Official Unionists
                said, it seems there has been a turning of the tide for the
                euro. As a result, there is no need for a King Canute. The winds
                of business and trade are telling us not to stay in the euro
                zone, but rather to get business from every nook and cranny of
                the planet into Northern Ireland.</p>

                The motion is useful in opening up the debate on the euro — an
                issue that has not been debated enough — and I welcome the
                opportunity to speak about it. However, my party will not be
                supporting the motion because it is not practical, and because
                neither Gordon Brown nor Tony Blair will defer to the
                implications of the motion if it is passed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An informal dual currency has been operating
                on this island, and it will continue to operate after 1 January
                2002. Sinn Féin would like to see a united Irish currency that
                operates outside the European monetary union and that will
                retain the economic power and control that comes with having an
                independent currency. That will include the power to set
                interest rates, control the growth of money supply and determine
                an ideal exchange rate position. These are vital tools of any
                state’s economic strategy and play a crucial role in ensuring
                a dynamic sustainable economy.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Deputy Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I detect an undercurrent of conversation —
                it is difficult to hear what Dr O’Hagan is saying.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr O’Hagan:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The experience with the euro has shown that
                the European Central Bank takes no account of the needs of the
                small economies on the periphery of Europe when formulating
                monetary policy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The present dual currency system works
                against the creation of a united Irish economy, as will the
                introduction of the euro. The scenario of Britain being outside
                the single currency while the Twenty-six Counties adopt it
                creates an economic fault line between North and South on this
                island. Although Sinn Féin is opposed to the European monetary
                union in its current form, it does not want to see more
                obstacles to economic development and trade on the island. We
                must, therefore, ensure that the introduction of the euro does
                not cause yet another blockage to positive economic development
                on the island of Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The failure of the EU itself, as well as the
                Irish and British Governments, to consider the negative effects
                of the euro on trade in Ireland shows the lack of thought that
                has been put into the actual effects of introducing a single
                currency.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.00 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The economic effects of partition in border
                areas are greater than ever. Changing currency values leave
                communities on both sides of the border continually seeking the
                best means of increasing their spending power. Short-term gains
                for consumers on either side of the border are no recompense for
                the long-term damage inflicted on the border economy by this
                dual currency predicament. Therefore, the motion, as it stands,
                does not address the greater problem of economic sovereignty and
                the underlying economic problems.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The euro project is the centrepiece of a
                process of economic and political integration, in which more and
                more power is to be ceded, not only to centralised
                decision-making processes but to a range of unelected bodies.
                Participation in the euro has removed substantial economic
                decision-making powers from the Dublin Government. The ability
                to run deficits, borrow money and set exchange and interest
                rates is gone. The Twenty-six Counties are now victim to a
                &quot;one-size-fits-all&quot; policy formulated and managed not
                by any elected body but by the autonomous European Central Bank
                (ECB). Not one Irish official is among the senior management of
                that bank. Added to that is an ongoing campaign to end the right
                of the Dublin Government to set their own tax rates. That litany
                of failure should be nothing new to the people of the Six
                Counties or to our business community. For years, we have all
                been victim to the same &quot;one-size-fits-all&quot; policies
                of Westminster, which were formulated with little thought to the
                economic impact that decisions will have outside England.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A single EU currency, in its current format,
                is not of benefit to the island of Ireland economy. Until 1979,
                we had a single currency on the island of Ireland, and a
                connection with sterling. The Twenty-six Counties have merely
                substituted one unsatisfactory form of monetary union for
                another. We want to bring real power back to the people of the
                island of Ireland, not to be ceded to a new union. Go raibh

                contributions. If I had any doubt about the motion’s virtue,
                the terms on which it has been rejected by the DUP and Sinn

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My party fully supports the swift and early
                entry of the UK into the European monetary union. There is no
                doubt that the current self-exclusion policy of the UK
                Government brings uncertainty to businessmen and potential
                investors — whether domestic or external — and creates
                dislocations on this island and in the UK as a whole. It is time
                that action was taken to address that.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Member. His point is that
                self-exclusion dislocates business. How does he explain the fact
                that the UK gross domestic produce growth is higher than that of
                &quot;Euroland&quot;, and is projected to be higher again next
                year?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Ford:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those of us who witnessed what happened to
                the British economy during the Thatcher years of the 1980s have
                little difficulty in seeing the lower base from which the
                British economy is now recovering. It is certainly not an
                economy that is booming and forging ahead of Europe. Rather, it
                is one starting from a low base and that is still catching up
                with Europe. No doubt the better economic minds on the Ulster
                Unionist Benches, and in the Speaker’s Chair at present, will
                continue to deal with that debate for some months.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I interpret the resolution from Ms Morrice
                and Prof McWilliams as one looking towards some voluntary
                arrangements to deal with the inevitable currency difficulties.
                There is no doubt that the changeover to the euro, the
                expectations of developments in that direction and what Dr O’Hagan
                has described as the informal dual currency system pose problems
                for small business. There is no doubt that unless we do
                something to assist small businesses to deal with that, there
                will be economic difficulties for this region that will not
                apply elsewhere in the UK. It is therefore right that we should
                seek ways to deal with that problem and to assist small
                businesses to cope with the situation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs Courtney spoke about cross-border trade,
                as it affects commerce in the city of Derry. There are, of
                course, many small firms in border areas — and, increasingly,
                in other parts of Northern Ireland — that are having to adapt
                their work to deal with cross-border activity and the
                two-currency problems entailed in that. Dr Paisley correctly
                suggests that farmers are more concerned about getting a fair
                share for their production than the precise currency in which it
                is paid. However, surely even he would agree that it is a little
                bizarre to hear journalists discuss on the radio the ewe premium
                being set at 21 euros, when nobody knows whether, when it is
                actually paid, it will be 61p, 62p, 63p or 64p — or whatever
                — per euro. That is a fundamental issue, and I have heard
                farmers complain about their inability to predict the value of
                European grants. However, that, of course, is an argument to
                support all of the UK adopting the euro, rather than one
                specific region.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Changes are starting to occur, and the UK
                Government are clearly preparing for the referendum that will
                lead to the UK’s entry into the European monetary union. It
                is, therefore, right that the particular problems that we
                experience — in the only UK region that has a land frontier
                with the euro zone — should be addressed. Small businesses
                should be given the assistance that they require, whether it be
                from the Treasury or from the Department of Finance and
                Personnel.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Jane Morrice said that the UK Government
                had got us into this mess — they certainly have some
                obligation to assist the economic development of this region and
                to help us to get out of the mess. Looking back some years, we
                were in a situation where the punt and sterling were part of a
                common currency union but not of a customs union. Now we are
                part of a common customs union without being in a currency
                union. Perhaps we will achieve the full benefits that are
                necessary for our economic development, and that of the other
                part of the island, only when we are both in the same customs
                and currency union.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I may have some reservations about the
                precise way in which the motion is phrased, but the terms in
                which it has been outlined by the proposer make it worthy of
                support. There is no doubt in my mind that the euro represents
                the best way forward for this society, and the motion is a step
                towards recognising the transitional nature of the arrangements
                that will exist from 1 January 2002. I support the motion, and I
                ask the House to support the concept of practical measures to
                deal with the informal currency system that we are about to
                enter.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Beggs:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I oppose the motion, and I will speak about
                the wording of it rather than comment on what the proposer of
                the motion has said. We vote on the wording of the motion, and
                that is what we should be talking about. Government can
                legislate and make financial arrangements, but who will pay for
                their implementation? Who will pay for new cash registers and
                new accountancy software in our businesses? Will it be the
                taxpayer, or will it fall to our hard-pressed businesses just as
                we are entering difficult financial trading times?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The motion refers to the official recognition
                of the euro as a second currency. Euros will, of course, be
                traded in Northern Ireland in the same way as punts, francs and
                pesetas have been traded. That is already happening, so why is
                it being called for in the motion? Why have we stated the
                emotive date of 1 January 2002, when the euro will replace all
                those currencies in Europe? It is obvious that Ms Morrice is
                looking for much more than is currently happening, and I am
                taking a reasonable interpretation of the wording of the motion
                — as opposed to what the proposer has said.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The motion refers to there being a second
                currency alongside sterling. It refers to a second currency and
                not to all the other currencies in the world, such as the
                dollars, that can be traded. Surely it is therefore referring to
                a second currency that is to be used in our tills. That is a
                reasonable assumption. What the Member has said in the debate
                does not add up to what is written in her motion. My
                understanding is that if her motion were to be agreed, the
                measures would not be introduced on a voluntary basis.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Nowhere in the motion is it stated that that
                should happen on a voluntary basis. As I said earlier, this is
                happening automatically on a voluntary basis. Businesses that
                rely on trade in other parts of Europe or across the border —
                hoteliers, and so forth — are already making preparations. It
                is important that they provide convenient payment methods for
                their potential customers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The motion concerns compulsory dual currency,
                which would be the worst possible outcome for Northern Ireland.
                It would mean additional costs for Northern Ireland, the only
                place in Europe that would have dual currency. If the motion
                were to be adopted, additional costs would be imposed on our
                businesses that would not exist anywhere else in &quot;Euroland&quot;
                or in the United Kingdom. That would disadvantage businesses.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member also calls on central Government
                to provide additional funds to pay for preparations for dual
                currency. As my Colleague has stated, that would cost hundreds
                of millions of pounds. How high on the list of priorities for
                public expenditure in Northern Ireland is preparation for the
                euro? If additional funding were given from the Barnett formula
                because of euro preparation, would the choice be to spend
                millions of pounds converting tills and accountancy software?
                Surely it would be spent on health, education, public transport
                and the protection of children rather than on financing the
                Member’s single euro indulgence.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Banks, businesses, retailers and hoteliers
                are already making these preparations. It is right and proper
                that they should do so. The official recognition of a second
                currency would mean having two currencies in the tills. That is
                my interpretation, and I must reinforce that point. It would be
                an extremely expensive exercise for rural shopkeepers and for
                proprietors of corner shops in urban areas. How many tourists
                are expected in order to justify the additional financial burden
                in having dual currency and dual accounts? Firms could go out of
                business.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The euro is being presented as a solution to
                all our ills. However, the single European currency would hand
                over some economic control to Europe and would ultimately lead
                to the further development of a European superstate. To date,
                close co-operation has been beneficial to all the people of
                Europe. Now that Northern Ireland has devolution, the real
                danger is that, if a European superstate were to be promoted,
                more and more decision-making would be handed over to that
                superstate. We may also receive a flood of European Directives,
                as is already being experienced by Assembly Committees. There is
                no choice involved with European Directives; they must be
                approved. So much for devolution.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Who contributed to the decision-making on the
                preparation of these European Directives? The people of Northern
                Ireland have little involvement in that process. Decisions are
                made at a high level by representatives of the Governments of
                all the nation states in Europe. There is little consultation
                with the Northern Ireland Assembly on any of these Directives.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee of the Centre is currently
                conducting an investigation into interaction with the European
                Community. That may be an important area that is not being dealt
                with. A European superstate goes completely against the grain of
                devolution. More decision-making is being handed over to
                European central Governments above the heads of the people.
                There will be limited means of influencing decisions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The motion, as it stands, does not correspond
                with the mover’s words. I oppose additional costs on local
                businesses and increased central control by a European
                superstate, and I oppose the motion.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I remind Members to switch off mobile phones
                and pagers before coming into the Chamber.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr McDonnell:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome this all-too-brief opportunity to
                have a debate on the euro, although it is an oblique discussion.
                We are not talking about introducing the euro directly, although
                many of my colleagues have been talking about that. The euro
                will be legal tender from 1 January 2002. I reassure Esmond
                Birnie that he is not the only person who is confused. We are
                all struggling to discover what it will mean for us. It is
                timely that we should face the issue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Much of the discussion in the Chamber has
                been about the pros and cons of the euro. However, from the
                wording of the motion I do not think that that is the issue. We
                all accept that the euro will not be the official currency in
                Northern Ireland or Britain after 1 January. This is not about
                replacing sterling; it is about facing the reality that in 27
                days time the cash in people’s pockets and the currency in
                their bank accounts and chequebooks will change in most of
                Europe.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Punts will remain for approximately a month
                until the banks gather them in. After 9 February there will be
                no more French or Belgian francs, lire, guilders, pesetas,
                Deutschmarks, drachmas, or markka. There will still be Danish
                and Swedish kronor, as well as sterling. For most people the
                currencies that are disappearing represent 1% or 2% of their
                expenditure. When added together, about 10% of our financial
                expenditure could be handled in euros.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Most of us do not admit that we go across the
                border to buy fuel for our cars. Many local transport companies
                have re-registered vehicles in the South and buy their fuel
                there. Many of us spend the odd weekend in Dublin or elsewhere
                in Southern Ireland, in places such as Donegal, and many of us
                holiday abroad. The combined impact of this will be much greater
                than that of people from the South spending punts in the North.
                I estimate that it could be two or three times greater.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The greatest interest will be in tourism.
                Almost all of our tourist expenditure will be in euros. We will
                still have British visitors, and I hope that we will still have
                Canadian and American visitors, although the transatlantic trade
                is down. We may have some Swedish visitors, but they do not form
                a big section of our tourist market. I hope that we will have
                Southern Irish visitors, and a few French, Spanish, German,
                Italian, Dutch and Belgian visitors. I am not just talking about
                past visitors, I am talking about those whom we hope to bring
                here, and those for whom the Tourist Board and Tourism Ireland
                Limited are marketing. All of those people will have euros in
                their pockets.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have no doubt that many of our tourist
                businesses and entrepreneurs in other fields will accept euros.
                They will be accepted in the same way as the Irish pound has
                been exchangeable along the border and in many large stores in
                Belfast and in provincial towns. They will be accepted in the
                same way as sterling can be exchanged in Dublin, and the punt
                works in Newry, Derry and Belfast — on an unofficial and
                informal basis.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There will be many more euros to handle than
                there ever were punts. Any unwillingness, disinterest or lack of
                enthusiasm on the part of shops, bars or hotels to freely accept
                or tolerate the euro, will be seen by tourists as awkward,
                unfriendly and unwelcoming. It will give a less than subtle
                message that their business is not wanted, and they may decide
                not to come back.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am not making a case for or against the
                euro. On 1 January, we will still have sterling, but our
                dealings with external currency will change. How will we grapple
                with that? I have a small business interest, and the bank has
                already advised me to set up a euro account to deal with what
                are trivial bits and pieces of exchange. As I understand it,
                most small businesses are being advised along those lines. Up to
                20% of our financial transactions, whether they are for
                business, tourism or personal reasons, will be in euros. We will
                not need to spend vast amounts of money that are badly needed
                elsewhere, but we need to create and manage a euro tolerance.
                Otherwise, the clumsiness that might emerge will inflict damage
                on our credibility.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Despite the fact that we will remain a
                sterling zone, we need to encourage people to be familiar with
                the euro. When they get on a plane and go to any European
                country on holiday, the euro will be the currency. When I go
                abroad, it takes me about three days to become familiar with the
                currency. The challenge, and the motivation behind Ms Morrice’s
                motion, is to create a sensible connection between the two
                financial systems that makes sense of the exchange between them,
                so that our import and export business can move freely.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not wish to deal today with the strong
                case in favour of the euro. I know that those who are opposed
                have an equally strong case against it. I want to make a simple,
                rational, common-sense case for coexistence or cohabitation.</p>

                interface with France, Belgium and Holland. We must get to grips
                with that situation and make exchange easy for business.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am not surprised that the motion has been
                put down by the Women’s Coalition and supported vociferously
                by the Alliance Party. The motion calls for two currencies in
                Northern Ireland. As we have all witnessed in the last couple of
                weeks, when it comes to schizophrenia, both parties are very
                adept at behaving in that way. A couple of weeks ago, they
                wanted to belong to two communities. They wanted to be Unionist,
                and they wanted to be Nationalist. Now they want to have pounds,
                and they want to have euros.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is the worst of all worlds; that is the
                problem. If it were the best of both worlds, the DUP would
                support the motion. Let us consider the arguments. Members have
                been told that Northern Ireland cannot help but be affected by
                this issue because it shares a land boundary with a country of
                the euro zone. I am not very touched by that argument. It is not
                a new phenomenon that two countries that share a land boundary
                should have to deal with different currencies. That happened in
                Europe until this year.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Morrice:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There were not 300 million of them.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr S Wilson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Three hundred million people use dollars, and
                more of those people come here on holiday than those from
                Europe. We are not awash with dollars. Nevertheless, there is an
                argument that there must be a special arrangement in Northern
                Ireland because many people will be using euros and because we
                share a land boundary with the euro zone. If those special
                arrangements are not required between Canada and the United
                States or between France and Germany until this year, why should
                there be a special case for Northern Ireland after 1 January
                2002?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It has also been said that treating the euro
                as the second currency in Northern Ireland will be voluntary.
                However, Ms Morrice does not regard this as voluntary. In fact,
                its being voluntary would invalidate all her arguments. On one
                hand she says that it will be a disaster if businesses do not
                recognise the euro as a second currency; on the other hand she
                says that they can pick and choose whether they want it. She
                must make up her mind, although I know that that is difficult.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members were also told that it would help
                farmers. I have taught some economics students in my life; some
                of them were good, and others were poor. However, if I were
                marking an essay by Ms Morrice, I would not give it a pass
                grade. She says that if farmers were paid in euros, all their
                concerns about the effects of the exchange rate would cease.
                What does she think the farmers will do with the euros when they
                get them? They are not going to pay wages, electricity bills or
                feed bills with them. They will have to change them into
                sterling. Therefore, the argument that euros will do away with
                the exchange problems that farmers have been complaining about
                is false.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That takes me to the logical extension of her
                argument, which is, as my hon Friend Dr Paisley said, that the
                euro be introduced into Northern Ireland as the first step
                towards imposing a common currency on the United Kingdom.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Morrice said that the introduction of the
                euro would help tourism. An article from ‘Ulster Business’
                quotes a man who should know about tourism because he owns
                several hotels in Northern Ireland. Howard Hastings has said
                that we should say &quot;yes&quot; to Europe — as Dr Paisley
                said earlier — but &quot;no&quot; to the euro. That is the
                view of someone who works in tourism every day, who knows the
                effects and who has said that these arguments are not valid.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was also argued that the euro would make
                Northern Ireland’s trade with Europe easier. Dr Birnie pointed
                out that 80% of Northern Ireland’s international trade is
                outside the euro zone. Therefore, most businesses will still
                have to deal with exchange fluctuations. Some businesses have
                traded almost exclusively in dollars for many years, but they do
                not argue that Northern Ireland must join the Federal Reserve or
                introduce the dollar into Northern Ireland. Trading, as the
                currency exists, can be done; it is done every day.
                Nevertheless, Members are told that if they do not agree the
                motion, Northern Ireland will face economic disaster.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Of course, we should not worry about the
                cost; we can get it from the Treasury. That is the final
                argument — let us go to the Treasury, hold out our hands, and
                it will pay.</p>
                <i>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the Treasury were to give Northern Ireland
                another 200 million quid, I would want it to be spent on
                something more than slot machines and cash registers. Yet, it
                appears that this is the priority that the Women’s Coalition,
                the Alliance Party and, it seems, the SDLP share in the event of
                the extra money becoming available. Let me give an example. A
                newspaper recently published an article about a company which
                runs a few buses between Donegal and Northern Ireland. It
                reckoned that the changeover to the euro will cost it £40,000.
                That is for one small business. That will be multiplied across
                Northern Ireland, and the figures estimated are £200 million or
                £700 million — nobody is sure.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I can think of far better things to spend our
                money on, especially when all of the arguments that have been
                made are fallacious. The reason behind this is not that it will
                help the farmers and tourism, that it is realistic or that it
                will help our trade with the rest of Europe. The real reason is
                that those euro fanatics who are looking at the political
                landscape in the United Kingdom know that 80% of the population
                in the United Kingdom will not voluntarily vote to go into the
                euro zone. So what do you do? Esmond Birnie has described it;
                you introduce the currency by stealth, &quot;euro creep&quot;,
                as it is called — or &quot;euro creeps&quot;.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Northern Ireland is part of the United
                Kingdom, and I hope that it will be treated as such when it
                comes to a referendum count. I have no doubt that good sense
                will prevail in Northern Ireland as much as it will prevail in
                the rest of the United Kingdom and that the people here will
                oppose it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The fact of the matter is — and Esmond
                Birnie has mentioned it — that it is less and less likely that
                the five economic tests that Gordon Brown has set will be met.
                It is less and less likely that people in the United Kingdom
                will be persuaded to voluntarily accept the euro. We have seen
                the kind of interference that comes from Europe — it is now
                telling the Irish Republic how much tax it can levy. We are not
                members of the euro zone, yet it is telling Gordon Brown how
                much he can spend. Next week we will discuss the Budget. Under
                the proposals for a common currency, Brussels can determine our
                level of spending and taxation.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will finish now. That is why people will
                reject the introduction of the euro. That is why we have to have
                it sneaked in by the back door. That is the real motive behind
                the motion.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr M Robinson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On 1 January 1999, the euro was launched to
                great acclaim and much media frenzy. We were informed of the
                many benefits associated with the euro; how it would be a strong
                currency and would one day rival the mighty dollar.
                Unfortunately, this has not been the case.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For the first three years, the new currency
                has struggled in the markets, and its value has plummeted month
                after month. Advocates of a single currency feel that it makes
                sound business and economic sense, in that it will create lower
                interest rates and faster growth. However, interest rates are
                unique to each country. No one interest rate fits all; no one
                interest rate is right for both Belfast and Brussels.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is, therefore, obvious that countries that
                have signed up to the single currency will end up with interest
                rates that are either too high or too low. How could any country
                be sure that it is getting a fair deal in line with the needs of
                that particular country? One currency, one bank, one interest
                rate will inevitably lead to common taxation, one budget and one
                economic policy. As I have already mentioned, each country is
                very different economically, so how can a single budget, which
                will meet the needs of every country, be created?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There will obviously be winners and losers.
                If we look at the common agricultural policy and the common
                fisheries policy, it is blatantly obvious who the winners and
                losers were. As part of the common fisheries policy, the EU
                tightened the quota system against the United Kingdom. As a
                result, thousands of trawlermen have lost their jobs, and
                hundreds of vessels have been taken out of commission. Under the
                latest proposals, Britain is expected to cut her fishing fleet
                under the quota system by another 40%. The decimation of the
                fishing industry has caused problems of unemployment and
                recession in the fishing towns and villages across our Province.
                This is one all-too-obvious example of how community policy can
                damage not only jobs and employment, but the social and
                community fabric in affected areas.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does the Member agree that while the fishing
                industry in the United Kingdom has suffered because of job and
                boat losses, other European fleets have done better at the
                expense of the fish in UK waters?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr M Robinson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In agreeing with my Colleague, I would like
                to thank him for illuminating the point that I was making.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The assertion of governmental or imperial
                power has always rested upon the assertion of the rights to levy
                taxes, to spend money and to impose a portrait of the head of
                the king or queen upon the coin. The European Union is following
                a well-trodden path in wishing to issue and design its own
                coinage. The power to tax is fundamental in establishing
                governmental rights. It is difficult to see why we would even
                contemplate a common economic policy run by the very people who
                brought us the common fisheries policy and the common
                agricultural policy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In discussing the single currency, we cannot
                help but mention the fact that we would be moving towards the
                centralisation of federal power and, therefore, the creation of
                a single Government. How would it be possible to govern a single
                country called Europe, given the different languages, histories,
                cultures, identities, et cetera? Each and every country should
                be proud of its heritage and culture. Unfortunately, the
                introduction of a single currency is only going to further
                weaken our culture and our identity.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yes, Northern Ireland is unique in that it
                shares a land border with the Republic of Ireland, which as we
                all know has opted to introduce the euro. However, this should
                not pose any great difficulty, as we have managed for over 20
                years with two different currencies, since the Republic of
                Ireland introduced its own currency by replacing the pound with
                the punt.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is an absurd notion to have the two
                currencies working alongside one another. The cost of
                implementing this would be phenomenal. The costs of conversion
                are huge. Every computer, vending machine, slot machine,
                accounting system and bank telling machine would need to be
                changed. There are over 20,000 automated teller machines
                handling the existing type of paper currency note in the UK. All
                of these would have to be replaced to handle entirely different
                styles and shapes of notes. Also, 500,000 point-of-sale
                terminals in shops around the country would require either
                fundamental overhaul or replacement to handle any new currency.
                All accounting and cash settlement systems would need to be
                adjusted in order to deal in the redenominated currency, and in
                the period of transition these would need to shift from sterling
                to the euro and back again using the fixed conversion factor.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Around the European Union as a whole, there
                are 12 billion bank notes in circulation and another eight
                billion in store. All or most of these would need to be replaced
                with new ones. The complete coinage would require reminting into
                the new shapes and specifications of the euro. In the case of a
                small shopkeeper, the costs would be considerable. They would
                have to make facilities available for transactions in both
                sterling and euros. In practice, this would mean doubling up the
                number of tills in the shop to handle two separate sets of
                banknotes and coins. The total cost to business is estimated at
                more than £30 billion in total.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What return could they possibly earn on this?
                In effect, it would be all cost and no benefit. Who would end up
                footing this bill? Would the customer end up paying the price in
                more ways than one? We should be proud of the pound and all that
                it stands for. John Redwood MP said that if we join the euro,
                there is no point to general elections, as so many of the
                important decisions about our prosperity will be taken behind
                closed doors by unelected officials in some far away bank.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like to address several issues. The
                issue of cost was raised by Dr Birnie and by several Members
                from the DUP Benches. I would like to tease out that issue in
                order to understand it better. For example, let us suppose that
                we will have a referendum. Dr Paisley put this point well. What
                will happen if the people of the UK say, &quot;Yes&quot;? We
                will have to convert our currency into euros and have a
                transitional period. Who will pay for that? Surely the Treasury
                will not expect the people of Northern Ireland to foot the bill
                for that currency change? The Treasury will have to pay for the
                conversion.</p>

                that point in answer to Mr Sammy Wilson’s comments. Has his
                head been buried in the sand? Does he not visit Newry or any
                other border town? Does he not see that currency is crossing the

                single transferable speech.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is no question that the referendum on
                the UK’s membership of the single European currency will be
                the deciding factor on whether the UK enters it. The Women’s
                Coalition believes that the single European currency is
                important and valuable. However, the criteria and the timing
                must be right. We in the party are pragmatists. The motion
                offers a solution in the interim. I remind Members that support
                for the motion is not necessarily support for the euro, nor is
                it support for UK membership of the single currency. The motion
                seeks only to make provision for the unique situation in
                Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The euro is a reality. It will make its way
                north of the border whether we like it or not. Our farmers, our
                businesses and our industry need to know how to deal with it. By
                supporting the motion, the Assembly would send out a clear
                message to the people that it represents — Northern Ireland is
                open for business in euros and in pounds. Let the people decide.</p>
