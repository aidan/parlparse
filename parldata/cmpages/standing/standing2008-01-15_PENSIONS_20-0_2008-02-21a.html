said:</div>
					<a name="08022194000153"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We will
give the Information Commissioner the power to spot-check Departments,
to do everything in his power and our power to secure the protection of
data. In other words, we will do everything in our power to make sure
data are safe.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08022194000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">That was
the statement he made following the very shocking loss of information
from HMRC.</div>
					<a name="08022194000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">What this
new clause does is to set up a mechanism for ensuring that the
Information Commissioner has a role in protecting data. Over 6 million
people will be signing up for personal accounts. The pensions
authorities will therefore have a considerable number of personal
details about these people, and it is quite important that this
information is protected. The code 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column578" />Column number: 578</div>of practice that this clause sets up will enable a dialogue to take
place between the Secretary of State and the Information Commissioner
on what sort of changes in attitude the Information Commissioner wishes
to see from Departments like the DWP to ensure that data are
protected.</div>
					<a name="08022194000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">Perhaps I
should remind members what the House of Commons Justice Committee had
to say in its report earlier this year. They pointed out that the Data
Protection Act 1998 applies to private organisations and individuals
and they can be held criminally liable if data are lost. But it does
not currently apply to Government Departments. On 3 January, the
Information Commissioner, Sir Richard Thomas, said in response to this
that losing data should be a criminal offence. New clause 7 does not
introduce that: that presumably will come when the reviews by the
chairman of PricewaterhouseCoopers and the Information Commissioner,
set up by the Prime Minister, are
published.</div>
					<a name="08022194000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">What this
new clause does do&#151;and I think it is an important clause and the
sort of clause that should apply to all public bills which grant
Government Departments more access to private individuals&#146;
information&#151;is require the Department and other bodies it sets
up to think very clearly how that data should be handled. I think that
is a fair and reasonable
point.</div>
					<a name="08022194000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">To quote from
the Chairman of the Justice Committee, my right hon. Friend the Member
for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith), about the scale of the
problem at the
moment:</div>
					<a name="08022194000154"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
scale of the data loss by Government bodies and contractors is truly
shocking. But the evidence we have had points to further hidden
problems. It is frankly incredible, for example, that the measures
Revenue and Customs has put in place were not already standard
procedure.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08022194000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">This particular new clause has
a requirement that there is a set of standard procedures for handling
data loss relating to personal accounts before the pensions authorities
actually begin to collect that data. So we are saying very clearly at
the beginning that we regard this as vital and so important that we
have sought to include the clause in the Bill. I do not see why the
Minister cannot support that.</div>
					<a name="08022194000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that the review will
introduce criminal charges for Departments that lose data, but we are
proposing setting a standard and saying that, in future, when the DWP
is collecting data&#151;in this case about pensions&#151;there will
be clear guidance. People, including the Information Commissioner, will
be involved in setting out that guidance, and it will follow from the
review that there will be consequences if that personal data is not
adequately protected. By having a code of practice, following up the
review that the Prime Minister has commissioned and having legislation
that makes data loss a criminal offence for Departments, we can provide
people with a level of security for their personal data which they are
not getting at the moment, and to which I believe they are
entitled.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022194000188"></a>The
Minister for Pensions Reform (Mr. Mike
O'Brien):
						</b> I have no problem with the broad thrust of the
hon. Gentleman&#146;s proposal: that the Information Commissioner
should be able to cover this, and that the Freedom of Information Act
2000 and data protection 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column579" />Column number: 579</div>provisions will apply in the normal way. They already do. We do not need
this. That is the problem. The Government already have the necessary
provisions in place. Indeed, section 44 of the Bill strengthens the
sanctions for unlawful disclosure of personal data by staff of the
Pensions Regulator. These sanctions will extend to the delivery
authority in the event that it is required to handle personal data on
the regulator&#146;s behalf. Our view is that the measures in the
hon. Gentleman&#146;s amendment will generally replicate safeguards
already in place. The Information Commissioner already has powers to
oversee the data handling of all present and future data controllers
including the regulator, the scheme, and also the delivery authority if
it becomes responsible for any personal
data.</div>
					<a name="08022194000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under section 51
of the<b class="B"> </b>2000 Act, it is the duty of the Information Commissioner
to</div>
					<a name="08022194000033"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;promote the following
of good practice by data controllers and in particular so to perform
his functions under the Act as to promote the observance of the
requirements of this Act by data
controllers.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08022194000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
commissioner has a legal duty which involves promoting the use of codes
of practice for data protection, and is keen to be involved in further
developing and amending them. It is in fact the commissioner who will
do a lot of work to develop those
codes.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022194000189"></a>Paul
Rowen:
						</b> I was listening with interest to what the Minister
said. Is he aware of clause 71 of the Serious Crime Act 2007? It is
relevant because my new clause is modelled on it. In other words, in a
Bill that has just gone through the House, the Government have put in
place very clear and explicit arrangements&#151;in this case the code
of practice for disclosures of information to prevent fraud. The Home
Office has said very clearly that it will draw up a clear code of
practice in conjunction with the Information Commissioner. It is not
just relying on existing legislation, it is actually making a clear
statement. If that is Government policy in the Home Office, does the
Minister not accept that there is a very clear case for doing it here,
which is what our amendment seeks to
do?</div>
					<a name="08022194000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022194000190"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:
						</b> The problem is that in respect of the area we are
now covering&#151;the pensions legislation and the bodies it is
setting up&#151;the Pensions Regulator and the DWP already have
documents which are effective codes of practice. We work closely with
the Information Commissioner in ensuring that they give full coverage.
I say very clearly to the hon. Gentleman that we are satisfied, and the
advice I have been given is, that PADA, the Personal Accounts Board
that we are setting up, the Pensions Regulator and the Department are
already covered. We do not need the new clause. Further, we have
consulted the Information Commissioner; he has indicated that he is not
seeking a statutory code of practice on the matter in addition to what
he already has.</div>
					<a name="08022194000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
effect, the Liberal Democrats are offering something that is not only
covered by existing legislation but is not particularly wanted by the
Information Commissioner. On that basis, I hope that the hon. Gentleman
is duly reassured that what he is seeking to do is not in
dispute&#151;in the broad thrust at 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column580" />Column number: 580</div>least, although I might quarrel with some of the detail. The broad
thrust is not in dispute and is already covered. If the hon. Gentleman
looks at the detail, he will find that what he seeks is already,
generally, going to
happen.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022194000191"></a>Paul

that I am reassured, because the DWP&#146;s record in the area is
hardly
exemplary.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022194000192"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:
						</b> What record is the hon. Gentleman referring to?
HMRC is not part of the DWP, but of a different Department. I am not
sure what his &#147;record&#148; of the DWP specifically is. There
have been one or two issues, but they have not been on the scale that
he seems to be alluding
to.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022194000193"></a>Paul
Rowen:
						</b> The Minister is aware of the data found on the
roundabout in Torbay. I regard any loss of data, whether on 1 million
people or on 10, as a serious issue. My view is that, yes, there are
codes of practice across Government as a whole that are not operating
to the level of security that they should be. Accepting that, I am more
reassured by what the Information Commissioner said and I am sure that
when we get the Prime Minister&#146;s review we will have a further
opportunity to pursue the matter. Therefore, I beg to ask leave to

							<b class="B">Mr.
David S. Borrow</b> (South Ribble) (Lab): I beg to move, That
the clause be read a Second
time.</div>
					<a name="08022194000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause is a
modest one, which aims to deal with an anomaly in the Pension
Protection Fund legislation. The issue was first raised by my hon.
Friend the Member for Preston (Mr. Hendrick), who is my own
Member of Parliament, in a ten-minute Bill debate in the House on 17
October last year. He raised the issue of members whose pension schemes
have become insolvent and who are therefore reliant on the Pension
Protection Fund for their future pensions but who, because they are
under the age of 50, are barred by the rules from access to the funds
in that fund. A small group of individuals, under their schemes that
went insolvent, therefore necessitating the use of the Pension
Protection Fund, had a provision that would have sometimes allowed them
to have access to funds prior to the age of 50, particularly in those
instances where they were terminally ill.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column581" />Column number: 581</div>
					<a name="08022194000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">Generally the provision is for
individuals who are medically certificated as having less than six
months to live to have access to a lump sum. A similar provision exists
within the financial assistance scheme, which was set up for those
pension schemes that went insolvent prior to the Pension Protection
Fund being set up. However, the provision is not at the moment in place
for the Pension Protection Fund. A small number of individuals
unfortunately reliant on the fund will find themselves to be terminally
ill but unable to access any funds at all. Most final salary schemes
recognise that, in such circumstances, it is reasonable to make a lump
sum payment to help with the additional costs&#151;heating, lighting,
special food or diet and even that special family holiday that the
individual would want in the final months of
life.</div>
					<a name="08022194000160"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.15
pm</div>
					<a name="08022194000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">The provision
would enable the board of the Pension Protection Fund to make a payment
of two years&#146; worth of the pension that the individual would
have been entitled to had he or she retired at the normal retirement
age. It is a modest and not very expensive provision. It has been
difficult to work out the number of individuals who have claimed such a
provision within the financial assistance scheme because the numbers
are so small. The issue has been overlooked, and I hope that my hon.
and learned Friend will look favourably on the new
clause.</div>
					<a name="08022194000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022194000195"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:
						</b> I thank my hon. Friend for raising what is the
important issue of a small number of people who are terminally ill and
for whom the sort of financial security that might have been available
from their pension scheme is not available from the PPF. It was
raised&#151;as he said&#151;in a ten-minute Bill last October by
our hon. Friend the Member for Preston. There are strong arguments for
change and I welcome discussion of the
issue.</div>
					<a name="08022194000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">Since the
matter was first raised, my officials and I have been considering
whether it would be possible to ensure early access to some of an
individual&#146;s compensation entitlement should they fall
terminally ill before they reach normal retirement age or normal
pension age. We still need to address some issues before we can make
such a change to the PPF. We would need to ensure that changes that
increased liabilities for the PPF were sensible and affordable. It is
vital that the PPF maintain the confidence of other schemes that fund
it through the levies. Any increased costs would need to be justifiable
and not lead to disproportionate increases in the
levies.</div>
					<a name="08022194000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">We also need
to ensure that any changes do not place inappropriate burdens on the
PPF, for example by requiring it to make difficult decisions about
entitlements, which could lead to disputes or to a protracted
decision-making process. Currently, eligibility for PPF compensation
does not require the PPF to make those sorts of decisions and the
Government believe that it is important for the good running of the
fund that that should not
change.</div>
					<a name="08022194000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">I therefore
see merit in the proposals set out in new clause 17, because the test
for entitlement could be applied using existing mechanisms to quickly
and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column582" />Column number: 582</div>effectively make decisions on terminal illness; also because the small
number of people who might become terminally ill would receive a
significant sum&#151;an average of around &#163;10,000&#151;while
limiting the cost to the PPF, and therefore the impact on levy payers.
The scheme envisaged by the new clause therefore appears to have found
a suitable
balance.</div>
					<a name="08022194000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are,
however, some additional details that need to be considered, for
example the impact on possible future compensation paid to survivors. I
therefore welcome the opportunity to consider in more detail the
proposals in the new clause with a view, I hope, to returning to the
issue at a later stage of the Bill. At that point, I hope we will be in
a position to bring forward a clear clause that ensures that we are
able to deal with this lacuna, this gap in provision. I want to see
that gap filled in due course. I hope that we will have a more positive
response at a later
stage.</div>

							<a name="08022194000197"></a>Mr.
Waterson:
						</b> The new clause is another return to the
simplification, or deregulation, agenda. It is very limited in scope;
it is for a limited statutory override. One of the issues looked at by
Messrs. Lewin and Sweeney in their review was statutory override. The
amendment is sponsored by the National Association of Pension Funds,
and the background is the whole thrust of trying to limit or reduce the
costs and burdens on sponsoring employers of existing defined benefits
schemes. Those costs have gone up a lot in recent years. The latest
NAPF annual survey showed that the administration costs of an average
scheme have risen by over 50 per cent. in the last two years alone.
That is a staggering figure.</div>
					<a name="08022194000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">The NAPF welcomes the
Government&#146;s rolling deregulation programme&#151;rolling is
just about correct, although it is not very fast. It
says,</div>
					<a name="08022194000155"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;we believe the
Government could go further and accelerate the
process&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08022194000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is a
marvellous piece of understatement. One way in which that could be
done, would be to introduce a limited statutory override into the Bill.
I have already touched on the work of the external deregulation
reviewers. They identified a problem whereby some schemes are unable to
take advantage of Government simplification measures, due to the way in
which their own scheme rules are drafted. It is not the law itself 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column583" />Column number: 583</div>that stops them, it is their own scheme rules. The problem is about how
that can be changed.</div>
					<a name="08022194000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">Lewin and
Sweeney recommended that the Government should legislate to ensure that
employers and pension scheme trustees can override their scheme rules
in certain specific cases set down in the legislation. That would
include the right to make changes to the indexation requirements
introduced in the 2004 Act, and it should apply in other circumstances
such as the revaluation in clause 79.</div>
					<a name="08022194000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">As we near the end of the
Committee stage I may, for once, be pressing on an open door. The
Government have said that they agree with the measure in principle, but
they also believe that it should be possible to make such changes by
secondary legislation. The NAPF does not entirely agree with that
because of the complexity of the pensions set up at the moment. It
believes that we should send what it calls a &#147;strong signal of
support&#148; to those employers offering high-value occupational
pension schemes&#151;something that I entirely agree with. It
says,</div>
					<a name="08022194000156"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
amendment...seeks to put the matter beyond doubt and provide a
power&#151;in primary legislation&#151;which will enable the
Secretary of State to make regulations to extend the Pensions Act 2004
indexation changes and those set down in clause 79 of this Bill
regarding revaluation to all pension schemes.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08022194000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have two final points that
are important to put on the record.</div>
					<a name="08022194000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022194000198"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman will be aware that section 68
of the Pensions Act 1995 enables regulations of the sort that he
describes to be brought forward. In effect, the provision that would
enable us to bring forward the regulations is already there. If it were
the case that we intended to bring those regulations forward, that
prompts the question of what point the amendment would
serve.</div>
					<a name="08022194000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022194000199"></a>Mr.
Waterson:
						</b> The obvious riposte to that is
to ask the Minister why he has not brought forward regulations, draft
or otherwise. The NAPF accepts what the Government are saying in
principle, but it thinks that we should send a strong message to
industry and sponsoring employers that this is possible. I do not want
to get into this too deeply, but there are wider issues about sections
67 and 68 of the 1995 Act. The Department&#146;s view has been that
those sections do not bar pensions schemes from doing this, that or the
other. In fact, on the basis of legal advice, which as we all know is
rarely black or white, many employers have often felt that they are not
allowed by those sections to do certain things. We will return later to
those issues, particularly in relation to section 67. We still think
that it is worth proceeding with the new clause but if, when he comes
to speak substantively on this, the Minister can confirm that these
regulations are about to hit an unsuspecting world, I might take a more
charitable view on pressing the new clause.</div>
					<a name="08022194000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">Any decisions regarding changes
to scheme rules would still be subject to mutual agreement by the
employer and the scheme trustees and the changes would only affect
pension rights accrued in the future, not those earned in the past.
That is a chunk of consensus that is now accepted on all sides. It
emerges from Sweeney and Lewin that accrued rights should not be
tampered with. On that basis, I commend the new clause to the
Committee.</div>
				
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column584" />Column number: 584</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022194000200"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:
						</b> I am not sure that I entirely got the answer I
was seeking about why this particular new clause is necessary. I do not
think that there is any difference between my view and that of the hon.
Member for Eastbourne about the need to provide a statutory override.
We have already indicated, as a matter of policy, that we intend to
issue regulations for consultation later this year, which will enable
the override to be put in place. Given that we already have a statutory
capability to introduce those provisions, I do not detect from the hon.
Gentleman any convincing argument as to why we need to include it in
the Bill; I would be prepared to consider it if there was one. The
provision is there and we do intend to make this change; he is knocking
at an open door and it is important that the statutory override is put
in place.</div>
					<a name="08022194000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">This can be
quite a complex area, as the hon. Gentleman said, so I want to ensure
that when we publish the regulations we have time for the various
employers&#146; groups and others to look at the regulations and give
us their views. That is the better way forward. The new clause would
not prevent us from doing that, but it is unnecessary for that purpose.
I aim to have a consultation later this year to achieve what the hon.
Gentleman seeks. I hope that it will then be brought into effect by
Parliament, either this year or in the early part of next year, so the
change that he seeks is on its way, and not even at a slower pace than
that sought by the new clause. The reason we have not brought it
forward so far is that we have been working on the Bill&#151;there is
a limit to the availability of parliamentary draftsmen and officials to
do everything at once. I wish that such resources were unlimited, but
they are not. I will seek to bring forward the changes as quickly as is
reasonably possible.</div>
					<a name="08022194000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022194000201"></a>Mr.
Waterson:
						</b> I am delighted that the Minister thinks that he
has the powers to do this, and at some point might even use them. I
appreciate the point about limited availability of parliamentary
draftsmen, which is why we have tried to help him out by drafting the
relevant provision. I do not think that he has raised any technical
issues on that particularly. He has confirmed my worst fears that this
is indeed part of what is called a rolling deregulatory programme. We
would like to see it roll a bit faster, that is all that I am really
saying. Now it is all going to be swept up in the review. Another
review was announced in the Chamber today, I gather, so I think that we
are up to 57 reviews since the current Prime Minister took
over.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022194000202"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:
						</b> I assure the hon. Gentleman that we are not
reviewing the statutory override idea at all; we are merely going to
put it into regulations. The Lewin and Sweeney review has been
completed so there are no more reviews, it is just a matter of getting
the regulations out there, consulting on them to get them right, and
getting them
implemented.</div>

the Lewin and Sweeney exercise, but it seems like a wartime convoy
going at the speed of the slowest ship when there seems to be a lot of
consensus on what needs to be done. The Minister has the powers, and we
should get on and do it. Clearly, the door at which I am 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column585" />Column number: 585</div>pushing, and which is supposed to be open, is stuck. Until the odd-job

give my hon. Friend the Member for Eastbourne the odd rest during our
proceedings as he has borne the brunt of our efforts for a
while.</div>
					<a name="08022194000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 21
would ensure that there are provisions for the sharing of personal
accounts on divorce or the ending of a civil partnership. It has been
supported by the Equality and Human Rights Commission, and I am
grateful for the brief that it
provided.</div>
					<a name="08022194000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new
clause is simple. I am well aware of the concerns expressed by both
Ministers, and indeed by Tim Jones and Paul Myners of the Personal
Accounts Delivery Authority in the evidence sessions, that we need to
keep the administration of personal accounts simple. They do not want a
mass of transfers in and out, which I believe are barred until 2017. If
there is a criticism of new clause 21, it is probably that it is modest
in scope, too restrictive and would not help enough people because it
relates only to couples when they both have a personal account. The
issue is not easy, and we are not talking about new money coming into
the personal account scheme or money going outside in its
entirety.</div>
					<a name="08022194000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph
(b) allows transfers by mutual consent, which I hope the Minister has
noted. That is important because I learned from the Equality and Human
Rights Commission briefing that although pension sharing rules on
divorce were introduced in December 2000&#151;since they were
introduced there have, sadly, been more than 1 million petitions for
divorce&#151;figures from the Department for Constitutional Affairs
reveal that in the year to September 2007, less than 8 per cent. of
divorcing couples obtained pension-sharing orders. That tells me that
there is a real problem in this area, and that an asset, which in many
cases may be worth as much or perhaps more than the former matrimonial
home, is not being fairly shared. A wife may have contributed greatly
to a marriage over many years or may have taken time off to look after
children or a sick 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column586" />Column number: 586</div>relative, and it is absolutely right and important that she should enjoy
the proceeds of pension contributions to which she has a right, given
her part in the marriage over many years. This is an area that couples
often find contentious, and believe will be complicated, or perhaps
they are not even aware that it is possible to have a claim on a former
spouse&#146;s
pension.</div>
					<a name="08022194000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
the new clause commends itself to the Minister. I know that there is a
bar on transfers before 2017, but I repeat that we are not talking
about transfers out of or into the personal account scheme. We are
talking only about changing the fair sharing of pension pots within the
personal account scheme. I think that in 2017 it would probably be
necessary to go beyond the provisions in new clause 21 and perhaps look
at other cases. I hope that the Minister, perhaps when he replies, will
give the Committee an indication of whether the review of transfers in
and out, in 2017, will take into account that very important
aspect.</div>
					<a name="08022194000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that I
have set out where we are coming from in tabling new clause 21. I hope
that the Minister realises the seriousness of the matter, given that,
as I have just said, less than 8 per cent. of divorcing couples
currently obtain pension sharing orders. If he cannot accept the new
clause, as drafted, I hope very much that he will reassure us that the
Government are aware of the importance of the matter and intend to do
something about
it.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
John Greenway</b> (Ryedale) (Con): I think that my hon. Friend
is on to something with this new clause. I want to make a brief point
that he did not touch on in his otherwise excellent
r√(c)sum√(c) of the new clause. He has said that it will apply
only when a divorcing couple both hold personal accounts. One of the
attractions of the personal account scheme will be its low cost. On
Tuesday, in Committee, we discussed changes to provisions for pension
splitting on divorce and the prospect of further work to be done by the
Government. However, it is not clear whether someone could transfer
their money into a personal account. I see nothing in the Bill that
would allow for that.</div>
					<a name="08022194000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 100, which I have been
rereading along with its explanatory note, deals with the exclusion of,
rather than allowing, transfers. Such transfers would entail very
little cost. In fact, there would probably be no cost at all, other
than a charge that might be levied by the scheme for such a transfer.
Given that we are probably dealing with relatively low-income earners,
I find the prospect of the new clause particularly attractive. I am not
sure whether it needs to be included in the Bill, or whether a power to
deal with it in regulations is buried in the detail. However, on
principle, I support my hon. Friend&#146;s suggestion. I regret only
that I did not spot the new clause earlier and add my name to
it.</div>

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions
(Mr. James Plaskitt):
						</b> This is indeed an
important matter and I am grateful to the two hon. Members who have
just spoken on it. As I said, the new clause would replicate for
personal accounts the effect of provisions in the Welfare Reform and
Pensions Act 1999. Pension sharing was a flagship policy of the
Government&#146;s first pensions reform and the arrangements in the
1999 Act will apply to the personal accounts scheme, as they do to all
other occupational 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column587" />Column number: 587</div>pension schemes. Given that the Act provides already for pension sharing
for occupational schemes, we have not duplicated the provisions in the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="08022194000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">If a couple
divorces and the court makes a pension sharing order, the trustees of a
scheme will arrange for the former spouse or civil partner to be
awarded a pension credit, which will be a share of the member&#146;s
pension rights. The trustees will then discharge the pension credit
into a pension scheme in the former spouse&#146;s name, who will then
become a pension credit member of that
scheme.</div>

						</b> I am reassured by the way in which the Minister
started his remarks. For the sake of clarification, we heard a lot
during the evidence sessions about no transfers at all before 2017, but
is the Minister now saying that it will be possible in divorce cases to
move money in and out before
2017?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022194000208"></a>Mr.

						</b> We covered that in previous debates on divorce
and arrangements for it. The arrangement is that the pension credits,
as they are called, that come out of a divorce settlement and are
awarded by the courts can be transferred into such personal pension
schemes&#151;the point covered by the hon. Member for
Ryedale&#151;but there is a ban on them subsequently being
transferred
out.</div>
					<a name="08022194000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">Scheme rules
determine whether a scheme will accept the pension credit members.
Occupational pension schemes are not obliged to accept them, and very
few do. Some existing schemes do not accept them if the former spouse
has no connection with the sponsoring company. It is our intention that
personal accounts will accept the discharge of a pension credit into
personal accounts if that is what the former spouse wishes, provided
that the pension credit has come from the personal account or the
former spouse has a personal account in his or her own right as either
an active or deferred
member.</div>
					<a name="08022194000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">The former
spouse may have the pension credit discharged into another pension
arrangement, such as a personal pension, if that is what they prefer.
There is no compulsion to use personal accounts. The
Government&#146;s detailed intention to pension sharing in personal
accounts will be covered in the scheme order. I am grateful that the
new clause has provided the opportunity for me to explain our
intentions. I hope that I have offered assurances. Our proposals are
wider in scope than the new clause would allow, and I hope that the

rightly spent a lot of time dealing with accumulation and the measures
that people have to take to ensure that they have a pension worth

subsection (1)(b) because that measure is different from existing
legislation. It requires the customer to select an annuity from the

the opportunity to choose on the open market. In other words, we

single male with a five-year guarantee on a level income annuity. At
the age of 65, between the highest and lowest annuity available, there
was a difference of 10.45 per cent. For a joint annuity in respect of a
husband and wife, the spouse being three years younger, at the age of
65 the difference for level income is 18.89 per cent. and, escalating
at 3 per cent. per annum, it is 22.28 per cent. Those differences are

					<a name="08022194000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">Within the
companies on the FSA website, which are some of the most commercially
competitive and well-known in the country, such as Norwich Union, Legal
&amp; General, Canada Life, Friends Provident and Reliance Mutual,
there is a huge range of
differences.</div>
				
					<a name="08022194000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">With
impaired life annuities, which are typically available to someone with
an impaired life, such as because they are a smoker or have suffered a
heart attack, there can be up to a 40 per cent. difference between the
benefits under such a scheme and the ones they could get with an
enhanced annuity. Those are staggering figures. If hon. Members
consider the original Turner report, we have gone down this road to try
to get a low-cost saving model that could give people an enhanced
pension, which is laudable. However, if we do not do so, when we come
to the decumulation phase, we will more than encourage people to use
the open market&#151;we will make them use it. We will see all the
benefits from the savings that people have by going through the
personal accounts wiped away because they might be advised, perhaps by
the firm that they are working for, to go to a preferred annuity
provider that may not give the best rates. It is in everybody&#146;s
interests, not least the state&#146;s&#151;given that any shortage
of income may have to been met through enhanced benefits&#151;that we
encourage, nay require, retirees to get the best open market
option.</div>

							<a name="08022194000211"></a>Mr.
Greenway:
						</b> I am entirely at one with the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s objective, but I am slightly confused about why he
thinks that we need the new clause. I understand that the personal
accounts scheme would provide the same opportunities and entitlements
that apply to all other pension schemes, particularly personal pension
schemes, where the open market option already exists. However, we
should address how we can ensure that retirees are given that
information. Perhaps the Minister will consider including that in the
regulations to be made under clause
8(2).</div>
					<a name="08022194000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022194000212"></a>Paul
Rowen:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman is right. He knows a lot more
about this than I do. We want to ensure that retirees get that
information and go down that route. However, we tabled the new clause
because we want that information to be required to be made available
under the Bill, rather than saying that it should be made available.
That is a matter of semantics, but it is important. For example, it is
estimated that in 2007 those buying an annuity lost &#163;1.25
billion of pension and benefit by not accessing enhanced annuity rates.
At the moment there is insufficient information available for people
purchasing annuities and some relevant issues are not being addressed.
In due course, an additional 6 million to 10 million people will have a
personal account and will want to cash it in for an annuity, and it is
important that they go for the open market
option.</div>
					<a name="08022194000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will be
interested to hear how the Minister intends to ensure that that option
is made available. As the hon. Member for Ryedale knows, we have
laboured the point about information and advice quite a lot, because
the success of the personal accounts is predicated on the quality of
the advice that is available. By including the new clause in the Bill,
we would be requiring the  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column590" />Column number: 590</div>open market option to be used, because it has the benefit of forcing
people to go down that route, otherwise they may take the easy option.
We know what happens when people are visited in their homes by people
trying to get them to change their electricity or gas supplier: they
use the information that they are given because that is all they have
in front of them. The benefit of the new clause is that it says that
the open market option, with all the options available, is the route
that has to be chosen. I would be very interested to hear how the
Minister intends to ensure that that sort of benefit is taken advantage
of, if not by that
route.</div>
					<a name="08022194000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022194000213"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:
						</b> I am grateful to the hon. Member for Rochdale
for tabling the new clause. I am tempted to reply by referring him to
the hon. Member for Ryedale, who has almost dealt with the matter
already. Nevertheless, I have a few other things to add and some
reassurances to give, which I hope will address the thrust of the
argument made by the hon. Member for Rochdale and encourage him to
withdraw the new clause, which, as I will try to explain, is
unnecessary.</div>
					<a name="08022194000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 22, as the hon. Gentleman said, would require all qualifying
pension schemes, including personal accounts, not only to offer, but to
require, their members to exercise the open market option. As he
rightly said, choosing annuities is one of the most important financial
decisions that a pension scheme member makes. It is a one-off decision
that can have a big effect on the value of income in retirement. For
this reason, the Government fully support the open market option, which
allows individuals to shop around to get the best annuity deals that
they can under the circumstances, rather than simply taking the annuity
offered by the provider. By shopping around, people can certainly make
a very big difference to the value of their pot&#151;as much as 30
per cent, we
believe.</div>
					<a name="08022194000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, new
clause 22 is not required to ensure that members of personal accounts,
or any other qualifying scheme, can benefit from the open market
option. Under the Finance Act 2004, all tax-registered money purchase
pension schemes that provide benefits through the purchase of an
annuity must offer the open market option, or they would face tax
charges. As clause 14 requires all qualifying schemes to be tax
registered, that requirement, in effect, already applies to all money
purchase schemes into which employees can be automatically enrolled,
including personal
accounts.</div>
					<a name="08022194000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">As hon.
Members will be aware, the Government, working with stakeholders, have
recently conducted a review of the operation of the open market option.
That review reported in 2007 and set out a number of measures to help
and encourage more individuals to use it. We do not believe that it
would be right at this stage to go beyond that and to force members of
money purchase schemes to use the open market. Apart from anything
else, such an approach could add to costs and complexity, for example
if schemes had to check that the member had shopped around to avoid tax
charges.</div>
					<a name="08022194000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">We do not
believe that the Bill should create a separate set of rules just for
personal accounts. Additionally, we have said that within the
existing  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column591" />Column number: 591</div>framework, the detailed design of the process will be a matter for the
delivery authority, based on the conclusions of the review of the open
market.</div>
					<a name="08022194000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">Regarding the
point of information that was raised by the hon. Member for Ryedale,
existing legislation already requires occupational pension schemes to
provide a wide range of information to members. The relevant parts of
the legislation will apply to personal accounts in the same way as to
any other pension
scheme.</div>
					<a name="08022194000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022194000214"></a>Mr.
Greenway:
						</b> I must confess that I had not thought about this
point before. Could the Minister clarify how he thinks the personal
accounts scheme will be structured? If someone is in a group personal
pension scheme operated by a major insurance company pension provider,
and the default position is that that pension provider will convert the
cash in the fund to an annuity at their rates unless the person
exercises the option to purchase an annuity somewhere else on the open
market, is it the intention that the scheme will itself provide a
default pension, or will people simply take the money and buy the best
priced pension they can find? I think that the Minister takes my point
that there is quite a subtle difference between the
two.</div>
					<a name="08022194000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022194000215"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman is right to stress that. The
important thing is to ensure that individuals reaching this point are
aware of the need to shop around for their annuities and that they have
the right information to do so. As I said in response to the hon.
Member for Rochdale, we are making changes, which were reported in
2007, to the way the OMO
works.</div>
					<a name="08022194000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Pensions
Advisory Service is setting up a web-based, structured choice tool to
guide people. We are working with stakeholders to facilitate the
development of better focused information for customers about their
annuity options. The issue will also be for the Personal Accounts
Delivery Authority, which will be responsible for the detailed design
of how members can access their pension savings. That will include
consideration of the information that members will need when making
that important
choice.</div>
					<a name="08022194000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that I
have reassured the Committee about the Government&#146;s commitment
to the open market option and that the personal accounts scheme, along
with other qualifying money purchase schemes, will be required to offer
that to their members. The appropriate support for information will be
in place, and I hope that the hon. Member for Rochdale will withdraw
the
motion.</div>

Assistance Scheme to cover certain pension

					<div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;The Financial
Assistance Scheme shall cover those pension schemes which have
registered with the Department for Work and Pensions by 1st January
2008 and which would have been entititled to assistance by either the

detain the Committee for more than a minute or two, especially as you
have been kind enough to exercise your discretion in calling my new
clause, Sir Nicholas, for which I am most
grateful.</div>
					<a name="08022194000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a
small group of schemes, which my hon. and learned Friend the Minister
mentioned on Tuesday, that fall between the financial assistance scheme
and the PPF. Those schemes, such as that of Desmond and Sons, are ones
where the employer went insolvent before April 2005, meaning that the
PPF does not apply, but where winding up, for whatever reason, was
delayed until after April 2005, meaning that the schemes fall outside
the criteria for FAS assistance. A technicality has caused the
problem&#151;I think that I am safe in assuming that it was not the
Government&#146;s intention to exclude such schemes when the FAS was
set up. They are occupational schemes, just like others caught within
the FAS. The only difference is the date of winding
up.</div>
					<a name="08022194000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">Without detaining
the Committee much further, it is fair to say that such circumstances
would not have been foreseen at the time. It was not reasonable to have
expected pension schemes to wind up later than the employer&#146;s
insolvency, yet we know that such schemes exist. Pensioners are not
getting either the pension for which they paid into the
scheme&#151;the pension they expected to get&#151;or any help,
which is a massive problem for the pensioners involved. A small number
of schemes are affected, and I understand that they have a mainly small
numbers of members, so I presume that the cost of putting this right
will be equally small. However, it is an extremely vital issue for
those people concerned with, or caught up in, such a
situation.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022194000219"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:
						</b> The FAS was designed to help
underfunded occupational pension schemes that started winding up
between 1 January 1997 and 5 April 2005. The Pension Protection Fund
was designed to help occupational pension schemes that were left
underfunded when their employer went insolvent from 6 April 2005
onwards. The new clause refers to a small group of schemes that fall
between the FAS and the PPF, where the employer went into insolvency
before 6 April 2005, but, for many reasons, the pension scheme,
although underfunded, did not start winding up until after that
date.</div>
					<a name="08022194000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">A small number
of schemes are affected. We know of three at the moment: Desmond and
Sons, which is based primarily in Northern Ireland but also in the UK;
Stanley Press Equipment; and Pinney&#146;s. If we are to deal with
the issue, it would be useful to know 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column593" />Column number: 593</div>whether any other schemes are affected. It is an anomaly that those
schemes are not covered and I want to look at that in more
detail.</div>

find a way to assist them. I cannot give a guarantee at this point, but
I encourage my hon. Friend and his colleagues who have been pressing me

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022194000222"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:
						</b> On a point of order, Sir Nicholas. We seem to
have moved ahead at full steam and I had not thought that I would not
be here for this part of our proceedings. However, everything has
progressed faster than any of us perhaps expected, so I am here, and I
am pleased that I
am.</div>
					<a name="08022194000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">Members of the
Committee are grateful to you, Sir Nicholas, and to your colleague,
Mrs. Anderson, for your firm and fair steering of the
Committee over the past three weeks. It has been a pleasure to serve as
a member of a Committee chaired by you both. I would also like to
extend warm thanks to all members of the Committee, especially my hon.
Friends, but also Opposition Members, especially the hon. Members for
Eastbourne, for South-West Bedfordshire, for Rochdale and for
Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey, all of whom have made
Front-Bench contributions. I particularly pay tribute to the hon.
Member for Ryedale, who, along with the hon. Member for Bromsgrove, has
made significant contributions with his knowledge and
skill.</div>
					<a name="08022194000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">I thank my
colleagues for their help. Pensions matters can get tedious, but I am
sure that they have got through a lot of correspondence and that their
constituents are well informed as a result. The debate has dealt with
some important issues that will affect many millions of people. It is
important that we deal with this in as consensual a way as possible and
that we bring together
stakeholders.</div>
					<a name="08022194000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was
particularly pleased that we were able to have the oral evidence
sessions at the beginning of our consideration of the Bill. A number of
organisations were able to come forward: the ABI, Age Concern, the ACA,
the BCC, the CBI, the EEF, and lots of other initials. The Equality and
Human Rights Commission, the Federation of Small Businesses, Help the
Aged, Which?, the TUC, the Pensions Policy Institute and others were
all able to inform our debate. The result has been that the quality of
the debate from both sides has been particularly good. The information
that we received from the three pensions commissioners who gave
evidence was invaluable, as was the help that we received from Paul
Myners and Tim Jones from the Personal Accounts Delivery Authority. I
thank them all for their contributions.</div>
					<a name="08022194000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">I thank the Under-Secretary of
State for Work and Pensions, my hon. Friend the Member for Warwick and
Leamington, for his contributions, and I extend a particular word of
thanks to my Parliamentary Private Secretary, my hon. Friend the Member
for Coventry, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column597" />Column number: 597</div>South, and also to our Whip, who has made a very welcome contribution at
various stages of our proceedings. I also wish to extend my grateful
thanks to the officials in my Department who have briefed me, the
parliamentary counsel who drafted the Bill with expertise, the police
and other officials, <i class="I">Hansard</i> and the Clerk of the Committee, all
of whom have ensured that we were able to carry through an important
Bill with a great deal of proper consideration and detailed
understanding by members of the Committee. Our proceedings have taken
place in a spirit of goodwill, good humour and consideration. I hope
that we can look forward to the rest of the Bill&#146;s progress
through the House and the other place being conducted in a similar
way.</div>
					<a name="08022194000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022194000223"></a>Mr.
Waterson:
						</b> Further to that point of order, Sir Nicholas.
May I add my thanks to those of the Minister to your
and your fellow chairman&#151;I hope that you will pass those thanks
on to Mrs Anderson&#151;and to all the officials, the <i class="I">Hansard</i>
writers, the Clerks, the police and all the other staff who have made
this such a smooth running Committee? I would like to thank the
Ministers for their unfailing courtesy and their amazing ability to
keep a straight face while advancing the most preposterous
arguments&#151;it was quite an achievement, but they have both had a
lot of practice.</div>

						</b> Order. I am not sure that there can be an

order.</div>
					<a name="08022194000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022194000226"></a>Mr.
Waterson:
						</b> I would like to thank the Labour members of the
Committee, particularly the Whip&#151;the velvet fist inside the
velvet glove. The hon. Member for Caerphilly has been the big cheese,
as it were, of the Committee. He kept us all running to time, or
slightly ahead of time, in
fact.</div>
					<a name="08022194000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">I usually try to
enliven these events by trawling through hon. Members&#146;
biographies that are on the internet, but this time there have been
fairly slim pickings. However, I was taken aback by the unconscious
irony of the hon. Member for Brent, South, who sadly is not here. Her
biography says:</div>
					<a name="08022194000158"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;From an early age I
knew that as a woman in a male dominated society you have to be active
and assertive, or else you won&#146;t be heard. I am part of a
generation who grew up in the Thatcher years and didn&#146;t like
it.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08022194000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a bizarre
contradiction there. Obviously she thought that the Thatcher years were
those of a male-dominated society.</div>
					<a name="08022194000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Liberal Democrats, as
always, have enlivened our debates. I referred before to the fact that
the constituency of the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and
Strathspey includes part of Loch Ness. It is rather reminiscent of
Liberal Democrat pensions policy: sometimes through the mist we thought
that we perceived a shape, but then we rubbed our eyes and saw that
there was nothing there at all.</div>
					<a name="08022194000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">I thank my colleagues on the
Committee. To match the efforts of the Government
Whip, we have had to have two different Whips: my hon. Friends the
Members 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column598" />Column number: 598</div>for Peterborough (Mr. Jackson) and for Rochford and Southend,
East, both of whom served the Committee admirably and well. I pay
particular tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for South-West
Bedfordshire, who has worked extremely hard on a large part of the
Bill. He brought his own expertise to discussions about the Territorial
Army, among other things, and his personal commitments and beliefs to
some of the other issues,
too.</div>
					<a name="08022194000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am also
grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Ryedale, who has brought
enormous experience and expertise to the Committee. In fact, sometimes
I thought that he was doing a better job than Ministers in responding
to some points. I also thank my hon. Friend the Member for Bromsgrove,
who talked passionately about the pensions victims in her own
constituency. I know that she has followed these issues closely for
some time.</div>
					<a name="08022194000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">I entirely
agree with the Minister about the benefits of oral evidence. There
might be Bills on which that might not be so helpful, but in this case
it put into context a lot of the discussions that we were to have.
There were times when we had a big array of witnesses and they were
almost all very helpful indeed. However, for those involved in
pensions, life is one long seminar and I see the Committee as just
another stage in that process. Of course, there is another seminar in a
week or two, which has been organised by the indefatigable Pensions
Policy Institute, to talk about means-testing and so on, so life goes
on. Really, this is all part of the same process for people in the
pensions world.</div>
					<a name="08022194000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
regret that some of our more sensible ideas were not embraced by the
Government, but as I have said before, we have pencilled them in for
the pensions Bill that will be introduced under the next Conservative
Government in a year or two. I thank you, Sir Nicholas, for your
unfailing courtesy and helpfulness in allowing this Committee stage to
go so well. We look forward to the next pensions
Bill.</div>
					<a name="08022194000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022194000227"></a>Paul
Rowen:
						</b> Further to that point of order, Sir Nicholas. May I
also thank you and your co-Chair for the efficient and courteous way in
which you have conducted proceedings? This has been my first pensions
Bill, although I know that many hon. Members here have been through
several and survived. We all are indebted to the Clerks, who assisted
us in ensuring that our amendments made it on to the amendment paper. I
am also grateful to members of <i class="I">Hansard</i> and the police, who have
helped to make our proceedings go well.</div>
					<a name="08022194000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would also like to thank the
two Ministers. We have had a continuous dialogue throughout the
Committee and have regularly had copies of letters that the Ministers
have sent on issues that we have raised, so I thank them for that. I
genuinely feel that we have had a proper dialogue in which they have
agreed to change and look at various things. That demonstrates the best
aspects of the Committee system, when everything is not a closed book
and is open to debate.</div>
					<a name="08022194000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again, I support what has been
said about the involvement of outside bodies in the oral evidence
sessions, which informed the debate considerably. I have particularly
enjoyed listening to the hon. Member for Ryedale, who obviously knows a
great deal more 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column599" />Column number: 599</div>about pensions than I do. I thank the Government Whip and Labour and
Conservative Members for the pleasant way in which we have gone about
the proceedings.</div>
					<a name="08022194000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022194000228"></a>Mr.
Greenway:
						</b> Further to that point of order, Sir Nicholas. I
endorse everything that has been said and I am grateful for the
comments that have been made about my contributions. However, there is
one serious point that I want you to take from the Committee, given
your membership of other Committees. I must confess that I found the
evidence session, which preceded our normal scrutiny of the Bill, an
extremely enlightening and constructive experiment. I have thought back
to the first time that I was in Committee Room 10 in the autumn of 1987
when we were sitting on the other side of the room and not allowed to
say anything. The yah-boo-sucks politics that took place in Standing
Committees in those days was unconstructive, unhelpful and did not
improve the quality of legislation. One of the reasons why this
Committee has been so constructive and has ended up with better
arguments is that so many issues were brought out in public during the
evidence
sessions.</div>
					<a name="08022194000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">From an
Opposition point of view, in wanting to give the Government a run for
their money, a lot of the foxes that we might have run with were shot
by some of the evidence that we received. However, given that the
collective objective of these occasions is to end up with better
legislation, I would urge you, Sir Nicholas, to ensure that when
decisions are taken in this place, the voice of reason calling for more
oral evidence sessions at the start of Public Bill Committees should be
heeded with real vigour. I know that you will share my view and that we
can leave it in your capable hands to make sure that point is duly
registered.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022194000229"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:
						</b> Further to that point of order, if you will
permit me, Sir Nicholas. I do not want to delay the Committee, but you
ought to be aware of a minor incident that occurred during the course
of these proceedings yet might have escaped your notice. At one stage,
the hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire put forward a very
constructive point to which my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary
responded by reading the wrong note and setting out an answer to a
point that was not raised&#151;he did so with great eloquence.
Interestingly, the hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire said in
response that he was greatly 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column600" />Column number: 600</div>reassured. I can therefore say that the spirit of co-operation and
constructive engagement during the course of this Committee has been
unlike anything that I have ever experienced. Our proceedings have been
very good humoured and I am grateful for
that.</div>
					<a name="08022194000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022194000230"></a>The
Chairman:
						</b> The Chairman of a Committee always gets the last
word.</div>
					<a name="08022194000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">May I thank
members of the Committee for their generous comments about myself and
my co-Chairman, Janet Anderson, which I shall pass on to her? I am sure
she will be as happy as me to have received such generous
comments.</div>
					<a name="08022194000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
congratulate the Committee on the work that it has done during the past
month. It has been a great pleasure to chair this Committee, and I
would like to thank all members of the Committee, particularly the
Front-Bench Members&#151;that includes the Liberal Democrats, of
course&#151;and those with special knowledge. For example, the hon.
Member for Ryedale has added very considerably to the knowledge of the
Committee, which, ultimately, has been to the benefit of the
legislation that we have been considering line by line. The hon. Member
for Bromsgrove and even the hon. Members for Stoke-on-Trent, South and
for South Ribble have put forward proposals succinctly that have added
to the tenor and constructive nature of the
debate.</div>
					<a name="08022194000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">I thank my
Clerk, and those who have sat in when he has not been here, for their
support and advice. I also thank the <i class="I">Official Report</i> and the
police: clearly they have added to the way this particular Public Bill
Committee has gone so
smoothly.</div>
					<a name="08022194000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think that
this Committee has been an example to the people of this country of how
Parliament actually can, in the right situation, do the job that it is
here to do. We have considered a very important piece of legislation
line by line. It has been done constructively. The usual channels have
worked together and&#151;uniquely one might say&#151;the programme
order has proved to be adequate, although, sadly, on many other
occasions such orders are not. I believe that this Committee and the
way the Government and the Opposition have worked together are examples
that I hope will be understood and taken to heart by the House. I
congratulate all Members on the contributions that they have
made.</div>
