Amendment proposed [this day]: No. 8, in page 9, leave out lines 14 to 21 and insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(5) No regulation under this section shall come into force until it has been published by a notice sent by post to all persons to whom (to the best of the Commissioners' knowledge) section 8H might apply.' [Mr. Heathcoat-Amory.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<H5>4.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Question again proposed, That the amendment be made.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that with this we are taking amendment No. 9, in page 9, line 23, leave out from `under' to end of line 25 and insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`regulations made under section 8C above.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am minded to put the question on clause stand part at the end of the debate on the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Richard Ottaway </B>(Croydon, South): On a point of order, Dr. Clark. A point of order was raised this morning, in response to which the Financial Secretary agreed to write to members of the Committee about the 3.41 per cent. increase in relation to the retail prices index. He said in response to my hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin) that it was based on market expectations. One of the problems of having a 9 o'clock start to our proceedings on Thursdays is that we do have not have a full opportunity to digest the world's financial press. I had missed the headline of today's Financial Times, which stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Pound's fall cheers industry.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It probably cheers the Government, too. The article stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The pound fell sharply against the dollar and the euro yesterday as the expectation—
<P>
</UL></FONT>an important word—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>spread that UK interest rates are near their peak.
<P>
</UL></FONT>If the Minister were right that the forecast is based on market expectations rather than on what the Treasury expects the RPI to be, he may wish to revise his letter to take it into account that expectations have peaked and that, in all certainty, the figure of 3.41 per cent. is wrong.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Mr. Ottaway, your point of order has been heard by the Minister, and it is for the Minister rather than the Chair to respond to it. I have little doubt that he will do so in a moment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael Jack </B>(Fylde): On a point of order, Dr. Clark. This morning, Mr. Cook was generous in his anticipation of points of order to say that members of the Committee could remove their jackets if they so wished, but he was courteous in inviting the Committee to inquire of yourself what your ruling would be on the same subject. I seek your guidance.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Mr. Jack, you will recall that, when I chaired the Committee on Tuesday, I invited gentlemen to remove their jackets. I do so again this afternoon, if that is their wish.
<P>
<B>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Stephen Timms)</B> I am particularly grateful to you, Dr. Clark, for that final comment. I welcome you back to the Chair. I cannot help but notice that your return is accompanied by the sun coming out.<P>
<P>
At the end of our previous sitting, I was responding to the intervention by the hon. Member for Guildford (Mr. St. Aubyn) about the implications for small retailers of the notice power. I was saying that the law provides for the content, the position and the colour of the mark to be set by regulation or notice. Any changes to the specification of the mark would affect initially only a handful of manufacturers and importers.
<P>
It would become a matter for retailers if it were decided to end the currency of the old mark, which the hon. Gentleman was anticipating. Given the way in which the Bill is drafted, that can be achieved only by regulation. We would have to return to the list in new section 8C(2)(e) to end the currency of the old mark. As the hon. Gentleman will recognise, it is not among those items in new section 8C(3)(a) to (d), which, we propose, should be susceptible to change by notice.
<P>
I shall now deal with amendment No. 9. I share the Committee's desire to ensure that those who might be affected by the new offence of suffering premises to be used for the sale of unmarked tobacco are aware of their obligations. After all, one of the key benefits of the new offence is its deterrent value. Clearly, if it is to be an effective deterrent, people need to know that the offence exists. Customs is already planning a publicity strategy to ensure that everyone who—to the best of their knowledge—might be affected by the offence has reasonable warning of its introduction.
<P>
As part of the strategy, every registered business in the country will receive a written notice about the change, which will be included with every VAT return. Articles will appear in the trade press, and letters sent to trade associations. That is a more reasonable and less costly approach than a mailshot, which could include hundreds of thousands of people. Indeed, the mechanics of drawing up a list of every conceivable business that might be affected would be difficult. There are 100,000 retail tobacco outlets in this country, including pubs, clubs and garages, and other businesses might also be affected. To be convicted of the offence, it would be necessary to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a person had actual or constructive knowledge that illicit tobacco was being sold on the premises. It would be necessary to pass over that hurdle before a conviction could be obtained.
<P>
<B>Mr. Oliver Letwin </B>(West Dorset): Did the Financial Secretary use the expression ``constructive knowledge''? If so, what does it mean?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> That point that I made was that it would have to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt that a person had actual or constructive knowledge that illicit tobacco was being sold on the premises. The person would have to know that the tobacco being sold was illicit, and should not be sold. If the person knew that, and was doing it, he could be convicted.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I entirely understand the Financial Secretary's point. Opposition Members would not quarrel with the proposition that people should be convicted if they know that they are committing an offence. However, if they know what they are doing, they would presumably have knowledge of it. Why would the knowledge need to be constructive?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The word ``constructive'' came to mind because managers of premises such as pubs or factories might turn a blind eye to hawkers and people selling illicit products or making illicit tobacco available for sale under the counter. That is the reason for the language that I used.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> This point may become important later in the courts under Pepper v. Hart. Does the word ``constructive'' mean that the person ought to have known?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> No; it means that the person had actual or constructive knowledge, not that he ought to have had it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Tyrie </B>(Chichester): The problem is with the word ``constructive''. If that word were deleted from the record, would it make any difference to what the Financial Secretary is trying to convey to the Committee? Does the word ``constructive'' add anything?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> As you would expect, Dr. Clark, I chose my words with care. My use of the term ``constructive'' did indeed add to my point, as, indeed, do all the words that I have used. The term ``constructive knowledge'' has a proper meaning in case law precedent—turning a blind eye or being grossly negligent.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> This is obviously not a political matter, but it is important. The Financial Secretary explained the matter as I would have expected him to—namely, that a person is considered to have had constructive knowledge of something happening if as a reasonable man he should have known about it, as in the case of a pub owner who should have known what was happening because he was on site.
<P>
The Financial Secretary seems to be saying that the courts will be able to judge whether a person who did not know about an incident should have. If it is judged that he should have known had he been a reasonable man, he could be put in prison.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> If a person deliberately turned a blind eye to something that was happening or had been grossly negligent in not being aware that it was happening, the courts would have that power.
<P>
The amendments would not improve the existing provisions for pack marks, and would limit the ability of commissioners to react to changing circumstances. Amendment No. 8, in particular, might jeopardise the use of a valuable aid for Customs and Excise that will add to its armoury against smuggling. I hope that Opposition Members will not present themselves as the smuggler's friend by pressing the amendments to a Division.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory </B>(Wells): I am grateful to the Financial Secretary for attempting to give us some reassurances about the amendments and explaining the background to how regulations will be made. However, he has not met our case. He explained that the changes to be made by notice rather than by regulations to be laid before Parliament will be comparatively minor. However, breaches of the resulting rules will still incur a disciplinary sanction. It is therefore important for those who face the possibility of being disciplined to know about the offences and the requirements on the content and type of mark with which they must comply.
<P>
It is obviously for the convenience of Customs and Excise to be able to make such changes speedily. However, we do not legislate for the convenience of revenue authorities. Opposition Members feel that it is a good discipline for Customs and Excise to have to ensure that regulations are correct by consulting properly in advance, so that such changes are kept to a minimum.
<P>
In addition, any necessary changes can be made quickly by laying appropriate regulations. It is not necessary to return to the House and make changes to primary legislation through a Finance Bill, which would, I agree, be unnecessarily clumsy and might delay matters. However, it is a reasonable discipline to place on Customs and Excise that, if it has made a mistake or wants to make changes to stop an emerging loophole, it must do so in the way specified elsewhere in the clause by drafting regulations for parliamentary scrutiny.
<P>
We believe that it is an unnecessary weakening of parliamentary scrutiny to give such additional powers to Customs and Excise, especially as records show that not all notices issued by it reach the regulated community, or reach it in a timely manner.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Bill is written for the convenience of the Treasury and Customs and Excise, and the regulated community may incur penalties. That is a significant and countervailing factor that will induce us to press our amendment if the Financial Secretary is unwilling to give the matter further thought.

<P>

<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I am sorry that the right hon. Gentleman takes that view. I am sure that smugglers will take some heart from what he says.
<P>
I promised to respond to a point made by the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon (Mr. Burnett). I was grateful that he informed me that he was unable to attend the Committee this afternoon, and I think that he informed you as well, Dr. Clark. He wanted me to explain how Customs and Excise reaches a decision to prosecute for smuggling. There is a long-standing process to ensure that prosecutions are carried out when there is a reasonable prospect of success. The hon. Gentleman was especially interested to know which individuals were involved. The decision rests with senior operational managers, Customs and Excise solicitors and, depending on the circumstances, policy staff. Customs and Excise keeps the Attorney-General regularly informed of large and sensitive excise cases.
<P>
The occasions when Customs and Excise makes a prosecution depend on the facts of individual cases. It will take into account, for example, the amount of revenue evaded, the number of cigarettes smuggled, whether the person involved is a major or persistent offender, whether the goods are known to be sold to minors and whether a successful prosecution will provide a demonstrably large deterrent to those involved. That deals with the question that the hon. Gentleman asked before lunch.

</FONT>Question accordingly negatived.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 4, in page 11, line 40, leave out `For' and insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`Subject to the provisions of subsection (9) below, for'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 5, page 11, line 44, after `them', insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(9) A person shall not he regarded as a manager of premises by reason only of being the landlord or superior landlord of such premises or a person entitled to the benefit of a restrictive or other covenant in relation to such premises or of being the agent or employee of such person.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> New section 8H on page 11 of the Bill states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>A manager of premises commits an offence if he suffers the premises to be used for the sale of unmarked products.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
``Unmarked products'' are earlier defined as those that do not carry the necessary marking or a compliant mark. In other words, the product might carry the necessary label, but not one that is correct in all respects. Customs might have altered the required mark by notice, as we have just discussed, and that might not have filtered through to the trader concerned, so such offences could be comparatively trivial, but the manager of the premises would be committing an offence. We want to probe whether that is fair and whether managers in all respects are the people who should be in possession of the knowledge.
<P>
The use of the word ``suffers'' in the phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>suffers the premises to be used<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
is curiously biblical in its origins. We have observed many times that we should try as parliamentarians to write laws that people understand. I suppose that the churchgoing community understands that ``suffers'' really means ``allows', but I am afraid that an increasing number of members of the public would be slightly puzzled at the use of that rather arcane word.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I am following my hon. Friend's biblical exegesis with interest, but does not ``suffer'' mean something closer to ``incite'' than ``allow''? ``Suffer the little children'' does not mean merely ``allow the little children''.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I am not sure. I defer to my hon. Friend's biblical knowledge, but the Minister might tell us a little more about what he understands by that word. I am not sure that I agree with my hon. Friend in the sense that ``suffers'' could imply or cover inactivity as well. In the context of the Bill, that is more serious, because it is one thing for a manager to be committing an offence if he actively colluded or had knowledge of the fact that the premises were being improperly used; but if the word is used simply in the negative sense that he allowed it to happen—that it went on without his knowledge—it is plainly unfair.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> This is closely connected with the point that we were discussing earlier, is it not? I entirely agree with my right hon. Friend that this is one of the pieces of tax legislation that will most rapidly have to be rewritten by the rewriting committee, which is bringing forward a Bill to be introduced by the Financial Secretary later in the Session in relation to personal allowances. If what is meant here by ``suffers'' is ``allows'', and if what we are dealing with is a case in which constructive knowledge is sufficient to convict, we are saying, are we not, that a person who unwittingly allows something to happen but who should have known that it was happening although he did not actually know that it was happening, could for that reason alone be convicted?
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> My hon. Friend has got the point entirely.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. There are far too many separate conversations going on to my left. I should be grateful if one or two of them could come to a halt.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> Thank you, Dr. Clark. I think that we would all agree that if the manager of a building or a shopping arcade actively connived in illegal activity, penalties should apply. However, we are discussing a case in which the manager did not know about the illegality and, although he may have suffered it to the extent that he permitted it to continue, it was in a purely passive sense that he did not actively go round making spot checks to ensure that the illegal trading was not taking place. Is that really the job of a manager if that manager is simply a landlord?
<P>
In new subsection (8) a manager is defined in a number of ways, including someone who is entitled to control the use of the premises concerned. A landlord, which may be a company or an individual, may well be entitled to control the use of a shop in the shopping arcade, but that is different from being in constant managerial control of the shop or making constant, almost hour-by-hour checks that the person conducting the trade on the premises is complying in every way with the requirements of the Commissioners of Customs and Exercise.
<P>
One can easily imagine a situation in which a landlord fulfils the condition that he is entitled to control the shop concerned—in other words, he is entitled to prevent illegal activity if he knows that it is going on—but it is not his duty to do so; indeed, in practice it is highly unlikely that he will be making the necessary regular checks to ensure that the rules governing the retailing of tobacco products are kept. There must be shopping centres in all our constituencies that are owned by landlords many miles away, and it is plainly absurd for the law to place an obligation on such landlords to make those checks, which involve not just keeping an eye on the shop but going through stock to make sure that the ``duty paid'' marks are there and that they comply with the regulations and notices issued by Customs and Excise. It is unrealistic and unfair to place that obligation on landlords and to back it up with penalties. The amendment seeks to deal with that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> My right hon. Friend prompts me to ask whether he interprets new section 8H(I) as limited to cases in which the premises are being used for sale in the sense that what is being sold is part of the stock of the premises. Or could they also include premises that are being used for sale in the sense that someone who has nothing to do with the premises themselves but happens to be there is using them for sale? I take it to be the larger interpretation, but there must be some doubt about the matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> My hon. Friend is raising the possibility that the measure not only covers established tobacconists but might cover a warehouse or public house normally used for other purposes that is used illegally for passing on smuggled tobacco. It is absurd, especially if the premises are normally locked, to expect the landlord many miles away to have knowledge of that illegal use. There is a problem here which the amendment seeks to address by better defining and restricting the concept of ``manager''.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick St. Aubyn </B>(Guildford): I must support my right hon. Friend's amendment. I should refer to my entry in the Register of Members' Interests in that regard, although I hope that the situation never affects me personally. The definition of ``premises'' in the clause is very broad; it presumably includes not just commercial but domestic premises. People may rent their home out to strangers who decide to indulge in a bit of petty smuggling. People renting out a property may technically be liable for criminal prosecution for actions over which they had no control. People often move to other parts of the country or abroad for a few years with the employer with whom they have a long-term career. They do not expect to be told that if those to whom they rent a property decide on a visit to the continent for a bit of arbitrage on tobacco products and share those products with their friends when they come home—which is of course illegal—they will be subject to criminal penalties. That would be not only wrong but absurd. Such people have not connived in such activities and probably had no thought of them when they rented out their domestic premises.
<P>
My right hon. Friend is therefore right to propose the additional provision. Alternatively, the Government could redefine ``premises'' to make clear what sort of premises are involved and provide that if landlords include a provision in their lease prohibiting tenants from indulging in smuggling, that will be a sufficient fulfilment of the requirements and discharge any obligation. If a lease makes it clear that such activity is forbidden, owners cannot be said to have suffered the activity to be carried on at their premises. If the Minister proposes that alternative it is the only reasonable and just one that comes to mind—will he also make clear the position of those who have granted leases in the past? Would there be a sort of grand-fathering clause in the Bill to protect such people?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I am grateful to the right hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory) for allowing me to clarify the point. We have had an interesting discussion about the meaning of ``suffer''. I was tempted to clarify that by saying that a person may be said to suffer something only if he has active or constructive knowledge of it. The offence of suffering premises to be used for the sale of unmarked products is an important one. It parallels legislation that prevents the use of premises for the sale of illegal drugs, gambling and so on. A manager of premises must have actual or constructive knowledge, in the sense that I have explained, of illicit activities taking place on them to be guilty of the offence.
<P>
I agree with the underlying aim of the amendment, but the clause has been drafted to provide that safeguard. A person who merely lets premises on a commercial basis but does not exercise day-to-day control over them will not be guilty of the offence set out in new section 8H. The law would not be affected if, for example, a person tried to avoid liability by leasing the premises to someone else while retaining day-to-day control of them. I cannot believe that there is merit in protecting the licensee of a pub, for example—also referred to as a landlord and therefore covered by the amendment—from the consequences of his actions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> Where in the Bill is the assurance that the manager must have knowledge of the offence being committed?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> That is the effect of what is in subsection (8) of new section 8H. In doing that, the clause strikes the right balance. The categories of people whom those who have tabled the amendment seek to protect are outside the scope of the proposed new offence. That will be reflected in the guidance that Customs and Excise gives to its officers on the offence. The fact that I have given that assurance on the record may provide some reassurance as well. If it does, I am grateful to the right. hon. Gentleman for giving me that opportunity.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> In the light of what he has just said, will the Minister make clear whether he is expounding the law as he speaks? Is he giving a new interpretation in law for the word ``suffers'', or can he refer to examples in case law in which ``suffers'' is interpreted as he describes?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I am not giving a new interpretation; I am explaining the effect of the terminology used in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I think that we are ad idem on the intent here. Will the Minister make it explicit, for Pepper v. Hart purposes, that the Government intend that what he said should be the case? People who merely let out premises that happen to be used for such an activity, but who have no real control of them, will not be subject to criminal penalties under the clause. Is that not merely his interpretation but the Government's intention?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> Yes, it is the Government's intention, as I have just said. It is worth making the point that a pub landlord who turns a blind eye—picking on the use of the word ``landlord'' here—will be as guilty as if he allows sales of illegal drugs on his premises. No one can have any quarrel with that; the principle applies in both cases.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> The Minister clearly agrees with the substance of the amendment, because he has just said so. People who want to understand the legislation will have to look through the report of the Committee proceedings on the Bill to understand the Government's intention. Why does he not simply accept the amendment? Would that not be a clearer and more direct way of imparting the Government's intention?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The hon. Gentleman has misunderstood. I accept the aim but not the substance of the amendment, which is wrong for the reasons that I have given. The Bill as drafted achieves the aim.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> We cannot accept that. The Minister has been helpful in explaining what he intends the clause to do, but that simply strengthens the case for making the clause fit his intention. It will be highly unsatisfactory for the court to rely on what the Minister has said in Committee, particularly as the court will know that he would not have said it if we had not tabled the amendments.
<P>
The drafting of the Bill is defective and incomplete and, although I readily acknowledge that our amendment may not be right in every respect, the Minister should table his own amendment in due course. He can hardly say that that would make the Bill too long, as it is already in two volumes. Adding an extra line or two to make the matter clear beyond doubt would assist the Committee and reassure the regulated community everywhere. As it stands, a manager is included in the offence if he is simply a landlord who may well be entitled to control the premises. It may be written into the lease that spot checks are permitted, so that if the landlord turns up and demands to know what is going on, the leaseholder cannot deny him access. That is completely different from assuming that the landlord in question will do so and has an obligation to carry out the checks. That is not in line with what the Financial Secretary has assured us is the intention, which is that only those who know or should know what goes on will commit an offence. To improve the Bill, I genuinely ask the Financial Secretary to reconsider.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> Does my right hon. Friend agree that it is curious that the explanatory notes on clause 14 contain no explanation of the word ``suffers'', yet the Financial Secretary has given it a specific and important meaning. That suggests that the Government and the draftsmen have not thought through the full import and meaning of the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> My hon. Friend adds support to my case. This is an important part of the law, as it deals with penalties that may be suffered by people who do not possess the knowledge, or the constructive knowledge, that makes accusing them of an offence realistic or fair.
<P>
Given that the provisions are new—we are not amending existing law—it is doubly important to try to get them right. I fully understand if the Financial Secretary wants to take the subject away and think about it, as it certainly requires that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The meaning is clear as the Bill stands, so I urge my hon. Friends to resist the amendment.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> The clause deals with the management of excise duty on tobacco products, under the Tobacco Products Duty Act 1979, which is the cornerstone of the legislation to raise money from the sale of cigarettes. This is a useful moment to try to pinpoint where the Government have gone wrong in their management of excise duty, which has resulted in a loss to the Exchequer during the past few years, and to question whether the clause, which amends the Act, is adequate for its purported purpose of redress.
<P>
According to the 1998 Red Book, the outturn of revenue from tobacco duties in 1996–97—the last year of the previous Government—was £8 billion. Therefore, this Government inherited £8 billion a year. Table C9, which has been referred to, on page 203 of the most recent Red Book, shows an average outturn during the years 1998–99 to 2000–01 of only £7.1 billion. Allowing for nominal increases in tobacco duty since the previous Government, that represents a revenue shortfall under the regime introduced by this Government of £1 billion a year for each of those three years. That is a total revenue loss of £3 billion. The Government have said that they want extra tobacco duty revenue to put into the national health service. According to this Government's way of thinking—which might be a good one—that is £3 billion that we would all have liked to be spent in the health service.
<P>
The Red Book analysis shows that the £3 billion shortfall has translated into a serious cut in what would have been spent on tackling the excessive waiting lists that have been caused by this Government's health service policies. The Government have made a direct link, in this Finance Bill, between revenue from tobacco duty and revenue spent in the health service. In the interests of proper revenue collection and sensible tax policies, as well as in the interests of the amount of money spent on health, will the Financial Secretary tell the Committee what mistakes the Government have made? Revenue from tobacco is on average £1 billion a year less, over a three-year period, than it would have been if they had followed the previous Government's policies.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> According to my reading of the explanatory notes, the clause unmistakably increases the powers of the Commissioners of Customs and Excise. In particular, it allows them to make changes to regulations, not by the normal route of laying them before Parliament, but by issuing a notice or by other means. Subsection (8) on page 13 states that changes
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>may be specified in the regulations or required by the Commissioners.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
They may therefore issue a letter or oral instruction to change the regulations, without even issuing a notice and sending it through the post to those affected. Will the Minister explain what he means by changes to the requirements being made by a notice or other means?

<P>

<B>Mr. Jack:</B> I notice that subsections (2), (6) and (7) contain requirements to extend the commissioner's powers to make regulations concerning the manufacture of tobacco products and the premises where that may take place. There is no definition of how such a process is supposed to operate. I should be grateful if the Minister could enlighten us a little. The notes on clauses state:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>This will, for example, ensure that the Commissioners have clear powers to restrict or prohibit the manufacture of tobacco products outside registered factories.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I see some merit in that for people who might be undertaking illegal activity, but business is subject to enough regulation already as a result of the Government's action. By the nature of the trade, the world of tobacco products is already very carefully prescribed and inspected. I am slightly unclear why more powers are required at this juncture. Will the Financial Secretary enlighten us about why more burdens are being placed on the industry?
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> Clauses 12, 13, 14 and 15 all cover tobacco product duty. A raft of quite powerful measures is about to be put on the statute book that will tighten the regime and ensure that the Government get the revenue in, which is perfectly reasonable to do in principle. However, before the Government go ahead with that, surely we should know the answers to two simple questions. First, is duty currently at, or near, the revenue-maximising point, or is that not the Government's objective? Secondly, is there, for example, a health objective that is leading them to seek a trade-off between a revenue maximisation policy and a health objective? We have received no clarification from the Government about that.
<P>
I wish to take the Minister through a few more relevant points. Earlier, he referred to the document ``Tackling Tobacco Smuggling'', which I have now had the opportunity to read. It is profoundly uninformative. It does not even give elementary information. It tells us that what information it does provide is almost certainly highly unreliable and that even the information on the amount of smoking tobacco—smuggled or not smuggled—is ``notoriously unreliable''. It also states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Tobacco consumption is under-reported in all surveys.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The document is not sure by how much, and it is assumed that the level of under-reporting has not changed. However, I should have thought that a good deal of logic exists to suggest that it has. Prices have increased and wherever there is a change in the price regime, there is likely to be a change in behaviour.
<P>
The document states that about one in five cigarettes are smuggled, but finally it gives a more precise figure of 18 per cent. I would not mind that, were it also to provide a figure of 25 per cent. of total revenue from tobacco being lost through smuggling—thus implying in other words that the cheaper brands of tobacco that are smuggled result in a higher revenue loss because they have a lower base price, That is the only assumption that I can make to get anywhere near squaring those numbers.
<P>
We have no information on the key question, which is, what effect will a change in price have on demand, or, in economics language, what is the elasticity of demand for tobacco? Virtually nothing in the document answers that question. I cannot help feeling that that is exactly the crucial information that we would find if we had an opportunity to read the Taylor report. That is the crucial issue in determining whether the current assault on smuggling is likely to be effective in the long run and whether the rather attractive chart 7 passes for anything more than spurious rigour that will turn out to be mere guesswork. The chart suggests that the new strategy, combined with a 5 per cent. duty increase, will result in no further increase in tobacco consumption, and boldly shows that without the strategy there would be a huge increase.
<P>
We do not know whether that is true because we do not even know whether the figures on which the chart is based are accurate or what the elasticity of demand for tobacco is. However, someone has made an effort to find out what the elasticity of demand for tobacco is, and has submitted it as evidence to the Treasury Committee. On the whole, Select Committees seem to do better than Standing Committees in getting to the bottom of matters, but I shall do my best.
<P>
The submission from the Institute for Fiscal Studies is interesting. Although it makes several difficult assumptions—which I have discussed with the author, who agrees that they are difficult—it takes us some way forward. I shall take the Committee not through the logic of the entire paper but merely through the two conclusions. The initial, and seemingly favourable, conclusion is that the estimates are smaller than the critical elasticity value—in other words, that the tax rate is below its revenue maximising point, so the Government's strategy might safeguard revenue in the short and medium term. Unfortunately, however, it continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>However, these elasticity estimates do not take account of all of the growth in smuggling of cigarettes which has occurred since 1996 . . . and which is likely to increase the estimated responsiveness of demand for duty-paid cigarettes to price changes.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It goes on to say that we may therefore find that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the current tax rate will be much closer to its revenue-maximising level.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is as far as the author is prepared to go—that we might shortly approach the point at which we shall not raise more money but will merely increase smuggling.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> Will my hon. Friend give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> I am drawing to the end of my remarks.
<P>
Without a clear Government view on elasticity of demand for tobacco, none of the strategy that has been described in debate on the past four clauses is worth much. We need the answer to that, and if it is in the Taylor report, the Government should publish that report so that we can be reassured that they are taking the right approach. If the report contains awkward or sensitive advice that the Government do not want to disclose, perhaps, as the Financial Secretary said, quite legitimately for operational reasons, he should delete that operational advice and, in the interests of transparency, give the report to the Committee and the country. The document that we have contributes little—indeed, it is little more than a propaganda document—to the debate about how, in the long run, to tackle the increase in tobacco smuggling.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> I rise again because my eye has been taken by some more intriguing drafting in the clause. It would be helpful, both for the Committee and for the industry that is affected by the measures, if we were to concentrate on clause 15(9). The notes on clauses helpfully tell us that it allows the commissioners to make regulations relating to any of the matters in section 7(1) of the Tobacco Products Duty Act 1979 or provide for their imposition. It would be helpful if the Financial Secretary would spell out to us what exactly are the unregulated areas that might be affected by the regulation mentioned.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Customs has some of the most comprehensive powers in the land—understandably, because it has a very difficult job to do. It has greater and stronger powers than the Inland Revenue and, in some cases, even than the police. It would help if we knew what would be subject to the regulation. This provision seems to give carte blanche to customs at any time of its choosing, on any subject and in any way to regulate on anything that it wants to do under the Act. It seems to be a pretty broad power. I may have got it wrong but, in the interests of the magic Pepper v. Hart case, will the Financial Secretary make clear what this means? While he is doing so, will he also explain why subsection (9) contains the words:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Regulations under subsection (1) above may, in particular, include provision . . . ?<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am intrigued by the words ``in particular''. They seem to imply that the provisions are special, but there could be a whole load of other things as well. I am intrigued to know why that linguistic form has been chosen. There must be a reason; otherwise, it would not be in the Bill.
<P>
I draw the matter to the Committee's attention because a vast exercise is going on to rewrite our tax laws in plain, understandable, straightforward English—the tax simplification process. However, this is a classic example of the process appearing to travel in the diametrically opposite direction. Why, with the new orthodoxy emerging, have we ended up with this convoluted and bizarre phrase?
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I know that my right hon. Friend was the originator of the tax rewrite. Does he agree, however, that a Government who happily stick with the term ``suffers'' and claim that it is clear to the ordinary reader are all too likely to be introducing such gobbledegook?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> I am glad that my hon. Friend makes that point. Again, I would acknowledge, ahead of the answer, that sometimes, when one is welding new legislation into existing legislation cast in old-style language, it can be difficult to put it in exact, plain English. However, surely some effort could have been made at least to move to a sensible halfway house. I do not sense that such an effort has been made.
<P>
The reverse of this position is another intriguing interpretation of these words. The explanatory notes helpfully tell us that this section also
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>enables the Commissioners to dispense with compliance with any provision in the regulations in such circumstances and subject to such conditions as they determine.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The commissioners are being given the draconian power to do what they want, when they want, anywhere that they like, without telling anyone when, where or how; and they are also being enabled to take those powers away in equal measure.
<P>
It is an interesting piece of law. There may well be precedent for all this in other parts of the customs powers, but if we are to approve the clause we need to know a little more about how it is supposed to work. Will the Financial Secretary, therefore, give an explanation of subsection (9)(b), under which the dispensing element can be used with such ease?
<P>
Finally, will any of the regulating powers in the clause be subject to prior consultation with those whom it will affect?

<P>

<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I shall deal in full with the points about clause 15 but, if you will allow me, Dr. Clark, I shall wander some way from it and respond to some of the other points.
<P>
The hon. Member for Guildford suggested that if only the Government had continued with the policies of the previous Government, more revenue would be coming in from tobacco duty. That is certainly not the case. Following the previous Government's fundamental expenditure review, to which we referred this morning and which was not made public, they announced 300 immediate reductions in front-line smuggling staff. They also announced that a further 302 posts would be lost following a review of the effects of losing the first tranche of 300 staff.
<P>
I remember that well, and I remember the now Paymaster General, my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, South (Dawn Primarolo), rightly drawing attention time after time to what would happen if the cuts went ahead. I am sad to say that the previous Government were deaf to those points, with dire consequences. Some of those responsible are in the Room at the moment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey rose—</B><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Before Mr. Davey intervenes, I should say that I was tolerant of Mr. Tyrie because he twice suggested that he was coming to an end. Therefore, I did not interrupt him to point out that he was fairly wide of the clause. He has drawn the Financial Secretary wide of it, and this intervention will probably be even wider. I invite the Financial Secretary to get back to the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I am grateful, Dr. Clark, and am sure that the Financial Secretary and I will bear with your instructions. Does the Financial Secretary have any calculations of the revenue lost by the Exchequer from the cuts in Customs and Excise staff introduced by the Conservative Government?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I am afraid to say that I do not have the figures, although in July 1997, soon after we were elected, we announced that the loss of the further 302 posts would not go ahead. We were in time to avert what would otherwise have been even more serious damage.
<P>
The hon. Member for Chichester (Mr. Tyrie) asked about the Government's objectives for tobacco duty. We have health and revenue objectives. Rising tobacco prices have beneficial health effects, and the proceeds of real-term increases in tobacco duty will go to the health service in future. Those effects have been rightly acknowledged by the shadow Secretary of State for Health, who said that increases in tobacco duty send out the right messages on health. We discovered this morning that not only do the Conservative members of the Committee believe that tobacco duty should not rise in real terms, but they want it frozen, which means that it would fall in real terms. That would have damaging health effects, and is not a view that I share.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman asked about the consequences for smuggling. I refer him to the excellent and informative document. ``Tackling Tobacco Smuggling'', which puts in the public domain with the greatest possible clarity a large quantity of information in a readily accessible form. Its first graph, printed on page 2, is about the market share of smuggled cigarettes, and shows what would happen to its size if no action were taken. It also shows the projected market share with the measures that my hon. Friend the Paymaster General has announced, and the real duty increase. The information that the hon. Gentleman wanted is contained in that graph.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Although I was not in the Chair this morning, I understand that there was a long debate on smuggling. I therefore hope that references to smuggling are kept to a minimum.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> In the light of that ruling, Dr. Clark, I had better shut up.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I shall now discuss the content of the clause, which has two distinct elements. First, it supports the integrity of the marking scheme by ensuring that in cases in which the duty on tobacco products is remitted or repaid, fiscal marks are obliterated or destroyed. That safeguards against the re-entry into the supply chain of marked products on which duty has not been paid, or has been refunded—a measure that has not been contested in our debate.
<P>
Secondly, the clause amends the power to make regulations. The present tobacco regulations were made in 1979 and are now inadequate in some circumstances. Essentially, the provision regularises agreed current practice, and can therefore be seen as helpful. New regulations are needed for the introduction of the fiscal mark, and the clause seems an appropriate opportunity to address the deficiencies of the old regulations. The powers need to be amended to allow Customs and Excise to make flexible regulations and will, as I said, simply regularise current practice.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> Could the Financial Secretary help me with the phrase ``regularise current practice''? It has the whiff of implying that Customs and Excise has been making it up as it goes along and may be imposing on the tobacco trade rules, regulations and procedures that do not necessarily have the full force of the law.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> As I said, the 1979 regulations are inadequate in several respects. We are taking the opportunity to ensure that they are adequate for the current circumstances.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> Can the Financial Secretary assure me that no acts that are beyond the law have been undertaken under those deficient regulations?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I can assure the right hon. Gentleman that the new regulations, as amended, will be wholly adequate for the purpose for which they are intended.
<P>
I shall respond to some of the specific points that the right hon. Gentleman raised on elements of subsection (6) and subsection (9). He asked why Customs and Excise needed that power for registering premises for the manufacture of tobacco products. The problem is that the current regulations require premises to be registered even where they do not provide adequate security. Customs and Excise will have the power to refuse to register premises as a tobacco factory and to restrict or prohibit the manufacture of tobacco products outside registered factories. That is more important than it appeared to be in 1979.
<P>
Subsection (9)(1A)(b) parallels the commissioners' existing powers in other excise regimes such as that for alcohols. Manufacturers often ask customs for temporary relaxations of rules on the manufacture or storage of excise goods, for example when modernising plant or moving premises. The provision gives the commissioners the ability to allow such concessions when asked to do so. The changes are therefore helpful. I commend the clause to the Committee.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I was hoping that the Financial Secretary would have answered my question, but his failure to do so may have been an oversight. I asked him specifically about subsection (8) and the fact that the Commissioners of Customs and Excise will be able to alter regulations by way of a notice or other means. The regulations could be tabled or the changes could simply be ``required by the Commissioners''. An oral proclamation would be sufficient; indeed, proclamation is the word. The Committee might remember last year, when the Henry VIII powers were raised during consideration of the Finance Bill.
<P>
In the 16th century, the Crown often circumvented or dispensed with statute law altogether by simply issuing proclamations. It persuaded Parliament to pass an Act of Proclamation to legitimise it, which basically meant that what the King said went. We are approaching a similar situation under the clause. Evidently, the commissioners will find the usual route of laying regulations and having them approved far too burdensome, so they will be able simply to require something. It is not even specified in what form the changes must be proposed. Will they have to be written or issued by notice? Will the Financial Secretary be kind enough to respond to my question?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> In his helpful reply, the Minister failed also to respond to my question whether such matters would be the subject of consultation. He generously admitted that, since 1979, deficiencies have been discovered in the regulations that the proposals would put right. Effectively, we shall be starting afresh. My right hon. Friend has shone light on an area that is still shrouded in darkness about how such matters operate.
<P>
If there is one thing that my mailbag shows whenever Customs and Excise is involved in any matter, it is a lack of understanding on the part of the citizen who is affected by customs law. Such matters lead usually to problems that must then be sorted out by correspondence, negotiation or even an appeal to the commissions, which could have been avoided had certain aspects been set up properly in the first place. Will the new area of activity be the subject of consultation? What notice system will be instituted to enable the points raised by my right hon. Friend to be put in the public domain well ahead of time, so that those to whom the provisions apply might know that there is to be a new set of regulations?
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I, too, am dissatisfied by the Minister's response. As my right hon. Friends have made clear, the thrust of clause 15 is that, if we give Customs and Excise enough power—extraordinary power, in my view, especially under the proposed new subsection (lA)(b)—all the problems that have been wrongly described as being the fault of the previous Government will be solved. The Financial Secretary must realise that, when the Labour Government came to power in 1997, they took responsibility for matters. He said that they adjusted the number of customs officers when they came to office.
<P>
The number of customs officers that were available was the responsibility and the result of the tactical decision of Ministers of this Government. Ministers in the previous Government had not anticipated the massive increase in tobacco duty that was immediately introduced by the Labour Government, with the unfortunate consequence that the revenue suddenly dropped off on the scale of £3 billion. Will the Financial Secretary explain how additional customs officers would affect the quantity of untaxed cigarettes brought legitimately into the country from the European Union? We heard earlier that that accounted for half the loss of revenue throughout the period.

<P>

<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The hon. Member for Guildford should take a leaf out of the book of the hon. Member for West Dorset, who, from time to time in our debates, freely acknowledges the dreadful errors made by the previous Government. They certainly made errors in cutting customs at the time when tobacco smuggling was growing. It would be wiser to acknowledge those mistakes than to defend the indefensible.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Wells pressed me for more information about subsection (8). From what he said, I imagine that he has not had time to look at the Tobacco Products Duty Act 1979, which is amended by the clause. The measure that he suggested was draconian applies only to the making of returns that provide information to customs about the brands currently on the market, for example. It is a routine matter.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Fylde (Mr. Jack) asked whether there would be consultation. There will be, and draft regulations will be exposed to the trade shortly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I am sorry to press the point, but the Minister is completely dismissive of our concerns. He says that the changes sought are unimportant or trivial, but that is not clear from the Bill. It is a reasonable requirement on customs that even comparatively minor changes should be introduced, made subject to regulations and presented to Parliament in the normal way. Hundreds or thousands of such regulations are presented every year by every Department. The procedure is not onerous—in fact, the negative resolution procedure usually means that there is no real scrutiny or debate, which may be another problem. However, having to collate periodically the changes and put them in the form of a written regulation is at least some discipline on a Department—in this case, the Inland Revenue. The proposals must then go through a certain procedure, after the consultation demanded by my right hon. Friend the Member for Fylde.
<P>
As it stands, however, the law is simply being made on the say so of the commissioners. The Minister did not even answer my question about what form that would take. Would it be an oral instruction from some junior official from Customs and Excise, or would it have to be circulated in the form of a notice? That is an example of Executive-made law, which should interest not only myself and my hon. Friends, but the Committee in general. The long march from unchallenged Executive authority achieved a satisfactory destination when changes to laws were required to go through Parliament, where there were opportunities to discuss them. Laws should not just be promulgated by the Executive. The case may be minor, but nevertheless it is significant, and the Minister has not given an adequate explanation of it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Does my right hon. Friend agree that one could highlight his point by imagining that the commissioners in the clause were replaced by the Commissioner for the Metropolitan Police? Let us imagine that it was proposed that that commissioner should be able to make law. It is an extraordinary testimony to our present intellectual position on Customs and Excise that we do not find it absurd that such a proposition should be before us. The Minister happily accepts it as the normal course of events—but we have all tolerated it for far too long.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> My hon. Friend makes a telling point. Such a proposition in a Home Office Bill would undoubtedly catch the eye of the civil rights lobby. People interested in civil rights would be right to scrutinise the text, and ask questions about it. Here, buried in a Finance Bill, is a similar proposition that the agents of the Treasury, in the form of HM Customs and Excise, should be able to make rules that have the status of law, with penalties attaching to their breach. It does not even say how. That is the point about which the Minister owes the Committee an explanation. If he is unable to provide one, we shall be tempted to vote against the clause on those grounds.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> I am intrigued by clause 16 because the gaming industry gains by £2 million, which is a good bet for the industry. What particularly caught my eye was the fact that the gain results from the application of an unspecified measure of the prices index—we do not know quite what it is—which, as I understand it, is uprating the bands against which the tax is levied. Bearing in mind our continuing desire to hear from the Financial Secretary on the subject of the various indices that the Government are using to upgrade various parts of the tax system, would he be so kind as to furnish us with the details of which index in this case is being used for that purpose?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The clause increases the duty bands for gaming, and the changes come into effect for all accounting periods beginning on or after 1 April 2000. The changes are based on the promise made by my hon. Friend the Paymaster General to the House in 1998 to adjust the duty bands just with inflation for the lifetime of this Parliament. The index used in this case is historic RPI data, December to December. I believe that that answers the right hon. Gentleman's question.
<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> I wonder whether I might press the Financial Secretary a little more. He says that December to December is historic. Will he refresh my memory about why that period has been chosen? Is the historic index the all-prices RPI as applied in December?
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I would be grateful if when he replies to my right hon. Friend, the Financial Secretary could explain whether the period over which the inflation linkage applies to these allowances is the same as that over which the RPI linkage to personal tax allowances in the income tax system operates? If there is a difference, why is there a difference? We should like to hear how the structure of inflation linking for these allowances relates to the inflation linking and tax allowances in the rest of the system.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> Will the Minister explain why his projections for gaming duty in table C9 show the amount of revenue falling by 2000–01? To what extent is that due to forms of betting—for example, on the internet—that are beyond the Government's tax base?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> As I told the Committee, the indexation in question has been in plate only since 1998, when my hon. Friend the Paymaster General told the House that we would uprate the bands in line with inflation for the lifetime of this Parliament. We are therefore taking about a different kind of exercise from others that we have examined. We then decided that looking back to the previous year's December-to-December RPI was the most sensible measure to use to put our commitment into effect. 
<P>
The right hon. Member for Charnwood asked about income tax allowances. September to September historic RPI data are used in that case, and they are set out in the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> Are we not coming back to a subject that was of interest to the Committee when it considered the inflation linking of the duty rates? Is it not small wonder that people are confused about what the Government mean when they say that they are linking different aspects of the tax system to inflation, if they apply inflation measured over a different period even to the concept of tax allowances? In our earlier sittings, the Financial Secretary explained why prospective inflation rates had to be applied to the duty rates on alcohol and petrol and why retrospective inflation rates had to be applied to allowances. We now hear that different retrospective inflation rates are applied to different allowances in the system. Is it not time that the Government brought together all those different aspects of an unnecessarily complex system and cleared their own mind before telling the Committee what the phrase ``inflation linking'' means when applied to the tax system?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I think that the situation is a little different in this case because the Government have announced that they will use the device in question only for the duration of this Parliament. The uprating is announced in the Budget each year. If we are to look back to the most recent available RPI figure when putting the figures together, December is the right month to use. As I said, the use of the September to September RPI for income tax personal allowances is set down in statute.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> The mystery unfolds. Different historic indices are selected, almost randomly, it seems, for different purposes. The Financial Secretary described it as a bespoke arrangement for the remainder of this Parliament, which implies that, at some stage in the future, there might be recommendations to change that. Will he undertake on behalf of the Government to produce, during this Parliament, a definitive list of all the indices that are used for different purposes, and a commentary on why they have been selected, including periods, calculations and related matters? That might provide a more comprehensive picture of the Government's thinking on indices and the assumptions that lie behind them.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I want to pick up on a remark made by the Financial Secretary. If I am right, he said that the income tax system was on a September-to-September basis, and this duty is on a December-to-December basis, because the income tax system is written into statute. That is correct, but the Committee is considering a new statute. It is therefore entirely within the Government's power to introduce an amendment that establishes the principle that my right hon. Friend and I are suggesting to the Committee. If tax allowances in the system are to be linked to the inflation rate, the Government should be able to decide the period during which that inflation linkage will be measured. I assume that the Government thought that the December to December linkage was the latest index available on Budget day that would be administratively convenient to link to allowances. If it is administratively convenient for the gaming duty, will the Minister explain why it is not administratively convenient for the income tax system? Why is the measure of inflation for gaming duty different from that for income tax? It is absurd. As my right hon. Friend said, there are almost certainly other allowances in the tax system in relation to which inflation is measured over a third, fourth or fifth period? The Committee was given a figure of 3.41 per cent. for the prospective movement in the September-to-September RPI, and 1.1 per cent. as the retrospective movement as applied to income tax. Will the Financial Secretary tell the Committee the December-to-December statistic?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I do not have that figure to hand, although the Red Book contains RPI figures. I understand the right hon. Gentleman's point. He is right to say that a variety of indices are used in different circumstances, and always have been, including the period when he was a Treasury Minister. I cannot remember his introducing proposals to address the matter. A range of considerations should be taken into account. Administrative convenience is one, and consistency with past practice and clarity for taxpayers are others. It is helpful if people know, as soon as the September RPI is published, what will happen to allowances. Why should that information be delayed for a couple of months?
<P>
I can now answer the right hon. Gentleman's question—the answer is 1.8 per cent.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I was hoping that the Financial Secretary would now be able to answer the question that I asked.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I apologise to the hon. Gentleman, who asked about the figures for duty receipts. The forecast does not deal only with gaming duty; it also deals with betting duties. The relevant table reflects the fact that receipts from the national lottery have been on a downward trend.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> The Financial Secretary spoke about the right time for telling people about the uprating of tax allowances. I hope that I understood him correctly. Will he explain why the Government saw fit to announce indexation of personal tax allowances for most taxpayers in the pre-Budget report but decided to exclude pensioners? That created problems with the coding for the Inland Revenue and caused concern among elderly taxpayers who received the incorrect codes for April and had to have money clawed back in May. If he is so keen on suggesting early indexation of allowances, will he assure the Committee that it will apply to pensioners as well in future?
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> The Financial Secretary drew an affecting picture of people in pubs who say: ``Oh good, it's the September figure today, so we shall hear by how much our tax allowances will go up.'' I am not certain that the Office for National Statistics' September publications have a circulation any wider than that of its other statistics. Even if there were such pleasure in the pubs and clubs of Britain in the middle of November each year, those people would be prepared to forgo it if they understood that, by doing so, their allowances would go up by not 1.1 per cent. but 1.8 per cent., which the Financial Secretary told us would be the increase in gaming duty.
<P>
The point is serious. The Financial Secretary proposes that the principle of inflation linkage should give the gaming industry an increase in tax allowances of 1.8 per cent. while the same principle should give to individual taxpayers an increase in tax allowances of 1.1 per cent. Why should the gaming industry benefit by 0.7 per cent. more from the same principle than individual taxpayers through the income tax system? To say that it is written into the Income and Corporation Tax Act will not be regarded as satisfactory in the pubs and clubs.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> I should like to follow my right hon. Friend's perceptive analysis. I am not sure whether the Financial Secretary has announced it as such, but we are rapidly heading towards a pick-and-mix approach on the selection of targets. The Treasury is reasonably adept at forecasting, and I can see that it may introduce a new regime on the expensive areas, picking measures in future that will provide a cheap outcome, while having another view on the expenditure areas.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> That is what it is doing.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> That is why I ask whether the Financial Secretary will undertake, for the greater education of all, to publish a commentary on the Treasury's policy on the subject.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I accept that a variety of approaches is and has always been taken. I do not agree that it would be a good idea to delay the announcement of income tax allowances. They have been announced in September for a long time, and it helps employers and others to have that information earlier rather than later. It would not be sensible to try to guess what the best month would be each year. Consistency is important. If the same month is used for income tax allowances every year, the process will be entirely fair through natural swings and roundabouts. I certainly do not agree that it would be sensible to introduce an element of arbitrariness about the month chosen for uprating income tax allowances, which would be the impact of what Opposition Members suggest.
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> We cannot have that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> My right hon. Friend says from a sedentary position that we cannot have that, and I am sure that he would like to catch your eye, Dr. Clark.
<P>
Inconsistencies are involved in addition to that of inflation. For example, the clause is scheduled to come into operation from 1 April 2000, but other changes that relate to amusement machine licence duty, which we shall debate later, will come into effect on 5 August 2000. I shall be probing why those differences exist. Differences seem to abound, and I am becoming confused about exactly what Government policy is and what purpose the differences serve.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I did not intend to intervene again, but the Financial Secretary suggests that we proposed that the month used should be selected at random, year by year, when the statistics become available. That is not the Government's policy, and it would be a misrepresentation to suggest that it was, but it is closer to the Government's policy than it is to the approach that my right hon. Friend and I are espousing. If the policy intention is to link tax allowances to inflation, why does the period over which inflation is measured vary from one tax to another? I realise that for administrative purposes the right month may be December, November or October, but the idea that some policy purpose is served by having different time scales seems to add unnecessary complexity to the system. It is to that proposition that I am still waiting for a response from the Financial Secretary, either to say that a purpose is served, or that no purpose is served and that it is merely a historical relic, in which case the Treasury might want to consider the matter for a future year.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> It is a feature of history that, as I have said three times now, has always existed. However, the right hon. Member for Charnwood cannot get off quite so easily. He urged the Committee that it would be in the interests of income tax payers if the December figure had been used this year rather than the September figure, because it was 1.8 per cent. rather than 1.1 per cent. As I pointed out, consistency, using the same month each year—is more important, as is evident from the practical effects of the changes over time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I am grateful to the Financial Secretary, because he may be straining the patience of the Whip. He is in danger of prolonging this exchange unnecessarily. Just so that the record is clear, I did not suggest changing the period year by year. I was simply picking up the Financial Secretary's argument to suggest that if pubs and clubs are waiting for the September figures, giving them more notice would be regarded as beneficial. I simply allowed myself the observation that if that were true—I do not for a moment believe that it is—they might balance on the other side of the scales the proposition that if they waited until December, the figure would be 1.8 per cent. and therefore more generous, even if they had a shorter period of notice as a result. The serious policy point is whether to adopt a single approach in linking inflation to allowances, rather than an approach that is not only variegated and impossible to understand but, as the Financial Secretary is finding in these exchanges, impossible to explain.

<P>

<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> I rise to welcome the clause and the schedule. The clause deals with issues that I and my hon. Friend the Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable) raised in debates on last year's Finance Bill. The Government have increased amusement machine licence duties during this Parliament and several not-for-profit clubs and seaside coastal resorts have been hit by those large increases. My hon. Friend moved amendments to the previous Finance Bill to raise the level at which lower rates of duty become payable in order to help the not-for-profit clubs and various operators of amusement arcades in seaside coastal resorts.
<P>
The Government were taxing machines for which the stakes are low at the same level as machines for which stakes and prizes were much higher, which was unfair. As I said, it had a severe impact on not-for-profit clubs, such as the British Legion. Many of the machines on such premises were primarily aimed at raising money for charitable purposes, yet the Government were taking a large slug in taxation out of the reasonable activities of the clubs.
<P>
We are delighted that the Government listened to our representations last year and have taken account of letters sent by my hon. Friend the Member for Twickenham to Treasury chambers to press the same case. I give credit to the Government where credit is due and I want to put that on the record. I am pleased that they have changed their position as a result of Liberal-Democrat representations.
<P>
There is always a ``but'' when one gives credit to the Government and this is it. Trying to view paragraph 4 of schedule 2 with a non-expert's eye and work out which category is appropriate for this type of machine, I suspect that it is category D. Over a 12-month period, the duty payable for these machines is down to the same level that applied at the beginning of the Parliament. We salute what the Government are doing, but they are taking us back to the status quo ante, rather than providing a generous reduction to the operators of those machines.
<P>
The Liberal Democrats have a final comment for future consideration. Now that the Government have seen the light and are protecting the not-for-profit clubs and operators of amusement arcades with low profit margins in seaside coastal resorts, they should go a step further, perhaps in next year's Budget, and ensure that such clubs and operators do not have to pay such a tax burden. If they did so, they would earn even more plaudits not just from Liberal Democrat Members but from clubs throughout the country.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I join the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton in welcoming the broad thrust of the clause and schedule 2. However, I should like the Financial Secretary to answer one or two specific points. They might prompt him to table minor amendments at a later stage in our proceedings. I may have misunderstood some of the purport of the provisions, in which case it can be cleared up in Committee. My first question is linked to paragraph 7(1) of schedule 2, in which the date by which applications must be received is 4 August. I am unclear why the date is so late. The effect of such a late date is that no one will be able to make an application at the beginning of July to get in before the summer season and gain the benefit of the new changes. That seems odd, given that the summer season for most operators, especially at the seaside, is by far the most important part of the year, as I know from my constituency.
<P>
My second question relates to paragraph 10 of the schedule, which creates new schedule 4A. I want to concentrate on sub-paragraph 8(a) of the proposed new paragraph 2, in which the notices are to be given to people
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>who are or appear to be<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
in default. We shall come to much more serious versions of the provision when we discuss the importance of duties. Unless the Financial Secretary can explain the measure, it seems strange to allow the person who is issuing the default notice to take a view about whether someone was the relevant person to whom to give such a notice and for that view to become the governing feature.
<P>
Of course, the person issuing the notice must take a view, but if it turns out that the person to whom the notice has been given is the wrong person, surely the notice would not be held to have been collected. If, the following year, the person appears to the person offering the notice to have been the right person, it seems that the person who has received the notice is then the proper person, even though he was not the right person in the first place. That seems an odd state of affairs. I hope that the Financial Secretary can explain the provision or slightly amend it.
<P>
Proposed new sub-paragraph 8(b) states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>any person who is the representative of such a person<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
may be the recipient of the default notice. Perhaps the Financial Secretary has some jurisprudence about that provision and can explain who would, under such circumstances, count as a representative. I say for the edification of members of the Committee that, in usual circumstances, such a representative can be a person's Member of Parliament, priest or solicitor. I am sure that the intention behind the provision is sensible, but surely it should include the possibility of the owner's employees, for example. I am puzzled why ``representative'' has been used and I hope that the provision can be either revised or explained.
<P>
I have been referring to sub-paragraphs of paragraph 2 of new schedule 4A rather than directly to paragraph 2 of the schedule itself. There is also an oddity in sub-paragraph (l)(b) of paragraph 3 of the new schedule, which states: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the request included in the notice<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
has to be complied with, but without a time limit.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Where are we now, Mr. Letwin?
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Paragraph 10 of schedule 2 introduces new schedule 4A, and we are at paragraph 3(1)(b) of that schedule, on line 47 of page 120. I apologise—the measure is a nightmare to negotiate, although the drafting is clear on the whole.
<P>
There is no time limit and no provision to allow reasonable time for compliance. That is odd, and does not compare with parallel legislation. Will the Financial Secretary examine that?
<P>
For the benefit of all the Committee, I shall now use page numbers. Line 23 on page 121 says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>A default licence may be granted for a period of any length.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
However, lines 18 to 20 on page 120 say that the first day of the specified period must fall not more than three years before the date of the notice. I cannot understand how a notice that cannot extend more than three years backwards can be accompanied by a default licence granted for a period of any length. I might be misconstruing the relationship between the two, but I think that that is an error for the Financial Secretary to explain or amend.
<P>
In Committee, we cannot have the benefit of discussions with parliamentary counsel, and there might be perfectly good explanations for the issues that I have raised, so I do not seek an immediate answer. Indeed, the Financial Secretary might table amendments on all those points later.
<P>
However, I shall argue strenuously about one point that I do not think I have misunderstood. Paragraph 4(7) of new schedule 4A is probably a conscious measure and a matter of policy. It would be marvellous to know that it is not a policy matter, because that would mean that only the drafting needed clearing up. There are some amusement arcades in my constituency, and no doubt in other constituencies that cover the seaside. It appears that if an arcade has a licence for a couple of days a week, rather than for prolonged periods, those short periods can be rounded up to a month. I am sure that that is not right. If that outcome is not intentional, it is a drafting problem, because I cannot imagine that it was caused by ignorance about the way in which the industry operates. If it is intentional, it is the wrong policy. Either way, I hope that the Financial Secretary will give us an answer.
<P>
I apologise for my rather detailed and tedious repetition, but part of the Committee's purpose is to clean up what is by common consent a reasonable provision.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The hon. Gentleman's speech might have been detailed, but we are grateful that it was presented in such a way that we could all follow it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I am pleased with the welcome for the changes introduced by the clause. They have been widely welcomed and are particularly helpful to seaside resorts. The changes for seaside arcades are exactly what the trade wanted. I do not want to disappoint the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton too much, but the influential representations were not those from the Liberal Democrats, but those from the industry and the seaside resorts.
<P>
The Government have a series of measures in hand to boost United Kingdom resorts in line with the commitments that we have made in seaside areas. The changes made in the provisions are a fillip for seaside tourism and have been widely welcomed. The significant change is to be found not in the table in schedule 2 to which the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton referred, but in paragraph 2 of schedule 2, in which exemption is extended to ten-penny machines. That is the real boon that the trade was pressing for, and has been welcomed.
<P>
The hon. Member for West Dorset, whose constituency will benefit from the changes, asked me about paragraphs 2(2) and 2(8)(a) of new schedule 4A. As far as I can see, there are no errors here. He asked me particularly about the phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>are or appear to be.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
At the time of issuing a default notice, an officer may not know for sure what the position is, and can only go on what appears to be the case—he has to go ahead anyway. However, there is a review mechanism that will establish whether a mistake has been made. The term ``representative'' is described more fully in paragraph 4(7) of new schedule 4A.

<P>

<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> In paragraph 7(4)(a), it is stated that a representative can be a ``personal representative''; in other words, a Member of Parliament, a priest or a solicitor can be a personal representative. That seems an odd thing.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> It is a fairly conventional question about who can count. The reference to the ``representative'' is in paragraph 7(4)(a), as the hon. Gentleman said.
<P>
The benefit of an August implementation date is that the trade can plan well ahead. It is right to give those who are affected by the increases in duty for some of the more profitable machines the opportunity to plan properly. A person can appeal about any aspect of an assessment, under paragraph 6(2) of new schedule 4A, so there are built-in safeguards. In response to the hon. Gentleman's main question, I can tell him that the default licence covers a whole month even if the period for a licence is less than a month. That mirrors exactly what happens if the operator has paid duty as he should have done; it is impossible to buy a licence for less than a month.

<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> On a point of order, Dr. Clark. I apologise for detaining the Committee, but there is a gap in my copy of the notes on clauses from the end of clause 17 to the middle of clause 30. I have looked at a sample of those copies available, but they appear to have the same problem. I do not know whether other members of the Committee share that gap in knowledge, which limits my ability to understand our proceedings.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> If you will give me one second, Mr. St. Aubyn, I will find out whether you are unique or one of us. It seems that there is a gap in the documents in the Room. Does anyone have notes beyond clause 17? [Hon. Members: ``Yes.''] Someone has. Would it be possible for the hon. Gentleman to look at someone else's documents, so that the Committee may proceed?
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> That is fine, but as the gap will extend to other sittings, can it be rectified before the next sitting?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> It most certainly can, and I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for bringing it to my attention.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> Further to that point of order, Dr. Clark. The document that I obtained from the Vote Office is complete.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> We will come to the conclusion that there are different sets of documents in the Room and do our best to proceed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I was somewhat tentative in dealing with the previous clause, in respect of which I suppose that I should admit, rather late in the day, a potential interest. It may be that someone who operates an amusement machine is or might be a client of my bank or a competitor bank.
<P>
I want to say the same—which is what reminded me—in relation to clause 18. I have no doubt that there is an airline that is or might be a client of my merchant bank or another merchant bank in competition with it.
<P>
I know one airline that will not be happy about the error, which I am pretty sure is not a client of my merchant bank, and one airline that will be extremely happy, which I am fairly sure has been a client of my merchant bank. I do not think that there is any doubt about the fact that an error has been made.
<P>
Clause 18 has the admirable intention that a standard class flight to Belfast, for example, with no business class, let alone first class, should benefit from the reduced rate. That is the clear intent of subsection (5) on page 14—in particular, lines 12 to 15. So far, so good. The problem is that another aeroplane has only one class of travel, which happens to be the most expensive aeroplane in the world—Concorde. Its passengers will be glad to know that they will benefit under the misdrafting from a reduced rate of air passenger duty. I am sure that that is not on purpose, although it would be charming to note that the Government actually intended to provide a special subsidy for Concorde travellers. Clearly, something must be done to the subsection to correct the error, although I am not sure what.
<P>
I have another question about the clause. It is not clear to me when, and in respect of exactly what, the rebated or unrebated amounts apply. I wonder whether that is clear to anyone who will try to use this to operate the system. I say ``when'', because subsection (5) says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>if the passenger's agreement for carriage provides<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
for standard class or premium class travel. [Interruption.] I ignore, as usual, the sedentary interventions, much as they amuse us, by the hon. Member for Nottingham, North (Mr. Allen).
<P>
Is the ``agreement for carriage'' the agreement that is reached with the travel agent when the booking is made? I can see why it might be, because some passengers are upgraded subsequently and involuntarily when they reach the airport. I take it that they are not meant to be caught by the premium rate. Is the agreement what applies in the ticket that is eventually paid for, potentially at the airport by revision, because there are also people who voluntarily upgrade? To which part of the journey does it apply? If I am taking a journey, as many people do on business, the first leg of which is in one class and subsequent legs of which are in another class, which item is the subject of the agreement for carriage—the higher class that attracts the premium or the lower that does not?
<P>
<H5>6.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
It is not particularly important which ways those things are decided, but it is important that they are decided one way or the other. Operations would otherwise be needlessly complex and there would be grounds for fruitless dispute between operators and their customers. Hon. Members regularly receive letters from unfortunate constituents who have been clobbered. It is simply a matter of getting this on a sound footing. I hope that the Government can clarify the intention and move clearly in one way or the other.
<P>
May I enter a plea for the north of England and the very rural areas? This may be of interest to the Liberal Democrat Members in Cornwall. A special provision is made for the remoteness of the Scottish highlands and islands, similar to that in telecommunications legislation. I quite understand that people find themselves stuck and need to travel by air more than the rest of us do, but there are other remote areas and I cannot see why only they should benefit. I can see why a distinction should be drawn between people who live in the far-flung parts of the UK and those who live in London, for example, but this seems a rather bizarrely drawn provision.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bill Tynan </B>(Hamilton, South): The hon. Gentleman will recognise from my accent that I come from Scotland. The Scottish highlands and islands are extremely remote. Their only transport is by air, and that must be taken into account. That is why the Government have taken this decision, which is welcomed in the highlands and islands. I hope that the hon. Gentleman can accept that too.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I do not for a second doubt that people in the highlands and islands are dependent on air transport. I do not seek to deny them the exemption. It is perfectly reasonable for them to have it. As a long-time occupant of a place in Mull, I have not been dependent—
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We may be drifting into clause 19 here.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I apologise. I was indeed drifting into that clause, which is connected, but separate. I will withdraw my remarks until we reach it.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> It is nice to find an hon. Member who agrees that he was out of order. I thank the hon. Gentleman. I feel very reassured.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> My hon. Friend anticipated a point that I was going to make. I have heard that some airlines were moving to an all-business class arrangement. I had not got as far as the luxury of Concorde as I have yet to travel on that remarkable aircraft. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset that passengers in a higher quality form of business class travel will benefit from this arrangement. I want to probe the Minister on subsection (4) and look specifically at the word ``journey''. My hon. Friend tiptoed up to this when he pointed out that, with many hub-and-spoke arrangements in the airline business, people fly economy from London to a European point, where they then embark on a longer distance journey.
<P>
I am not clear whether the clause applies if the passenger agreement, which I presume is the ticket, is sold in two parts. Subsection (4) refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>every flight on his journey.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If someone undertook a complex bit of business or pleasure flying and travelled in different classes during the journey, how would the provision apply? Does he simply put his expensive ticket in his pocket, declare that the journey is from the United Kingdom to the European point of embarkation and keep quiet? Or does he declare his hand and then discover that there is a penalty clause? I would like clarification of what ``journey'' covers. The Committee should also have clarification on the point—which I endorse—made by my hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset about a single, higher class aircraft.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> Like the previous one, this is a measure that the Committee can enthusiastically welcome. Air passenger duty was introduced by the previous Government in a way that conflicts with European law. It provided an exemption for return flights within the UK but not within the EU; the return leg exemption therefore had to be abolished. We have done so in a way that halves the rate of air passenger duty on single economy flights anywhere within the EU, so there are real benefits—particularly, as my hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton, South (Mr. Tynan) pointed out, for the residents of the highlands and islands. We will come to that in a moment.
<P>
Any aeroplane in which all the passengers are in a single class—which is, I understand, the case with Concorde—would benefit from the lower rate. That is a feature of the way in which we have framed the clause. If hon. Members wish to table an amendment to increase the duty on those passengers, they are entitled to do so. We have achieved a simple, straightforward measure that has huge benefits for large numbers of people travelling economy within the UK and around Europe and, as a spin-off, for the much smaller—indeed, very small—number of people who fly by Concorde.
<P>
I was asked about the term ``agreement for carriage''. The duty liability lies with the airline and arises from when the aircraft takes off. It is determined by the agreement for carriage at the time. An upgrade prior to departure would spark the higher liability, but it is up to airlines to decide whether they wish to absorb that cost or pass it on to the customer.

<P>

<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I am astonished by the Financial Secretary's remarks and, on behalf of Concorde travellers everywhere, thank him from the bottom of my heart. I shall renew my enthusiasm for travelling on that aeroplane. However, I am not so pleased on behalf of those who are involuntarily upgraded, although the airlines will presumably absorb the cost to avoid civil litigation. I hope that the Financial Secretary has hired staff to deal with complaints from those who find themselves paying the extra £20 when they are upgraded or who consequently ask not to be upgraded. If he is happy to subsidise Concorde passengers and pay for the staff to deal with complaints, I suppose that it is hardly worth asking my hon. Friends to vote against a clause that is otherwise innocuous and, indeed, beneficial.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> I press the Financial Secretary for an answer to my question about the definition of ``journey''. He has very helpfully said that the liability lies with the airline for the payment of the tax, but that it depends on what the airline declares as the journey. I see the Financial Secretary nodding; he may have an answer.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I apologise to the right hon. Gentleman. I should have responded to his point, which is dealt with by subsections (4) and (5); they make it clear that if someone takes one flight in a series of flights that does not qualify for the reduced rate, the higher rate applies.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I, too, had forgotten the point made by my hon Friend, which was connected to one that I made earlier. The Financial Secretary should reflect on the matter. Surely the Government do not intend to provide a nightmare incentive. I might book with several airlines, and, because I am travelling economy class, use the first airline for the first leg, but not subsequent legs. That would create a disincentive to book a business flight with, for example, British Airways. I admit that the incentive is minor, but it is wrong. Surely the right focus for the clause is on the first journey and on the plane that takes off from United Kingdom airports. I cannot see why the Financial Secretary should want to create a minor legal nightmare.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howard Flight </B>(Arundel and South Downs): I was about to make the same point. In simple language, if the clause is interpreted as described, everyone will get a BA flight to Amsterdam and then a KLM flight to destinations all over the world. The first definition that the Financial Secretary used was that of the airline that provides the flight from the UK. That could be interpreted as relating simply to the first flight out of the UK. If the same airline provides a further flight from Amsterdam to Hong Kong, that would be nothing to do with the UK.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I do not think that the clause creates a legal nightmare. The journey referred to is the whole trip. Therefore, the ultimate destination determines the liability. If, as the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs (Mr. Flight) suggested, the flight—if he will pardon the expression—is via the EU to a third country, and the tickets are connected; that is the liability. We do not intend that, by taking an economy shuttle flight from Manchester to Heathrow or Amsterdam, higher duty on the onward flight will be avoided. Furthermore, that is not the effect of the clause. I do not recognise the problem that is described. The assessment will be made when the ticket is purchased, and the appropriate rate of duty applied.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> Will the Financial Secretary assure the Committee that detailed guidance will be provided to airlines for the avoidance of doubt when passengers ask such questions?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> There will, of course, be extensive discussions with the airlines, and many have already taken place. The airlines have been extremely enthusiastic about the Government's resolution of the problem of having to abolish the return leg exemption. That is true of cut-price airlines—easyJet, for example, wrote to me to welcome what we have done for charter airlines, and the larger airlines, too. We will, of course, do everything that is necessary to make it clear, to everyone affected, how to proceed.
