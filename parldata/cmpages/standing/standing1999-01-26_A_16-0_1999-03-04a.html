<H4><center>(Except clauses 1, 2, 3 and 4 and schedules 1 and 2)</center></H4>
<P>
<H5>2.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I sense that this will be an afternoon and early evening of rapid progress--mainly to enable me to attend the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association 40th parliamentary seminar reception at 10 Downing street. I say that merely to put down a marker for the Committee. If members of the Committee want to catch my eye after today, they will bear that in mind. [Laughter.] I was not looking at Liberal Democrat members of the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Richard Ottaway </B>(Croydon, South: On a point of order, Mr. Winterton. As you are aware, next Tuesday, we will probably reach two important clauses--clauses 200 and 201--on congestion taxes and parking levies.
<P>
Shortly after the general election, in August 1997, the Minister for Transport in London issued a press release welcoming the start of the Leicester experiment, which is highly relevant to congestion charging. In fact, that experiment was under way before the general election, and was kicked off by the Conservative party. Nevertheless, the Minister rightly continued with the programme. In the press release, the Minister said that the scheme was the first in the country, and that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"we need to examine the pros and cons very carefully before reaching any decisions."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am sure that the whole Committee would agree with that.
<P>
As you will be well aware, Mr. Winterton, in July last year the Government published their White Paper on transport, which rightly referred to the Leicester environmental road tolling scheme. The White Paper states that the report on the trial
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"is due to be published in September 1998."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am sure that we would all like the report to be published. Unfortunately, from my inquiries at the Vote Office, it appears that that has not yet happened.
<P>
In view of the fact that the Minister believes that we should examine the outcome of that experiment before introducing road charging, I hope that you will encourage the Minister to publish the report before next Tuesday, or to adjourn the Committee until, say, Thursday to allow the Government time to publish the report, so that we can act on the Minister's advice.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I have to say to the hon. Member for Croydon, South (Mr. Ottaway) that, although he raises an important point, it is not a point for the Chair. I am sure that Ministers will have heard what the hon. Gentleman has said and may care to respond--although I hope that the matter can be dealt with briefly--as it is not a point for the Chair.
<P>
<B>The Minister for Transport in London (Ms Glenda Jackson):</B> I shall of course make inquiries as to when Leicester intends to publish the report, and whether there is yet a finite date. However, the amendments that we hope to discuss in Committee next week relate to enabling powers. The experiment being conducted in Leicester will not be the only source of information available to the mayor--and to all the mayoral candidates before the election.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes </B>(Southwark, North and Bermondsey) rose--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Is it on the same point of order?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> No, a different one.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I shall first let Mr. Ottaway raise another point of order.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> This is a far more serious point of order, Mr. Winterton, and is certainly a matter for you as the Committee Chairman. As you know, we had an extensive debate about the financing of London Underground and the introduction of the public-private partnership. We all listened carefully to what the Minister had to say in that debate, and voted accordingly in line with the Minister's advice. I do not know whether you have had a chance to read the lead story in the Financial Times today. I will not go into detail, but it is about the financing of London Underground. It states that the Deputy Prime Minister was "irritated" by the Minister's mistake and that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"officials close to him suggested the junior minister appeared to have 'misled' the Committee."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
So the Deputy Prime Minister's office said that the Minister had "misled" the Committee. I am sure that you take seriously the possibility that members of the Committee were misled before deciding how to cast their votes on the public-private partnership. I am sure that the Minister would not intentionally mislead the Committee, and I make no allegations. The Government are, however, clearly in some disarray over the proposal. I would be grateful if you could give us the benefit of your views on the matter, Mr. Winterton.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I will seek to help the hon. Gentleman and the Committee. Strictly, the Deputy Prime Minister's quote from the Financial Times is not a matter for me. If the Minister has misled the Committee in any way--I have no evidence that she has--I am sure that she will seek an early opportunity to correct any mistake or any wrong information that she provided. I cannot say more than that. Does the Minister want to respond?
<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> Thank you, Mr. Winterton. I also thank the hon. Member for Croydon, South for his detailed perusal of the official record and for alerting the Financial Times, which then alerted me, to the fact that I may have inadvertently misled the Committee on the fares assumptions used in the financial modelling for the PPP.
<P>
I take this opportunity to apologise to members of the Committee if I have, indeed, inadvertently misled them. I have written to you, Mr. Winterton, to all other Chairs of the Committee and to every member of the Committee, and I will lay a copy of the letter in the Library. Perhaps it would be in order for me briefly to touch on what will be in it.
<P>
The issue arose from exchanges on the modelling with regard to the PPP and the assumptions about the fares part of such modelling. Our modelling is not based on unreasonable assumptions or conservative goals. It assumes that fares will increase by 1 per cent. more than the retail prices index in the years 2000 and 2001. From that period to the end, the assumption for the modelling was that it will be RPI plus nought. Those are modest, reasonable assumptions, in marked contrast to the real fares that Londoners experienced in the decade from 1987 to 1997 under the previous Administration, which rose by 38 per cent. in real terms.
<P>
As I said, I have written to every member of the Committee and to you and your fellow Chairs, Mr. Winterton. A copy of that letter will be laid in the Library. I apologise unreservedly if I did indeed inadvertently mislead the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> Further to that point of order, Mr. Winterton. That has compounded the confusion. I thought that the Minister was going to say that she had taken advice and that she was right and the Deputy Prime Minister was wrong. What she told the Committee was exactly what London Underground advised the Environment, Transport and Regional Affairs Select Committee in that report that it published in July last year. We assumed that that advice and the Minister were right and that the Deputy Prime Minister's office was wrong. It now seems that the Government, through London Underground, have misled not only this Committee but the Transport Select Committee in its report on London Underground. I hope that the Minister will publish a letter to explain why London Underground misled the Select Committee and to sort out that problem, too.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am concerned only with what goes on in this Committee. I am grateful to the Minister for the totally acceptable apology that she gave and for the fact that she will provide a letter of full explanation not only to me and my fellow Chairmen, but to all other members of the Committee. As far as I am concerned, that is an end to that point of order.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> Further to a point of order that I raised at a previous sitting and to which you were kind enough to respond, Mr. Winterton. I want to pursue a related development on the late tabling of amendments. Today, for the first time, a set of amendments to clause 201 appears on the amendment paper. More particularly, there is also a new schedule that is starred--indicating that it was tabled last night--and which runs to more than 10 pages. In fact, the new schedules that are now being tabled late are so long that, for the first time that I can recall, their lines have been helpfully numbered by the printer, for which we are very grateful. In itself, that is probably only a continuation of the Government's earlier discourtesy.
<P>
There was no prior indication of the new schedule other than in the Minister's letter, which is dated today and which can therefore have been sent only today. It was sent to you, Mr. Winterton, and a copy was sent to us. The new schedule must be debated on Tuesday, so for any amendments to be in order, they must be tabled tomorrow by the rise of the House at 3 pm or thereabouts.
<P>
The reason why this is particularly discourteous and why I prevail on you, Mr. Winterton, to see if anything can be done--if you would be kind enough to consider it, it might require you to reconvene the Business Sub-Committee--is because the hon. Member for Croydon, South, his Whip and I agreed to a change in the marker post under your chairmanship on the assumption that we had the Bill and amendments before us. But next Tuesday--when we are able to debate only this part of the Bill in the morning sitting, from 10.30 am to 1 pm, and in the afternoon sitting, which we have now agreed will start only at 5.30 pm and must finish at 6.50 pm because that is when the marker comes into effect--we now have to consider two entirely new Government schedules, each of 10 pages plus, and amendments, and any amendments that the hon. Member for Croydon, South and his colleagues and I and my colleagues might want to table.
<P>
The new schedules concern two exceptionally important matters--road user charging and workplace parking levies, They will be the only parts of the Bill dealing with the tax-raising powers that will be given to the GLA, which were heralded by the Prime Minister in his speech to the Labour conference last year and which are new types of taxes. As it happens, my hon. Friends and I have tabled a third proposal, so there are three proposals relating to that new taxation.
<P>
It is entirely unreasonable that when we were asked to agree to a proposal to change the milepost, unless I am incorrectly informed neither the hon. Member for Croydon, South nor his Whip nor our Whip nor I were told that we were agreeing to a timetable but that substantial new schedules--longer than anything we have seen before--were still to be put before us. It happens to be Budget day on Tuesday and I am slightly suspicious that the Government are seeking to do this so that there will be the least possible opportunity to debate these matters, whatever our views. Will you therefore consider reconvening the Business Sub-Committee, Mr. Winterton, possibly on Monday? I do not want to interfere with the event of later today, but I am happy to appear on Monday under your chairmanship.
<P>
Furthermore, on the Floor of the House in business questions about an hour ago, the Parliamentary Secretary, Privy Council Office, who was deputising for the Leader of the House, gave a conciliatory response to a point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for North Cornwall (Mr. Tyler) and the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Brooke) He said that the office of the Leader of the House had been alerted to the fact that there were problems in this Committee as a result of this issue--I paraphrase--and that it would see what could be done.
<P>
I hope that you will feel it possible to do one of the things that can be done, Mr. Winterton, but it would be helpful if Ministers indicated that they too now accepted that the additional time needed to do justice to the new proposals should be granted and that they agreed, under your chairmanship, to the provision of more time to debate them after 6.50 pm on Tuesday evening.

<P>

<B>Mr. Peter Brooke </B>(Cities of London and Westminster): Further to that point of order, Mr. Winterton. The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey (Mr. Hughes) correctly reported what happened on the Floor of the House, although I do not think any Government Members were present for business questions. There is no obligation for them to be there. [Interruption.] I am talking not about Ministers, but about Labour members of the Committee.
<P>
<H5>2.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I shall not rehearse again what I said on the Floor of the House, as the hon. Gentleman has outlined it accurately. However, I shall repeat one sentence that was not in the form of a question to the Deputy Leader of the House. This has been a good-natured Committee, but the Government have not been as forthcoming as they might have been--I have tried to press them for answers--about why we are being subjected to this regime, when they had more than enough time in advance of the Bill's publication. This is not the first time that this has happened--it has happened again and again.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I shall seek to help the Committee. First, the matter is not one of procedure for the Chair, so long as new schedules, new clauses and amendments are tabled in adequate time. I can only say that I hope that the Ministers responsible for the Bill appreciate the problems faced by Opposition parties when such major new schedules and new clauses are, on a regular basis, drawn to our attention and become part of our debate. Before I make a final ruling on the matter, I am sure that the Minister for London and Construction would like to comment.
<P>
<B>The Minister for London and Construction (Mr. Nick Raynsford):</B> Further to that point of order, Mr. Winterton. The hon. member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey spent a large part of the early stages of the Committee's proceedings criticising the Government for including in the legislation powers to allow the Secretary of State to make regulations rather than placing detailed provisions in the Bill. I put it to him that the clauses that are to be replaced, clauses 200 and 201, together with schedules 13 and 14, are precisely of that nature. It was with a view to providing the Committee with an opportunity for a full debate on the substance of the congestion charging and non-residential parking charging regimes that the amendments have been brought forward.
<P>
The new schedule to replace schedule 13 was tabled on Tuesday evening and the new schedule to replace schedule 14 on Wednesday evening, with a view to giving members of the Committee the maximum time possible to consider them before they are debated next Tuesday. I accept that these are complex, detailed provisions, but the aim was to allow the Committee more opportunity for consideration than would have been afforded simply by the retention of the two existing clauses that give the Secretary of State power to devise a scheme by regulation.
<P>
The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey made a point about the Business Sub-Committee and the timetable. The timetable has not been amended in a way to reduce the time available for consideration. The milestone was put back by one sitting, specifically to accommodate the fact that we had lost a sitting when the House was in recess. So there is no loss of time for debate.
<P>
The provisions have already been debated in principle at considerable length on Second Reading and in other forums. I hope that there will be ample opportunity for discussion of the detailed provisions in the new schedules on Tuesday.
<P>
I say to the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster that we regret that pressures have been placed on members of the Committee to absorb and consider detailed amendments tabled approximately a week before they are due to be debated. We understand his concerns. We are seeking to minimise any further inconvenience of that nature. I hope that he will accept, for the reasons that I have outlined, that in this case we believed that it was right that the Committee should have a greater opportunity to consider the details of the scheme than would have been the case if we had simply allowed the two existing clauses to stand.
<P>
I apologise if no Government Member was present at business questions when the right hon. Gentleman raised this. Had we received notice that the issue would be raised, I certainly would have been only too pleased to have been present, but I did not receive any such notice. I am not sure whether that was a mistake or not.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I am not sure if I can give way during a point of order, Mr. Winterton.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The right hon. Gentleman cannot give way, but he can certainly rise again. The Minister has sat down, so it will not be an intervention. The right hon. Gentleman may now speak further to the point of order.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> Further to that point of order, Mr. Winterton. I did not intend any discourtesy to the Government Front Bench. I was on my way out of the Chamber to answer a green card that had been sent in for me, when I heard the Liberal Democrat Chief Whip refer to the Greater London Authority Bill. I thought that it would be sensible and, indeed, courteous to the Liberal Democrat Chief Whip to go back into the Chamber, and I intervened pursuant to his intervention.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I call the Minister to respond.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I am most grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for that clarification. I accept entirely that he intended no discourtesy at all: neither did we. I reiterate that we received no advance notice that the matter was going to be raised by the hon. Member for North Cornwall during business questions, so we were not able to be present to respond. No discourtesy was intended either to the House or the Committee. I hope that you will accept, Mr. Winterton, that within the constraints, which we realise have created some pressures and difficulties, we are endeavouring to ensure the fullest scrutiny of the Bill by the Committee. We will minimise the occasions on which additional new clauses and new schedules need to be tabled to replace existing provisions in the Bill--that is, after those that will be discussed on Tuesday.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> Further to that point of order, Mr. Winterton. First, Liberal Democrat Members did not intend to suggest that either the Minister or his colleagues had been discourteous in relation to the House's earlier business. It was a matter between the business managers of the parties concerned and was dealt with on that basis.
<P>
Secondly, our criticism is not that the Government have replaced Secretary of State clauses with more detailed clauses, but that when it is known that more provisions are coming, they have come literally with only one clear day's notice. The Committee should not have to deal with that.
<P>
Lastly, the movement of the marker post to Tuesday was unrelated to that matter. My point to you, Mr. Winterton, was that, given that when we met it might have been in the Government's mind that the marker post would be reached after significantly more propositions were before the Committee, the Committee could at least have considered the issue. Had we known that, I would have sought to put it further back to give us more time. I cannot speak for the hon. Member for Croydon, South, but I guess that he would have done so too. For the Minister to suggest that tabling the proposals now gives us sufficient time to debate three new taxes is ludicrous. Two and a half hours in the morning and one hour 20 minutes in the afternoon cannot be sufficient time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tony McNulty </B>(Harrow, East): The hon. Gentleman has wasted 20 minutes already.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> It is not a waste of time because we cannot, by agreement, start until Tuesday. I therefore repeat my request, Mr. Winterton. Would you be good enough to convene the Business Sub-Committee at a time convenient to you in the new week? Perhaps we could thereby arrive at a timetable that allows matters to be properly debated.
<P>
<B>Sir Sydney Chapman </B>(Chipping Barnet): Further to that point of order, Mr. Winterton. You mentioned that you have an important engagement at No. 10 later of the clock today. The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey suggested that the Business Sub-Committee should convene to discuss the possibility of the Committee sitting until later than 6.50 pm on Tuesday. I have an even more important commitment on Tuesday evening--dining with Madam Speaker and meeting a Minister from Latvia. In land-locked Chipping Barnet, we regard relations with Latvia as being of the utmost importance. Will you use your good offices, Mr. Winterton, to ensure that the Committee meets for a longer time on Thursday rather than until late on Tuesday?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I think that that could be described as the cherry on the cake of the point of order, but I shall not reply directly to the hon. Gentleman's question.
<P>
The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey has raised an important issue and I am conscious of the many new clauses, new schedules and amendments that the Government have submitted. I must make a ruling according to precedent. The Government have not breached any procedure of the Committee. I hope, however, that the Ministers heard the genuine complaints and concerns expressed by Opposition Members.
<P>
I should say that I am prepared to consider reconvening the Business Sub-Committee. Perhaps the appropriate members of that Sub-Committee could gather informally at the end of this sitting to discuss how we might precede and whether it is necessary to reconvene. I hope that that suggestion is acceptable to the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey and the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I am grateful to you for that offer, Mr. Winterton.
<H4><center>Clause 180</center></H4>
<H4><center>Orders by the Authority changing what are GLA roads</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paul Burstow </B>(Sutton and Cheam): I have just one Question about the clause. I hope that asking it will help me to understand how the clause will relate to section 14 of the Highways Act 1980, to which it will be added. That section has a provision for parties to make contributions to the costs arising from a transfer of responsibility for roads.
<P>
The provisions in the clause provide for consent regarding such a transfer of responsibility. I want to be clear about whether that consent will include the possibility of financial contributions and whether it will ensure that no party will be made worse off as a consequence of such transfers?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The hon. Gentleman raises a valid point about the financial arrangements. They will be dealt with separately under the normal procedures of local government finance. The clause will allow for transfers of responsibility between the GLA and a borough and vice versa.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman knows that the mechanism initially involves discussion between the parties. If they cannot reach agreement, the matter will be referred to the Secretary of State who will take the final decision. However, the financial arrangements will have to be taken separately under the normal local government finance provisions.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 180 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Clauses 181 and 182 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Progress is being made.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> on a point of order, Mr. Winterton. We are very happy, but had not realised that your reception would begin so early.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that observation, to which I do not need to reply.
<P>
Clause 183 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 184</center></H4>
<H4><center>Transport for London to be the traffic authority for GLA roads</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I am sorry to have broken the pace at which we were moving. However, the clause concerns road traffic, and I slow us down a little so that we might consider it further. I should like to understand its implications for the priority red route network. Will this and other clauses in this chapter allow the mayor, should he or she think it fit, to bring an end to the red route network in Greater London? My understanding is that they will.
<P>
There remains considerable concern across London that, although parts of our capital might benefit from the introduction of red routes, some localities--particularly but not exclusively in outer London--suffer adverse consequences in terms of the viability of high streets and other shopping areas through which the red routes pass.
<P>
I draw to the Committee's attention the study by the Traffic Director for London which was published a few months ago and examines the economic effects of red routes. The study deals with vacancy rates and commercial buoyancy.
<P>
The best that the report could say about red routes is that they had a negligible effect on trading. However, it acknowledged that red routes had been implemented in the context of improved trade in many retail areas, although I must add that improved trading conditions are not being experienced by many smaller retailers in my constituency.
<H4><center>3 pm</center></H4>
<P>
The report found that it was hard to gauge the effect of red routes on vacancy rates, because of improved trading conditions. However, vacancy rates at shopping centres where red routes had been introduced were marginally higher than at centres where they had not been introduced. That is a cause for concern that needs to be examined in the context of these provisions.
<P>
Similarly, the report said that it was hard to gauge whether the commercial buoyancy of the market and the optimism of traders were rising or falling. There had been no change in the number of businesses that described themselves as deflated over the past three years. It continued by saying that where red routes had not been implemented, there was increased optimism about trading prospects.
<P>
Will the clause give the mayor the ability to decide that red routes are not working and that they should be changed either in their entirety or in terms of the goals that they are meant to achieve? Alternatively, is that power to be retained by the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I am not sure at which point I should raise this matter; now seems as good a time as any.
<P>
What will happen to the post of Traffic Director for London and where will it fit in? Is it part of the London traffic control system? [Interruption.] The Minister is indicating that he will answer those questions. Depending on what he is about to tell me, I may wish to catch your eye again, Mr. Winterton.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I hope that I can help both the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam (Mr. Burstow) and the hon. Member for Croydon, South.
<P>
The clause provides for Transport for London to become the traffic authority for the Greater London authority road network. It will take over responsibility for all the red routes in London, which are currently the responsibility of the traffic director--a post referred to by the hon. Member for Croydon, South. The Bill provides for the traffic director's post and role to be absorbed within the structure of TfL.
<P>
The current traffic director's appointment expires in May 1999 and therefore a transitional provision will be needed to ensure continuity until the GLA takes over. When it does, it will assume responsibility for the operation of red routes, and policy decisions about their future will be made by the mayor and the assembly.
<P>
I suggest to the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam that considerable benefits have flowed from the red route programme, especially in speeding up public transport and reducing journey times. That must be of benefit. Indeed, the hon. Gentleman inadvertently highlighted the issue of the speed of transport by referring to the speed with which we have dealt with the previous few clauses.
<P>
If we wish to improve public transport, the red route network is one measure to consider. That will be a matter for the mayor, and I am sure that it will be given high priority.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> My hon. Friend the Member for Sutton and Cheam and I are grateful for that answer. Will the Minister tell us, either now or later, whether on the evidence so far, which was alluded to by my hon. Friend, those who trade along red routes--I am thinking of parades of shops--are satisfied with the arrangements that have been made for them? For those of us who have red routes coming to our constituencies, of whom I am one, the issue is that it should be possible to pick up and drop off--people should be able to stop briefly to buy their newspaper, cigarettes or whatever. Businesses will depend on that facility; otherwise, they will not survive.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The hon. Gentleman raises points similar to those that he raised during our previous sitting, when he got himself branded the fare-dodgers' friend by citing a number of excuses for not having paid a fare. Unfortunately, as he will know only too well, the easiest excuse in the book to offer for a car being parked on a red route, or in an otherwise restricted place, is that the driver got out simply for a short visit to buy a packet of cigarettes, or for some other entirely undesirable objective.
The hon. Gentleman will know that there has been a great deal of discussion on that issue, because it is of real concern to traders along red routes. The matter has probably received more time, public debate and consultation than has any other aspect of the red route network, despite the fact that the network is designed to speed up public transport and ease congestion on some key roads that are vital to London's operation.
<P>
I can give the hon. Gentleman that undertaking that he obviously wants: the mayor will be visibly responsible for the matter, so for traders who are concerned about the impact on their business of the red route network--responsibility for which will transfer to the GLA--the mayor will be an obvious target for their representations. The mayor will want to respond to such representations, as to others on relevant traffic issues.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> One last factual question. For the red routes that the mayor and the authority inherit, what is the earliest date--if there is one--at which they can be reconsidered by the new authority?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The formal answer to that must be 3 July 2000. In reality, as the hon. Gentleman will recognise, it will take some time after the mayor formally takes powers to begin to define the new integrated transport strategy, in which red routes and policy in relation to red route objectives will play a role.
<P>
I cannot give a precise date, but formally the mayor will be able to take decisions from 3 July 2000. Representations currently made about the red routes to the traffic director--who, I know, is assiduous in responding to them--will from that date be directed to the mayor.
<P>
<B>Mr. McNulty rose--</B><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman wish to intervene on the Minister?
<P>
<B>Mr. McNulty:</B> No, Mr. Winterton. I want to speak afterwards.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I call Mr. Ottaway.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> Will the Minister explain the mechanics for the absorption of the Traffic Director for London? Is the traffic director currently part of London Regional Transport? If so, can the Minister point out to me the place in the Bill where it is explained how he is to be absorbed?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> We shall later this afternoon reach clause 199. At that point, I will be happy to give the hon. Gentleman detailed chapter and verse to explain how the traffic director will be absorbed into the new framework of Transport for London.
<P>
<B>Mr. McNulty:</B> I suspected that I would speak at slightly too great a length for an intervention; none the less, I shall be brief.
<P>
My hon. Friend knows that I am not a naturally suspicious or cynical person, but if he looks at the map of the GLA network, he will see that, uniquely, the London borough of Harrow has no roads that form part of that network. I hope that in deliberations of the new body once it is established, it is made clear to Transport for London, as the body responsible for the GLA road network, that it leaves Harrow out of its consideration at its peril. What it does to Barnet, Brent and Hillingdon roads that form part of the network will have a serious impact on Harrow. I would like that to be borne in mind.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I am taking advantage of the speech made by the hon. Member for Harrow, East (Mr. McNulty) who alluded to the fact that there are no GLA roads in his constituency. I mean no disrespect to you, Mr. Winterton, or to my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South, but I was caught slightly short by the pace at which you moved through clauses 180 to 183 and by the fact that my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South did not move the amendments to clause 183. I make no complaint about that--he is entirely entitled to take that course. I did, however, have some consequential questions on clause 183, which related to roads that are not GLA roads. Through you, Mr. Winterton, I advise the Minister that I will put those questions in writing. It would be helpful if all members of the Committee could receive a copy of the answers.

<P>

<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> Members of the Committee are right to have reservations about the red route. They will know that the Traffic Director for London started the red route in outer London and has been working his way in. Hon. Members from the borough of Sutton will know exactly what I am going to say about that--the effect on local retailers has been devastating. All that I can say to hon. Members with inner London seats is that they have a battle royal to come.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> If my hon. Friend imagines that we have not had a battle royal already, he is unfamiliar with central London.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> Being a constituent of my right hon. Friend, I know what he means. We have yet to see the full force of local retailers because they have not yet fully appreciated the impact of the red route.
<P>
To anticipate the Minister, he will say that a Conservative Government introduced the relevant legislation and the regulations. However, it is the interpretation of the regulations that is causing the problem. I have no trouble with the regulations. They are based on about 15 criteria, which are listed in alphabetical order. Second from the bottom is the improvement of pedestrian facilities. The present incumbent of the post of Traffic Director for London is a helpful, courteous man. In his mind, however, he has moved that criterion to the top of the list. There is an absolute obsession in parts of Croydon and up the A23--a road up which I drive regularly--with pedestrian crossings. They are entirely unnecessary and largely unused, but they have altered the phasing of traffic signals quite considerably to the detriment of the traffic.
<P>
Ministers will know, because they have answered a question on this issue in the past few days, that traffic speeds in central London have slowed from about 11. 5 mph to 10 mph. They will also be aware that traffic volumes in central London are not increasing, but are virtually static; the growth is in outer London. The only reason that I can give for that slowdown and the increased congestion in central London is the introduction of traffic-calming measures such as reducing three lanes to one and the obsessive use of pedestrian crossings.
<P>
I hope that the mayor will take those points on board. If we want to get traffic moving in London--I am sure that we all do--attacking the motorist by physically slowing him down is not the right way to go about it, as I said on Second Reading.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for the explanation that he gave earlier. It will be useful for the GLA to be able to undertake a review once the network is in place. I understand from the annual report for 1997-98 by the Traffic Director for London that the network is due to be completed by 2000. Colleagues who have not yet experienced the joys of representations from retailers and traders will shortly do so.
<P>
It is important that there is a reassessment of the goals and objectives of red routes so that they are better attuned to achieving the objective that the Minister described of enabling public transport to move quickly. However, it is not necessarily the case that we would support the objective of allowing everything to move more quickly. Indeed, the red routes are not achieving the notable policy goal of encouraging people out of private motor cars and into public transport because they facilitate ease of movement for all vehicles. We want resources and priorities to be concentrated far more on the movement of buses and other public transport. In that respect, the debate has been useful. It has clarified the fact that the mayor and TfL will be able to deal with the matter. We look forward to that happening in due course.
<P>
<H5>3.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> On a constituency matter, the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, the hon. Member for Vauxhall (Kate Hoey) and I, and possibly the hon. Member for Poplar and Canning Town (Mr. Fitzpatrick), share the most proposed red routes in our constituencies. According to the map, there are five in my constituency alone, let alone those in the rest of the borough of Southwark.
<P>
I, too, am very happy about the responsive way in which the traffic director has so far responded to the traders' points. If the inner-city areas that are affected by large roads with heavy volumes of traffic--in my constituency they include the A2, the A3, the A200 and the A100--are to be able to reconcile the through traffic going perfectly properly from London to Dover, France or anywhere else and the businesses that have been within them for a long time with pretty marginal levels of profitability, it is crucial that all such areas have the means of some short-term parking for loading and unloading so that trading can continue.
<P>
I want to register that. It has generally been the response of the traffic director. Little markets, little shopping centres and small parades of shops serving large numbers of people will not be able to survive and fight against out-of-town or larger supermarkets and hypermarkets if red routes do not always remain compatible, irrespective of the wider macro-issues to which my hon. Friend the Member for Sutton and Cheam referred.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> We have had an interesting and relatively wide-ranging debate on the clause. I shall respond to a couple of points that were made on red routes and the role of the traffic director.
<P>
I should make it clear to the hon. Member for Croydon, South that red routes did not originate in outer London. To the best of my knowledge, the first red route was the Archway route, which is in inner London. There have been red routes in inner London as well as outer London from the outset.
<P>
The hon. Members for Sutton and Cheam and for Southwark, North and Bermondsey raised the concerns of retailers. Clearly, there is real tension between retailers' concerns and the need to achieve a more efficient framework for public transport and to improve provision for cyclists, pedestrians and others who often have a raw deal under existing provisions. On big routes with heavy traffic, their interests are not often adequately reflected. I would point out to the hon. Member for Croydon, South that there is a balance to be struck between the interests of pedestrians and the interests of those who want traffic to move more swiftly along the roads.
<P>
The current traffic director, Mr. Derek Turner, has filled his post with considerable distinction. He has been very effective and extremely courteous. As I said earlier, he has responded assiduously to queries and questions from all sides and the Government's decision to abolish his post has nothing to do with his performance. We simply believe it appropriate for his functions to be part of the Greater London authority--specifically, Transport for London--which can take a more integrated view than is possible under the current framework, whereby the traffic director's responsibilities are discharged entirely separately from the approach of London Transport. That is why clause 199 abolishes the post of traffic director. It is in no way a reflection on Derek Turner's performance in post, which has won plaudits and admiration from hon. Members on both sides of the House of Commons and from many people elsewhere.
<P>
I hope that the Committee will support clause 184.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I have a constituency point. I welcome a clause that gives the power to place traffic signs in connection with GLA roads, but I want to know whether someone can make someone else put signs up where they do not currently exist.
The A2 goes from London Bridge to Dover. As one drives down it through my constituency towards the Bricklayers Arms--
<P>
<B>Mr. Jim Dowd </B>(Lord Commissioner to the Treasury): As quickly as possible.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> One would be enjoying the views, the company and the night spots. There has often been no road sign at all. The practical problem is that lorry drivers going down to the channel ports are mixed with foreign motorists who are getting lost because they have never been here before. Sometimes that is dangerous in terms of turn-offs. Approaching the Bricklayers Arms roundabout and flyover, one suddenly has to decide which turning to take. If one does not decide quickly enough, one finds oneself stuck in the middle of the zig-zag.
<P>
Non-existent, defaced or broken signs are common, as are signs that start one off on a journey from A to B indicating where B is and then, two roads further along, stop doing so. In urban areas, especially where there are one-way systems, that does not help anybody--people end up going down back streets, people in side roads encounter lorries turning into them and so on.
<P>
We should ensure that there is a mechanism by which members of the public, local authorities or transport user groups can trigger the provision of sufficient signs, so that all roads--at least main roads, trunk roads, red routes and main local authority roads--give an indication of where they are going. There should be a consistency of signage that takes people from the middle of London to its edge, and from the edge to the middle, without them going exactly where they did not want to go in between.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey has made most of the points that I wished to make. There is a case for a fundamental review of London's road signs. They are not bad, but they are far from perfect, and we always strive for perfection in our capital city. Can the Minister confirm that the mayor and his advisers will be able to conduct a wide-ranging review of the signage in London?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I hope that I can help the hon. Members for Southwark, North and Bermondsey and for Croydon, South. I am not sure that I can resolve all the problems of the people who are lost in Southwark--that may be due to factors other than road signs.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> Desirable factors.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I think that there may soon be a debate between the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster and the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey as to which constituency contains the largest number of houses of ill repute.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> They are all in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey).
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Does this form part of the Bill?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> It is in the cultural section.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I was referring, Mr. Winterton, to people losing their way.
<P>
In answer to the serious questions that the hon. Gentlemen posed, the clause provides an important power that will enable the Greater London authority and Transport for London to conduct the review of signage on the main GLA routes in London that both hon. Gentlemen seek. The powers will relate to GLA routes but, as the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey pointed out, there is sometimes a need for signs to be pointed off the major routes in order to guide people to the main GLA routes. That is precisely what is provided for by clause 185.
<P>
The Highways Agency is currently engaged in a re-signing programme on primary routes. Such initiatives will be inherited by the mayor when he takes over. The mayor will have the discretion to make changes, within reason--we do not want a completely separate style of sign in London, nor do we want the mayor putting up signs with slogans supporting himself or herself. It would not be appropriate for all London's road signs to proclaim, "The mayor is great."
<P>
Clause 185 gives TfL the scope to effect significant change and improvement in signage for the main GLA roads in London. I hope that members of the Committee agree that the clause should stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I have one more quick question. I am grateful that there is a power to ensure that there are signs, but will the Minister tell us if there is any duty to provide signs? If not, will he consider, if all parties agree, tabling a short amendment at a later stage to provide for a duty as well as a power?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I am in some difficulty. I was chastised earlier for the number of amendments that have been laid before the Committee. I do not think that I should encourage too many more, but if the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey will write to my hon. Friend the Minister for Transport in London, we shall give consideration to his thoughts on the subject. I hope that the clause may now stand part.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> On an even shorter matter, if, under the clause, someone has a sign affixed to their wall, is the person whose wall it is affixed to recompensed for the rental of the wall?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> Clause 186 applies to the provisions under which powers are given for signs to be affixed to particular places, rather than the financial arrangements that might apply to any such arrangements. As I would not wish to mislead the Committee in any way by giving an indication on a matter that is outwith the clause, I undertake to write to the hon. Gentleman and to send copies to all other members of the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I just happened to notice that a very large volume was being looked at quickly behind the Minister. Mine was not a mischievous question; I did not know the answer. There is a serious issue here, which has been raised with me in the past. If someone has to have a rather large sign, to put it nicely, on their wall, it seems reasonable that he is paid rental for it.
<P>
I am grateful for the Minister's answer. Depending on what he says, we may need to think about this further, and not simply with regard to the GLA. There may be a wider issue here for the Minister for Transport in London, relating to major roads, and areas outside London.

<H4><center>Transfer of London Traffic Control System to Transport for London</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> My remarks may extend over the next three clauses, which are all on the same broad subject. I hope that that is in order, Mr. Winterton.
<P>
The four clauses transfer the Secretary of State's statutory functions for traffic control systems in Greater London to Transport for London for all roads other than trunk roads. The Bill transfers any property that the Secretary of State holds in connection with these statutory functions to Transport for London.
<P>
Where the Secretary of State decides that he wants to pass to Transport for London the traffic control system for a trunk road--or trunk roads--in Greater London, he can transfer, first, all the systems relating to that road and, secondly, the maintenance and operation of those systems. The Bill also provides for the transfer from Transport for London to the Secretary of State of the entire traffic control system for all the roads in Greater London, and allows that to be reversed, providing that the Secretary of State and Transport for London agree. On all roads in Greater London other than trunk roads, wherever a traffic sign is also a light signal, Transport for London shall be deemed to be the traffic authority for those roads.
<P>
This is potentially a very important change for London local authorities, particularly Westminster, where there are very many roads that are not expected to be included in the network of GLA roads, but which have signals. I refer to Trafalgar square, Regent street, Oxford street, Victoria street, Piccadilly and others.
<P>
The clauses also provide for existing traffic signals and their maintenance and operation to be devolved to London borough councils. Such councils can also set up and operate new traffic signals with Transport for London's consent.
<P>
Clause 187(8) deals with a funding issue. At present, the traffic control systems unit is funded on a per head of population basis. If outer London boroughs, which have relatively few signals, are allowed to drop out of a Londonwide scheme, the bulk of the costs will continue to remain, but will fall on fewer boroughs. In a system whereby all boroughs are responsible for their own signals, Westminster and other central and inner London boroughs, which have a large number of signals, will be faced with high maintenance costs for a system that is in place because of problems caused largely, not by their residents but by drivers entering from elsewhere including from other London boroughs.
<P>
For reasons that will be apparent from those remarks, Westminster would prefer to retain the current system, but I would be grateful if the Minister would reply to my question about funding, which has also been raised separately by the Association of London Government.
<P>
<H5>3.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I want to clarify the Government's thinking on the transfer of the traffic signal control unit and London Regional Transport. As I understand it, in the case of London Regional Transport, the transfer provisions contained in clause 143, which we have already considered, provide for property, rights and liabilities to be transferred, whereas in respect of traffic control systems in Greater London, only property will be transferred under the Bill. Because of the way in which the Bill is drafted, staff who work for that unit, dealing with the good administration of traffic control within Greater London, have less certainty about their future than staff who currently work for London Regional Transport who will be transferred to Transport for London.
<P>
Will the Minister explain the rationale for that apparent difference in approach to different staff, and give us some assurances about how that matter will be dealt with sensitively, to protect the interests of staff who may find themselves having to reapply for their own jobs?
<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> As the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster stated, the purpose of clause 187 is to transfer the traffic lights signal control system presently vested in the Secretary of State by orders under provisions of the Local Government Act 1985 to Transport for London. He is correct in saying that that transfer will apply to all roads in Greater London other than trunk roads.
<P>
The right hon. Gentleman was concerned about funding. As he said, at present funding is on a per capita basis. That issue is best dealt with directly by the mayor and the boroughs. I well understand the arguments that have been advanced, and the issue is clearly important to all concerned. However, once the mayor and assembly are in place, such discussions are best held between the mayor and the boroughs. Given that the GLA is being created, it would not be correct to write such detail, important though it may be, into the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I understand what the Minister is saying, but given the particular disadvantage that certain central London boroughs will face if they are to provide a signalling system largely for drivers from outside, rather than inside, their boroughs--the situation is likely to be reversed in some outer boroughs--will she give any guidance whatsoever as to how that matter should be addressed when the debate that she envisages takes place?
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> It is highly unlikely that whoever the people of London decide should be their mayor would require the sort of guidance to which the right hon. Gentleman refers. We are proposing a major office with great responsibilities. I have little doubt that the people of London will elect to that high office someone who is eminently suited for the duties that will be placed on his or her shoulders. Guidance such as the right hon. Gentleman suggests would be somewhat irrelevant.
<P>
Central to the duties of the duly elected mayor will be an integrated transport strategy. The issue on which the right hon. Gentleman touches--the amount of traffic that comes in and out of London every day--will be a central consideration when the mayor is devising an integrated strategy. The duly elected mayor will not only be aware of but will receive detailed representations from individual boroughs on such issues--which I know are variable; the right hon. Gentleman gave details of how they affect the City of Westminster. The mayor will have a duty to consult. The issues of the amount of traffic that comes in and out of London every day and of funding will be best dealt with by the mayor and by the boroughs in question.
<P>
The hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam was concerned about unfairness in the transfer once the bodies that are at present responsible for the areas that we are discussing become part of TfL. We have absolutely no intention of putting the staff of the traffic control system unit on a different basis from the staff of London Transport. If there is anything in the Bill--or anything that we have failed to include in it--that could create that situation, I will consider it closely and ensure that that is not the case. It would be utterly unfair and entirely unacceptable for there to be any such difference. We are talking about several different bodies eventually forming Transport for London.
<P>
In the light of that explanation, I trust that I have answered the questions that right hon. and hon. Gentlemen have asked and that clause 187 will stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> This group of amendments raises an issue that comes up in several clauses in this part of the Bill. We are concerned that TfL is being given statutory duties and powers, which ought properly to rest with the GLA and not with a functional body. That goes to the heart of the question of accountability. Although the clause to which we have tabled the amendments may not be the most important, the principle to which they refer is important.
<P>
Amendment No. 949 is intended to require that the power to transfer the traffic control system to TfL should rest with the GLA, through TfL, rather than with TfL itself. Many of the other amendments would have the same effect. We will be interested to establish the Government's thinking on whether the functional body, TfL, or the mayor and the authority should exercise the relevant power.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> The amendments are, in essence, part of what the hon. Gentleman and his colleagues have argued for a considerable time. They relate to what constitutes the GLA's basic power and authority.
<P>
The GLA may act only at the instigation of the mayor, the assembly or the mayor and the assembly acting jointly. Transport for London is directly accountable to the mayor. Therefore the power that we are talking about is, in essence, the power of the mayor. Clause 189 provides that the Secretary of State and Transport for London can agree to transfer traffic control systems from one to the other, but in this instance Transport for London embodies--as in all its actions--the power of the mayor. It would not be possible for TfL to give traffic signals to the Secretary of State or, indeed, to take on additional traffic signals without it being an agreed, implicit policy of Transport for London. The agreed, implicit policy of Transport for London is, of course, the agreed, implicit policy of the mayor.
<P>
There appears to be an inconsistency. I am not entirely clear why it should be necessary for the authority to be involved in agreements with the Secretary of State in this instance but not in the case of transfer schemes between Transport for London and a London borough, which we have just discussed in relation to clause 188. I repeat that Transport for London is accountable to the mayor. I hope that the Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I listened carefully to the Minister. On this occasion, the amendments were tabled to try to elucidate the disposition of powers as between the functional bodies, the mayor and the assembly, and not because of the usual argument about the disposition of power between the assembly and the mayor.
<P>
We are concerned because although the Government make it explicit in the White Paper that the duties will reside with the mayor, that is not the case in the Bill. If one drew a flow chart showing lines of accountability, I fear that this would be an area where the lines of accountability were not quite as clear as the Minister sought to assure the Committee. We will probably want to return to the issue when we reach the next clause, but for now, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

The suggested new subsections aim to enable the mayor and Transport for London positively to promote bus lanes across London. Economic growth in London since 1984 has caused a massive increase in the demand for transport. Buses represent a way of meeting some of that demand which is both cost effective and environmentally sensitive. There is a widespread belief that the mayor will make his biggest contribution to London if he can achieve significant and noticeable improvements in public transport; in the short term at least, he will make progress with buses rather than the tube. On the whole, debates on the Bill reinforce that view.
<P>
London First produced its transport strategy document in 1996, entitled "London's Action Programme for Transport: 1996-2010". It calls for the early completion of a 500-mile bus priority network for London at a modest cost of 80 million. When he was Secretary of State for Transport, my noble Friend Lord Parkinson spelt out clearly that London's road network was fixed in in scale. The construction of new roads has, with very few exceptions, ceased to be an option. New proposals might attract support in theory, but they also produce far louder howls of protest from those who would be directly or indirectly affected. Lord Parkinson's strategy was to use the existing road network more efficiently.
<P>
The first step was the introduction of red routes, which we have just debated, under the Road Traffic Act 1991. The second step was to try to co-ordinate the digging up of roads in the roads and streetworks legislation of the same year. The next step, to which the amendments are directed, should be to give more priority to buses. The amendment would enable Transport for London to do that. I shall be interested to hear the Minister's reponse.
<P>
<H5>3.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> I am delighted at the right hon. Gentleman's direct support, which underlines the importance of bus priority networks in London. The Government are committed to such networks, not only in London but throughout the whole United Kingdom. The bus is a major player in a properly integrated transport system, not least because of its flexibility. Despite some arguments to the contrary in the Committee's earlier debates, it is clear that red routes are leading to shorter bus journey times. There has been an influx of new, cleaner, greener vehicles onto our roads. Of all the modes of public transport that are available in London, the bus is the only one that still has excess capacity, despite the millions of people who use buses every day.
<P>
<B>Sir Sydney Chapman:</B> Would the Minister like to add that since the introduction of red routes there has been a reduction in the number of accidents on roads that are thus designated? That is important.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for mentioning another big plus following the introduction of red routes. Road safety is an integral consideration, not only for the Government but for the mayor when he or she takes office.
<P>
I shall not detain the Committee by waxing lyrical on the benefits for all of greater bus usage in London. While I entirely endorse the right hon. Gentleman's views on the importance of buses and the bus priority network, it is not necessary to include in the Bill the requirement that he suggests. The majority of bus priority networks will be on borough roads. The boroughs will have to create local implementation plans, which must fall within the overarching integrated transport strategy for London devised by the mayor. The mayor will have the power to direct the boroughs if they drag their feet, although it is unlikely that they will do so. The Government have consistently supported and prioritised the issue since coming to power, and we will continue to do so until the GLA and the mayor take over. There is little doubt that the bus priority network will he a central plank of the mayor's integrated transport strategy.
<P>
Therefore, although I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for endorsing the value of buses to all of us in London, I ask him to withdraw the amendment.

<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I am grateful to the Minister. On this occasion, although she made more than one reference to the Government's prioritising of the issue, she made no reference to the situation that they inherited. She would be the first to acknowledge that there was a significant budget for bus priority improvements in the plans of Mr. Steven Norris, the former Conservative Minister for Transport in London.
<P>
We have had an opportunity to give the subject an airing. I am grateful for the Minister's comments, and I am content to beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 759, in page 98, line 21, after "by", insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Transport for London, or as the case may be,".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is regrettable that amendment No. 893 was not moved, because I was going to encourage the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam to divide the Committee on it. He has shot my fox. I now wish that I had thought of the amendment.
<P>
It is wrong that the Secretary of State should have the last word on fixing parking charges in London. We want the mayor of London to run London, not the Secretary of State. I know that the Government see things the other way round.
<P>
Amendment No. 759 is a probing amendment to ask the Minister why, if the Secretary of State does not approve the levels of additional parking charges proposed by the London authorities, the same sanction does not apply to TfL? Why does the Secretary of State come into the picture on this aspect only as far as the borough is concerned, and not TfL?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The hon. Member for Croydon, South, in moving his amendment, expressed surprise and disappointment that the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam had not moved his earlier one. We were even more surprised, as we were inclined to respond sympathetically to the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam. We are also inclined to respond sympathetically to the hon. Member for Croydon, South, who has identified a lacuna in the Bill's wording which provides for the Secretary of State to act in certain circumstances but not others. On reflection--and I think that the Committee will agree with this--there is a lot to be said for the mayor being responsible for discharging those functions rather than the Secretary of State.
<P>
This puts me in an extremely difficult position. As you will know, Mr. Winterton, we have received a certain amount of criticism for proposing amendments. Whereas previously I thought that I would be in the happy position of being able to say that we would take away an Opposition amendment, I now have to seek the Committee's indulgence to bring forward our own amendment to give effect to the intentions of the Committee. On the strict understanding that we will not be criticised for doing so, I give the Committee an assurance that we are prepared to bring forward an amendment to take on board both these issues and ensure that in future the mayor, not the Secretary of State, will have responsibility in this respect.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> Perhaps I should say this on clause stand part, Mr. Winterton, but I am grateful to the Minister for accepting the amendments that I did not move. Would that I had known about this--it would have been an excellent subject for a local press release.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am sure that it still will be. [Laughter.]
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> It certainly will still be the case, Mr. Winterton.
<P>
The Minister is very kind. I look forward to seeing the Government amendments which will attract no opprobrium or criticism from these Benches. I may come back on clause stand part with some other general points.
<P>
<B>Mr. Keith Darvill  </B>(Upminster): I wish to raise a constituency issue, which I am sure will resonate with other members of the Committee who represent outer London boroughs. It relates to parking generally rather than parking charges specifically.
<P>
There are areas in consitutency close to commuter stations. Some stations are in largely residential areas, and some are in town shopping areas.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman has, I think, anticipated me; I cannot see how he is talking to the amendment. I think that he, like the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam, wishes to speak on clause stand part.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway rose--</B><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> No doubt a vote of thanks.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> A vote of thanks to you, Mr. Winterton, and to the Minister, and to anyone else who wants to be thanked.
<P>
I think that the Liberal Democrat press release will read something like, "Tory helps out Liberal and persuades the Government". [Laughter.] The Minister has been thoroughly reasonable, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I am grateful for the Minister's comments about the amendments that we did not move. Perhaps we should stop moving amendments; then they might be accepted. I do not suppose that I shall try the idea often, but I might pursue it as an occasional experiment.
<P>
The issue of parking gets Londoners hot under the collar--if they get a parking ticket, if charges go up too much or if they perceive an injustice. We want the methods by which parking and other charges are determined to be as clear as possible and to provide maximum accountability. The clause will allow Transport for London to fix charges. However, as I said before, because that body will exist at one remove from the electorate, it will not be as accountable as we would like.
<P>
Transport for London, as the Minister rightly said in a previous debate, will be the agent for the delivery of the mayor's strategies. By giving such duties to an agency, the Bill will create the potential for a lack of clarity about who is accountable. The mayor might take the opportunity to say, "Well, that is a matter for Transport for London--it has the power to decide. That is not a matter for me."
<P>
In terms of the mayor's broad strategies, he or she will set the direction and control the budget. However, the Government may need to reconsider the issue of clarity, if only to satisfy themselves that they will achieve the aims set out in the White Paper. Paragraph 5.17 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"TfL's role will be an executive one, implementing the Mayor's transport strategy and running or managing a wide range of transport functions and services on a day-to-day basis. It will also advise the Mayor on transport issues and be able to promote transport schemes across all modes. Responsibility for policy and all statutory duties will rest with the Mayor."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Unfortunately, the Bill does not appear to give effect to that intention and that is why we raise the matter. The GLA, not Transport for London, should be represented on the joint committee that will oversee transport issues in London.
<P>
That brings us back to the question of accountability. Transport for London will be simply a technical body, there to deliver the mayor's strategies. This and other clauses blur the clarity that ought to be present. Will the Minister look at the matter again to satisfy herself and perhaps, in due course, the Committee that there will not be a lack of clear accountability?
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> One of the problems in London is that, where there are different regimes taking decisions on the same issue in different areas, it is sometimes difficult for people to know under which regime they fall.
<P>
I own up immediately--I once fell prey to that problem when I parked in the borough of Camden. I parked near the flat of the Secretary of State for Health, round the back of the British museum. There were no signs to give the times of parking restrictions--I went to both ends of the road and into adjacent roads and there was not a sign to be seen. I parked at 8 pm but the restrictions continue in that area until 8.30 pm.
<P>
The point is serious--people would be respectful and mindful of the parking regulations if they knew what they were. It is not satisfactory if attentive people try to find out what regulations exist but cannot do so. Some of us may be alert to regulations because we are aware of roughly where borough boundaries lie. We may think, perhaps because we have seen it in the Evening Standard, that some boroughs--Camden or Westminster, perhaps--might have changed their regimes. However, someone who has never been to London before and is visiting with the family for the day, or has come from abroad, will not be aware of the rules. We have a duty to make sure that the regimes are clear and that any person who is reasonably keen to discover what rules he should abide by can find something that tells him.
<P>
<H5>4 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Sir Sydney Chapman:</B> Many of my constituents, who drive into inner London, feel strongly that it would be common sense for the hours of restriction to be the same in all boroughs. If that is not possible, does the hon. Gentleman agree that, with the profusion of restriction signs--whether there are one or two yellow lines on the road or notices on lamp posts--a motorist should have the right to park in the proper place on any road, so long as there is no visible restriction?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I would support that idea--I assume that we have all experienced such feelings. If I remember correctly, I eventually won my battle with Camden on that issue although the contest took several rounds. I agree with the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
My gut reaction is to favour varying provision because there are areas--for example in the City of Westminster--that have many visitors in the evening. In order to protect the residents and residents' parking, regimes are needed that catch those who might otherwise park before going to the theatre or cinema. An 8.30 pm restriction is much less likely to be inconvenient. My instinct is for a variable pattern that must be left to local authorities to decide.
<P>
I learned, almost to my cost, that the rules governing diplomatic parking bays are always in force, however unjustified their location and under-used--some are not even used--they are. One bay at the bottom of Haymarket on the right-hand side appears never to have a car parked in it during the evenings or weekends. Perhaps it exists for a night-time visit to the New Zealand High Commissioner.
<P>
The restrictions should state whether they apply for 24 hours a day, seven days a week, or from 8 am to 6.30 pm. I accept the point made by the hon. Member for Chipping Barnet (Sir S. Chapman). There should be a sign that states in simple English what the hours of restriction are. That would result in far less aggravation for a driver who feels that fines had been unjustifiably imposed.
<P>
The law is clear that when the expiry time runs out, there is a first penalty and then a second penalty, and I do not mind that. However, the borough of Westminster has meters that knock off the time as soon as the coin goes in--the meter immediately ratchets down from forty minutes, or whatever. I know that the borough is tight on the collection and spending of money and that the revenue collected from parking fines is large. The meter people in Westminster hide around every corner and, the moment that parking time has expired, they appear. I know that because I have paid the price. I do not object to the penalties, but I object to not getting my money's worth.
<P>
The serious point is about respecting the system and ensuring that a regime is in place that is tough on parking and unnecessary motoring, but fair to everyone. That is particularly the case for those who may not be used to London, cannot see clearly or who do not know their way around. We shall disadvantage them if we do not have clear parking restrictions.

<P>

<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> Perhaps the hon. Gentleman is unaware that traffic wardens in Westminster are briefed to clamp any taxi that says "Vote Liberal" on it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> One night I took one of my highly respectable parliamentary colleagues in my taxi. We were stopped twice by the police as we travelled from Smith Square to the roundabout by Millbank on the Embankment. In the end, the police told us that they were looking for a rapist, which was not very reassuring either to my hon. Friend in the back to me in the front.
<P>
The authorities do not clamp taxis any more often than any other form of transport. I do not mind who they clamp so long as the regime is fair.
<P>
<B>Mr. Darvill:</B> I apologise for intervening prematurely on amendment No. 759. I started to refer to the problem of parking and parking charges generally in outer London and as they relate to suburban stations and the integration of other modes of transport.
<P>
The problem in my constituency, which I suspect is also faced by other hon. Members, is that the zoning--zone 6 in my constituency--attracts commuters by car from outside the Greater London area to residential areas close to stations. That creates traffic journeys from outside Greater London to suburban stations, causing heavy parking pressures in local areas which sometimes impinge on local businesses that rely on traffic entering smaller shopping areas. Cars are left all day while commuters are in London, until they return in the evening to take them back outside Greater London. That causes all sorts of pressures in those areas.
<P>
Parking charges and parking restrictions should be a matter for the mayor and assembly to consider. If zoning and parking were in harmony, that would help to reduce traffic in such outer London areas, reducing the pressure on residential areas and helping local businesses--especially retail businesses in smaller shopping centres, which face the additional pressure of competing with out-of-London shopping centres such as Lakeside.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> As debate on the Bill has gone on, there has been a welcome reduction in observations about Westminster city council. I am grateful for that, and do not by my remarks in any way seek to provoke any more such observations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Dismore </B>(Hendon): Is the right hon. Gentleman going to enjoy his dinner tonight?
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I am not going to the dinner tonight. I will not expand on that remark, Mr. Winterton, or you will rule me out of order.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South is incorrect to say that it is a policy of Westminster city council to clamp taxis that say "Vote Liberal". Westminster city council is a Liberal Democrat councillor-free zone because of the services provided by the majority party--supported and reinforced, I may say, by the Labour party. It is also only by 12 votes that my constituency has not become a Labour councillor-free zone.
<P>
There was an edge to the remarks of the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey about parking practices in Westminster. All that I will say in defence of the policies carried out by Westminster, their intent and their effect is that 22 years ago, when I became the constituency Member of Parliament, only one meter in 20 was free at any one time, so an enormous number of vehicles were driving around, polluting central London while looking for a parking meter. Now, at any one time, one meter in eight is free, thus reducing the amount of traffic.
<P>
The one exception that I make to the parliamentary convention that we do not answer the substance of letters from people writing from outside our constituency is that, if someone from outside the City of Westminster writes to me to complain about Westminster city council's parking regulations, I reply on every occasion. Short of writing to the Lord Mayor or the leader of the council, there are few other people whom the public can identify with whom they could raise that matter. I am proud of the practical effect of the policy.
<P>
I have only one question to add to those which the Minister has already been asked. What are to be the parking enforcement regulations and responsibilities on GLA roads? Will Transport for London be responsible for that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> We have had a most interesting debate, which has ranged across a number of diverse issues relating to additional charges. The hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam raised the question of democratic accountability--[Interruption.]
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I am receiving the reply for my hon. Friend.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The hon Member for Sutton and Cheam has mysteriously disappeared, but I reassure him in his absence that TfL will be thoroughly and completely accountable because it will be an executive agency. It will implement the mayor's strategy, and its decisions will be subject to his approval. There is, therefore, no possibility of TfL setting charges in a way that is not accountable. The mayor will be answerable to the assembly, which will therefore, be able to scrutinise TfL decisions. I hope that the fears that the hon. Gentleman expressed on that count can be quickly set aside.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman's second concern was about the membership of the joint committee that the boroughs established to achieve a degree of co-ordination in respect of charges. This is obviously an especially difficult issue. Concern has been voiced that TfL should not be represented on the joint committee because it is an executive body and that there should be an elected member instead. The difficulty with that proposal is that the mayor, who will be responsible for TfL, could not be expected to attend the committee; that would not be a reasonable use of his time. It would be inappropriate for members of the assembly, who will scrutinise the mayor but take no executive responsibility, to be members of the committee along with its other elected members. It is, therefore, right that TfL should be represented by an appropriate member of TfL--possibly a member of its board. We would certainly expect it to discuss the matter with the boroughs' joint committee to ensure that it was suitably represented on the committee. That would ensure co-ordination between the boroughs and TfL.
<P>
The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey described his personal experiences of misfortune in various boroughs--I thought that we might get a league table that showed whether he had fared worse in Camden or Westminster. However, I shall not tempt providence because we might be tempted to refer once again to Westminster city council. I know that the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster would not want us to do that.
<P>
The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey made a perfectly valid point about variations between different areas in hours of applicability, charges and the procedures adopted. Charges do not vary merely from borough to borough, but often from road to road. There can be variations in weekend restrictions and in the hours when restrictions apply on weekdays. There are certainly variations in policies on enforcement. That is a function partly of boroughs' different decisions, but also of the need to reflect the different circumstances of different roads and areas.
<P>
I endorse the hon. Gentleman's two general points. First, there is a need for an overview to ensure that we do not have totally incoherent inconsistency. There is a case for differences, but they must exist for good reasons, not just because of incoherent inconsistency. Secondly, there must he good signage because people must be aware of the fact that they may incur a penalty by parking in a particular place. Such information should be properly brought to their attention. I am sure that TfL and the boroughs, through their joint committee, will want to give both those points careful attention.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I do not want to push the Minister further than he wants to go, but does he agree that there should at least be a sign in every separate road to make clear what the regime is? I make that point because some people--perhaps the less able or the less fleet of foot--cannot be expected to know that they have crossed into a zone when the sign is six streets away. Nor can they be expected to drive round the streets to find out what the regime is before they decide whether they can lawfully park there.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes an absolutely valid point. I am surprised that he asked only that there should be one sign per road because often that would not give members of the public adequate information. I repeat: there should be adequate signage, which will obviously vary from road to road and from place to place.
<P>
<H5>4.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Upminster (Mr. Darvill) raised the issue of parking in appropriate suburban locations to achieve proper integration--for example, where people wish to park so as to use a train or underground service or where people congregate in certain areas for other purposes. We strongly believe that the new integrated transport strategy, which the mayor will be responsible for preparing, must address these issues to ensure that people can travel without using their cars unnecessarily for journeys where public transport offers an alternative. Proper integration opportunities to park and use public transport must be encouraged. I assure my hon. Friend that that will be very much part of the agenda for the mayor and the assembly.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster extolled the virtues of the City of Westminster--I shall not respond to that out of deference to his earlier remark. His question was about enforcement arrangements. The current position is that the police are responsible for all moving traffic offences, because only the police have authority to halt vehicles. The police can also deal with some parking offences. The traffic wardens enforce red route controls and borough parking attendants enforce borough designated parking places and controlled parking zones.
<P>
When the GLA is set up, the police role will remain unchanged. Traffic enforcement will remain entirely an operational matter for the police. We see no case for setting up separate traffic police, because experience elsewhere suggests that that leads to operational inefficiences and a lack of the integration that is desirable. Traffic wardens will continue to enforce red route controls, although red routes, as we established in an earlier debate, will become GLA roads and will be the responsibility of the GLA. The exact arrangements for other roads that are to be transferred to TfL have yet to be finalised. We have only just announced which roads will be in the GLA road network, and we need to give further thought to the matter and consult with interested parties before further decisions are taken.
<P>
The Bill will allow the mayor to decriminalise parking on GLA roads. The exact arrangements by which that will happen will be left to the mayor's discretion. Our aim is to give the mayor flexibility--for example, to agree with the boroughs to provide parking enforcement under contract to TfL or to agree with the Metropolitan police that traffic wardens can, in some circumstances, issue decriminalised parking tickets. In the meantime, the boroughs will continue to be responsible for parking enforcement on all the roads for which they are responsible. I hope that that clarifies the position.

<P>

<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> Perhaps the Minister can help me with a question to which I do not know the answer. Is it Government policy that overstaying offences that is, breaches of the rules that relate to the timing of parking rather than dangerous parking or parking on the kerb--should be decriminalised generally, not just in London? It seems to me that that would be good idea.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> We agree with the general principle behind the hon. Gentleman's proposition. However, it is important that the precise individual circumstances in such cases are considered fully before any final decisions are taken. We would not want to preempt the mayor by taking away the degree of flexibility that we wish him or her to exercise.
<P>
As the hon. member for Sutton and Cheam has now resumed his seat, I repeat that the decisions of the mayor, who is responsible for TfL, will be subject to scrutiny and questioning by the assembly. There will be a proper framework for democratic accountability in all matters on which TfL acts. I hope that I have answered all the points that have been raised and that members of the Committee are happy for clause 191 to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<H4><center>Special parking areas</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow rose--</B><P>
<P>
<B>Hon. Members:</B> Uh.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I did not expect hon. Members to groan--[Interruption.] The hon. Member for Croydon, South says that they being spontaneous.
<P>
I want to make one or two points about special parking areas and to ascertain how the clause will affect the London boroughs. At the moment, as hon. Members will know, special parking areas are designated by London boroughs. However, the GLA will also specify special parking areas. In a special parking area that is designated by a London borough which also happens to contain some GLA roads, what would happen if the GLA declined to designate its roads as part of the SPA? What conflict resolution system will address that potential undermining of the cohesiveness of a special parking area?
<P>
If the special parking area is designated by both authorities, what will happen to the income that is generated on the GLA roads through the operation of the SPA? Will it go into the parking accounts of the local authority--the London borough--to enable it to sustain its operations, attendants and so on, or will it go elsewhere? Again, how will that be resolved--by agency arrangements or by agreement? It would be useful for the Minister to give us some clarification on that.
<P>
Who will set the tariffs or charges to be levied on the GLA roads within an SPA? Will that be entirely a matter for TfL or will it be delegated to the London borough so that there is consistency across the special parking area?
<P>
We have already established that the Bill provides for red routes to be changed and for that approach to be amended in the future, which is welcome. The Minister said in respect of our discussions on clause 191 that the Bill also provides for the decriminalisation of several offences. I want to establish whether that applies to GLA roads within SPAs.
<P>
Finally, the comprehensive Library briefing on the Bill's transport provisions--which I think is being written to reflect the numerous new clauses that have been tabled; indeed, the library is working overtime as a consequence of that--states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The constraints of time have meant that the Home Office, who has an interest in this area"--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
that is, parking--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"has not had time to consider the clauses."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Is that correct? Has the Home Office now considered the clauses? if so, do we know what its conclusions are, not least on decriminalisation? Undoubtedly, that will be important. I look forward to hearing the Minister's response.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The hon. Gentleman raises a series of issues relating to a modest clause. It will simply clarify provisions that are brought into place with the creation of the Greater London authority, which will have a network of GLA roads. In the main, they will be roads that were previously the responsibility of the Traffic Director and others, but which have been designated as GLA roads on the basis described a week or so ago by my hon. Friend the Minister for Transport in London.
<P>
Setting charges for special parking areas will be as provided for in the clause. Transport for London will be responsible to the extent that the special parking area contains GLA roads or trunk roads, and the local authority is responsible for roads other than GLA roads or trunk roads. My understanding is that that simply replicates existing arrangements. The income and revenue derived from charges is drawn by the respective bodies, so the GLA will receive income from parking charges in respect of special parking areas on GLA roads.
<P>
The GLA will be able to enter into agency agreements with the boroughs to provide enforcement via parking attendants, or it could make other arrangements if it so wished. If it was doing so, it would be a matter for the GLA to discuss with the boroughs, and for the two to reach agreement. Clearly, there will be occasions when they need to discuss such arrangements and the apportionment of revenues that are derived from enforcement that is undertaken jointly by someone acting as an agent for both bodies.
<P>
I do not anticipate any problems with this clause along the lines set out by the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam. It is a simple clause which gives effect to the new order created by the establishment of the Greater London authority.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> Sometimes we have to look at modest clauses more closely than those which are less modest. In this respect, I am grateful for the Minister's comments. However, we did not get an answer to my question about Home Office scrutiny of the clauses. Perhaps we will find out whether the Library got that matter right. It concerns us that when the Bill was published, the Home Office had not had the chance to scrutinise that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I apologise to the hon. Gentleman for not responding to his earlier question. I am afraid that it was incomprehensible. We have cleared all the policy proposals in the Bill with other Departments, including the Home Office, and we have a Home Office Minister with us on the team, so what the hon. Gentleman said was news to me. There is no possible comment that I can make, because it is not in line with our understanding of the position.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I am grateful for the Minister's intervention. I am sure that in the revised version of the transport section of the Library's paper on the Bill--which I am sure is currently being prepared to reflect all the new clauses--that will be deleted from the text.
<P>
I listened to what the Minister said about the interrelationship between a special parking area that is set up by a London borough and the SPAs that will be set up by the Greater London authority for its roads. A number of boroughs that have set up large special parking areas will have GLA roads in them. I am concerned to hear that there will be potential conflict between the two agencies. Although there will be much consensus and agreement, the way in which the clause is drafted will lead to a problem for many London boroughs trying to implement proper parking controls in their area. They will have a different agency above them, which may take a different decision.
<P>
I have listened to what the Minister has said. I am grateful for his comments about the Home Office, but I remain concerned that the clause, modest though it may be, may not have modest implications for the London boroughs.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 192 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 193</center></H4>
<H4><center> Interpretation of parking provisions</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> As many as are of that opinion--
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I can genuinely plead that I was on my feet, Mr. Winterton, but your eyes were looking towards the river. To make it a fair contest, I serve warning at the beginning of my remarks that you may well rule me out of order, Mr. Winterton, and say that I should have raised this matter under clause 191. But I think that it would be in the interests of the Bill if I make a brief reference to this now.
<P>
I raise this point so that anyone who wishes to follow it can go back to the briefing that we received earlier this week from London First. I am returning to the issue of buses, in line with my earlier exchange with the hon. Member for London Transport--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> She is the hon. Member for Hampstead and Highgate.
<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> Thank you, Mr. Winterton.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I meant the Minister for Transport in London.
<P>
I want to return to bus priority networks and the point that London First made about many of the worst bus hold-ups that are in places where there is no space for bus priority measures, such as King's road, Chelsea. Illegal parking and loading can cause lengthy delays to buses that make their service slow and unreliable. Effective enforcement is essential.
<P>
The London First group states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"At present boroughs do not give sufficient priority to enforcement on these routes, largely because, if it is thorough enough to prevent infringements, it does not generate enough revenue from penalties to finance the activity. TfL should therefore be able to set compliance standards for bus priority routes and where necessary help to finance additional enforcement effort. Action on obstruction of bus routes is one of the actions which an incoming Mayor should take to make a real difference quickly"--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
a point that I made when speaking to amendment No. 948. London First continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"It is essential that the Mayor's hands should not be tied by limitation on the powers available."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
You have been extremely generous, Mr. Winterton, in allowing me to raise this issue under clause 193. I should be interested to hear what the Minister has to say.

<P>

<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> Once again, Mr. Winterton, I crave your indulgence for straying beyond clause 193 and responding to the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster. At the outset, he said that you, Mr. Winterton, were not looking towards him when he rose to speak, but looking instead towards the river. From the angle at which we sit in Committee, unless one is either very tall or standing, it is not possible to see the river. However, it is possible to see the other side of the river, which is not the City of Westminster. It is the London borough of Lambeth and beyond that is the London borough of Southwark. If one is sharp-eyed, one may also see a bus crossing Westminster bridge towards Westminster.
<P>
The right hon. Gentleman made a fair point about the enforcement of bus priority routes to ensure that they achieve their purpose. He rightly highlighted the irritation caused by vehicles that are parked in bus priority routes and which cause obstructions and negate entirely the value of such routes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> Or, as I specifically alluded to in my speech, where there is heavy bus use and the road is not wide enough for there to be a bus priority network, yet vehicles are parked in those relatively narrow streets.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The right hon. Gentleman rightly referred to the other issue that he mentioned in his speech, which is the restriction of a bus's ability to move along roads where there are not bus priority routes because of parking.
<P>
The Minister for Transport in London, my hon. Friend the Member for Hampstead and Highgate (Ms Jackson)--to distinguish her two roles--has taken an important initiative to ensure that there is, in particular, more effective enforcement of bus priority routes. The mounting of cameras to identify drivers who transgress parking restrictions has begun to make an impact and I know that there are proposals to roll out more widely that network of surveillance cameras to achieve a larger impact.
<P>
I have no doubt that the mayor, when elected, will treat bus priority routes as an extremely important issue. If London is to have a well-operated public transport network and people can get around on public transport so that they do not feel duty bound to bring their motor cars into congested areas, we must ensure that buses can move reasonably smoothly and freely through areas, where otherwise they are inhibited from travelling by parked vehicles. For that reason, effective enforcement is likely to be a high priority for the mayor. Having said that, however, it is a matter for the mayor and it is not something that we can pre-determine.
<P>
I can only express my view that it would be surprising if the mayor did not treat effective enforcement as a relevant issue, both for ensuring smoother movement of the bus fleet in London and to achieve the integration and consistency of policy across London that is so very much part of our policy in introducing the Greater London authority and creating the new body, Transport for London, which will give effect to the mayor's transport strategy.
<P>
I hope that I have answered the right hon. Gentleman's concerns, which are legitimate if not strictly within the remit of the clause. I commend the clause to the Committee.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before I put the Question, I should like to tell the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster that he is so agreeable in presenting his case so quickly that it was not until he had completed it that I realised that it was not entirely relevant to the clause. Having allowed the right hon. Gentleman to put his case, it was appropriate for the Minister to respond.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 193 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 194</center></H4>
<H4><center>School crossing patrols</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke rose--</B><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Is this going to be relevant, Mr. Brooke?
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> It is thought to be relevant by the Association of London Government, Mr. Winterton. As it is only 4.35 pm and I do not know whether you will be changing for the event in 10 Downing street, Mr. Winterton, it is perhaps not unreasonable for me to put the issues that the ALG raised. They will be familiar to Ministers.
<P>
What proposals are there for boroughs to receive appropriate funding, currently paid for by the police? Will there be a reduction in the police precept? Will the moneys be transferred and, if so, will funding be proportional to the total number of school crossings in the borough, or population-related? When will the transfer take place? Will powers to stop vehicles be transferred from the police to boroughs--for example, to the school-crossing patrol attendants?
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Kate Hoey):</B> The right hon. Member asked important questions to which I hope I can respond. The clause is intended to avoid anomalies. Presently the Metropolitan police have a statutory responsibility for school-crossing patrols within the current Metropolitan police districts. Outside those districts, the counties and unitary authorities have that statutory responsibility. The clause will change the current situation by transferring statutory responsibility for school-crossing patrols from the Metropolitan police to London borough councils within Greater London, and to the relevant county councils outside Greater London.
<P>
The transfer will, of course, involve the transfer of finance, which will be dealt with satisfactorily through the local government finance settlement. That will ensure that money is available for the new bodies to carry on with the work that is currently done by other bodies.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> If I may dwell for a moment on a specific question, which should be within the Home Office's ability to respond, will there be a reduction in the police precepts?
<P>
<B>Kate Hoey:</B> I doubt it, but I will seek further clarification and respond to the right hon. Gentleman in writing.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 194 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 195</center></H4>
<H4><center>Parking attendants</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> It is a welcome suggestion that it will not be up to the Secretary of State to decide the uniform that parking attendants have to wear.
<P>
<B>Kate Hoey:</B> That is precisely why we are moving the clause, and I hope that the Committee will support us.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 195 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>

<H4><center>Clause 199</center></H4>
<H4><center>Repeal of certain enactments</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I thought that I was going to be beaten by the hon. Member for Croydon, South in speaking to the clause, the hon. Gentleman having asked a perfectly proper question earlier about the demise of the Traffic Director for London It was suggested that the answer was in the clause. I have, however, spotted that that seems not to be quite so, Subsection (3) states:--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"So far as relating to roads which are or become GLA roads, the Traffic Director for London's network plan . . . shall, until such time as it is superseded by the transport strategy, continue in force and have effect as if it were part of that strategy."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The next subsection deals with transitional arrangements. However, I do not see the direct answer to the hon. Gentleman's question about where the transfer of the power and authority of the Traffic Director for London is set out. If I have missed something I stand to be fully corrected, but there appears to be no direct reference. Perhaps diligent research would reveal a reference in the Road Traffic Act 1991, which is, of course, alluded to.
<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> In answer to the question about where in the Bill there is provision for the office of Traffic Director for London to be abolished, I draw the attention of the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey to clause 199(1)(d), which includes among the provisions that will cease to have effect
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"sections 50 to 63 and 80 of, and Schedule 5 to, the Road Traffic Act 1991 (priority routes, local plans, trunk road plans and the Traffic Director for London)"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I trust that that answers the hon. Gentleman's question.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 199 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dowd:</B> I congratulate you, Mr. Winterton, on the galvanising effect that your social diary has had on the Committee.
