Jonathan Djanogly</b> (Huntingdon) (Con): On a point of order,
Mr. Illsley. A few Government proposals have been tabled
this morning, so we are now up to new clause 436. It is worth spending
some time talking about that. We should put it on the record that we
are delighted that this Bill is being consolidated&#151;the
Conservative party argued for that from day one&#151;and we are
pleased that the Government have changed their mind and decided to
consolidate.</div><a name="06071368000018"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071368000293"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. That is not a point of order for the
Chair.</div>
<a name="06071368000019"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071368000294"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I shall come directly to my point,
Mr. Illsley. Although we are happy that these proposals have
been tabled, they have been tabled very late, so we will not be able to
consider them in Committee. I want to put that on the record and to ask
whether you have any views on the
matter.</div><a name="06071368000020"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071368000295"></a>The
Minister for Industry and the Regions (Margaret Hodge):</b>
Further to that point of order, Mr. Illsley. I hope that I
am in order, and no doubt you will stop me if I am not. I had informal
discussions outside the Committee about the tabling of these
consolidation amendments with Conservative and Liberal Democrat
colleagues. We agreed informally that there is clearly not time to give
detailed consideration to these new clauses in Committee and said that
we would share them with professionals, particularly the Law Society.
We have shared them with all members of the
Committee.</div><a name="06071368000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
prepared to meet Opposition Members during the recess if necessary to
consider whether any amendments are required, which we would then table
on Report. If that does not work, we will clearly not be able to
proceed with this further
consolidation.</div><a name="06071368000022"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071368000296"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Further to that point of order, Mr.
Illsley. That is the reality of where we are. It should be put on
record that we are in the closing stages of consideration in Committee,
following consideration in the House of Lords, and that this is a late
stage to table 430 new clauses.</div>
<a name="06071368000023"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071368000297"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> Further to that point of order, Mr.
Illsley. These proposals are being added at the express desire of
Members of the House of the Lords, particularly Conservative peers, and
some Labour peers too. We are trying to meet their views and, most
importantly, to ensure that we provide an Act that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column645" />Column number: 646</div>serves its purpose. If Opposition Members do not wish to co-operate with
a procedure that is forced upon us in this
way&#151;</div><a name="06071368000024"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071368000298"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> You forced it upon
us.</div><a name="06071368000025"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071368000299"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> No. That is not true. The consolidation in the Bill
of those proposals from other legislation is at the direct request of
Opposition Members in the House of Lords. We are responding to that.
Clearly, there needs to be co-operation from all members of the
Committee and from all hon. Members if we are to consolidate the Bill.
That is why I have offered informal meetings during the summer recess
to discuss any issues that Opposition Members may wish to raise and why
I have said that if amendments are required we will table them on
Report.</div><a name="06071368000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">If hon.
Members do not wish to co-operate in the procedure that is before us as
a result of a request from Opposition Members in the House of Lords, we
will have no option but to withdraw the 400 new
clauses.</div><a name="06071368000027"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071368000300"></a>The
Chairman:</b> The hon. Member for Huntingdon (Mr.
Djanogly) has made his point, but it is not in the hands of the Chair
to respond to it. The timetabling of the Bill is in the hands of the
Government, and we are bound by the programme order, which has been
agreed
to.</div><a name="06071368000011"></a>




<h4 class="hs_8Clause">Clause
217</h4><a name="06071368000005"></a><div class="hs_7SmCapsHdg">Provision
of
insurance</div><a name="06071368000028"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071368000301"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 460, in
clause 217, page 99, line 2, at
end add&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;( ) The cost of
any excess under an insurance policy permitted to be purchased under
this section may be paid for by a company or associated company,
provided that it does not exceed
&#163;5,000&#146;.</div><a name="06071368000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are discussing the clauses in chapter 7 of part 10 that deal with
provisions protecting directors from liability. Clause 217 permits a
company to take out and maintain insurance for a director against any
liability referred to in clause 216(2), the scope of which we argued in
our previous sitting should be broadened. However, if excess is
provided for under an insurance policy, it is logical for a company to
be permitted to meet the cost, provided that it does not exceed a
reasonable amount, given that the existence of an excess normally
reduces the premium payable by a
company.</div><a name="06071368000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
would enable a company to meet that cost under an insurance policy that
it is permitted to take out under clause 217. On a probing basis, we
suggest that the provision should encompass an excess sum of less than
&#163;5,000.</div><a name="06071368000031"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071368000302"></a>The
Solicitor-General (Mr. Mike O'Brien):</b> This is
not an unreasonable amendment and we accept that it states a modest
face value. It also picks up a recommendation made in the company law
review. However, in the light of the major reforms introduced in the
Companies (Audit, Investigations and Community 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column646" />Column number: 647</div>Enterprise) Act 2004, we do not feel able to accept it. It is preferable
to keep to the basic principles that underline the
chapter.</div><a name="06071368000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
a director&#146;s liability is to a third party, the company will in
most cases be able to indemnify him. However, if the liability is to
the company itself, it would be wrong in principle for the company to
indemnify the director, even if the amount involved was relatively
modest, as I accept the proposed amount
is.</div><a name="06071368000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Companies Act
1985 permits companies to indemnify directors against most liabilities
to third parties, including shareholders who bring a class action, or
to pay a director&#146;s legal costs up front, providing that the
director repays any loans, discharges or other liability to the company
if he is convicted in criminal proceedings or judgments are made
against him in civil proceedings brought by the company or an
associated company. It should be clear that companies are already
permitted to indemnify directors in a wide range of
circumstances.</div><a name="06071368000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is,
however, necessary to draw some lines in the sand. Those lines are
drawn in the right places in the 2004 Act and in the Bill. The hon.
Gentleman&#146;s point is not unreasonable, but we have taken the
view that this is a matter of principle. I hope he accepts that that is
probably the best way to
proceed.</div><a name="06071368000035"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071368000303"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I thank the Solicitor-General for his
consideration of my points, although I am not entirely sure that I
agree with his point of policy. When excesses are involved, insurance
costs can generally be reduced, so we thought that the amendment would
be attractive. However, I have heard what he has to say, and I beg to
ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="06071368000036"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071368000306"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> We move on to clause 222 dealing with the
changes to the law on ratification, and one of our main concerns about
chapter 7 and directors&#146; liabilities. The clause preserves
mostly the current law on ratification of acts of directors, but with
one significant change. Under the Bill, any decision by a company to
ratify</div> <a name="06071368000223"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;conduct by a
director amounting to negligence, default, breach of duty or breach of
trust in relation to the company...must be taken by the
members&#148;</div><a name="06071368000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">without reliance
on the votes in favour by the director or any connected
person.</div> <a name="06071368000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">We accept
what many lawyers are saying: the changes to the law on ratification
advance the existing common law position which allows the ratification
of the director&#146;s breach of duty by ordinary resolution and
which does not disregard the votes of any one person interested in the
ratification. The advance on the common law position will place a
significant restriction on the actions of directors, make it more
difficult to achieve the majority required for ratification, and might
lead to an increase in the number of derivative actions taken against
company directors.</div><a name="06071368000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
instance, what if the majority of shares in a company are held by
directors, which is the norm for smaller family-type companies? In such
a situation, their votes will be disregarded for ratification purposes,
giving much more power to small shareholders, who will then have
leverage over the owners, which will not necessarily serve the best
interests of the company. What if the minority shareholder owns say
only 1 per cent. of the company? Should they still have that veto over
ratification?</div> <a name="06071368000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have
tabled amendment No. 423 to delete subsection (4) and the provisions
barring interested parties from voting. However, if the provision
remains, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column648" />Column number: 649</div>would the Minister consider a threshold so that a small minority of
shareholders cannot hold the majority to ransom?</div>
<a name="06071368000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">Furthermore, I note that
subsection (3) stops connected members voting as well. We find that
provision worrying also. Surely, connected members still have rights as
individual shareholders and should be treated as such, rather than as
relatives. If they see it as in the interests of the company to ratify
actions, why should the fact that they are a relative of a director
mean that they cannot vote? We have tabled amendment No. 424 to deal
with that important
issue.</div><a name="06071368000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">I wish to put
on the record a letter from Stephen Hancock of Herbert Smith to the
Attorney-General on 8 June 2006&#151;it was copied to me and to Lord
Sharman. It
reads:</div><a name="06071368000224"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Dear
Attorney General</div> <a name="06071368000225"></a><div class="hs_brev">I
should like to raise with you concerns I have with provisions contained
in the Company Law Reform Bill addressing derivative actions and, in
particular, with the new clause 222, dealing with
ratification.</div> <a name="06071368000226"></a><div class="hs_brev">On any
view the proposal to overturn the rule in Pavlides v Jensen is a major
step and potentially undermines two cardinal principles of company law
- that companies are run in the interests of shareholders as a whole,
and majority rule. In my younger days I acted for many arbitrageurs and
hedge funds. It is my view that the existence of this rule is one of
the principal reasons why we do not have greenmail problem in this
country. If the bill in its current form becomes law we may well start
to experience the sort of secretly-settled derivative actions which
have plagued other jurisdictions, especially in light of the company
court's indulgent attitude to costs awards in company cases. Of course,
that risk would be reduced if the court's consent were to be required
for the settlement or discontinuance of any derivative action which it
has permitted.</div>
<a name="06071368000227"></a><div class="hs_brev">Derivative actions should
benefit all shareholders and as I have said majority rule is a cardinal
principle in our company law. It is important that the objective
business judgement of majority shareholders, expressed by means of a
ratification resolution, should be allowed to prevail to bar derivative
proceedings brought alleging neglect or default on the part of
directors. In this regard, it seemed to me that the provision in the
earlier draft of the bill (clause 217) rendering ineligible the votes
of members with a personal interest (perhaps because of an interest in
the counterparty to a transaction complained of) was enough to ensure
that ratification was done objectively by disinterested shareholders.
However, the new clause 222, which would disregard the votes given by
any shareholder connected with a director, does something
different.</div><a name="06071368000228"></a><div class="hs_brev">To begin
with, I should like to make two comments on what you said when
introducing the new provision. First, although the concept of connected
persons will be familiar to directors in the context of disclosure of
shareholder interests (usually but a minor irritation) it is quite a
different matter to use it in the context of disenfranchisement.
Secondly, it was unfortunate that you should seek to justify stripping
such a connected person of his property (that is, his voting rights) by
suggesting that he is likely to be biased or in some way under the
influence of wrongdoers.</div>
<a name="06071368000229"></a><div class="hs_brev">There are many companies whose
shares are publicly traded and who have controlling investors.
Naturally, in such cases among the directors of the publicly traded
company will frequently be individuals connected with the controllers,
for example a director who is also a trustee of an ultimately
controlling family or charitable trust. If the new wording were to
become law such controlling shareholders would be disenfranchised on a
ratification vote to approve a business decision (perhaps an investment
or disinvestment) which is challenged as negligent and reduced to
having their views taken 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column649" />Column number: 650</div>into account by the court when considering, in its discretion, whether
to permit the derivative action. Surely bringing business judgement to
bear on such questions is precisely what shareholding control should be
about. Why should such a shareholder have less of a say on such a
matter than an arbitrageur or hedge fund investor?</div>
<a name="06071368000230"></a><div class="hs_brev">I would respectfully suggest
that it would be sufficient in such a case to ensure that all
shareholders whose votes in favour of ratification are to be counted
have no special personal interest in the matter. This should meet the
point debated between you and Colin Sharman. Clause 222 goes much
further than, as you yourself put it, capturing &#145;...those
members who are motivated or influenced by personal advantage or gain
arising from a vote in favour of
ratification.&#146;&#148;</div><a name="06071368000259"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.15
am</div><a name="06071368000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">That very
balanced, insightful letter deserves consideration. It did not arrive
in time for us to table amendments to reflect Mr.
Hancock&#146;s suggestion that only those who have the advantage of a
personal interest should be barred from voting rather than what is
proposed in the clause, which takes an indiscriminate, blunt approach.
The Minister may wish to comment on Mr. Hancock&#146;s
suggestion.</div><a name="06071368000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">We need to
get the clause right. If we do not, it could further hamper the aim of
making the UK a more business friendly environment. By widening the
scope for derivative actions on one hand and reducing the possibility
of the directors ratifying their actions on the other, the Government
will make it less likely that many talented and able people will come
forward to act as company directors. We hope that the Solicitor-General
will think again about the
matter.</div><a name="06071368000060"></a>

Gentleman&#146;s point about increasing derivative actions; the
approach in the clause is appropriate. However, I have not had the
opportunity to consider the letter, which, I agree, is well argued. It
would be useful if a copy could be given to my right hon. Friend the

consideration during the summer to the points
raised.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071368000309"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> It may well be, but I have not seen it.
My noble Friend the Attorney-General would not normally be the person
who considered the proposal. It would be referred to the Department of
Trade and Industry to be dealt with by my right hon. Friend the
Minister for Industry and the Regions. It is probably being transferred
between Departments at the moment. The appropriate way to deal with it
is to say that we shall consider the points raised. My right hon.

that on that basis the hon. Gentleman will feel able to withdraw the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071368000312"></a>The

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071368000313"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The clause is about restrictions on the use or
disclosure of protected information by the registrar. We have
previously debated access to directors&#146; home addresses, and we
acknowledge that the overall proposed framework represents a step in
the right direction. As I said in earlier debates, more needs to be
done, and this clause is one of the mechanical follow-up
provisions.</div><a name="06071368000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
225(2)(b) states that the registrar is not
obliged</div><a name="06071368000231"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to omit from the
material that is available for public inspection anything registered
before this Chapter comes into
force.&#148;</div><a name="06071368000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendments
are intended either to delete that provision, through amendment No.
258, or to add the words set out in amendment No. 279. The problem is
that there are concerns that, without the amendments, the registrar
will not need to remove directors&#146; home addresses already on the
register once the law changes. That view is held by many outside
interested
parties.</div><a name="06071368000072"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071368000314"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> We have had a long discussion on the protection of
names and addresses on the public record. If I am honest with the hon.
Gentleman, the amendments are difficult because of the practical
constraints that we face. Once the information for a director is on the
record, it could be embedded and appear on hundreds of documents filed
over the years or decades. It would be an understatement to say that it
would be difficult to remove snippets of information from old paper
records and microfiche, and it is important to keep information for
enforcement agencies.</div>
<a name="06071368000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 741 contains the power
to provide for historic records of addresses to be made unavailable for
public inspection. We have discussed that clause, as the hon. Gentleman
knows. We accept that there may be exceptional circumstances in which
it is appropriate for an address to be taken off the public record.
However, each case needs to be considered individually, taking 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column651" />Column number: 652</div>account of practical consideration, the director&#146;s need for
privacy and the implications of the loss of information. We do not
expect there to be more than 10 or 20 such cases. We will consult on
the regulations, but we do not think that the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
suggestion is desirable or
practical.</div><a name="06071368000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">I fully
agree that, if a provision in the Bill or regulations under it required
the Registrar of Companies to omit protected information from the
material available for public inspection, the clause should not relieve
her of that obligation. Amendment No. 279 is not necessary. Clause
741(1)
provides:</div><a name="06071368000232"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;regulations
requiring the registrar, on application, to make an address on the
register unavailable for public
inspection.&#148;</div><a name="06071368000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">We do not
consider that clause 225(2), when read in the context of the other
provisions of the clause, casts doubt on that. I therefore hope that
the hon. Gentleman will withdraw his
amendment.</div><a name="06071368000076"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071368000315"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071368000337"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> We move on to part 11, another significant new
area of the Bill, which is complex and has brought much interest and no
little concern from the City among others. I should especially like to
thank Farrar and Co solicitors for the advice they have given us on the
analysis of this part. Let me set the scene. It applies equally to all
clauses in this part, but I shall not repeat it.</div>
<a name="06071368000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">A shareholder can only bring a
claim on behalf of a company in limited circumstances. Part 11 sets out
a new procedure of derivative actions that enables shareholders to
bring a claim on behalf of the company for breach of duty if that
breach has not been authorised or ratified by the company. Together
with part 10, we believe that that has significant potential to
increase the liability of directors. Before I go any further, I should
like to explain the current common law position and set out what the
Government aim to do.</div>
<a name="06071368000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">Derivative claims are
proceedings brought by a shareholder. Under the Bill, they must be in
respect of a course of action vested in the company, for the purposes
of seeking relief on behalf of the company, and brought only in respect
of courses of action arising from an actual or proposed act or omission
involving negligence, default, breach of duty or breach of trust by a
director of the company.</div>
<a name="06071368000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">To bring a derivative claim, a
shareholder must commence proceedings in the usual way and then apply
to the court for permission to continue the claim. In determining
whether to grant permission, the court is required to take into account
the series of factors set out. There are two major concerns. The first
is that it advances the common law in undesirable ways. The second is
that the effect of the clause, particularly when combined with part 10,
will be detrimental to directors generally. We have tabled amendments
to address those concerns, but the leading common law case on which
codification attempts to build and on which the hon. Member for
Cambridge (David Howarth) is clearly dying to speak, is that of Foss<i class="I">
v. </i>Harbottle. If the Bill&#146;s intention is to enshrine in
statute the well established exception to the rules set out in that
case, our view and that of the lawyers who have advised us is that this
is not immediately achieved by the current drafting.</div>
<a name="06071368000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">The rule in Foss<i class="I"> v.
</i>Harbottle is that a member cannot bring in an action on behalf of
the company for an injury done to the company; the company is the
injured party and the action vests in it. The exceptions to the rule in
Foss<i class="I"> v. </i>Harbottle are, broadly speaking: an infringement of
personal rights of members; ultra vires or illegal transactions on the
basis that the majority cannot ratify such transactions; transactions
requiring the sanction of a special majority; and, importantly, the
fraud and control test whereby the transaction constitutes a fraud on
the minority. This includes fraud proper as well as breach of fiduciary

<div class="Column"><a name="Column653" />Column number: 654</div>duty as a director and when the wrongdoers are in control of the shares
of the company.</div> <a name="06071368000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
non-inclusion of the fraud and control test in the Bill represents a
radical departure from the previous thresholds to a member making a
derivative claim. The result of that non-inclusion is that it will be
easier for shareholders to bring claims against directors. Furthermore,
it is the view of many law firms that the current form of part 11 does
not address concerns about the court having an unlimited discretion in
deciding whether to allow derivative actions to proceed. The
non-inclusion of the fraud and control test represents a fairly radical
departure from the previous thresholds to a member making a derivative
claim.</div><a name="06071368000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">The court will
still be required to consider the evidence and merits at the earliest
stage, and there is a danger that that part of the Companies Bill will
simply create a more complex procedure without any corresponding
reduction in the potential administrative burdens for companies. It
therefore makes sense to amend part 11 to preserve the traditional
thresholds of fraud on the minority and wrongdoer control, as that
would make it clear in statute that the new regime is not intended to
sweep away the existing case
law.</div><a name="06071368000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the new
legislation does not replicate existing case law, it will take some
time for a body of case law to develop. Although of persuasive nature,
the previous rules in Foss <i class="I">v.</i> Harbottle and other case law will
not be directly relevant in determining whether the provisions of the
legislation have been applied. That will create uncertainty for some
period as to the extent of the derivative claim provisions, and the
burden of that will largely fall on the company. That could, in part,
be remedied by the Bill more closely mirroring existing
law.</div><a name="06071368000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">In practice,
derivative claims have been relatively rare to date. It has been
pointed out to us that the Government will achieve relatively little by
enshrining this rare bit of case law into statute. Granted, they will
have codified a part of the common law, but any potential benefit that
that will have&#151;it will be minimal&#151;will be far outweighed
by the possible damage that will be wrought by increased shareholder
litigation and by reducing the number of people who are willing to take
up company directorships in the
UK.</div><a name="06071368000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">A further key
change in the Bill is that the persons engaging in fraudulent conduct
need not have received a benefit. Members will therefore be allowed to
make claims for an honest act or omission of a director if it results
in a breach of duty, regardless of whether they received a benefit.
Under Foss <i class="I">v.</i> Harbottle, it is not permissible to make a
derivative claim as a result of negligent action unless the person in
breach of duty receives a corresponding benefit. The Bill represents a
shift from the existing position, in that the focus is much more on
allowing member control of directors&#146;
actions.</div><a name="06071368000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">The range of
circumstances under which a derivative action may be brought will be
much wider than is currently the case. A shareholder who brings
proceedings must apply to the court for permission to continue the
claim. If the court judges that a person seeking to promote the success
of the company for the benefit of the shareholders would not continue
the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column654" />Column number: 655</div>claim, permission must be refused. Permission must also be refused if
the conduct complained of has been authorised or ratified by the
company&#151;that is, by the
shareholders.</div><a name="06071368000121"></a>

slightly.</div><a name="06071368000125"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071368000340"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I call Mr. Djanogly to
respond.</div><a name="06071368000126"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071368000341"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I am delighted by that reassuring point of order
from the Solicitor-General. I shall do my best to keep up the
heightened tension.</div><a name="06071368000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
we debated earlier, there will also be a significant tightening in the
law in relation to the ratification procedure which will make it more
difficult for a director&#146;s act to be ratified. On any resolution
to ratify a director&#146;s negligence, default, breach of trust or
breach of duty, the votes of shareholders who are personally interested
in the ratification must be disregarded. The consequence of that is
that ratification will be more difficult to achieve and that there are
therefore likely to be more derivative actions. The consequences of the
prospect of more derivative actions for company directors is grave,
especially when the prospect is made more likely by the extension of
possible liabilities that face directors under part 10. This is once
again an area of law about which the Government have said that the
intention is to codify the existing common law position. Unfortunately,
once again they are overturning the common law position.</div>
<a name="06071368000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">Parts 10 and 11 in effect
create what my noble Friend Lord Hodgson referred to as a
&#147;double whammy&#148;&#151;an exciting term for the House of
Lords&#151;for company directors. The codification of both the basis
on which to bring a claim and the means by which that claim is brought
will serve only to make it easier for claims to be brought against
company directors. There is a real concern that that will act as a
disincentive to people who might want to become directors in the
future, which can only be detrimental to UK plc.</div>
<a name="06071368000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">The concern about the interplay
between parts 10 and 11 and the effect that that will have was well set
out by Neil Fagan, a partner in the law firm Lovells, in his article in
<i class="I">Insurance Day </i>on 16 December last year. After discussing the
part 10 duties in some details, he went on to say:</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column655" />Column number: 656</div><a name="06071368000235"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Significantly,
there is now a provision for derivative claims to be brought. A
derivative claim may be brought in respect of a cause of action arising
from an act or proposed act or omission involving negligence, default,
a breach of duty or breach of trust by a director of the company. The
cause of action may be against the director or another person (or
both). Thus the rule in <i class="I">Foss v Harbottle,</i> that shareholders
cannot sue directors (subject to certain exemptions), is presumably to
die after approximately 150 years.</div>
<a name="06071368000236"></a><div class="hs_brev">A member of a company who
brings a derivative claim must apply to court for permission to
continue it. Among other factors the court must consider whether the
member is acting in good faith in seeking to continue the
claim.</div> <a name="06071368000237"></a><div class="hs_brev">There are
other provisions in relation to derivative claims but this is clearly a
significant change in the law. One can only hope that the provision
that the member should act in good faith is sufficient to stop spurious
or speculative claims.&#148;</div>
<a name="06071368000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">The fear that increased
litigation might lead to increased insurance costs is also real for
company directors. My hon. Friend the Member for Hornchurch (James
Brokenshire) mentioned that when we discussed part 10. Should the rates
that directors and officers have to pay go up, there will be a further
disincentive to people becoming company directors in the UK. That is
becoming a consistent theme of parts 10 and 11, and it is not a happy
one.</div> <a name="06071368000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">To illustrate
the potential problem, I shall read from an article in <i class="I">Insurance
Times</i> from November of last year, which
states:</div><a name="06071368000238"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Proposed
company law reforms could lead to a rise in directors&#146; and
officers&#146; (D&amp;O) premiums, Heath Lambert has
predicted.</div><a name="06071368000239"></a><div class="hs_brev">The Company
Law Reform Bill attempts to clarify directors&#146; duty of
care.</div><a name="06071368000240"></a><div class="hs_brev">Mark Hardinge,
Heath Lambert&#146;s chief executive of financial and professional
risks, said it was inevitable that insurers would seek to increase
rates as the Bill could increase the scope of negligence claims against
executive
management.&#148;</div><a name="06071368000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">Now that
there is a statutory basis for a derivative action, it will be easier
for shareholders to sue directors or others for a broader range of
conduct than would be possible under the common law.</div>
<a name="06071368000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">The implication of that
extended right to sue has been well set out by city solicitors Norton
Rose in their briefing note of December 2005, which
states:</div><a name="06071368000241"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
extending the conduct in respect of which shareholders can complain,
there is a concern that the new provisions may be abused by disgruntled
or activist shareholders. In addition to the possibility of claims for
negligence, the ability to claim for breach of duty would allow a
shareholder to bring a claim (although the court might not allow it to
continue) for breach of any of the new general statutory
duties...as well as regulatory obligations, such as environmental
or health and safety obligations, of which there are many. Shareholders
in quoted companies could bring claims for matters such as breaches of
the Listing Rules or the Disclosure Rules. The new statutory right
provides another tool for use by activist shareholders to push for
change at underperforming companies. How useful this will be will
depend on the court&#146;s willingness to exercise its discretion to
intervene in what, in many cases, will be simply commercial
decision-making by the company, its directors and majority
shareholders. In any event, boards should review the wording of their
D&amp;O insurance policies to ensure that defending derivative claims
is
covered.&#148;</div><a name="06071368000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government claim that the new statutory derivative procedure is aimed
at making the law</div>
<a name="06071368000242"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;clearer and more accessible, but
will not result in a major change in the law.&#148;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column656" />Column number: 657</div><a name="06071368000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">That statement was made by the then
Minister, the right hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth (Alun
Michael), in a letter to the <i class="I">Financial Times</i> on 9
November
2005.</div>
<a name="06071368000263"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.45
am</div><a name="06071368000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is now clear
from our analysis and the comments that we have received from a
significant number of stakeholders in this area that the then Minister
was wrong to claim this. In fact, the proposed statutory claim is
wider, but there are a number of other significant changes that I would
like the Government to comment on. The question of cost has been raised
by the solicitors Farrer and Co. In May 2006, it
wrote:</div><a name="06071368000243"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
legislation does not specifically deal with the question of costs. In
the event that a member is granted the right to take a derivative
action (whether or not successful), the assumption is that the court
would require the company to pay the costs of the action. Does this
extend to the costs of the defendant if the derivative claim is not
successful? Will the company be required to bankroll an action which
may last for some years with significant costs in circumstances where
the duly elected board has no control? This could be
clarified.</div> <a name="06071368000244"></a><div class="hs_brev">The costs
of a derivative action will ultimately be borne by the company in
circumstances where it is obliged to take action to defend a claim or
simply to make representations. In particular, given the lack of
information that a member may have, this may lead to an unduly
bureaucratic and costly process (both in terms of cash and management
time) for
companies.&#148;</div><a name="06071368000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
concern that part 11 will increase the potential liabilities for
directors and the chance of tactical and vexatious litigation by
activist shareholders is well expressed in this June 2006 briefing from
the law firm Allen and
Overy:</div><a name="06071368000245"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We are
concerned that Part 11 empowers shareholders to commence litigation
against the directors without consulting or informing the board. This
firstly increases the chances of tactical litigation, secondly creates
the capacity for disruption and thirdly gives the shareholder a primary
(rather than a derived) right to bring a claim in the company's name.
To elaborate on the third point, it is a fundamental principle of
company law that directors owe their duties to the company and that
therefore the company has the primary right to sue them in respect of
wrongdoing. At present a shareholder derives a right to sue in the
company&#146;s name in particular circumstances, including because
the wrongdoers who control the company will not exercise the
company&#146;s primary right to sue. By failing to include a
requirement that the board be consulted or informed about a
shareholder&#146;s intention to sue the directors in the
company&#146;s name, the company will be deprived of an opportunity
to exercise its primary right to sue in any circumstance where the
shareholder chooses not to consult the
board.&#148;</div><a name="06071368000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
summing up how dangerous this part of the Bill may be for company
directors, I would like to quote from an article by Robert Watts in
<i class="I">The Daily Telegraph </i>on 29 January
2006.</div><a name="06071368000139"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06071368000342"></a><b class="B">Mrs.
Louise Ellman</b> (Liverpool, Riverside) (Lab/Co-op): The hon.
Gentleman has been speaking for nearly 15 minutes on this issue, which
is clearly important to him, but I note that he does not have a single
supporter here. Is he really intent on scrutiny, or is this
some kind of monologue, which none of his own side is
interested in?</div>
<a name="06071368000140"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071368000343"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> No, my own side are very interested in this, but
they know what I am going to say. The hon. Lady does not, so I thought
that I would give her the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column657" />Column number: 658</div>full benefit of my considerations. This is a matter of great importance
to companies and company directors, and I trust that she will bear with
me.</div><a name="06071368000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">The article
states:</div><a name="06071368000246"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Meanwhile,
there are even greater concerns about the part that relates to
derivative claims. These are court actions that, the bill says, may be
brought by shareholders against the directors in relation to &#145;an
actual or proposed act or omission involving negligence, default,
breach of duty or breach of trust by a director of the
company.&#146;</div><a name="06071368000247"></a><div class="hs_brev">In
fact, the bill goes on to say that the action can be brought against a
&#145;director or another person (or both)&#146;. Former directors,
consultants and even lowly employees who own stock could also face
these actions, it states.</div>
<a name="06071368000248"></a><div class="hs_brev">It will be relatively easy for
a shareholder to launch a claim, but any such action would need a
court&#146;s permission to continue.
</div><a name="06071368000249"></a><div class="hs_brev">Such actions could be
costly, distressing and last for years. Equitable Life, for instance,
pursued 15 former directors, initially claiming damages of
&#163;1.7bn, in an action that lasted for more than four years before
the two sides settled.</div>
<a name="06071368000250"></a><div class="hs_brev">Lawyers are divided on whether
such actions could become commonplace. It would all depend on how the
courts interpreted what almost all parties agree is badly drafted
legislation.&#148;</div><a name="06071368000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">Many
company lawyers are concerned that the Bill might spawn an industry of
&#147;ambulance-chasing&#148; legal firms similar to those that
have fed off personal injury claims. Richard Ufland, a corporate
finance partner at Lovells,
said:</div><a name="06071368000251"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Law
firms will be able to take on &#145;no-win no-fee&#146; claims in
this area... This is an important consideration for the Government
in deciding whether to extend these actions. There is also the concern
that activist shareholders may grab at any chance to use court actions
as a means of trying to force through changes they
want.&#148;</div><a name="06071368000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our
amendments would rectify the problems that I have highlighted.
Amendment No. 485 was originally tabled in the Lords and would remove
subsection (2)(b). This is what Lord Hodgson argued in Grand Committee
in the
Lords:</div><a name="06071368000252"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;This
first amendment would remove subsection (2)(b). Section 459 of the
Companies Act 1985 provides a separate cause of action to shareholders
where their company&#146;s affairs have been conducted in an
&#145;unfairly prejudicial&#146; manner. Section
461&#148;</div><a name="06071368000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">of that
Act</div><a name="06071368000253"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;then gives the court
wide powers to grant relief in respect of the matter complained of.
There is, therefore, no place or need for a derivative claim as
provided in Clause 243(2)(b) of the Bill&#151;the court has all the
appropriate jurisdiction under Section 461.</div>
<a name="06071368000254"></a><div class="hs_brev">It has been argued to us that
the existence of Section 459 is another reason why the codification of
derivative claims need not take place: there is already a working
method whereby aggrieved shareholders can exercise their rights. If
this codification goes ahead, the Bill should not muddy the waters with
such a reference to Section 459, which is a stand-alone procedure
unrelated to derivative claims.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report,
House of Lords </i>27 February 2006; Vol. 679, c. GC
3.]</div><a name="06071368000146"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06071368000344"></a><b class="B">David
Howarth</b> (Cambridge) (LD): I have some sympathy with at
least one of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s amendments, but amendment No.
485 is puzzling. As I read it, clause 243(1)(b) restricts the scope of
derivative claims by putting in an additional requirement that such a
claim can be proceeded with only when the claimant seeks relief on
behalf of the company. I may have misread it, but it seems to me that
the amendment implies that derivative claims could be brought on
personal rights. That would be a broader right than that in the
Bill.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071368000345"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> No. I think the hon. Gentleman has misconstrued
our amendment, which basically says that the clause is confusing the
derivative process with the section 459 process and that they should be
kept
separate.</div><a name="06071368000148"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071368000346"></a>David
Howarth:</b> It seems to me that the opposite is the case and
that the purpose of clause 243(1)(b) is precisely to separate personal
rights, which come under section 456, or whatever it will be when the
legislation is consolidated, and bringing true derivative claims on
behalf of the company. If clause 243(1)(b) were removed, the confusion
that the hon. Gentleman seeks to avoid would be more likely to
exist.</div><a name="06071368000149"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071368000347"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The hon. Gentleman has his view and I am not
sure that I agree with it, but it is certainly worth thinking about
further.</div><a name="06071368000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 243(3)
states:</div><a name="06071368000255"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
derivative claim under this Chapter may be brought only in respect of a
cause of action arising from an actual or proposed act or omission
involving negligence, default, breach of duty or breach of trust by a
director of the
company.&#148;</div><a name="06071368000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our view is
that the wording of that subsection is not sufficiently precise and is
too wide. In particular, the use of the words &#147;or
proposed&#148; go too far. A member should not have a statutory right
to make a derivative claim to restrain some proposed act or omission.
The intention should be to provide a remedy for a member when there has
been an actual act or omission. To include the words &#147;or
proposed&#148; may be a charter for members to take action at any
time to restrain what they think is a potential future breach of the
relevant duties. We propose to amend the clause as set out in amendment
No. 494.</div><a name="06071368000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Institute
of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales raised some concerns in
its April 2006 briefing, which form the basis of several amendments.
Amendments Nos. 487 and 488 are ICAEW amendments and I want to read
from the institute&#146;s briefing of 27 April, which sets out its
concerns and which we
support:</div><a name="06071368000256"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
are concerned that the draft clauses in the Bill do not reflect the
DTI&#146;s intention as stated in its explanatory material and agreed
during the Committee stage debate, codifying existing common law
principles on derivative actions. They create new rights for members to
bring a derivative action against persons other than directors and
against directors in cases of negligence, default, breach of duty or
breach of trust, as well as fraud. An actual or alleged breach of duty
by a director (for example, in preparing incorrect accounts) could
effectively be used as a &#145;springboard&#146; for the member to
bring a derivative action against others (for example, an auditor). We
believe this will encourage nuisance claims against directors in order
to open up a route to
others.&#148;</div><a name="06071368000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">The purpose of
amendment No. 487, therefore, is to tie the clause down to directors.
However, I would be interested to hear from the Solicitor-General who
he thinks could be caught by the last line of subsection
(3).</div><a name="06071368000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">The briefing
paper continues:</div>
<a name="06071368000257"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In addition, allowing
an action in respect of a cause which arose before the person seeking
to bring the derivative claim became a member of the company, could
attract people to become members purely to make a claim, after the
event.&#148;</div><a name="06071368000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is why
amendment No. 488 would delete subsection (4).</div>

McCabe</b> (Birmingham, Hall Green) (Lab): On a point of
order, Mr. Illsley. Is there anything you can do to ensure
that we concentrate on scrutinising the Bill rather than having to

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071368000349"></a>The

<a name="06071368000160"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071368000351"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> I think the hon. Gentleman is doing his
best. This is an important part of the Bill and unfortunately he is the
only Conservative Member present. It is a sad reflection on his
colleagues that on a serious matter such as this they have allowed him
to read out&#151;at great length, in what appears to be merely a
time-wasting exercise&#151;a series of rather repetitious notes from
various solicitors&#146;
firms.</div><a name="06071368000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, the
hon. Gentleman has made some important points, which I shall be happy
to deal with in due course. However, the Committee has been treated
with some contempt by the Conservatives, who have simply cleared the
room and gone away. They appear not to be concerned about what the hon.
Gentleman claims is an important issue.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071368000352"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The Solicitor-General has jumped in and made his
political point. I have not been repetitious and I have brought up some
matters that are very important to many stakeholders.</div>
<a name="06071368000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">We should not forget that the
primary right is that it is for the company itself to initiate the
action. Amendment No. 495 would embed that right in primary legislation
by reiterating that the company should be given a reasonable period in
which to decide to take action before a derivative claim is
stated.</div><a name="06071368000164"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071368000353"></a>David
Howarth:</b> The hon. Gentleman thought that I was dying to
intervene to explain the law on Foss <i class="I">v. </i>Harbottle. When I
lectured on the subject, it took several weeks to explain the law on
that case. I am far from dying to intervene at such great
length.</div><a name="06071368000165"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071368000354"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes my point: he said he
spent weeks talking about the case. I spoke for a mere 20 minutes on
Foss <i class="I">v.</i> Harbottle, yet the Government Whip complains that I took
up too much
time.</div><a name="06071368000166"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071368000355"></a>David
Howarth:</b> My point, which is rather different, is that
because the law is so complex it is perfectly reasonable for the
company law review and the Government to attempt to put it in statutory
form. However, there is a problem with that exercise, which 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column660" />Column number: 661</div>leads to some of the queries that have been raised. The statute does not
say what the purpose is of the rule in Foss <i class="I">v</i>. Harbottle, and,
because it lacks that statement of purpose, questions about the scope
of the statute come into play.</div>
<a name="06071368000264"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10
am</div><a name="06071368000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">It has to be
remembered that the purpose of the rule in Foss <i class="I">v</i>. Harbottle is
to prevent legal actions that waste everyone&#146;s time and effort.
Legal actions being brought by shareholders on behalf of a company for
claims that are the company&#146;s claims, which claims are doomed to
failure if the company takes action or is capable of taking action,
would make those breaches of duty moot&#151;because, for example,
they had been
ratified.</div><a name="06071368000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">The key
point that is missing from the Bill, because it is legislation rather
than a set of common law cases, is that basic statement of purpose. It
is the job of the Solicitor-General and the Minister to say what the
purpose is. If the Government were to reaffirm that the purpose of the
statutory provisions is to maintain the existing law&#151;that the
purpose of the exercise is to prevent legal actions that are a waste of
time&#151;many of our fears would be reduced.</div>
<a name="06071368000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have other uncertainties
about Foss <i class="I">v</i>. Harbottle&#151;for instance, whether the rule is
about procedure or whether substantive elements are hidden within it.
That is why it took so long to explain. The procedure elements and the
substantive elements&#151;for instance, about directors&#146;
duties&#151;tend to get confused in case law, which is why it is a
good idea for the Bill to separate the two.</div>
<a name="06071368000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Solicitor-General should
state that, in the Bill, the view being taken of derivative action is
purely procedural and that the underlying substantive rights are dealt
with elsewhere. For example, when the hon. Member for Huntingdon raised
the benefit point, it was about the underlying substantive legal
actions rather than the procedure for derivative action, which is what
these clauses are about. That is precisely the kind of confusion in
case law that the Bill is trying to sort
out.</div><a name="06071368000171"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071368000356"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> I assure the hon. Gentleman that we are
reaffirming the purpose behind the rule in Foss <i class="I">v</i>. Harbottle,
and that we do not in any way seek to repeal it. The courts will still
be referring to it.</div>
<a name="06071368000172"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071368000357"></a>David
Howarth:</b> I thank the Solicitor-General. That statement
will help us in interpreting the
provisions.</div>
<a name="06071368000173"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071368000358"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman not think that the
omission of the fraud control exclusions will in practice change the
law?</div><a name="06071368000174"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071368000359"></a>David
Howarth:</b> That is an interesting point. We shall come to it
in a later clause, and I may remark on it then.</div>
<a name="06071368000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">There have always been problems
in defining fraud on the minority. Indeed, a leading academic thinks
that it should never have been called fraud on the minority, but that
it should be fraud on the company. One 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column661" />Column number: 662</div>explanation of why that is not being sorted out in the Bill is because
it is not that easy to define fraud on the
minority.</div>
<a name="06071368000176"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071368000360"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> If we are going to codify and move away from the
common law, should not the issue that the hon. Gentleman says is
difficult be
addressed?</div><a name="06071368000177"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071368000361"></a>David
Howarth:</b> That is a good point, and I would be interested
to hear the Solicitor-General&#146;s comments on it. That brings me
back to the question with which I started&#151;whether the fraud is
part of the substantive law or part of procedural law.</div>
<a name="06071368000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 495 is helpful.
It provides that a claim could be brought only after the claimant had
approached the board. That brings me back to Foss <i class="I">v</i>. Harbottle.
It is about trying to prevent legal action from being brought by
shareholders if action is being taken by the appropriate organ of the
company. As I said when discussing directors&#146; duties, in most
cases that organ will initially be the board of
directors.</div><a name="06071368000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">To stop
mischief of the sort that Foss <i class="I">v</i>. Harbottle is designed to
prevent, the amendment would require people who wish to bring
derivative claims to approach the board of directors first, and only if
the board turned down the request to bring an action in the
company&#146;s name should there be any question of derivative action
being taken by the
shareholders.</div><a name="06071368000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have
explained why I do not think that amendment No. 485, which would leave
out paragraph (b), is helpful. It would tend to create precisely the
confusion that it seeks to prevent over the difference between a
personal action by a shareholder and an action brought on behalf of a
company. That brings us back to one reason for it taking so long to
explain the law in Foss <i class="I">v. </i>Harbottle to those trying to learn
it&#151;it is not entirely clear what the exceptions to the rule in
that case are. Three of the four are not really exceptions, but simply
examples of the rule not applying in the first place. The only real
exception is the fourth, so-called fraud on the
minority.</div><a name="06071368000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not
sure that amendment No. 494, which would leave out the words &#147;or
proposed&#148;, is helpful. There are circumstances in which it would
save everyone&#146;s time and effort for disputes to be sorted out
before damage occurred. It might be helpful if there were at least
discussions on action early, particularly if the damage might not be
able to be remedied later. The amendment is not helpful, but I
understand the
point.</div><a name="06071368000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
487 is a probing amendment to find out who the other person referred to
might be. I suppose that the obvious suggestion is that it would be the
company secretary, who is an officer of the
company.</div>
<a name="06071368000183"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071368000362"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I will also be interested to hear what the
Solicitor-General has to say. The definition of &#147;another
person&#148; could go much further than auditors, a law firm or
employees who own a few share
options.</div><a name="06071368000184"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071368000363"></a>David
Howarth:</b> The question is whether a company will have a
claim against such people. We return to the central idea of
shareholders trying to sue in the company&#146;s name. The underlying
claim must be a claim 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column662" />Column number: 663</div>of the company, not of another person. That is why the question arises
who the other person might
be.</div><a name="06071368000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 488
would leave out subsection (4), which allows late-coming shareholders
to make a claim. The problem, to which leaving out the subsection is
not the answer, is the amount of information about the situation of the
company that might be available to a late-coming shareholder. If we
believed in perfect information and perfect markets, we would say that
in buying shares, a late-coming shareholder takes on the risk for which
the market has discounted the price, and we could therefore reasonably
say that a late-coming shareholder should not be allowed any such
claim. The market transaction would already have taken account of the
risk.</div><a name="06071368000186"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071368000364"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Is there not also a problem in establishing loss
in such a
situation?</div><a name="06071368000187"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071368000365"></a>David
Howarth:</b> No, because the loss is the company&#146;s
loss, not that of the individual shareholder. We keep returning to that
point.</div><a name="06071368000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">The point to
consider is whether a late-coming shareholder takes on any underlying
risk of loss to the company, as the company&#146;s value will already
be less having been discounted by the market. The counterpoint to that,
on which I will be interested to hear the Solicitor-General&#146;s
comments, is the extent to which the clause is aimed at companies whose
shares are not freely traded and whose value might therefore not
represent all the information that might have been available. Trades
occur in circumstances in which information does not fully discount the
price of shares, which might cause
difficulties.</div><a name="06071368000189"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071368000366"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the provision
will encourage vexatious activists to take small stakes and arrive, as
Johnny-come-latelies, on the back of something that
happens?</div><a name="06071368000190"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071368000367"></a>David
Howarth:</b> I suppose there is a risk of people doing
that&#151;for example, those who object to the idea of corporate
social responsibility. There are investors of that sort who might want
to challenge, for instance, directors&#146; decisions to follow
environmental policies. The question, however, is whether the
safeguards in the rest of the Bill will discourage such people. It
seems unlikely that such a person will be able to meet the requirements
in the other clauses, particularly those relating to the initial
hearing.</div><a name="06071368000191"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071368000368"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Is it not the point that well-funded activists
will not be dissuaded by the cost position, because they will not meet
the costs in any event? They will be making a political
point.</div>
<a name="06071368000192"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071368000369"></a>David
Howarth:</b> There is an issue about how much people are
prepared to pay to make such political points&#151;it might become
very expensive, not only for the individual claimant, but for that
person&#146;s solicitor, assuming that the rule continues after the
Bill comes into
force.</div><a name="06071368000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is the
problem of the solicitor&#146;s personal liability for bringing
derivative claims or claims under the exceptions in Foss <i class="I">v.</i>
Harbottle when they should 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column663" />Column number: 664</div>not have done so, because they have, in effect, claimed to be the
company when they are not. In a way, however, the deterrence and the
value of claims are matters for the cost rules as much as for the
procedural rules.</div> <a name="06071368000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
underlying point on subsection (4) concerns the belief in the
efficiency of markets, particularly share markets. The question is
whether that is different, depending on whether we are looking at
companies that are publicly quoted on the stock market or companies
that are not, and whether further thought might be given to the
application of the
rule.</div><a name="06071368000195"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071368000370"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> I find myself in broad agreement with
quite a lot of what the hon. Gentleman has said, and he has also dealt
with some points raised by the hon. Member for Huntingdon. The
provisions will not produce a substantial increase in derivative
claims&#151;as he said himself, such claims are rare, and we expect
them to remain relatively rare. The introduction of the provisions will
not be a significant deterrent to people becoming
directors.</div>
<a name="06071368000196"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071368000371"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> One solicitor told me that anyone who called a
solicitor now to ask how to make a derivative claim would be told,
&#147;This is all common law. It&#146;s very complicated.
It&#146;s not down in statute.&#148; He told me that putting the
procedure in statute will make it more straightforward, so more people
will take it
up.</div><a name="06071368000197"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071368000372"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> In other words, the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s view is that the more confusion there is, the
better, but I do not accept that that is the appropriate approach. The
Government&#146;s view is that we should set things out in statute;
indeed, the Conservative party said that it wanted certain provisions
on company law put in statute. We have included the derivative actions
provisions, and I appreciate that the Conservatives might not like
that, but this area of law is important and people should know what it
is all about.</div><a name="06071368000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want
to deal with a couple of the points raised by the hon. Gentleman and
with some of his amendments. He quoted from the <i class="I">Insurance Times
</i>and <i class="I">Insurance Day</i>, but I should point out that those quotes
are from before the Government tabled amendments on Report in the Lords
to address some concerns that he
mentioned.</div><a name="06071368000265"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.15
am</div><a name="06071368000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman also suggested that the rule in Foss <i class="I">v. </i>Harbottle
would die after 150 years, but that is not the case. The principle that
only the company can sue remains. We are discussing the exceptions to
the rule, which have developed over 150 years, and in a rather confused
way, as the hon. Member for Cambridge said. That is rather unhelpful
because there are exceptions that are not really exceptions, and the
situation has become somewhat confusing. That is why the Law Commission
thought that there should be a new provision. However, the basic rule
remains and it is the cornerstone of this area of law. Our overall aim
is implementation of the recommendation of the Law Commission that the
right to bring a derivative action in common law should be replaced by
a new derivative 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column664" />Column number: 665</div>procedure with more modern, flexible and accessible criteria for
determining whether a shareholder can pursue an action.</div>
<a name="06071368000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">We agree with the Law
Commission that it is important that procedural requirements for
bringing a derivative claim are accessible and clearly set out so that
they can be understood by shareholders and directors. It is important
to emphasise that this part of the Bill does not introduce a wholly new
mechanism. The derivative claim is a well established procedure by
which shareholders can, in certain circumstances, bring an action in
the name of the company. It is in effect a failsafe mechanism rather
than a weapon of first resort. It is important to remember that
although members who bring an action can be required to bear heavy
legal costs, damages are paid to the company rather than to the
individual shareholders. So inherent in the whole procedure is a
deterrent against bringing frivolous
actions.</div><a name="06071368000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">There will
also continue to be very tight judicial control of cases brought under
the new procedure. A derivative action is not the same thing as a
shareholder or class action in the American courts, which is brought in
the name of a group of shareholders. Under the reforms of
directors&#146; liabilities introduced by the Companies (Audit,
Investigations and Community Enterprise) Act 2004, companies may
already indemnify directors against any liability incurred in respect
of such actions, even if the judgment is given against the director.
The new statutory procedure differs from the common law in two key
respects.</div> <a name="06071368000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">First, we
do not want the claimant to have to show wrongdoer control&#151;that
the directors whom the claimant believes have acted in breach of their
duties to the company are in control of the company&#151;as this may
make it impossible for a derivative claim to be brought successfully by
a member of a widely held company, including almost all major quoted
companies. We also want it to be possible to bring a claim in cases of
negligence, even if it cannot be shown that the directors have profited
from the negligence. In doing so we want to achieve a proper balance
between the ability of directors to take business decisions in good
faith and the right of minority shareholders so that shareholders can
bring meritorious claims on behalf of the company.</div>
<a name="06071368000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is clearly important that we
protect directors from vexatious and frivolous claims, but we must also
protect the right of shareholders. <i class="I">[Interruption.]</i> May I just
point out that I am absolutely delighted that, as I have risen to
speak, the Conservatives have trooped in. The Conservative Front-Bench
spokesman, the hon. Member for Huntingdon, cleared the room. I stood up
to speak and Members rush back in. I take that as a
compliment.</div><a name="06071368000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">We do not
accept that putting the derivative action on a statutory footing will
lead to more claims against directors. It is important that there is
greater clarity about how a shareholder may bring a derivative action.
It is unlikely that the proposal will result in a significant increase
in the number of actions. However, we have made it clear from the
beginning that we want claims to be dismissed by the courts at the
earliest possible opportunity and without involving companies. The
reforms introduced to civil procedure by Lord Woolf, however, mean that
certain unmeritorious cases 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column665" />Column number: 666</div>may get further before being thrown out. We have therefore tabled a
number of reforms to those procedures to ensure that unmeritorious
claims can be dismissed at an early
stage.</div><a name="06071368000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am in broad
agreement with the hon. Member for Cambridge on his analysis of
amendment No. 485 and I will not burden the Committee by repeating it.
Amendment No. 494 is based on a misunderstanding of the current law and
of the position under the statutory statement of directors&#146;
general duties. Clause 164 provides that the consequences of breach or
threatened breach of the statutory duties are the same as would apply
if the corresponding common law rule or equitable rule applied. The
reference to threatened breaches is important.</div>
<a name="06071368000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under the present law companies
may be able to take pre-emptive action to drop a breach of duty from
taking place before it happens and the damage is done. There could, for
example, be a threatened breach of duty if a director is refused
permission to exploit a corporate opportunity but announces that he is
going to go ahead anyway. The remedies in such cases, which include an
injunction or declaration, provide an important safeguard of the
company&#146;s interest against wrongdoing by a director. A
derivative action is an action brought by the company, as the hon.
Member for Huntingdon repeatedly said, and there is no sensible basis on which the
remedies available to the court should be limited in the way proposed
in the case of a derivative
claim.</div><a name="06071368000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">On amendment
No. 487, we followed a clear Law Commission recommendation in drafting
the clause. It may be helpful if I set out a couple of examples cited
by the commission. In the first, relief is sought from a third party
for knowing receipt of money or property transferred in breach of
trust. It seems correct that the member should be entitled to pursue a
remedy against a third party that is holding assets belonging to the
company that it has obtained in such
circumstances.</div><a name="06071368000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the
second example, a profitable company is a victim of a tort by a third
party. The directors, although otherwise committed to the well-being of
the company, have ulterior motives for not wishing to enforce the
remedy for the tort. Although the directors would in such circumstances
be in breach of duty, the breach would not give rise to a claim.
Therefore, it would not be open to a member to bring derivative
proceedings against the third party. Again, we believe that that is the
right outcome.</div><a name="06071368000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope
that those examples help to show that it is possible to uphold
important principles while placing reasonable constraints on the
application of the provision, and that it will not result in members
seeking to bring derivative claims against third parties simply because
they disagree with a
board.</div><a name="06071368000210"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071368000373"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Does the Solicitor-General consider that the
provision will likely be expanded to cover auditors and, indeed,
employees other than directors?</div>
<a name="06071368000211"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071368000374"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> I shall consider that, but as far as we
are concerned, it is not open to people to bring derivative actions
merely because of a disagreement. There must be a clear view that
something is damaging, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column666" />Column number: 667</div>not to individuals but to the company itself. On that basis, I hope that
the hon. Gentleman is able to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="06071368000212"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071368000375"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> What about amendment No.
495?</div><a name="06071368000213"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071368000376"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> The hon. Gentleman is quite right. I
have not dealt with amendment No. 495 or, for that matter, amendment
No. 488.</div><a name="06071368000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">On amendment
No. 488, clause 243(4) responds to the request from some respondents to
the company law reform White Paper, including the Law Society, that
part 11 should state clearly that it is immaterial whether the cause of
action arose before or after the person seeking to bring or continue
the derivative claim became a member of the company. That reflects the
position in the common law on derivative
action.</div><a name="06071368000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">On amendment
No. 495, at present a derivative claim is not available to the minority
shareholder unless he can show, to put it briefly, that the wrongdoers
are in control. The Law Commission observed that the meaning of
&#147;wrongdoer control&#148; is not clear, and as long ago as 1962
the Jenkins committee said that it would be extremely difficult to
devise a satisfactory general provision expressing the concept and the
remainder of the exception to the rule in Foss <i class="I">v.</i> Harbottle in
wider terms. That is why the Law Commission proposed a new statutory
remedy and why 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column667" />Column number: 668</div>the clause is drafted as it is. I hope on that basis that the hon.
Gentleman will withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="06071368000216"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071368000377"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The Solicitor-General spoke rapidly towards the
end of his comments on the latter amendments. I found it difficult to
understand what he was saying, so it will be very much a matter of
reading <i class="I">Hansard</i> and perhaps returning to some issues on
Report.</div><a name="06071368000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Solicitor-General suggested that I would sow confusion by removing
certain words from the Bill. That is not what I intended at all. I am
simply recognising the widely held view that the Bill will increase the
amount of litigation and that there will be consequences arising out of
that such as, for example, high insurance costs. He did not face up to
that, answer the question or analyse whether that is likely. He may not
have any research on the subject, but it would have been helpful to
have had some, as we have heard from many people that it is of great
concern.</div><a name="06071368000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">On amendment
No. 494, the Solicitor-General said that the reference to
&#147;proposed act&#148; reflects the common law
position.</div><a name="06071368000219"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">It being
