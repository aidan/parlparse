Hammond</b> (Wimbledon) (Con): I beg to move amendment No. 49,
in clause 30, page 20, line 37, after &#145;Regulation&#146;,
insert &#145;and other interested
parties&#146;.</div>
					<a name="07112782000038"><div class="hs_Para">I am
sure that we will endeavour to live up to your strictures to be alert,
Lady Winterton, and will make good law. The clause will remove the
requirement for new access contracts to be approved by the rail
regulator where they relate to a railway facility forming or to the
principal Crossrail tunnel running through central London. The powers
under the clause are exercisable by the Secretary of State, albeit
after consultation with the Office of Rail Regulation about the terms
of the contract.</div>
					<a name="07112782000039"><div class="hs_Para">The
purpose of the amendment is to insert the words, &#147;other
interested parties&#148;, after the word &#147;Regulation&#148;.
While it is wholly appropriate that the regulator should be consulted
in such a situation, other parties likely to be affected by the
provision are excluded from the consultation. In particular, parties to
the contract itself will have something to say on the subject. The
amendment is designed to allow other interested parties to communicate
with the Secretary of State before she decides to bypass the provisions
of the Railways Act 1993 and allow an access contract to come into
force without the approval of the regulator. While the motivation
behind the clause is clear and I have no objection to it, I think that
it would benefit from a more open and fair consultation under the
amendment.</div>
					<a name="07112782000040"><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112782000393">The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport (Mr.
Tom Harris):
						</b> Good morning, Lady Winterton. May I welcome
you back to the
Chair?</div>
					<a name="07112782000041"><div class="hs_Para">It is often
advisable to start as one means to go on, but I will not do so this
morning, because I intend to begin by more or less accepting the
principle of the amendment. That pattern is not likely to be repeated
throughout the rest of the day. The amendment
requires consultation with interested parties on the terms of a
proposed access contract for Crossrail services in the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column72" />Column number: 72</div>central tunnel that would not be subject to the ORR&#146;s approval.
There is nothing in the clause to stop the Secretary of State from
consulting as she considers appropriate. The point of subsection (4) is
to ensure consultation with the ORR, as the body with expertise and
responsibility, on the terms of access
contracts.</div>
					<a name="07112782000042"><div class="hs_Para">Although
I do not think that it is absolutely necessary, the amendment does have
some merit. The only reason that I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw
it is that I would like parliamentary counsel to see the proposed
wording to ensure that it is robust. If the hon. Gentleman agrees to
withdraw the amendment, we will bring it back on Report and give it a
fair
wind.</div>

Hammond:

propose to carry on in the same vein all day. He has
rather knocked me off my feet by accepting, this early in the day, that
one of our amendments would have a good effect. Given what he says, I
am very happy for him to pass the wording on to parliamentary counsel
and to bring back the proposal on Report. I beg to ask leave to
withdraw the

					<div class="hs_brev">&#145;which shall be subject to
annulment in pursuance of a resolution of either House of
Parliament.&#146;.</div>
					<a name="07112782000046"><div class="hs_Para">This
is a probing amendment with the purpose of seeking a clarification from
the Minister about the appropriate parliamentary procedure called into
action by the clause. I may well have misunderstood that procedure, but
I should be grateful for clarification. In other parts of the Bill
where the Secretary of State exercises her powers by means of statutory
instruments, such an instrument is subject to annulment by Parliament.
That is not so in clause 30. As the Committee will be aware, statutory
instruments may take one of three forms: some are passed by the
affirmative resolution procedure, under which they must be approved by
both Houses before they can become law; some are passed by the negative
procedure under which they are merely laid before Parliament; and some
are not laid before Parliament, but Parliament can annul them. The
parent Act states in which form the relevant power should be exercised
under parliamentary procedure. It would appear from clause 30(5) and
(6) that the statutory instrument in question is to be laid before
Parliament, but is not subject to annulment. Should I therefore assume
that the appropriate procedure is the affirmative resolution procedure?
If so, will the Minister explain why it is different from the other
ways in which the statutory instrument is used in the
Bill?</div>
					<a name="07112782000047"><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112782000396">Mr.
Harris:
						</b> Clause 30 enables the Secretary of State, by
order, to remove the need for ORR approval to access contracts or
amendments so that the Crossrail service can use the central tunnel or
railway facility associated with it. It is essentially new
infrastructure, specifically designed to carry Crossrail services, so a
reserve power is appropriate to ensure that those services are not
subject to approval. The Secretary of State would be required to
consult the ORR on the terms of any contract to which the order
relates.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column73" />Column number: 73</div>
					<a name="07112782000048"><div class="hs_Para">In response to the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s question, the statutory instrument is not
legislative in that respect, unlike the regulations that are made under
clause 33, which are subject to annulment. However, the making of an
order under clause 30 can reasonably be delegated to the Secretary of
State, who would inform Parliament of such a measure. The Delegated
Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee will look at the proposal and we
will pay attention to any observations and recommendations that it
makes. With those reassurances, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will
withdraw his
amendment.</div>

					<div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;( ) Any person
who suffers loss by the directions under this section shall be entitled
to be compensated by the Secretary of
State.&#146;.</div>
					<a name="07112782000054"><div class="hs_Para">Clause
32 is another example of measures that we have seen consistently during
the course of the Bill, in which the Government give themselves more
power to direct the private sector to comply with the needs of
Crossrail. As we have said before, this is an exceptional undertaking
and, therefore, it is an exceptional Bill, which requires exceptional
powers. We have said several times that such powers are often wholly
necessary. We have seen such measures in previous Bills, as the
Minister often reminded us last
week.</div>
					<a name="07112782000055"><div class="hs_Para">However worthy
the clause, I doubt whether the Minister will fail to reflect our
amendment. Do the Government want to be seen to be digging up the
centre of London without due regard to people maybe adversely affected
by the project? I certainly applaud the exhaustive work done by the
Select Committee in listening to the concerns of individuals and
businesses on which the project will have an impact. For the same
reason, I welcome the clauses providing for
compensation to be paid to the railway asset operator, who may suffer
financial loss as a result of Government intervention. We are therefore
surprised and concern that there is no provision for compensation in
the clause.</div>
					<a name="07112782000056"><div class="hs_Para">My
amendment proposes that at the end of line 40 in clause 32, we insert
the words:</div>
					<a name="07112782000352"><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Any person who suffers
loss by the directions under this section shall be entitled to be
compensated by the Secretary of
State.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07112782000057"><div class="hs_Para">The clause
enables the Government to force an owner of a railway facility to open
it up for the purposes of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column74" />Column number: 74</div>constructing Crossrail. It provides that the ORR must approve the terms
of any such imposed contract except, crucially, the terms relating to
financial charges. In other words, the Government can demand to enter
into an access contract with the facility operator but they can also
decide how much they would pay for the privilege. The
matter is apparently not open to negotiation, nor to independent
scrutiny via the regulator, which strikes me as unfair.</div>
					<a name="07112782000058"><div class="hs_Para">The purpose of my amendment
therefore is to ensure that facility owners do not suffer financial
loss as a result of any Government intervention. If a facility owner is
forced to enter into a contract with the Government under terms which
mean that they get less than they would normally get for such a
contract they should be appropriately compensated to make up the
difference. As I said at the outset, I accept that a project of this
nature requires the Secretary of State to take on certain exceptional
powers, but I do accept that the private sector or the private citizen
should necessarily suffer as the clause implies they will. I look
forward to receiving some reassurance from the
Minister.</div>
					<a name="07112782000059"><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07112782000399">
							<b class="B">Mr.
Brian Binley</b> (Northampton, South) (Con): I, too, seek
clarification from the Minister on the point made by my hon. Friend the
Member for Wimbledon. The hybrid Bill Committee spent a lot of time
making sure that people would be fully compensated and that
compensation codes would be written into the whole
Crossrail process. Indeed, we listened to many
petitioners who thought that they were not as well supported respect as
they should be.</div>
					<a name="07112782000060"><div class="hs_Para">The
general thrust of the Committee&#146;s work was that those people
should be protected, and in our report to the House we made that point
again and again. They think that the Government, not deliberately but
often as a result of insensitivity, can roll over them without paying
regard to their concerns or their need to be properly considered. I was
proud to be a member of that Committee for that very reason, because
our work was a perfect example of good government working in the way
that it should. I should like to know whether the Government can demand
to enter into an access contract with a facility owner and can decide,
as my hon. Friend said, how much they will pay for the privilege. If
they can take such action, it would run counter to the general thrust
of the Select Committee, which would be a matter of
concern.</div>
					<a name="07112782000061"><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07112782000400">
							<b class="B">Mr.
Mark Field</b> (Cities of London and Westminster)
(Con): May I associate myself with the
comments made by my hon. Friends the Members for Northampton, South and
for Wimbledon? There is likely to be a new regime on large-scale
planning applications which the Government will wish to push through
Parliament, and I do not want to prejudge the nature of the debate both
in the House of Commons and in another place. However, I have some
sympathy with the Government&#146;s view that some large-scale
developments, whether Crossrail, airport expansion or nuclear power
sites, are vital construction projects, and we simply cannot allow the
long public inquiries and enormous delays that affected similar
developments in recent
decades.</div>
					<a name="07112782000062"><div class="hs_Para">Obviously,
one of the great difficulties is that we have a culture in the House
that gives individuals the right to have their say. There is also a
process of legal and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column75" />Column number: 75</div>sub-judicial inquiry. One of the attractive aspects of the French
scheme&#151;I accept that France has a completely different legal
system&#151;is the notion that certain projects are in the national
interest. Of course, the flip side is that individuals who suffer
receive compensation, no questions asked. In the case of Crossrail,
that would be residents who live
nearby.</div>
				
					<a name="07112782000363"><div class="hs_Timeline">10.45
am</div>
					<a name="07112782000063"><div class="hs_Para">The amendment,
which I hope is helpful, at least begins to point in the direction in
which I suspect the Government want to go with projects such as
Crossrail. In other words, they wish to streamline the entire planning
system, and I have some sympathy with that view. Clearly, we need to
seek out precisely what is intended and we have always had an eye
towards local opinion forming. However, the other side of that equation
must surely be that those individuals whose rights are subverted in
some way qualify immediately for compensation. The amendment, I hope,
would at least provide a step towards that&#151;a template that the
Government must look at to ensure the balance between the protection of
local desires, needs and rights and the broad interests of the
country.</div>
					<a name="07112782000064"><div class="hs_Para">There
is no doubt that the broad interests of London, the south-east and,
indeed, the country require that Crossrail be built rapidly and to high
specification, and that it be up and running at the earliest stage.
However, there is little doubt that the lives of hundreds of thousands
of people will be inconvenienced. In relation to clause 32, we are
really discussing the extent to which the Secretary of State will take
powers beyond those envisaged in the Bill. Those individuals who suffer
should be fully compensated for whatever rights they have to forego in
the public
interest.</div>
					<a name="07112782000065"><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that the Minister will give serious consideration to that point,
even if he feels that the wording of the amendment is not quite right,
because we need to get this important debate right if we are to ensure
that the large-scale construction projects to which the House will be
committed in the coming decades are built properly and to
specification, but in a way that minimises the dissatisfaction of the
many people who will suffer as a
result.</div>
					<a name="07112782000066"><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07112782000401">
							<b class="B">Sir
Peter Soulsby</b> (Leicester, South) (Lab): I have no doubt
that the amendment is well intentioned, but I spent the best part of
two years serving on the hybrid Bill Committee and,
as the hon. Member for Northampton, South reminded us, that Committee
spent a considerable time looking at issues of compensation and how
land and property owners would be affected by Crossrail during
construction and once it was
operational.</div>
					<a name="07112782000067"><div class="hs_Para">We looked
in considerable detail at those whose land and property might be taken
for the Crossrail project, those who might be affected by the railway
passing under their property and the extent to which the existing law
and regulations would provide them with adequate compensation. In broad
terms, we concluded that the compensation code, about which most of us
knew very little when we embarked on the process, was widely based and
appropriate for the overwhelming majority of
situations that would emerge during construction. There were one or two
particular examples 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column76" />Column number: 76</div>to consider, such as the Smithfield market traders, who might not have
got adequate compensation under the code due to a rather peculiar and
long-standing arrangement for their leases, but that was very much the
exception.</div>
					<a name="07112782000068"><div class="hs_Para">While I am
sympathetic to ensuring that people get compensation, I can say that
those Members who served on the hybrid Bill Committee were in general
reassured that the ways in which the code would
operate would be adequate for the overwhelming majority of
circumstances. Therefore, the amendment is unnecessary. I hope that the
Minister can reassure us that the clause is sufficient to ensure that
the compensation code will apply in the circumstances that have been
envisaged here and be more than adequate, as we concluded it will be,
in other
circumstances.</div>
					<a name="07112782000069"><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112782000402">Mr.
Harris:
						</b> I think that I can offer reassurance to all
Members who have expressed concern about the clause. First, I draw
their attention to the fact that it stands within the part of the Bill
entitled &#147;Railway matters&#148;, which sets out a framework
for the operation of Crossrail services following the construction of
the Crossrail
tunnel.</div>
					<a name="07112782000070"><div class="hs_Para">Subsection (1)
states:</div>
					<a name="07112782000353"><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Secretary of State may give directions to a facility owner requiring
him to enter into an access
contract&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07112782000071"><div class="hs_Para">The facility
owner in that regard is the owner of the rail network&#151;in other
words, Network Rail is the intended facility owner. I can understand
why colleagues may have thought that that wording referred to owners of
private enterprises on the tunnel route, but that is not the intention
of the
clause.</div>
					<a name="07112782000072"><div class="hs_Para">Clause
32 deals with the situation in which agreement cannot be reached with
the infrastructure owner for an access contract for Crossrail passenger
services that for at least some of their journey use part of the
central London tunnel. It makes use of the section 18 procedure under
the 1993 Act for agreements that have already been negotiated, but the
process is modified so that the ORR must approve the contract&#146;s
duration and the non-financial terms that address directions made by
the Secretary of
State.</div>
					<a name="07112782000073"><div class="hs_Para">The ORR will
set appropriate financial terms for the access contract so that the
infrastructure owner is appropriately paid for the access it provides.
Clause 32 forces it to sell parts for use by Crossrail services, rather
than selling them to another operator or leaving them
fallow. If that requires contracts between the
infrastructure owner and other operators to be amended, it is dealt
with under clause 33, which considers compensation. As regards the
payment of money between the rail owner and the train operator, the ORR
must consider whether to undertake an access charge review, which would
ensure that the access charges could be reset as
necessary.</div>
					<a name="07112782000074"><div class="hs_Para">As to the
payment of money between the Crossrail project and any affected train
operators, I expect any further compensation necessary to be dealt with
under the normal industry process or adaptations agreed with the ORR,
as I explained at our last sitting in response to the debate on
amendment No.
46.</div>
					<a name="07112782000075"><div class="hs_Para">Essentially, any
existing operator that has to change its access to the existing rail
network&#151;not the Crossrail network&#151;as a result of
Crossrail services running will be forced to enter into a revised
access charge regime. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column77" />Column number: 77</div>That means that, in the first instance, the existing operator will pay
fewer or less access charges than it would normally pay without
Crossrail services being
there.</div>
					<a name="07112782000076"><div class="hs_Para">Further to
that, if the operator suffers a loss of business economically as a
result of losing a particular path to a Crossrail
service, it will be up to normal industry procedures to ascertain what
compensation has to be paid to that train operating company. That will
be dealt with under clause 33 but according to normal accepted industry
procedures, which have already been proved to work quite
well.</div>
					<a name="07112782000077"><div class="hs_Para">Following that
explanation, I urge the hon. Member for Wimbledon to withdraw the

							<a name="07112782000403">Stephen
Hammond:
						</b> I listened carefully to the
Minister&#151;certainly to the latter part of his explanation on how
there will be compensation under clause 33. However, I bring him back
to the beginning of his speech and the fact that the facility operator
post-construction is bound to be Network Rail. The intention is that it
should be Network
Rail.</div>
					<a name="07112782000079"><div class="hs_Para">It may be the
intention for the facility to be one that is owned by Network Rail, but
that is not what the Bill says. The Minister should therefore either
agree to the Bill saying &#147;Network Rail facility&#148; or, if
he intends the provision to be wider, accept my amendment. If he is not
prepared to consider amending the Bill in that way, I shall test the
Committee&#146;s view on the

						</b> I accept that &#147;the facility owner&#148;
is an ambiguous term, but it has been recommended for the purposes of
the Bill and, although I am speculating, given that Network Rail is
currently the private owner of the infrastructure, I do not expect that
situation to change at any point in the next 10 years during the
construction of Crossrail. However, if it were to
change, that would have a knock-on effect on the existing legislation.
Simply to talk about the owner of the infrastructure is far less
ambiguous than the hon. Gentleman suggests. However, if he is going to
ask the Committee to vote on the amendment, I must challenge the
premise, which he stated clearly, of compensating private owners along
the route of the Crossrail tunnel during
construction.</div>
					<a name="07112782000081"><div class="hs_Para">I have
already made it quite clear that this part of the
Bill refers to the operation of passenger services
following the construction of Crossrail. The hon. Gentleman&#146;s
concerns about the lack of compensation arrangements for private owners
who might be inconvenienced by construction do not apply in this case.
I again urge him to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

						</b> Again, I have listened carefully to the Minister.
The amendment does not say anything about construction. It talks about
the loss suffered by direction under this part of the Bill, if directed
by the Secretary of State. It was the Minister&#146;s presumption
that it deals with construction. It could be relevant during
construction, but it could also be relevant to the operational
phase.</div>
					<a name="07112782000083"><div class="hs_Para">From
our many visits to railway stations up and down the country, the
Minister and I know that at a number of stations&#151;I cannot think
of one on the Crossrail route&#151;Network Rail is the prime
operator, but certain parts of the infrastructure around the station 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column78" />Column number: 78</div>are owned by heritage groups and others. They might be the facility
operator at some stage. To facilitate Crossrail, it might be necessary
to use their lines and their
paths.</div>
					<a name="07112782000084"><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
seems to imply that compensation is in some way wrong. In the spirit of
the Bill, we have accepted that exceptional powers are needed that will
sometimes override the private interest for the public good, but that
there should be some payment for that overriding. Therefore, I am not
minded to accept his explanation unless he can reassure me that he has
accepted that &#147;facility owner&#148; is an ambiguous term.
Unless he proposes to clarify and redefine that matter on Report, I
will test the will of the Committee on the
amendment.</div>

contribute to this debate. First, &#147;facility owner&#148; is the
conventional term used in all rail legislation, and it has been used in
previous rail legislation. Secondly, it is important to respect
existing industry practices. Any conflict between
train operating companies over pathways is already provided for in
existing industry processes. It is not up to the Committee to start
taking the existing processes to bits. They already have the support of
all the train operating companies, the ORR, the Government and Network
Rail.</div>

misinterpretation of what the clause means. I absolutely agree with him
that if the industry process did not already exist, it would be
important for the Government and the Bill to make a point of ensuring
that a compensation process did exist. However, as the industry
processes already exist, and as the industry itself is not asking for
any change to them, I fail to see the point of taking the issue to a

							<b class="B">Susan
Kramer</b> (Richmond Park) (LD): I want to make some brief
remarks. To someone sitting outside this room, our previous discussion
would have sounded as though it was taking place at cross-purposes. My
interpretation of the language is rather closer to the
Minister&#146;s than that of the hon. Member for
Wimbledon, who sits on the Conservative Front Bench. However, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column79" />Column number: 79</div>the issue that has not been raised and which is relevant to the clause
is the implications for freight and for freight rail access along

earlier, the implications for London are extremely serious. London has
no aggregate resources within its own boundaries and the only mechanism
for bringing aggregate into London is freight rail. Those pathways need
to be protected in some way. While there may be compensation for the
freight rail provider, there is no mechanism for dealing with the
problem that Londoners will face without the ability to bring in bulk
product for a variety of purposes. The Minister should address that
issue.</div>

access rights for Crossrail services outside the central London tunnel.
However, I hope she will be reassured that there might then be the need
for a further process of amendment of any other access rights that are
in conflict. Clearly conflicting rights are likely to have been picked
up and dealt with at earlier stages as a consequence of ORR oversight,
subject to its new duty, and reviews of contracts under clause 27, but

							<a name="07112782000412">Stephen
Hammond:
						</b> We move on to a clause that deals with the impact
of the Crossrail project on the existing railway franchise agreements.
The amendments are very much in line with one another as they deal with
exactly the same issue. The clause gives the Secretary of State the
power to terminate a franchise if the parties to the franchise cannot
agree on how it is to be modified to deal with the consequences of the
Crossrail project, and only in those circumstances.</div>
					<a name="07112782000100"><div class="hs_Para">I can
understand that some sort of external arbitration will be necessary if
such a situation arises. After all, none of us wants the construction
or operation of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column80" />Column number: 80</div>Crossrail to be held up by a disagreement between
two sides to an existing franchise where that franchise agreement will
have an impact on Crossrail. However, giving the casting vote in such a
dispute to the Secretary of State is not necessarily the solution to
the problem. The power to mediate in such disputes should be given to
the ORR, which is transparently more of an independent and impartial
expert body than the Secretary of State and so perfectly suited to
carry out this
role.</div>
					<a name="07112782000101"><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 19 would change the wording of subsection (3) so that instead of
terminating the franchise himself, the Secretary of State will instruct
the ORR to review the agreement and try to mediate to achieve an
equitable solution. It would therefore revise a subsequent subsection
to reflect the change made by amendment No. 18. I hope the Minister
will look favourably on the suggestion that the Secretary of State
should not mediate and that the ORR, as an impartial and expert body,
should take on that
role.</div>
					<a name="07112782000102"><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112782000413">Mr.
Harris:
						</b> Clause 34 deals with the consequences for
franchises affected by the amendment of access rights held by the
franchisee in order to facilitate Crossrail services. That may arise
when, under clauses 28(2) or 33(2), the ORR directs amendments to
access rights. If those amendments affect the carrying out of a
franchise agreement, the parties to that agreement must use all
reasonable endeavours to vary its terms. If they fail to agree, the
Secretary of State can terminate the franchise agreement. The
ORR can direct that compensation as payable and determine the amount.
Amendment No. 18 and amendment No. 19, which would
apply to the consequential changes, would remove the Secretary of
State&#146;s power to terminate the franchise agreements when
agreement could not be reached between the parties and instead allow
the ORR to vary the franchise agreement for the
parties.</div>
					<a name="07112782000103"><div class="hs_Para">While I
approve the spirit of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s amendment, it is
unsatisfactory for two reasons. First, it would place the ORR in a role
completely outside its normal regulatory function. It
does not regulate franchise agreements and has no experience in doing
so, or in setting or writing the minimum specification for them. The
hon. Gentleman suggested that it has expertise in that area. It does
not.</div>
					<a name="07112782000104"><div class="hs_Para">Franchise
oversight and construction lie with the Department for Transport, and
lay previously with the Strategic Rail Authority. The functions of
franchising and of overseeing access contracts are in practice well
connected, but they are separate functions undertaken by separate
bodies with separate
responsibilities.</div>
					<a name="07112782000105"><div class="hs_Para">More
importantly, the amendment would remove a necessary protection for the
holder of the franchise. Agreement might not have been reached because
the franchise holder considered that an amended franchise would not be
a viable business proposition for him, so he would wish it to be
terminated with compensation. In that case, it is far more satisfactory
for the Secretary of State, who holds a franchising function, to
terminate such an agreement with compensation and
then refranchise the service. Therefore, following that explanation, I
ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw his
amendment.</div>
					<a name="07112782000106"><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112782000414">Stephen
Hammond:
						</b> It may well be that the ORR does not have the
expertise, as the Minister described from first-hand knowledge, but in
its function as a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column81" />Column number: 81</div>regulator it is an expert, independent and impartial observer. Many in
the industry might prefer that that body conducted the franchise
renegotiation process, rather than the Department for Transport, but
that is a discussion for another day and I am not tempted to open it
now.</div>
					<a name="07112782000107"><div class="hs_Para">I am interested
in the Minister&#146;s reference to an unintended consequence of my
amendment being that it might affect the business viability of a
franchise and, therefore, might undermine the ability of a franchise
holder to terminate if a franchise became unviable and the ability to
get compensation. That is certainly not a consequence that I had
anticipated.</div>
					<a name="07112782000108"><div class="hs_Para">The
spirit of the amendment is to look at a resolution where the access is
purely to do with Crossrail. I could not envisage circumstances under
which such a minor access arrangement would invalidate the whole
franchise, but I am prepared to accept the Minister&#146;s
explanation that in certain cases it might, and, therefore, that
protection should certainly be in place. Owing to that unintended
consequence, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

							<a name="07112782000415">Stephen
Hammond:
						</b> The explanatory notes for the clause state that
it disapplies the prohibition in section 25 of the 1993 Act on public
sector operators being a franchisee in respect of passenger rail
services. Section 25 of the 1993 Act effectively privatised British
Rail and introduced, or was the forerunner of, today&#146;s industry
structure and provides that certain public sector bodies cannot be
franchisees. Those bodies include Ministers of the Crown, local
authorities and passenger transport authorities. For better or for
worse, depending on how we look at it, it is a competitive system
whereby private sector companies bid for and operate rail franchises.
The question is, therefore, whether that system is
working.</div>
					<a name="07112782000113"><div class="hs_Para">If the
Department for Transport believes the system to be working elsewhere in
the country, why should Crossrail be different? We all know the answer
to that. The clause is so worded so that Transport for London can
operate Crossrail, post-construction. That raises the question whether
it is intended that the bidding process will see TfL as the sole
bidder.</div>
					<a name="07112782000114"><div class="hs_Para">We all
understand that that is what is intended by the Mayor, with his
megalomaniac tendencies, writing blank cheques from Londoners&#146;
bank accounts. Not necessarily every Londoner would agree with that
statement. Perhaps we will hear this from the Minister, but as we
understand it, the Mayor has just bankrolled the construction phase of
Crossrail. However, should that automatically give him the right to
operate it? After all, are we convinced that the Mayor is a good
operator and are we clear that that would be in the public interest?
Can we be sure that health and safety standards will be properly
met?</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column82" />Column number: 82</div>
					<a name="07112782000115"><div class="hs_Para">If one
examined the record of TfL in operating the underground, it would at
best be described as patchy. TfL management likes to
blame the infracos and everyone else, but the operating statistics of
the underground show that some 40 per cent. of the delays are due to
TfL and its inability to operate efficiently. Do we really want the
major national project of Crossrail to operate with 40 per cent.
inefficiencies? I am not sure that anybody wants that. Surely even the
Mayor, who at best is economical with the truth at times, does not want
that or wish to publicise it. <i class="I">[</i>

					<a name="07112782000116"><div class="hs_Para">Can we be sure
that it is in the public interest to have TfL as the constructor and
the operator? Where are the checks and balances? If TfL, which blames
anybody but itself for faults, has both roles, who will it blame? Would
it not be amusing to see the operation arm of TfL blaming the
construction arm? No, it would not, because the only people to suffer
would be those who travel on Crossrail. The public purse would also
suffer.</div>
					<a name="07112782000117"><div class="hs_Para">It looks as
though the clause has been written in so that TfL will have the right
to bid for this franchise. Is it to be an exclusive franchise? How long
will it run for? Who else may bid? The franchise system that the
Government have created allows for franchises of seven to 10 years. Is
it intended that the Crossrail operating franchise will be of the same
length? I suspect
not.</div>
					<a name="07112782000118"><div class="hs_Para">I
ask all those questions because the shadow Secretary of State for
Transport, my hon. Friend the Member for Chipping Barnet
(Mrs. Villiers), has intimated that we favour some
reintegration of the network. TfL being the owner, if not the manager
of the network and the operating model, could fit into a model of
reintegration later on. However, it would not fit in with the
Government&#146;s current model of operation for the railways. I ask
the Minister, is that what is intended in the clause? Is he now saying
that he accepts that a degree of reintegration is viable, possible and
desirable? In terms of this contract, is the clause just a Trojan horse
for TfL? Is this an exclusive bidding procedure and for how long is the
franchise intended to
run?</div>

						</b> I hope that the hon. Gentleman will get the
services that he seeks in the Wimbledon area in future. With the London
overground, there was a pattern whereby an extremely poor service
provided by Silverlink was taken back into TfL control for a
holding period while it was revamped, then
refranchised to a private sector operator. I see no reason why those
strategies cannot be responsibly used by TfL to provide Londoners with
the most appropriate and effective service. The hon. Gentleman will
know that the way in which TfL&#146;s services are provided are a
complete mixture; the buses, the docklands light railway, the
overground and the tube all have different kinds of
arrangements.</div>
					<a name="07112782000124"><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Wimbledon&#146;s fascination with private operators
is somewhat questionable, given the hideous Metronet experience that we
all have been through. Private operators can play an important role,
provided that integration oversight and a general
pattern of regulation are in place. To suggest that it is inappropriate
to introduce a clause that allows such measures to proceed for
Crossrail strikes me as extraordinary. Londoners will be fascinated by
the implication that the new service should be exclusively in private
hands, and not part of the broader TfL family as an integrated rail
service in
London.</div>

but he has been vindicated in many ways by what has happened on the
underground. To a large extent he has been a passenger&#151;perhaps
it is the wrong time to say that. The public-private partnership
exercise for the London underground has unravelled, and I am afraid
that that is what the Mayor had in mind at the outset when he made his
complaints about the nature of the exercise. Obviously, we hope that he
is in the last 22 weeks of his mayoralty, but he has made the rather
important point that we should not view transport, policing or any
other area only through the prism of a particular Mayor. We have to
look at the powers that should be in place for London governance and at
the importance of ensuring that proper services are available for all
Londoners.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
Lee Scott</b> (Ilford, North) (Con): Does my hon. Friend agree
that one of the most important things for the running of Crossrail,
whether by TfL or any other body, is that it should
not suffer from the same problems that affect London underground, where
passengers, including my constituents&#151;I am sure yours as
well&#151;have to travel in conditions in which it would not be legal
to transport
animals?</div>

							<a name="07112782000425">Mr.
Field:
						</b> I am sure that there are plenty of people from
Congleton who use the underground. My hon. Friend&#146;s point was
well made. My fears in relation to Crossrail are twofold. First, I fear
that there will be a repeat of the &#147;fares fair&#148; problem
that plagued us in the early 1980s, and many of our London
constituents, if not necessarily businesses, would not regard
themselves as benefiting directly from the Crossrail project. Secondly,
if Crossrail is to work, and become a great success, it must have spurs
well outside greater London. That is something else about which there
is increasing concern. It is at the heart of the matters raised by my
hon. Friend the Member for Wimbledon, and I hope the Minister can
respond to those concerns. The biggest fear of many
residents of Kent, Essex, Berkshire, Surrey and beyond is of the Mayor
taking control of their railway services because he is unaccountable
through any electoral process to people who live outside greater
London. The focus is on the present incumbent of the mayoralty, but
this is a sensible probing amendment and it will be interesting to
discover where the Minister is coming from.</div>
					<a name="07112782000130"><div class="hs_Para">I disagreed with much of what
the hon. Member for Richmond Park had to say, but in Mayor
Livingstone&#146;s defence, I think that his transport policy
includes some sensible integration measures. My
biggest worry, especially in relation to buses, is that it is the
economics of the madhouse. We are losing hundreds of millions of pounds
a year on that budget, ditto for congestion charging. I accept that
Livingstone had the courage to go ahead with the congestion charge, but
I suspect that whether or not he is re-elected it will be difficult to
row back on what has been done. We have to accept the reality of the
situation.</div>
					<a name="07112782000131"><div class="hs_Para">My biggest
concern is about the sheer cost of the operation but, as the hon. Lady
rightly pointed out, to integrate the overground elements with the
system in east London in Hoxton and Haggerston is a positive step
forwards. I suspect that she views the Silverlink line with rose-tinted
glasses, given that she represents Richmond in west London where the
service operates rather better than it does out in the east. I have
been down to Silvertown and to North Woolwich, where the
service is ramshackle and requires enormous
investment to make it worthwhile. The population in that part of London
is relatively small, although City airport could allow North Woolwich
station to become a hub and, as we discussed in relation to Crossrail,
a further station on the other side of the river in Woolwich itself
would integrate the entire process. That is a sensible way forward but
it would impose a great cost on London council tax payers now and, I
fear, in many decades to come. I hope that the Minister will give
serious thought to what we have said. As part and parcel of integration
we need not just one template but the potential for openness to a broad
range of different
operators.</div>

politics to raise its head in this long-running debate on Crossrail and
I am disappointed that it has done so in the form of an ungracious
attack on the London Mayor by the hon. Gentleman. I will not ask for
your indulgence, Lady Winterton, as you would probably rule me out of
order if I were to suggest that the hon. Member for Henley is far too
busy to spend his time on a Public Bill Committee dealing with the
largest infrastructure project that London has ever
seen.</div>

so.</div>
					<a name="07112782000135"><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member
for Wimbledon referred to the franchise system created by the
Government. I was not a Member of the 1992 to 1997 Parliament, but from
my recollection a Conservative Secretary of State invented the
franchise system for the purposes of running down the rail system
which, however, has been rescued, modified and made fit for purpose by
this Government. It is simply not the case that we invented that
system. Clause 35 disapplies the prohibition in the 1993 Act on a
public sector operator acting as a franchisee, which
helps to provide the necessary flexibility to
accommodate a public sector operator of Crossrail passenger services. I
do not want to give my hon. Friends any undue hope that the Government
have any plans to renationalise the rail industry by the back
door, as this is a purely practical measure.</div>
					<a name="07112782000136"><div class="hs_Para">It may be useful to use public
sector franchisees during the phasing-in and stabilisation period.
During the stabilisation period, service levels and performance will be
fully tested and optimised. Until that has been done and, for example,
the required performance level is set, it would be difficult to hold a
conventional franchise competition. All franchises that are put out for
competition operate on the basis that the network and services are
already in place. We know passenger numbers and the pathways that are
available, but that will not be the case at the outset of the provision
of Crossrail services. Such a competition could result in franchise
bids factoring in at least some element of project risk, and that may
be better managed as part of the project
delivery.</div>
					<a name="07112782000137"><div class="hs_Para">Several
options are open at the moment, and one was mentioned in glowing terms
by the hon. Member for Wimbledon. A decision has not been taken, as a
significant amount of detail will need to be worked through in the
coming years between the Mayor of London, the Department for Transport
and train operators as to how exactly Crossrail will be integrated with
national rail services, and will interact with London Underground. As I
have said before, Crossrail is a unique railway in the UK, and it is
essential to retain the flexibility to deliver every possible option if
we are to operate services efficiently and
effectively.</div>

					<a name="07112782000141"><div class="hs_Para">I
am sure that the Committee&#146;s usual good humour
will return after the previous, slightly more
controversial debate. The clause allows for the disapplication or
modification of certain franchising and access exemptions. The
exemptions in question are those that remove the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column86" />Column number: 86</div>ORR&#146;s task of approving or directing access contracts and those
that prevent Heathrow services from being franchised. What is missing
from the clause is any hint of consultation&#151;that has been a
recurring theme of my comments throughout our sittings. The Committee
will notice that the Government sometimes want to reassure us that
consultation will take place even though there is no such provision in
the Bill. I believe that to make the Bill work and to ensure that the
exercise of the exceptional powers that are being granted to the
Secretary of State is transparent, consultation procedures should be
included in the Bill.</div>
					<a name="07112782000142"><div class="hs_Para">As we have said several times,
Crossrail is a massive undertaking. Its implications are not just
physical, as they affect a complex web of agreements
that characterise the railway industry. To facilitate the multiple
changes required to expedite such a project, the Bill should adjust
existing legislation, but the clause fails to ensure that those who
will be affected by the changes are given the voice that they should be
allowed prior to those changes coming into effect. My amendment gives
the clause the necessary transparency and gives those who have not been
given a voice the voice they should be
allowed.</div>
					<a name="07112782000143"><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112782000430">Mr.
Harris:
						</b> Clause 36 is needed because the railway clauses in
the Bill work by making use of the regulatory system
for the national rail network. However, the London underground and
Heathrow spur networks, which are affected by the Crossrail proposals,
are exempt from that regulatory system. The clause therefore enables
parts of those exemptions to be amended or revoked where necessary to
facilitate Crossrail
services.</div>
					<a name="07112782000144"><div class="hs_Para">The
Railways (London Regional Transport) (Exemptions) Order 1994, which is
relevant to the Transport for London infrastructure, provided an
exemption from the outset of rail privatisation, and hence modern rail
regulation. Similarly, the Railways (Heathrow Express) (Exemptions)
Order 1994 provided an exemption for the Heathrow spur. The clause
enables parts of those orders to be amended or revoked, which would
remove the exemption from rail regulation as regards capacity
allocation and franchising, for purpose of facilitating Crossrail
services.</div>
					<a name="07112782000145"><div class="hs_Para">Clearly both
BAA, as the owner of the Heathrow network, and
Transport for London, in its role in relation to the London
underground, are important players in the Crossrail project. There is
no need for the hon. Gentleman&#146;s amendment, as those parties are
already involved specifically and individually in determining how best
to manage complex interactions between Crossrail, the Heathrow spur and
London Underground networks. Given that changes to exemptions would
require a statutory instrument subject to annulment in the House, it is
inconceivable that the affected parties would not be consulted before
such a measure was made. I therefore hope that the hon. Gentleman will
withdraw his
amendment.</div>

					<a name="07112782000153"><div class="hs_Para">Here
we go again on consultation. The clause deals with closures and, in
essence, commits the Secretary of State to close railway lines where he
sees necessary. At least, that is my understanding of
it. It gives the Secretary of State such a power by means of allowing
him to direct that certain provisions of the Railways Act 2005 will not
be applicable. Again, I am sure that this is an absolutely necessary
step, but it must be done in the right
way.</div>
					<a name="07112782000154"><div class="hs_Para">The
discontinuance of a railway service, however temporary, can cause a
great deal of disruption for an operator and for passengers, and I am
sure that the Minister will say that adequate consultation will be
carried out, but we need to be clear that it will be, so that the
affected parties can also adapt as they see fit. The consultation
should include, but not be restricted to, the Office of the Rail
Regulator.</div>
					<a name="07112782000155"><div class="hs_Para">I am trying
to ensure that the Secretary of State has the freedom to decide who
else it might be appropriate to consult, but I certainly want to ensure
that the powers of consultation are clear and defined in the Bill, and
that passenger groups, the appropriate train operator and those who
might be affected are also consulted. The amendment is perhaps slightly
different in tone to the last one, but it provides for the sensible and
responsible thing to do. I hope that the Minister will
agree.</div>
					<a name="07112782000156"><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112782000435">Mr.
Harris:
						</b> I rise to disappoint the hon. Gentleman. The
purpose of clause 37 is to ensure that the closure provisions of the
2005 Act do not apply when such a closure is required in connection
with the construction or maintenance of the Crossrail
works, or as a consequence of Crossrail passenger services. That
disapplication does 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column88" />Column number: 88</div>not apply to Crossrail services or facilities themselves. To deliver the
Crossrail project, it will be essential to alter track and stations and
to reorganise suburban services and much of that has the potential to
be classed as closures. Even quite small changes can be classed as
closures</div>
					<a name="07112782000157"><div class="hs_Para">If the
Secretary of State decides whether to apply closure
procedures&#151;it is a function that she cannot delegate&#151;the
clause provides that she would consider the closure
proposals by, or on behalf of, the nominated undertaker, and challenge
them as necessary in reaching her
decisions.</div>
					<a name="07112782000158"><div class="hs_Para">There is
nothing to prevent the Secretary of State from consulting when she
thinks that it would be appropriate, especially given that she would
consider the proposals in the context of her duties to the national
rail network, not just the Crossrail project in isolation. She might,
for example, look at the extent to which the interests of others had
been taken into account in the process, where possible. She might also
decide that a closure merits being subject to the closure
procedures in the 2005 Act with the consultation
process that that entails. However, I think that she needs some
flexibility to do what is appropriate in each case rather than to have
a blanket requirement to
consult.</div>
					<a name="07112782000159"><div class="hs_Para">This issue
gets to the nub of our opposition to the amendment. What concerns me
about the blanket requirement is that it risks creating false
expectations of what the Secretary of State would be able to do in
the light of consultations. For example, if a
consultation on a small scheme resulted in arguments opposed to the
closure, it would still have to go ahead to enable Crossrail passenger
services to proceed. A few closures, such as of services and parts of
stations are central to, and part of, the project proposals before
Parliament. As I have said, the Secretary of State would be duty bound
to consider those in the wider context of the UK
railways.</div>
					<a name="07112782000160"><div class="hs_Para">Finally, the
finer details of closure requirements are likely to emerge in the
detail design process. Network Rail is likely to undertake most of the
network works and will play a major part in the detail design process.
It will be in Network Rail&#146;s interest to ensure that the wider
interests of the network and its other users are
taken fully into account from the outset. I hope,
perhaps in vain, that following this explanation, the hon. Gentleman
will see fit to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

Hammond:
						</b> Again, I listened carefully to the Minister, and
again, I could not understand a lot of what he said. Even after
consultation, it may be necessary to close certain things, even if the
people who are consulted disagree with that. That is in the nature of
consultation. I do not see how the amendment, other
than in the very clearest way, is a major imposition on the Secretary
of State. It does not say that they must consult with any or every
person as would wish to be consulted with. It refers
to</div>

would not consult such people. Why, therefore, does he not wish to see
that in the Bill? I find this extraordinary. We have accepted all the
way through that this is an exceptional project requiring exceptional
powers and exceptional discretion, but when we can put in the Bill a
definition of those 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column89" />Column number: 89</div>powers, it would seem appropriate to do so. I am not sure that the he
has reassured me on why he wants the amendment to

							<a name="07112782000437">Mr.
Harris:
						</b> As I said in my original remarks, I am happy to
expand on them. Under the 2005 Act, a closure has a wide definition. If
part of a platform on a station had to be closed, I would see no
benefit in triggering a consultation process on such a very small
closure. The effect of the amendment would be that such a process would
have to commence on every single closure as defined by the 2005
Act.</div>
					<a name="07112782000164"><div class="hs_Para">I accept that in
most peoples&#146; minds, a closure means that of a railway station
or a line. I accept that that is a concern. With regard to the wider
responsibility for the rail network, it is frankly
inconceivable that any Secretary of State would not consult on a major
closure. However, the amendment would end up defining very many
restrictions and very small closures as closures and would trigger a
consultation system that would not be warranted in many
cases.</div>

					<a name="07112782000187"><div class="hs_Para">In the
same vein as many clauses in the Bill, clause 40 contains provisions to
ensure that those charged with 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column90" />Column number: 90</div>the building and operating of the Crossrail network are afforded all
possible assistance by those who own and operate existing rail assets.
Specifically, it gives the nominated undertaker the power to require
facilities owners and operators to co-operate with them by force of an
agreement. The explanatory notes state that Crossrail will, by
necessity,</div>
					<a name="07112782000356"><div class="hs_brev">&#147;interact
with the existing railways&#148;,</div>
					<a name="07112782000188"><div class="hs_Para">so it is certainly obvious that, as set
out in the clause, there is a need for this provision. My intention in
tabling the amendment is to ensure that there is absolutely no scope
for doubt as to which of those assets we are talking about. I do not
wish to return to the alcoholic allusions that we went through last
Thursday&#151;I think we have probably done that one to death. My
concerns in this case, however, are similar. As the clause stands, it
seems that the nominated undertaker can take action with regard to any
railway asset anywhere. Although I am sure that the Minister is about
to reassure us that the nominated undertaker will not use that power
haphazardly or unsystematically, I cannot see any reason why we cannot
specify on the face of the Bill that the assets that
require the exceptional powers must be those that relate to Crossrail.
Otherwise, there is scope for ambiguity. I believe that the amendment
is rational and that the Bill would benefit from its
inclusion.</div>

							<a name="07112782000453">Mr.

						</b> Crossrail will clearly interact a great deal with
other railway assets both before and after it is built. For example, in
the central area new Crossrail tunnels and stations will be constructed
in and around existing underground stations and running
tunnels and there will be more than &#163;2 billion of
Crossrail investment on the national rail network. Generally, the
preferred option will be for whoever is appointed as the Crossrail
nominated undertaker to address interface issues with owners of other
railway assets on the basis of standard industry
mechanisms. Clause 40 is, therefore, a provision that we should not
need to rely on
often.</div>
				
					<a name="07112782000367"><div class="hs_Timeline">11.45
am</div>
					<a name="07112782000190"><div class="hs_Para">However, the
existing arrangements that govern both the national rail and London
underground networks&#151;that is where the interfaces will mostly
come from&#151;might not address all the issues that could arise in
relation to a major new project such as Crossrail. It is therefore
prudent to have the ability to resolve
them.</div>
					<a name="07112782000191"><div class="hs_Para">It
is important to point out that the clause works both ways: the
controller of a non-Crossrail railway asset can also invoke the
provision and require the nominated undertaker to agree how a matter is
to be resolved. The object is to ensure that neither the nominated
undertaker nor the other party can act unreasonably in dealing with a
problem related to the interaction of the Crossrail works with overland
or underground railway
assets.</div>
					<a name="07112782000192"><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
presents two problems. First, it would limit the nominated undertaker
to using the power only where the non-Crossrail asset was one that
enabled the construction, maintenance or operation of Crossrail to
occur. In fact, problems could arise in relation to a wide range of
railway assets, not just the subset.</div>
					
					<a name="07112782000193"><div class="hs_Para">The clause
already requires the nominated undertaker to meet the test that the
matter at issue must be one that affects the construction, maintenance
or operation of Crossrail. We believe that that is the appropriate
qualification, rather than the stricter test that the amendment would
set.</div>
					<a name="07112782000194"><div class="hs_Para">The second
problem is that the limitation that the amendment would impose would
not apply in respect of subsection (2), so the provision would be
unfairly weighted in favour of the non-Crossrail party. I do not
imagine that that is the intention, but it would be the
effect.</div>
					<a name="07112782000195"><div class="hs_Para">My key point
is that the creation of Crossrail, for which I detect considerable
support in the Committee, should not be impeded because an interface
issue with another railway network cannot be resolved. Nor
should Crossrail cause unnecessary problems for other railway networks
without there being a means of resolution. The clause is an essential
back-up provision that recognises the fact that integrating a new
railway on the scale of Crossrail is difficult but should never be
impossible.</div>

					<div class="Column"><a name="Column92" />Column number: 92</div>
					<a name="07112782000203"><div class="hs_Para">I accept that the amendment
might be described as an exercise in terminology and semantics.
Arbitration has come up a number of times in our discussions and we now
come to two clauses that set out how it will work in practice, as it
relates to the duty to co-operate. When I first read clause 41(1), I
was slightly taken aback. Arbitration is, by definition, a process by
which a third party settles a dispute between two persons or
organisations. The implication of the subsection,
however, is that the Secretary of State can directly arbiter as to the
outcome of an arbitration in which one party is the nominated
undertaker.</div>
					<a name="07112782000204"><div class="hs_Para">As we
know, the nominated undertaker could be an appointee of the Secretary
of State and could even be the Secretary of State herself. I would like
to give the Minister the benefit of the doubt and assume that that was
not the intention in drafting the subsection. After all, we do not want
the defendant to be able to tell the jury and the judge exactly what to
do.</div>
					<a name="07112782000205"><div class="hs_Para">In my exercise in
terminology, I suggest a wording that would remove the doubt. Replacing
&#147;results&#148; with &#147;objectives&#148; would make it
clear that the Secretary of State could have a say in what form the
outcome of the arbitration should take, but not in what the decision
was. I ask the Minister to consider those points. Perhaps he will look
favourably on the
amendment.</div>
					<a name="07112782000206"><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112782000458">Mr.
Harris:
						</b> Perhaps we should rename the amendment the
&#147;number of angels dancing on the head of a pin
amendment&#148;. To set these matters in context, the clause sets out
the mechanism for disputes under clause 40(3) to be settled by
arbitration. The general provisions on arbitration are continued in
clause 62. Subsection (3), which the amendment would affect, allows the
Secretary of State to direct the arbitrator as to the overall results
to be achieved by the settlement. That is to avoid the possibility that
the outcome or result of the arbitration might prevent something that
is critical to the Crossrail
project.</div>
					<a name="07112782000207"><div class="hs_Para">I bear in
mind the criticisms that the hon. Gentleman has made on this and
previous clauses. Even if he has reservations, I hope he understands
that the results of an arbitration cannot allow the
construction of Crossrail to be impeded in any way. That is the only
caveat that the Secretary of State will have in mind when making those
directions. The arbitrator will have full control over the terms,
including as to compensation of the arbitration award, subject to the
rule that it must achieve certain practical
results.</div>
					<a name="07112782000208"><div class="hs_Para">The direction
of the Secretary of State will generally be only to facilitate the
completion of the Crossrail works within the agreed time scale or cost,
or to do with the subsequent maintenance of the all-important services
that Crossrail will deliver. Even then, the Secretary of State will
ensure that Crossrail is not delivered to the unreasonable detriment of
the rest of the rail
network.</div>
					<a name="07112782000209"><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment&#146;s use of objectives in subsection (3) is the
angels-dancing-on-the-head-of-a-pin section. In terms of legal
semantics, it would ultimately miscast what is happening. In making a
direction, the Secretary of State has an objective concerning the
construction, maintenance or operation of Crossrail. In acting further
to the direction, the arbitrator will retain his original
objective&#151;the fair resolution of a dispute&#151;within any
parameters established by the direction.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column93" />Column number: 93</div>
					<a name="07112782000210"><div class="hs_Para">To offer some further
reassurance to the hon. Gentleman, as with clause 40, this is likely to
be a fall-back power in practice. First, there is the general
reassurance for the rail industry of the Department&#146;s intention
to work within normal industry processes as far as possible in
connection with the Crossrail project. Secondly, it is envisaged that
many of the works will be undertaken by railway operators that have a
direct interest in integrating Crossrail works successfully with their
own existing assets. Finally, some agreements are already in place
regarding those matters. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will consider
withdrawing the
amendment.</div>

a probing amendment. Clause 43 is necessary and, as I am sure the

<div class="Column"><a name="Column94" />Column number: 94</div>authorised by a previous statute, clause 43 allows for the transfer to
the Secretary of State or the nominated undertaker any statutory powers
or duties relating to those works and previously exercisable by the
railway operator. The clause, oddly enough, is precedented in the 1996
Act&#151;a fact of which I would not be so dismissive as the hon.

						</b> There is great danger that we get bad drafting if
we allow too much legislation simply to consider
precedent. I say that as someone who practised briefly as a solicitor
in the early 1990s. Whenever a novel problem arose there was a
temptation to ask, &#147;Where&#146;s the precedent?&#148; We are
joking about this to a certain extent, and I accept that there are
similarities between the two pieces of legislation that make it logical
at least to keep an eye on how the clauses are
drafted.</div>
					<a name="07112782000223"><div class="hs_Para">There is an
issue to consider about parliamentary drafting if the
draftsman&#146;s first instinct is, &#147;Let&#146;s look at the
precedent and see how we can mess around with it,&#148; when the<b class="B">
</b>legislation is 11 years old. That is not a terribly sensible
approach. Our approach should be to ask what we are trying to achieve
to ensure that this is robust legislation for decades to come. We
should not simply justify it by looking at precedent. It might be easy
to draft and slightly easier for the Minister to justify certain
clauses, but we need to look much more sensibly at what the Bill is
trying to
achieve.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112782000465">Mr.

						</b> I agree with the hon. Gentleman. It would not be
appropriate or justifiable simply to say that because the clause has a
precedent that alone justifies its existence in subsequent legislation,
which is why I want to explain why we wish to follow that
precedent.</div>
					<a name="07112782000225"><div class="hs_Para">The 1996
Act is the closest legislative comparison we have to the Crossrail
project. It was a hybrid Bill that introduced a multi-billion pound
infrastructure project that was, at the time, the largest civil
engineering project in Europe, as Crossrail will be when it is under
construction. It is therefore justifiable to consider the precedent of
the 1996 Act. It was robust legislation that, crucially, worked, which
is what we want the Bill to do. However, I accept the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s point that precedent alone is not
justification.</div>
					<a name="07112782000226"><div class="hs_Para">Subsection
(2) allows the Secretary of State further to transfer to herself or a
nominated undertaker any of the powers or duties previously transferred
from a railway operator. If subsection (2) were deleted, as proposed by
the amendment, those powers or duties, after being transferred, could
not be transferred again. That would adversely affect cases in which
the same land was needed for works by different nominated undertakers,
which is entirely possible&#151;I would say likely&#151;especially
in relation to construction
sites.</div>
					<a name="07112782000227"><div class="hs_Para">The result
would be that when the first nominated undertaker handed back land so
that the second nominated undertaker could undertake his work, the
Secretary of State would not be able to ensure that the
powers and duties of the original railway operator
transferred with the land. That would be an unsatisfactory outcome, to
say the least. It would not be in the interests of the continued proper
management of the railway. I hope that that is explanation enough for
the hon. Member for
Wimbledon.</div>

tax consequences that could otherwise arise in relation to the
transfers of property, rights and liabilities under transfer schemes
made under schedule 12. Broadly, it ensures that inappropriate tax

various scenarios concerning the transfer of assets and liabilities in
the context of construction and delivery of Crossrail. It is right to
draw Members&#146; attention to the fact that because Crossrail will

he clarify what he means by inappropriate and give us one or two

					<a name="07112782000264"><div class="hs_Para">Clause
47 is important. It relates to the appointment of the
nominated undertaker, the body that is to assume the task of building
Crossrail. Subsection (4) requires the Secretary of State to consult
the Mayor of London. Does the Minister think that it would be prudent
to consult not only the Mayor of London, whoever that might be, but
leaders of local authorities? The Secretary of State should look beyond
consultation just with the Mayor of London, and should be required to
consult representatives of local government when making the decision.
After all, Crossrail is certain to have ramifications in several London
boroughs in areas both east and west of the City.</div>
					<a name="07112782000265"><div class="hs_Para">Local councils will have to
deal with several issues arising as a direct result of Crossrail, and I
sense that they may be better minded to co-operate if they feel
that they have been included in decision-making
processes relating to the project from the outset. I have no doubt that
some of the boroughs in question have already made representations to
the Select Committees, and I am sure that those representations were
taken very seriously. None the less, the amendment is
non-controversial. Local government has a role to play in the success
of the project. It would be a mistake to exclude it from the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="07112782000266"><div class="hs_Para">My amendment
is designed to ensure that the appropriate local government
representatives&#151;the amendment specifies them as the borough
council leaders and chief executives, and officials of the same
standing in borough councils outside Greater London&#151;would be
consulted on the appointment of the nominated undertaker, who will,
after all, become such a presence in their area. I hope that the
Minister will feel minded to accept the
amendment.</div>
					<a name="07112782000267"><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112782000485">Mr.
Harris:
						</b> Clause 47 empowers the Secretary of State to
specify by order one or more nominated undertakers, for the purposes of
the Bill. The clause requires the Secretary of State, before making
such a nomination order, to consult the Mayor of London&#151;who
will, I am sure, be Ken Livingstone. It also allows the Secretary of
State, by agreement with the Mayor of London and whoever it is proposed
to name in the nomination order, to fetter his discretion as to the
exercise of the power granted in subsection (1). That power is
necessary to enable the Secretary of State to make
contractual arrangements prior to the nomination of a person or body as
the nominated undertaker.</div>
					<a name="07112782000268"><div class="hs_Para">The amendment would require the
Secretary of State to consult leaders and chief
executives of local authorities along the route before making a
nomination order and before entering into agreements with the proposed
nominated undertaker. The crucial part of my opposition to the
amendment is that clause 47 requires the Secretary of State to consult
the Mayor before taking either of the actions specified. As the hon.
Member for Wimbledon knows, the Mayor is co-sponsor of Crossrail; that
is why he is given the relevant power. It is intended that the Mayor
will be responsible for delivering the project through Cross London
Rail Links Ltd. I expect to say more about how it is intended to manage
the project when the relevant amendments are considered.</div>
					<a name="07112782000269"><div class="hs_Para">For the purpose of the current
debate the simple point is that it is right that the Mayor, as
co-sponsor of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column99" />Column number: 99</div>Crossrail, should be consulted when the Secretary of
State contemplates making a nomination order or entering into an
agreement with any nominated undertaker. The chief executives to whom
the amendment refers are not co-sponsors of Crossrail, and it would not
be appropriate for there to be an obligation to consult local
authorities along the route about the matters before us. There will be
a good deal of discussion and consultation with key stakeholders, such
as local authorities, because they will have a key role to play in the
detailed delivery of the project, but it does not seem appropriate at
this stage to consult them about the identity of a nominated undertaker
or the terms under which a nominated undertaker will be commissioned to
carry out the work. Such matters are properly for the project&#146;s
sponsors, so I trust that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the
amendment.</div>

will be Mayor of London at any given time&#151;indeed, he and I are
completely at variance on that
point.</div>
					<a name="07112782000271"><div class="hs_Para">I recognise the
fact that the Mayor is the co-sponsor, but local government needs to be
a key stakeholder, and the Minister has said that it will be involved
in the consultation process. I therefore fail to understand the
Government&#146;s reluctance to refer in the Bill to the fact that
they will consult key stakeholders. Although I am happy to take the
Minister&#146;s reassurance on that, we do not know whether we will
have a different Minister, a different Mayor and a different view at
some stage, so it is odd that the Government will not include any
reassurance in the Bill.</div>
					<a name="07112782000272"><div class="hs_Para">It is disappointing that the
Minister will not accept a number of our points about consultation, but
given that the amendment deals with the co-sponsors and the nominated

consultation to test the will of the Committee. However, with your

							<a name="07112782000489">Susan
Kramer:
						</b> Amendments Nos. 2 and 3 obviously go together and
are designed to ensure that Parliament would not have to sign a blank
cheque. The issue has been tackled to an extent, given the
Government&#146;s willingness yesterday to put the heads of terms in
the House of Commons Library in both summary and slightly more expanded
form. There is some editing, which is always frustrating, to protect
commercial confidentiality, but we are assured that it has been kept to
a minimum.</div>
					<a name="07112782000277"><div class="hs_Para">There is
also a letter from the Mayor outlining how he intends to proceed with
the element of finance that is the responsibility of London. That is a
significant improvement on the situation that we faced when the Bill
was first presented and we first tabled our amendments. However, I am
still left with a number of questions for the
Minister.</div>
					<a name="07112782000278"><div class="hs_Para">First, as
the Minister will be aware from looking at the heads of terms, they in
no way represent a legally binding obligation, and no such obligations
will be entered into until after the legislation receives Royal Assent.
Will he therefore let us know how he intends to keep the House informed
of the final bill, so that we are not constantly having to sign a blank
cheque? Will he also let us know whether there is any mechanism he
would accept that allowed the House to express its verdict once the
final structure for financing Crossrail and its related obligations was
agreed?</div>
					<a name="07112782000279"><div class="hs_Para">As the
Minister will be aware, it is often in the final months of negotiation
that a deal, and particularly its financing, loses any relationship to
the structure that was previously discussed. As the
various financial institutions become involved, suddenly the
fundamental nature of risk allocation and of who is to pay what and
where essentially changes. Therefore, what mechanism does he think
would allow the House some appropriate understanding, which would not
be possible prior to Royal Assent, according to the timetable before
us?</div>
					<a name="07112782000280"><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
will the Minister help us on some understanding of a key element that
seems barely to be discussed within the heads of terms? The heads of
terms lay out various sources of financing, coming up to the total of
&#163;15.9 billion. The uses of funds is a one-line item only, and I
understand why the Minister has presented only a one-line item for
that. He presumably wishes to protect from general public knowledge the
size of the contingency that is built into the uses of funds. That is
sometimes a rational thing to do, because the various bidders on the
contract, if they were to know the size of the contingency, would be
likely to raise their prices to absorb it. He will be aware that the
rumour mill, which is very active within this particular industry, has
suggested that that contingency is an exceedingly large
figure.</div>
					<a name="07112782000281"><div class="hs_Para">We always
talk about projects coming in on budget and suggest that that is a good
thing, but when there is a large contingency, one would expect a
project to come in under budget. Having looked at the heads of terms, I
am not clear who is the beneficiary of any such savings and underspend.
There is only a one-line reference in those
documents.</div>
					<a name="07112782000282"><div class="hs_Para">I looked at
the heads of terms that are presented as part of the sources and uses
statement that I requested in relation to the amendment. With regard to
the timing within which funds are applied from the various sources, it
shows that the funds for the two last years, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column101" />Column number: 101</div>2016 and 2017, are underwritten by TfL and the Greater
London authority, which makes one suppose&#151;correctly, I
hope&#151;that at least the first element of the contingency will be
clawed back to TfL and the GLA, although I do not think that that is
made clear anywhere in the
document.</div>
					<a name="07112782000283"><div class="hs_Para">If the
contingency were to be, for example, almost the same size as the
Department&#146;s contribution, it would be important to know whether
the Department anticipated reclaiming all its contribution, leaving the
project to be funded solely by Londoners, through either the fare box
and TfL or the supplementary business rate. We need clarification on
who is to be the beneficiary of those savings and who, in a sense, is
carrying that element of the
risk.</div>
					<a name="07112782000284"><div class="hs_Para">I make a strong
plea that London fare payers should be the first to benefit from any
underspend and the London business community should be the second,
rather than the taxpayer being first out. That
clarification and an expansion on the outline sources and uses that
have been provided would be extremely
helpful.</div>
					<a name="07112782000285"><div class="hs_Para">On overspend,
which is obviously an ongoing worry and a reason for having an accurate
sources and uses statement, I am somewhat confused by the details that
have been laid out under the heads of terms. That might be in part
because I have not had long to work my way through the document.
However, there seem to be two intervention prices. Will the Minister at
least provide us with clarity as to whether those fall under the total
&#163;15.9 billion? In other words, when a hard line is more
appropriate and is non-contingency related, what uses number is
developed? Do those cover the ground between that and the &#163;15.9
billion, or are they in excess of it?</div>
					<a name="07112782000286"><div class="hs_Para">Indeed, within the document
there is a description of a put option that is to be debt free. That is
the ability of TfL ultimately to put the project back
to the Department. Does that mean that, under these proposals,
Londoners will be left carrying a substantial debt? They will lose
control of the asset and any revenues generated by it if it is passed
back to the Government. If that is a risk that Londoners are taking, it
ought to be
explicit.</div>
					<a name="07112782000287"><div class="hs_Para">The sources
of fund statement indicates that section 106 money will be applied back
into the project. Surely London&#146;s many boroughs have the right
to expect that section 106 money will be available to them to deal with
the offsetting of the many problems that the construction of Crossrail
will cause them. Will the Minister take us through the logic of
allowing that money to be funded back into the project itself, rather
than dealing with the mitigation of the impact on the affected
communities?</div>
					<a name="07112782000288"><div class="hs_Para">The
supplementary business rates are to be set, according to the
Mayor&#146;s letter, on any property that is in excess of
&#163;50,000 of rateable value. Will the Minister give his estimate
of how many businesses will be affected? The media speculation that it
will be between 100 and 150 businesses sounds rather peculiar, but
considering something of that size certainly changes the character of
the deal, compared to something that extends to many more companies
across
London.</div>
					<a name="07112782000289"><div class="hs_Para">There
seems to be real confusion over what will happen with the retail
industry. It is unclear how various retail branches will be
treated&#151;whether collectively or separately.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column102" />Column number: 102</div>
					<a name="07112782000290"><div class="hs_Para">TfL is expected to produce some
of its early contributions under a sources and uses statement from
prudential borrowing. I am unclear whether that is expected to absorb
all TfL&#146;s prudential borrowing capacity. While TfL has used
prudential borrowing on only a limited basis, it has been an essential
part of a wide range of new projects that have been brought on stream.
The East London line, Thameslink and a series of other projects will
come into play in roughly the same period, so I am concerned to
understand what the implications are if all the prudential borrowing is
absorbed within the Crossrail
project.</div>
					<a name="07112782000291"><div class="hs_Para">Lastly,
within the heads of terms, despite the fact that they have been
mentioned over and over again, there is not one single word dealing
with the issue of freight and freight access. It seems extraordinary
that those matters are not even included in the contractual regime
proposed by these various documents. Is the Minister willing to address
that
issue?</div>
					<a name="07112782000292"><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112782000490">Mr.
Field:
						</b> I should first salute the hon. Lady for her great
optimism that somehow this project will not have a great cost overrun.
All experience suggests that a budget of &#163;16 billion is likely
to be exceeded, not least because we were discussing only &#163;10
billion to &#163;13 billion three or four years ago when debate on
Crossrail became more common in the
House.</div>
					<a name="07112782000293"><div class="hs_Para">I fundamentally
disagree with the hon. Lady&#146;s view that it should be the fare
box that gets first advantage of any underspend. The London council tax
payer should get first advantage. Some people who are likely to use
Crossrail will come from outside London and from abroad, but a
significant number of Londoners will also do so. A
large number of infrastructure projects are in part being funded by
London council tax. In my own city of Westminster, this year, for the
first time, more than half the council tax that any resident pays is
now down to the mayoral precept. One can only imagine that, having
underwritten the Olympic games and elements of this project, that
statistic will become worse
still.</div>
					<a name="07112782000294"><div class="hs_Para">A
Mayor who does not empty a single refuse bin, sweep a single street or
run a single school or social services department will none the less
take an enormous proportion of the council tax spend from Westminster
residents. I appreciate that the same will increasingly apply to other

					<a name="07112782000295"><div class="hs_Para">There is a
difficulty with what the hon. Lady said about section 106 agreements. I
agree with her that much of the money should be used to mitigate the
localised loss of amenity because of disruption, but the reality is
that the parcel was lost during previous debates on Crossrail and on
the Greater London Authority Bill. It is clear that the Mayor is keen
to have a central pot of section 106 moneys to utilise for purposes
other than local mitigation, so I have some concerns along the line
that the hon. Lady put forward. I would be interested to hear what the
Minister has to say, but I make a strong plea for the London council
tax payer. If the project comes in within budget and money is to be
given back, he or she should be first and foremost, rather than
giving it back through the fare box.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column103" />Column number: 103</div>
					<a name="07112782000296"><div class="hs_Para">Indeed, the business community
is also involved in a fairly unprecedented way&#151;Canary Wharf with
&#163;400 million, and the City of London with &#163;250 million
and rising because of other connections&#151;but I suspect that that
will become much more common for large-scale infrastructure projects in
the decades ahead. The business community will be rather concerned, and
it may become much more difficult to include it in future projects, if
there is to be a massive underspend when there has been a reliance on
its money.</div>
					<a name="07112782000297"><div class="hs_Para">I suspect
that this is probably wishful thinking, given the likely situation in
respect of expenditure on this project, but I hope that I am wrong on
that. It is important that the London council tax payer, who is much
beleaguered by contributions to a range of national projects, should be
the first beneficiary of any
underspend.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112782000491">Mr.
Binley:
						</b> I am beginning to get the impression that there is
a general view that the project is purely about London, but of course
it is not. It impacts sizeably on the rest of our community in many
ways, but I fear that that is not taken into account in the amendment.
The people of Northampton and Northamptonshire
generally are concerned about Crossrail because it does not help their
transport problems one iota, yet it will cost them, through the
Exchequer, a considerable amount of money. The whole question of
transparency in respect of Crossrail is vital not only to London but to
the rest of the country, which will be affected by it but which will
not get quite the benefits that many Londoners hope it will
bring.</div>
					<a name="07112782000299"><div class="hs_Para">Let
us talk about transparency, particularly in respect of money. It seems
that the scheme has gone from &#163;6 billion to &#163;16 billion
in two short years. The costs need to be totally transparent but have
not been in the past. We do not understand why that massive leap has
taken place. I have seen some of the ways that Crossrail has been
costed, and, frankly, as a business man, I have been horrified. The
question of Woolwich station itself was enough to frighten the taxpayer
to death. It went from &#163;350 million down to about &#163;120
million. I know that that is not for the whole station, but the methods
applied to costing were most
disturbing.</div>
					<a name="07112782000300"><div class="hs_Para">Let us
talk about another aspect that will affect the rest of the country: why
we need transparency and why I do not think that the amendment covers
that need. I am concerned, as are many of my constituents, about the
amount of money that London is taking for infrastructure projects. The
Olympics will take a great deal of money, Crossrail is &#163;16
billion and Heathrow will take a lot of money, too. Such projects draw
resources from other parts of the country. They will certainly affect
the ability to provide massive civil engineering infrastructure
projects. I need to know how they will impact on other areas,
particularly those that have sustainable community projects. They, too,
have an immensely sizeable claim for infrastructure.
Transparency is vital.</div>
					<a name="07112782000301"><div class="hs_Para">We talk about underspend. Quite
frankly, I think that the rest of the country has a right to
question the probability of overspend on Government projects.
Indeed, it has been suggested to me that we could&#151;I emphasise
&#147;could&#148;&#151;end up with a &#163;25 billion or
&#163;30 billion project on our hands. We have seen many Government
projects increase threefold in cost, so the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column104" />Column number: 104</div>record is not very good, and we need reassurance. Transparency is the
only way to achieve that, and it is needed not only in relation to
existing figures&#151;we need ongoing reports too. The amendment does
not address that
need.</div>
					<a name="07112782000302"><div class="hs_Para">I am immensely
concerned about the impact on the rest of the country, so I want the
Minister to tell us how we can be fair and transparent for the nation
in terms of costing, focus and the drawing of resources by Crossrail
from other projects that are worthy, that are needed elsewhere in the
country, and that might be affected by Crossrail or other projects in
and around London. How will the Minister reassure us in that
respect?</div>
					<a name="07112782000303"><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112782000492">Mr.
Harris:
						</b> I appreciate the opportunity to take part
in a wide-ranging debate on financing, and I
congratulate the hon. Member for Richmond Park, who in the carry-over
debate was clearly disappointed when I mentioned that Crossrail finance
would not be included in the Bill. She has contrived a fairly ingenious
method of ensuring that the Committee has an opportunity to discuss
financing arrangements.</div>
					<a name="07112782000304"><div class="hs_Para">I shall
preface my remarks by pointing out that, given some of the problems
that the hon. Lady has identified, there are certain areas of the
financing agreement that will not be debated in detail in Committee.
However, I can assure her that the Government are committed to complete
transparency on funding arrangements. An example of that was the
lodging of the heads of terms in the Library yesterday.</div>
					<a name="07112782000305"><div class="hs_Para">In the carry-over debate on 23
October, I made an offer to the hon. Member for
Wimbledon, and to the hon. Lady&#146;s hon. Friend, the hon. Member
for Carshalton and Wallington, to give them an off-the-record Chatham
House rule briefing. They took up that offer, which has been helpful to
the Committee&#146;s deliberations. If I cannot give detailed answers
to certain of her questions, I hope that she will nevertheless accept
that the Government are committed to transparency. I understand and
accept the concerns that exist, particularly in the wider financial
community.</div>
					<a name="07112782000306"><div class="hs_Para">The work
that has been done on assessing the final true cost of Crossrail has
resulted in a more robust position than in almost any other major civil
engineering project of this type. I take issue with the suggestion by
the hon. Member for Northampton, South that the estimated cost of
Crossrail had risen from &#163;6 billion to &#163;16 billion in two
years&#151;I think the record will show that that is what he said. On
the Bill&#146;s Second Reading in 2005, the then Secretary of State
for Transport, my right hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh,
South-West (Mr. Darling) pointed out that, at 2002 prices,
the cost of Crossrail would be &#163;10 billion, which equates almost
exactly, I believe, with a cash amount of &#163;15 billion to
&#163;16 billion in today&#146;s terms by the end of the
project.</div>
					<a name="07112782000307"><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112782000493">Mr.
Binley:
						</b> The Minister will understand that many figures
have been bandied about in the past three or four years in relation to
Crossrail, including in the Select Committee on which we worked. I do
not doubt his word, but it is good at last to have some clearer idea of
what will happen. Does he accept that there has been confusion in the
past and that that is why transparency is needed in
future?</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column105" />Column number: 105</div>
					<a name="07112782000308"><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112782000494">Mr.
Harris:
						</b> I do not accept that there has been confusion in
Government or with Cross London Rail Links. I accept that confusion has
many avenues and many sources, but I do not think that the Government
are responsible for all of it. On Second Reading, the estimated cost
was &#163;10.2 billion. Out-turn cost by the end of Crossrail
construction is estimated to be between &#163;15 billion and
&#163;16
billion.</div>
					<a name="07112782000309"><div class="hs_Para">That leads me
on to another point made by the hon. Member for Northampton, South. He
started off, quite rightly, by pointing out that Crossrail is a project
of national significance; it is not just a London project, but one that
will have significant value for the rest of the United Kingdom, and I
agreed with him. He then went on to complain about the cost of
Crossrail having an impact on infrastructure projects in the rest of
the country. Frankly, you cannot have it both ways. It is a national
project that is being paid for, in part, by taxpayers throughout the
United Kingdom, which is correct because it is a project of UK
significance.</div>
					<a name="07112782000310"><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112782000495">Mr.
Binley:
						</b> I did not complain. I said that there was a fear
that it could draw from other national projects and that that created a
need for transparency. Does the Minister accept that that is the
case?</div>
					<a name="07112782000311"><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112782000496">Mr.
Harris:
						</b> I accept that the hon. Gentleman is frightened,
but I assure him that there is no need to be. The very fact of
Crossrail&#146;s construction and operation will, it is estimated,
add &#163;20 billion to the GDP of the whole country. So, as well as
being an important infrastructure project for London&#151;the
benefits to London will be obvious&#151;it will have a knock-on
benefit for the rest of the United Kingdom
economy.</div>
					<a name="07112782000312"><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Cities of London and Westminster expressed some concern
about the effect on council-tax payers in London and hoped that any
underspend would directly benefit them. I am more than happy to stand
corrected, but I understand that council tax is not intended as a
source of funding for Crossrail; domestic council tax will not be
top-sliced in order to pay for any part of the project. So, he can
reassure his constituents, unless, of course, they own a business with
a rateable value of over &#163;50,000, which many of them will, I am
sure. But council tax is not intended to be a source of
funding.</div>
					<a name="07112782000313"><div class="hs_Para">The purpose
of the first amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Richmond Park is
to require the provision of information about how the project will be
funded. Of course, as I have said, I am happy to support the case for
transparency, but not through the means suggested. The
Government&#146;s approach to transparency was demonstrated yesterday
when we published the heads of terms that have been agreed by the
Secretary of State for Transport and Transport for London. Some
details, as the hon. Lady has already said, have had to be redacted to
protect commercial confidentiality, but the key terms of the deal
between the co-sponsors of the project are now in the public
domain.</div>
					<a name="07112782000314"><div class="hs_Para">We and
Transport for London now need to progress the detailed arrangements
that would support the heads of terms. That will include a large number
of documents which we expect will take several months to finalise. Our
presumption is that those documents will 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column106" />Column number: 106</div>be made public, again, subject suitably to protecting commercial
interests. On that basis, it would seem nugatory to require in the Bill
for a nomination order to contain information that will be set out
elsewhere and in more detail. Although, as I have
said, I pay tribute to the ingenuity that the hon. Lady has exercised
in securing a debate on finance in the
Committee.</div>
					<a name="07112782000315"><div class="hs_Para">A
nomination order is not, in any case, an appropriate place to provide
the sort of detailed contractual information that the hon. Lady wishes
to see. Furthermore, a practical point is that there may be more than
one nomination order and, if that were the case, the supporting
financial information relating to any one nomination order would tell
us only part of the whole story. That would confuse and, even,
frighten, rather than
enlighten.</div>
					<a name="07112782000316"><div class="hs_Para">The
other feature of the hon. Lady&#146;s amendment is that any
nomination order, by implication, the additional financial information
that she is arguing should be included, should be subject to a positive
decision of Parliament. The degree of parliamentary scrutiny afforded
to secondary legislation is, quite rightly, of great interest to hon.
Members. I would simply point out that our predecessors saw fit to
accept that nomination orders made under the Channel Tunnel Rail Link
Act 1996 should be subject to the negative resolution procedure, and
that is what we have provided for in the Bill. I believe that that is a
reasonable
approach.</div>
					<a name="07112782000317"><div class="hs_Para">Committee
members understandably wish to know how the project is to be funded and
managed. I would emphasise that we have started to provide that
information already by publishing the heads of terms; we intend to make
more information available in due course. Indeed, the heads of terms
explicitly state that information about the project should be provided
in order to provide a higher level of transparency about the project.
That is key to securing widespread support for the
project.</div>
					<a name="07112782000318"><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Lady&#146;s amendments are designed to produce the same answer
but, as I have sought to explain, her suggested approach would not
deliver the transparency that she wants. I therefore ask her, and ask
her nicely, to withdraw her
amendments.</div>

objective is to secure transparency. I believe that, because of the
size and significance of the project, transparency is absolutely
necessary if it is to have support and respect, both of which are
critical. I take the Minister&#146;s decision to release the heads of
terms yesterday as a very important&#151;I was going to use the word

						</b> Schedule 13 is an important part of the Bill, in
that it adjusts any legislation that might otherwise hinder the
construction and operation of Crossrail. It includes a number of
different paragraphs, a couple of which relate to London lorries and
the effects of the London lorry ban order&#151;the Greater London
(Restriction of Goods Vehicles) Traffic Order 1985&#151;on the
Crossrail
project.</div>
					<a name="07112782000326"><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph 10
of the schedule makes provision for the approval of a lorry licence if
certain conditions are met. In principle, I can see that that is
absolutely necessary, but the paragraph goes on to state
that</div>
					<a name="07112782000360"><div class="hs_brev">&#147;no condition may be
imposed which is likely to obstruct the carrying out of authorised
works&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07112782000327"><div class="hs_Para">My concern about
that wording is that there may be a number of circumstances in which
localised conditions mean that the use of lorries will have to be
slightly curtailed or at least regulated. I imagine that if a permit
were granted, extra conditions would be imposed only if absolutely
necessary, and if that were absolutely necessary, it would be unwise
for the Bill to state that such a condition would
automatically not be
enforceable.</div>
					<a name="07112782000328"><div class="hs_Para">The
underlying motivation for the amendment is a desire to see that the
construction of Crossrail is carried out responsibly. I hope that the
Minister will elucidate exactly how schedule 13 and, in particular,
paragraph 10 in relation to approval of a lorry licence will operate,
and reassure me that my amendment is not
required.</div>

							<a name="07112782000501">Mr.
Harris:
						</b> Again, the amendment is not necessary, but I can
understand why the hon. Gentleman tabled it and the concerns that he
has expressed. Paragraph 10 of schedule 13 deals with applications for
the issue of a permit under the London lorry ban order in
connection with the carrying out of Crossrail works authorised by the
Bill, whether in an emergency, when special procedures set out in
paragraph 11 apply, or in other circumstances. The London lorry ban
order enables restrictions to be put in place on the use of heavy goods
vehicles in the scheme area to help to minimise noise pollution in
residential areas during unsocial
hours.</div>
					<a name="07112782000330"><div class="hs_Para">Sub-paragraph

					<a name="07112782000332"><div class="hs_Para">The amendments proposed by the
hon. Member for Wimbledon would allow the authority responsible for
issuing permits to condition the permit in a way that could obstruct
the timely and efficient carrying out of Crossrail works or be
inconsistent with approvals previously given by the
relevant local planning authorities to lorry
routes.</div>
					<a name="07112782000333"><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
is not desirable. It would allow the issuing authority to overrule the
careful consideration that local planning authorities will already have
given to the matter of lorry routing under the schedule 7 consents
process. Schedule 7 expressly provides that the local planning
authority may modify the nominated undertaker&#146;s proposed
arrangements for lorry routing on grounds including the preservation of
the local environment, where that is reasonably possible. In other
words, the amendment would undermine the good work that local
authorities had already done on lorry routing.</div>
					<a name="07112782000334"><div class="hs_Para">In addition,
the amendment would expose the project to additional cost and risk of
delay. It is unreasonable for the project to face that risk, given the
protections available to local residents through the schedule 7
process. There is the opportunity to petition in the Bill itself, and
there have been a number of undertakings to petitioners on the matter
of lorry routing. With those assurances about the other protections
available to local residents as regards lorry routing, I invite the
hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.</div>

					<a name="07112782000338"><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment is self-explanatory. It would transfer the task of dispute
resolution from the Secretary of State to a third-party arbiter. Clause
62 sets out a robust arbitration process, which would be suitable for
resolving the kind of dispute that may arise as a result of the
necessary disruption caused by the construction and operation of
Crossrail. The resolution procedure provides, for example, that if two
parties cannot agree on an arbiter, the president of
the Institute of Mechanical Engineers or someone appointed by the ORR
will perform the role of arbiter. If such an arbitration process is
good enough to deal with disputes arising from provisions elsewhere in
the Bill, why is it not good enough to deal with those arising from the
provisions in this schedule?</div>
					<a name="07112782000339"><div class="hs_Para">The key benefit of arbitration
is that the final decision is made by a person who is accepted by both
parties to the dispute, which gives the arbiter the necessary authority
and independence. I have no doubt that the Secretary of State would
come to a reasoned and fair decision, but I fear, as I have said
previously, that he or she may not have the same perceived independence
as a third-party arbiter. Clause 62 provides for an independent
arbiter, and such a person would be much better suited than the
Secretary of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column109" />Column number: 109</div>State to making the relevant decisions. I therefore look forward to the
Minister accepting my invitation to agree to the

Harris:
						</b> Paragraph 10 of schedule 13 to the Bill deals with
applications for the issue of permits under the London lorry ban order
in connection with the carrying out of Crossrail works. Sub-paragraph
(4) provides that an applicant who is aggrieved by the decision of the
local authority responsible for issuing the permit may appeal to the
Secretary of State within 28 days of notification of the decision.
Sub-paragraph (5) provides that the Secretary of State may allow or
dismiss the appeal or vary the decision of the authority
concerned.</div>
					<a name="07112782000341"><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman&#146;s amendment would replace the certainty provided by
the Secretary of State&#146;s decision to dismiss an appeal by the
applicant, who is likely to be a contractor or sub-contractor to the
nominated undertaker, with an uncertain and unclear
right or obligation&#151;the drafting does not make clear
which&#151;to seek arbitration following the Secretary of
State&#146;s decision. Given that applications for permits cannot
always be planned far in advance, as the inclusion of an emergency
procedure in paragraph 11 anticipates, the option of further
protracting the decision-making process through the further step of
mandatory referral to arbitration would be of no benefit to the
applicant or the progression of the Crossrail project more generally. I
hope that the reference to the emergency situation will explain why the
provisions for arbitration or the lack of arbitration in the schedule
differ from those in the schedules to which the hon. Gentleman
referred.</div>

a clear obligation. It might be that he thinks that the obligation
would not help the process, but it might help those involved in the
arbitration. I might revisit the amendment on Report, therefore, but at

							<a name="07112782000506">Stephen
Hammond:
						</b> I beg to move amendment No. 60, in
schedule 14, page 210, line 24, at
end insert&#151;</div>
					<div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;( ) If the
remains were interred less than 25 years ago, the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column110" />Column number: 110</div>nominated undertaker shall make every reasonable effort to identify the
relatives or personal representative of the deceased, and consult those
people as to how the nominated undertaker proposes to carry out its
functions under this Schedule with respect to the disposal of the
remains or
monument.&#146;.</div>
					<a name="07112782000347"><div class="hs_Para">We
now turn to the question of the construction of Crossrail affecting the
burial grounds of human remains and monuments to the deceased. I am
aware that the Select Committee considered a number of petitions about
that and has carried out some excellent work. However, clearly the
removal of burial grounds and monuments in order to make way for the
construction of Crossrail is an important and sensitive
issue, which the Bill tackles comprehensively.
Paragraph 1(1) and (2) of schedule 14 requires the nominated undertaker
to publish details of removals, and sub-paragraph (3) relaxes those
rules when dealing with the remains of someone who died more than a
century ago. That appears to be
appropriate.</div>
					<a name="07112782000348"><div class="hs_Para">My
amendment, however, proposes an additional sub-paragraph that would
change the rules when dealing with the remains of those who died more
recently and would represent a more sensitive way of dealing with this
very distressing matter. Twenty five years is a relatively short period
for burials. I accept that no obligation could be placed on a nominated
undertaker to take the approach proposed in the amendment when dealing
with all interred remains. However, very little effort would be
required in order for the nominated undertaker to find relatives of
those interred more recently. They could refer easily to undertakers
that performed the particular ceremony, church records or the electoral
role. Rather than just placing a notice in a newspaper, a slightly more
demanding obligation should be placed on the nominated undertaker in
order to relieve some of the distress caused to the families of those
interred less than 25 years ago whose remains will be removed to make
way for the albeit necessary construction of
Crossrail.</div>

							<a name="07112782000507">Mr.
Binley:
						</b> I support the amendment. In fact I would go even
further and, therefore, seek help from the Minister. Many people have
moved out of London, many of whom came to Northamptonshire, on an
overspill basis, 40 years ago. Many of their
grandparents are the people we are talking about, but they might have
died 40 or 50 years ago. Although I recognise that there is a limit to
what he can do for those people, will he rethink this scenario very
seriously? It will impact immensely on sizeable numbers of
Northamptonshire residents, and I am sure that the same goes for other
counties. Will he be kind and give us and them some comfort in that
respect?</div>
