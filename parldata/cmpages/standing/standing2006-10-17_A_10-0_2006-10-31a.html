Alexander</b> (Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey)
(LD): It is a pleasure to welcome you to the Chair again,
Mr. Hood. I look forward to serving under your chairmanship
in what promises to be a lengthy but engagingly good-tempered sitting.
I shall be brief, as much of what I wanted to raise was mentioned in
the previous debate.</div>
<a name="06110114000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is a probing amendment to
ensure that the requirements of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995
and the Human Rights Act 1998 will be taken into account in the
Department&#146;s contracting with private and voluntary
organisations that are to be engaged to deliver much of the work
involved in rolling out pathways to work, and so on.</div>
<a name="06110114000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">As he did during our sitting on
19 October, in his reply to the previous debate the Minister gave some
welcome reassurances on the Disability Discrimination Act and the
disability equality duty, which comes into force later next month and
which providers in the private and voluntary sector will have to take
into account.</div> <a name="06110114000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">I ask
the Minister to say something in this debate about the Human Rights
Act, because much of what we are discussing has implications under that
Act, not least in respect of benefit sanctions, but in other areas,
too. What consideration has the Minister&#146;s Department given to
the human rights implications of the contracting out of public
functions under clause 15?</div>
<a name="06110114000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">In respect of the sanctions,
the Minister made it clear that the Government have no immediate
intention of giving providers the power to sanction that the clause
allows for. That may well come about in due course in the circumstances
that the Minister tried to describe in the previous debate&#151;if
not to my satisfaction, at least to his.</div>
<a name="06110114000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the Minister give an
undertaking that an assessment will be made of the policy&#146;s
impact on human rights, on child poverty and on disability equality, so
that the potential adverse impacts of giving those powers to
contracted-out providers are taken into account before any decision is
made on contracting out sanctions? I got the impression from 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column335" />Column number: 336</div>the Minister&#146;s remarks in the previous debate that he is keen to
enter a substantial number of caveats before any decision is made to
contract out benefit sanction or decision-making powers. Before any
decision is made, a wide range of factors must be taken into account
and I will add them to his list: human rights, child poverty,
disability equality. I look forward to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
response.</div>
<a name="06110114000047"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000674"></a>The
Minister for Employment and Welfare Reform (Mr. Jim
Murphy):</b> It is great to see you in your place,
Mr. Hood. We have made substantial progress since you last
refereed our proceedings. A cursory look at the <i class="I">Hansard</i> record
shows that we have made progress via Marx, Stalin and the
Jacobites&#146; visit to Derby. To understand where they fit in you
will have to read the record carefully, Mr.
Hood.</div><a name="06110114000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall be brief
so that we can make progress. I can confirm to the hon. Member for
Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey (Danny Alexander) that child
poverty has been established as the No. 1 priority of the Department
for Work and Pensions. We are reviewing all our employment and welfare
programmes to ensure that they have the maximum impact on child poverty
and we will examine not just this Bill and the transition of existing
customers, but every proposal to discover their impact on child poverty
and their likely outcome.</div>
<a name="06110114000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">I confirm again for the
purposes of the record the assurances that I gave on 19 October, to
which the hon. Gentleman alluded, about the protections of the
Disability Discrimination Act and the Human Rights
Act.</div><a name="06110114000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">The effect of
clause 15 is to allow the Secretary of State to authorise providers to
carry out certain functions of his relating to conditionality. It does
not transfer those functions to the providers. Where a contractor is
exercising functions by virtue of clause 15, subsection (7) provides
that in most cases any act or omission of the contractors in carrying
out these functions is to be treated for all purposes as an act done or
omitted by the Secretary of State. For the purposes of the Disability
Discrimination Act or the Human Rights Act, anything done by a
contractor would be regarded as done by the Secretary of State. That
means that the Secretary of State remains responsible for ensuring that
those functions are carried out in away that is compatible
with both the Disability Discrimination Act and the Human Rights Act. I
hope that that reassures the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch
and Strathspey and my hon. Friend the Member for Caerphilly
(Mr. David), who also raised the matter in an earlier
contribution to our proceedings.</div>
<a name="06110114000051"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06110114000675"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Tim Boswell</b> (Daventry) (Con): I am grateful that I am able
to intervene on the amendment, although I do not need to do so,
particularly after the extremely helpful response that the Minister has
given. However, will he concede two things? First, will he concede that
it is important, as indicated in the earlier amendment, that any
contractor, whether contracted for services, let alone for decision
making, is well apprised of the requirements of the legislation and
trained on it? Secondly&#151;this is a wider issue&#151;will he
confirm that, as a matter of good practice, both the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column336" />Column number: 337</div>pathways to work Jobcentre Plus providers, and the other providers of
contracted services, should be encouraged to get together from time to
time to share best practice in this and in other more operational
areas?</div><a name="06110114000052"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000676"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> I will give a very brief
response. On the contractors, I made that position clear in respect of
the Disability Discrimination Act and the Human rights Act, but it also
captures what happens with subcontractors. That is the important point.
Contracts under the clause will be drawn up so that providers are
required to carry out their functions with proper regard to the needs
of disabled people. For example, pathways contracts will have clauses
that prohibit discrimination and harassment on the ground of
disability. Providers will also have to provide reasonable adjustments
so that customers can participate in conditionality, and promote
equality of opportunity. A cursory reading of the contracts and the
paperwork concerning the contracts&#151;I made a commitment in our
earlier proceedings to place that in the public domain&#151;will show
that the potential contractors in the private and voluntary sector will
be under no illusions about their statutory responsibility in terms of
the legislation. With those comments, and that reassurance, I invite
the hon. Gentleman to consider withdrawing his
amendment.</div><a name="06110114000053"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000677"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> As has been mostly been the case over the past
few days, the Minister&#146;s response on the amendments has been
reassuring.</div><a name="06110114000054"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,
by leave,
withdrawn.</i></div><a name="06110114000055"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question
proposed, </i>That the clause stand part of the
Bill.</div><a name="06110114000056"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06110114000678"></a><b class="B">Mr.
David Ruffley</b> (Bury St. Edmunds) (Con): We have had a good
debate about the preceding amendments, but I should like to say one or
two things about the importance of the involvement of the private
sector and the voluntary sector, and why Conservative Members support,
with some reservations, the proposition contained in the clause. The
Employment Related Services Association&#151;ERSA&#151;which gave
evidence to the Select Committee earlier this year, rather punchily
suggested this about the advantages of private and voluntary sector,
non-state-employed personal advisers being involved in the roll-out to
pathways to
work:</div><a name="06110114000602"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Rightly
or wrongly, individuals are often uneasy dealing with Jobcentre Plus
officials. These officials are sometimes viewed as
&#145;agents&#146; of the state, put in place to judge, and
determine whether or not an individual is actively seeking
employment.&#148;</div><a name="06110114000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those are
not my words, and that might be stretching a point. Incapacity benefit
personal advisers and the other officials at Jobcentre Plus are
dedicated professionals who are there to help people, not to catch them
out wilfully or with malice aforethought.</div>
<a name="06110114000634"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.15
pm</div><a name="06110114000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">What ERSA is
driving at, however, is this. In seeking support, claimants will often
show a willingness to take part in training or condition management
programmes, or they will say that they want to get better. However,
they know that the Jobcentre Plus official to whom they are speaking
will be wondering how ill or disabled 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column337" />Column number: 338</div>they are, and outside groups get the sense that claimants feel that they
might compromise their right to benefit by disclosing too much. Again,
those are not my layman&#146;s perceptions, but the thoughts that
were expressed time and time again in the evidence to the Select
Committee. There can be an element of trust and a special bond between
a personal adviser in a charitable body and the person whom the
personal adviser is helping to get back into work, and it is important
that we compare that with the relationship that a person will have with
someone who is working for the state.</div>
<a name="06110114000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a second issue on
which we must reflect when discussing increased contracting out to the
private and voluntary sector. It is an issue about which sector must
have confidence in bidding for contracts, but we have not yet discussed
it, which is why my comments will be very apposite to the clause stand
debate. Working Links is a public-private sector body and does not
belong purely to one sector or the other. I have had many discussions
with its representatives and visited various of its projects over the
past months. As the Select Committee notes, Working Links believes that
the current approach taken by Jobcentre Plus and some pilots
has</div> <a name="06110114000603"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;promoted
unnecessary complexity in providing employment support to benefit
claimants&#148;.</div><a name="06110114000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is the
result of the perceived complexity of the administration process and
the form filling. Working Links said that that did not happen to the
same extent in employment zones, which are private sector led, as we
all know.</div> <a name="06110114000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
argument for the employment zone model was supported by the Centre for
Economic and Social Inclusion and Reed in Partnership, which, according
to the Select Committee, suggested that</div>
<a name="06110114000604"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a national roll-out of Pathways
based upon the pilots would not be as effective as one based upon
Employment Zones which allow greater freedom and flexibility to service
providers&#148;</div><a name="06110114000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">to test
different approaches free from too much form filling. The Secretary of
State for Work and Pensions acknowledged that in evidence to the
Committee, saying that</div>
<a name="06110114000605"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;in the Employment Zones, for
example, the private and voluntary sector providers have a very good
track record in improving outcomes for Incapacity Benefit claimants and
Jobseeker&#146;s Allowance claimants. I think their
performance&#148;&#151;</div><a name="06110114000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">that
of the private and voluntary
sector&#151;</div><a name="06110114000606"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;actually
exceeds Jobcentre Plus in a number of very important
respects.&#148;</div><a name="06110114000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
principle of contracting out is therefore a good one, but&#151;there
is a but&#151;there is a demand for safeguards. We need to understand
that, as the Minister will when he oversees the contract design, which
will be an iterative process. As the Disability Rights Consortium
said,</div> <a name="06110114000607"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
impact of using private and voluntary sector providers to deliver
Pathways in new areas without having to replicate existing provision
will need to be closely evaluated as support may
vary&#148;</div><a name="06110114000608"></a><div class="hs_Para">under the
contracts</div><a name="06110114000609"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;by locality,
provider or individual adviser. Identifying the impact on employment
rates by different impairment groups will be
important.&#148;</div><a name="06110114000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">Is that point
reflected in the way the Minister is designing the contracts, looking
at the effect of these contracts in different areas with different
providers on 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column338" />Column number: 339</div>the employment rates of different impairment groups? I imagine that he
has thought of this, but is there any mechanism by which that will be
measured as the roll-out goes
forward?</div><a name="06110114000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">I turn to
another area where safeguards are clearly required. The Opposition do
not believe in red in tooth and claw, free market provision; in
particular we are not keen on widespread, so-called cherry picking or
creaming. Some claimants, whether for employment and support allowance
or incapacity benefit, by definition have different disabilities. Some
will find it easier to find employment than others. Those with severe
learning disabilities, mental health conditions, autistic spectrum
disorders as well as those with severe physical disabilities will
require more support and take longer to find sustained employment than
those with less serious conditions.</div>
<a name="06110114000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">Contractors should not be
allowed to cherry-pick just those claimants who are easiest to place.
Contractors must be able to meet their targets by getting more people
back into work so that the Government can hit their target of 1 million
men and women off the IB rolls by 2016. But it must not be a simple,
bog standard form of target hitting by helping the easiest first. I am
not asking for specimen contracts, but will the Minister share his
thoughts on this and give us assurances that the contract design
process is looking at how cherry picking can be minimised? It will
never be eliminated and it would be quite unrealistic to think that it
could be.</div> <a name="06110114000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister referred to proposals first mentioned by my hon. Friend the
Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Philip Hammond) on
Second Reading about payment by results. I do not want to have a second
reading debate now about what Opposition policy is. I know that you,
Mr. Hood, being a stern and disciplined chairman, will not
want anyone to be tempted down that route. But the Minister mentioned
it on the first day of these proceedings and he said that he might want
to raise it later on the Bill. I have a sneaking suspicion that this
clause stand part debate is the right
time.</div><a name="06110114000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">For the record
and so there is no ambiguity, the Government proposals and the briefing
that they have given to the outside organisations are to the effect
that payment by results, the outcome-based part of the new regime that
the Bill introduces and to which this clause relates, will involve
roughly a 30 per cent. upfront fee to the private and voluntary sector
providers and 70 per cent. will be payment by results: put crudely, if
a job or training is delivered by the contractor who will be able to do
the roll-out for ESA if the Bill goes through. It will be done anyway
as part of the national roll-out of pathways before ESA comes
in.</div><a name="06110114000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
referred to a Conservative proposal for the payment by results not
being 70 per cent. purely outcome based and 30 per cent. upfront fee,
but being 100 per cent. payment by results. That is not true in
relation to all the new claimants who will be subject to the Bill. New
claimants going on to ESA will be helped by contractors who will get 30
per cent. upfront and70 per cent. payment by
results.</div><a name="06110114000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
will be pleased to hear that we are not in dispute with that
proposition. Our point is slightly different. The Minister has said
correctly that, if 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column339" />Column number: 340</div>someone is on incapacity benefit for two years, they are more likely to
die or retire than to ever find a job. He then went on to
say:</div><a name="06110114000610"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;as a priority we
will focus on those who are newest to incapacity benefit or employment
support allowance.&#148;</div><a name="06110114000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the same vein, the Government Green Paper said, in the roll-out of
pathways to existing claimants: it will be only &#147;as resources
allow&#148;. That got my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and
Weybridge, my hon. Friends on the Opposition Front Bench here today and
me, together with other outside groups, thinking how we could get a
better deal for existing claimants than just what resources allow. We
know the phrase &#147;as resources allow&#148; is Treasury speak
for &#147;we&#146;ll see what we can do on the public spending
round, but maybe they&#146;ll get more money and we&#146;ll let
them have more support, but only dependent on what the Treasury can
find&#148;.</div> <a name="06110114000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">We were
concerned, as were outside bodies, about what is a resource constraint.
Under the Bill, not enough support will be given to existing claimants
when they come on to ESA, nor will requisite support be given to
existing claimants on IB before ESA kicks in.</div>
<a name="06110114000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">We all know that the Department
works under cash constraints. An example of how that works is that the
National Audit Office has identified anecdotal evidence of creaming
within the new deal for disabled people. Contracts out to tender for
the NDDP were based on price, encouraging a large number of low unit
price and low volume contracts offering services. Low numbers were also
targeted by the programme because Jobcentre Plus was allocated only
enough funds for around 4 per cent of the total IB population in an
area. This is not something I say critically of Ministers, but we have
to acknowledge, as the National Audit Office have acknowledged and the
Government in replies have occasionally acknowledged, that the numbers
of people who are the subject of help in, for instance, the new deal
for disabled&#151;it would also apply in similar programmes&#151;is
4 per cent. This is a very small figure and we have to ask ourselves
why it is only 4 per cent. It is not because Jobcentre Plus only wants
to help 4 per cent; it is due to public spending constraints.</div>
<a name="06110114000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me give one example.
Ministers will be aware of this and I do not think they are any more
happy about this than we are. The Sure Trust, among many
others&#151;I could also name the Patwith Trust&#151;say that there
can be a contract to get, for the sake of argument, 500 people into
work who have physical disabilities and who have been on benefit for,
say, two or three years. If the contract is to get 500 people into work
in Birmingham, for example, the organisation has a yearly contract to
hit that 500 target.</div>
<a name="06110114000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">The organisation may hit the
500 target after three months. It has done very well. Having reached
the target nine months ahead of schedule, it goes back to Jobcentre
Plus and says, &#147;We have done in three months what the contract
says we can do in 12 months. We are on a roll here. We are doing
terribly well. Can you give us more money so that in the next nine
months we can get more people back to work?&#148; The answer is no
because of the spending constraint at the Department. The departmental
budget for that cannot be exceeded.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000680"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> My hon. Friend is there. The Minister is
saying&#151;we are all saying it&#151;that existing claimants will
only receive the support in the roll-out process before 2008, when ESA
kicks off, and after ESAis introduced &#147;as resources
allow&#148;. If I have misunderstood the meaning of &#147;as
resources allow&#148;, no doubt the Minister will put me right when
he replies. It seems that priority will be given to those closest to
the labour market. There is nothing wrong with that; they have to be
given support to get back to work. The Minister
said:</div><a name="06110114000611"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;As a
priority, we will focus on those who are newest to incapacity benefit
or employment support allowance&#148;.&#151;[<i class="I">Official
Report</i>, 10 July 2006; Vol. 448, c. 1093.]</div>
<a name="06110114000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Green Paper says that the roll out of
pathways to existing claimants will happen only &#147;as resources
allow&#148;. That is not the same regime as that for new entrants
coming on to incapacity benefit in the roll-out period, or new
claimants for ESA. If we are wrong about that, I should be grateful if
the Minister could point to where he has changed his view about the
statement &#147;as resources allow&#148;. I want a constructive
debate because the point about existing claimants was not invented by
Her Majesty&#146;s Opposition. Nor was it an hallucination on the
part of experienced private and voluntary sector providers. It is fact.
If there were a new policy that the Government have announced about
existing claimants that none of us has heard about, we should be
grateful to be put
right.</div><a name="06110114000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">My final
question relates to the pathways to work roll-out, which is essential
to the proper functioning of the ESA contracting regime under the
clause. The contracting regime for ESA will be the same as that for the
roll-out to pathways. The Minister said in his letter of 4 July to
Members of Parliament that the phase that will begin in October 2007,
the start of the roll-out of the pathways service to the remaining 60
per cent. of new IB claimants and repeat IB customers, will
be</div><a name="06110114000612"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;mainly via private
and voluntary sector
partners&#148;.</div><a name="06110114000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">That will roll
on until April 2008.</div><a name="06110114000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not wish to be known or thought of as a politician who likes dancing
on the head of a pin when it comes to language, but will the Minister
quantify &#147;mainly&#148; in that context? Does it mean 90 per
cent.-plus private and voluntary sector providers getting that
business? Is it 60 per cent., or somewhere in
between?</div><a name="06110114000084"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000681"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> Again, I would not wish to test the patience of
the Committee by going into every detail of all the substantial
questions that the hon. Gentleman asked. They have all been fair, and I
acknowledge the legitimate issues that have been raised by others. I am
not accusing him of dancing on the head of a pin and, with my size 13
feet, there is no pin big enough to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column341" />Column number: 342</div>dance on. I was not about to raise the issue of the 100 per cent.
incentivisation on outcomes, although I have had the details of it with
me at each sitting. The hon. Gentleman is right; on Second Reading, the
shadow Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, the hon. Member for
Runnymede and Weybridge, pressed the Government on such matters. He
said</div><a name="06110114000613"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A payment
of 30 per cent. of the fee up front is precisely what creates the
resource constraint which is constantly referred to as a reason for not
rolling out the programmes more quickly. Why not utilise the private
and voluntary sectors&#146; appetite for risk...on a genuine no win,
no fee basis...paying them only when they have not only placed
someone in work but maintained them in
work&#148;.&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report</i>, 24 July 2006; Vol. 449,
c.636-7.]</div>
<a name="06110114000085"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000682"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> The full quote would be
nice.</div><a name="06110114000086"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000683"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> I will read the whole lot if the hon. Gentleman
wishes. The quote can be found at column 636 of <i class="I">Hansard</i>. I make
the point not to dance on the head of a pin, but to say that we simply
do not believe that constructing the contracts in terms of 100 per
cent. outcomes is the right way to
progress.</div><a name="06110114000087"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000684"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> My hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and
Weybridge was talking about existing claimants. The proposal would
enable a much faster and deeper roll-out of pathways to work to include
existing claimants. Our proposition is only in relation to existing
claimants who would not otherwise get the full support because, as
resources allow, it is a constraint. I repeat that we do not dispute
the 30 per cent. up-freeze, 70 per cent. outcome model that the
Minister proposes for new
entrants.</div><a name="06110114000088"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000685"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> Uncharacteristically, the hon. Gentleman has not
grasped the detail of what we seek to achieve. I say that that is
uncharacteristic, because I think that all members of the Committee
will acknowledge that he has taken great care to understand the detail
of the proposals, as they all have. However, I shall respond to the
specific points that he raised. The 100 per cent. outcome funding model
is not attractive for existing or future customers in terms of the
national roll-out of pathways and any future contracting.</div>
<a name="06110114000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">In answer to the question about
how existing customers will be treated in provider-led pathways, I
return to my earlier comments. In the key criteria document, which we
will place in the public domain, subject to commercial confidentiality,
section 1 asks potential contractors to address the specific needs of
and barriers to all customers, so there will be no distinction or
creaming. The hon. Gentleman quite fairly raised this issue on behalf
of himself and others, and we all share his concern that contracts
should be constructed in such a way as to ensure that opportunities for
creaming are
minimal.</div><a name="06110114000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">My assertion
that we should help the newest IB claimants as a matter of priority is
based on the lessons learned and experience gained from pathways, and
on the information that the hon. Gentleman rightly gave us about people
who are on IB for two years or longer being more likely to die or
retire than ever work again. Three quarters of current IB claimants
fall into that category. What I am saying is that, at the point of
migration, my personal priority would be to move the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column342" />Column number: 343</div>newest claimants across first. That is the distinction I am making about
supporting the newest claimants over and above anyone else.</div>
<a name="06110114000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are happy to learn from the
experiences gained as pathways is rolled out elsewhere in the country,
but the current approach is that the newest claimants and those with
dependent children will be first. That is the distinction that I seek
to make today and will seek to make in the future and as we migrate
people on to ESA, and that is the point that the hon. Gentleman seems
not to have grasped. I do not say that in any negative
way&#151;</div><a name="06110114000092"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06110114000686"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Jeremy Hunt</b> (South-West Surrey) (Con): Say it
gently.</div><a name="06110114000093"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000687"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> I will say it gently, rather than Ruffley, of
course. I have been making that joke throughout the Committee, but it
has taken hon. Members until now to
realise.</div><a name="06110114000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">Current
customers on IB are able to access the support available in pathways in
40 per cent. of the country. As it is rolled out&#151;before 2008 and
before ESA is in existence&#151;current IB customers will
beable to access the support that is available in pathways.
The distinction that the hon. Member for BurySt. Edmunds
(Mr. Ruffley) reasonably raises as a concern, will not be
there, because ESA is the benefit structure, and pathways, when it is
on the ground across 100 per cent. of the United Kingdom, will be the
enabling&#151;</div><a name="06110114000095"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06110114000688"></a><b class="B">Natascha
Engel</b> (North-East Derbyshire) (Lab): I am sorry not to let
the Minister finish his sentence. On the issue of access, will he
confirm, in light of yesterday&#146;s announcement about the 0800 and
0845 numbers, that new claimants on ESA will use an 0800 number rather
than an 0845
number?</div><a name="06110114000096"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000689"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> My hon. Friend has raised this matter with me
pretty doggedly. Earlier this week, we announced that in future all
working age benefits information will be accessible through an 0800
number from landlines and telephone boxes, and of course we could
examine how to enable that for pay-as-you-go mobiles. It is an
important new announcement. That point of contact for Jobcentre Plus
and working age benefits will help as regards access. Hon. Members
might be interested to know that, when I had conversations with a small
group of folk experiencing mental illness, one of the things that
frustrated them was the complexity&#151;the repeat phone calls, the
additional cost. I do not want to overstate it, but in some instances
that complexity was a barrier to accessing the support available,
because they had not yet entered the system. I can confirm that, from
2008, ESA claimants will be able to access services through an 0800
number.</div><a name="06110114000097"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000690"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> If it is the case that existing claimants will
get the same level of support as new claimants in the roll-out and post
2008 when ESA is up and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column343" />Column number: 344</div>running, why do existing claimants only have to volunteer? There is no
mandatory requirement on them to attend
WFIs.</div>
<a name="06110114000098"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000691"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> I will come back to the sentence that I was
halfway through, and then I will respond to that point. The national
roll-out of pathways will enable progressive support&#151;personal
advisers and everything else&#151;to back up the new employment and
support allowance from 2008.</div>
<a name="06110114000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">In respect of the
conditionality that different groups will have to undertake, post 2008,
new customers on ESA, depending on whether they are in the support
group or the work-related activity group, will have to undertake
work-focused interviews and, as we roll it out, work-related activity.
Before the migration, existing customers on IB will continue to receive
the six work-focused interviews. In different parts of the country, we
are piloting to find the right mix of sanctions and conditionality in
the pathways roll-out.</div>
<a name="06110114000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is important to put on the
record that we have made the policy decision, through the Green Paper
process and elsewhere, that from 2008, as existing customers are
migrated across, the conditionality will be in attending work-focused
interviews on the basis, crudely put, that they signed up to IB as a
certain benefit. We are changing aspects of that benefit, but we do not
think that it would be right to force existing customers, at the point
of migration to ESA, to undertake work-focused interviews and also
work-related activity. The compulsion on work-related activity will be
for new customers on ESA from 2008. That is the distinction. We can
continue that legitimate debate, but that is what we have settled, as a
matter of public policy, about where the burden of conditionality will
lie.</div><a name="06110114000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall make some
progress, if I may, on a couple of other matters. In terms of
unnecessary administration, the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds makes
a fair point. In determining what management information and reporting
we require from providers&#151;hopefully this will be reflected in
people&#146;s assessment of the paperwork that can be
provided&#151;we have tried to strike a balance between a genuinely
black-box approach, which we discussed before our break, and ensuring
proper contract management. He will recognise that it is an important
and difficult balancing act to enable flexibility in the private and
voluntary sector but also to maintain national standards, for example
in condition management, to ensure a degree of
quality.</div><a name="06110114000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">On clause 15,
all regulations, safeguards and appeals that apply to the process, such
as work-focused interviews, will apply in the same way as they do in
Jobcentre Plus. I think that the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn,
Badenoch and Strathspey asked about
that.</div><a name="06110114000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that I
have reassured hon. Members. I had another excellently crafted,
detailed speech to read out, and with the Committee&#146;s permission
and your indulgence, Mr. Hood, I will allow my noble Friend
the Lord Hunt to read it out when the Bill reaches Committee in the
House of Lords. That would save an awful lot of people drafting and
crafting time.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column344" />Column number: 345</div><a name="06110114000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is real unanimity about
the capacity of the private and voluntary sectors. Clause 15 enables
that roll-out to those sectors. It is an important component and
building block of the employment and support allowance from
2008.</div>

and capital:

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000692"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I beg to move amendmentNo. 198, in
clause 16, page 14, line 21, leave
out paragraph (a).</div>
<a name="06110114000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">The purpose of the amendment is
to probe the Government&#146;s intentions for the rules on notional
income and notional capital and the way in which those will be applied
in the context of the employment and support allowance. As the
Committee will no doubt know, the notional earnings rule&#151;as it
applies to income support&#151;can be applied in certain cases in
which people are not undertaking paid employment, such as voluntary or
other work, and Jobcentre Plus does not think that it is reasonable to
provide their services free of charge. That means that someone is
treated as if they were in a paid job. For example, if someone works 10
hours a week on a voluntary basis, that can be regarded as 10 hours a
week of actual employment.</div>
<a name="06110114000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">The notional earnings rule
means that the notional amount of money that someone is deemed to be
earning can be taken into account and removed from income support on a
pound-for-pound basis. In other words, people&#146;s benefit can be
reduced by an amount, even though they have not received it, because
theyare doing an activity in the community, for example, which
Jobcentre Plus deems, for whatever reason, appropriate. Likewise,
earnings disregard rules&#151;which are pretty ungenerous
anyway&#151;would also apply. In some cases, expenses when
undertaking voluntary work can be counted as earnings. Therefore,
someone who has had their travel expenses reimbursed could have those
treated as earnings and therefore they would count towards the
&#163;20 earnings disregard limit.</div>
<a name="06110114000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the Under-Secretary
clarify the Government&#146;s intentions for provisions on the
employment and support allowance? The notional earnings rule was
invented to tackle the situation in which people may have forgone
earnings to maximise their benefit situation. However, in the context
of a Bill that deals with work-related activity and people undertaking
activities that can help them get back into the labour
market&#151;this point has been made on both sides of the Committee
during the course of our proceedings&#151;activities such as
voluntary work can and should be regarded as work-related activity as
part of pathways to work or whatever.</div>
<a name="06110114000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">How will those rules apply to
employment and support allowance? If necessary, will the
Under-Secretary consider a form of limited amendment to the notional
earnings rules specifically in relation to the employment and support
allowance so that people engaged in voluntary work, as part of the
process of getting closer to the labour market, can do so without being
penalised. I look forward to her response.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column345" />Column number: 346</div><a name="06110114000112"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000693"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> I welcome you, Mr. Hood, back to the
Committee. We are anxious to make progress and therefore I will not
detain the Committee
long.</div><a name="06110114000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">Dealing with the
generality of the clause&#151;this is not a clause stand part debate,
and I hope not to make a speech on that&#151;we could interpret the
amendment as being about the wording and the construction of the
clause, as it would leave out one of its crucial subsections. We should
probably impart one further dramatis persona to the Committee in the
shape of Kafka, because the idea of prescribing something as capital or
income that a person does not possess, or it is a
disregard&#151;income to be treated as capital, capital to be treated
as income&#151;is overtly in that vein. I would be more than
delighted if I could make that particular case to Her Majesty&#146;s
Revenue and Customs, but I am more concerned that it might catch the
habit and start interpreting my tax schedules along those
lines.</div> <a name="06110114000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
explanatory notes on the clause are long and particularly helpful. I
shall make one other obiter remark. The Bill is constructed rather like
Beethoven&#146;s symphonies: the odd-numbered clauses are weighty and
important, whereas the even-numbered ones are lighter but nevertheless
perfectly delightful.</div>
<a name="06110114000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have good meaty explanatory
notes, so I simply ask the Under-Secretary to assure the
Committee&#151;I think it is clear from the explanatory notes that
everything in the provision is precedented and will be tied down in
regulations&#151;that in connection with the treatment of capital and
income, the provision will not be some kind of arbitrary game, as I
jocularly suggested, and that it will be precedented in
relationto other benefits and tied down to particular
circumstances, such as the wilful evacuation of capital assets, with
which we are fairly familiar in respect of other benefits.</div>
<a name="06110114000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having worked on the pension
credit legislation some years ago, I know that most people do not think
that the tariff for income is particularly generous to the claimant. I
shall not reopen that issue, but perhaps the Under-Secretary could give
the important assurance that she would anticipate that, unless there is
good reason to the contrary, the same approach would be taken in
relation to all benefits. This is like jobseeker&#146;s allowance,
but the capital tariff, or the notional income, is treated as if it
were more or less the same as pension credit. It would be unfortunate
for the Department&#146;s business if those got out of
line.</div> <a name="06110114000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to
reinforce what the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and
Strathspey said about voluntary work. It is an important pathway into
employment, and it is important to encourage rather than discourage it.
The level of notional income should be set with that in mind.</div>
<a name="06110114000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have recently been in
correspondence with the Princess Royal Trust for Carers about some
exchanges that I had on other matters to do with the position of
disabled people who have family responsibilities. I believe that
currently nobody is treated as notionally in work because,
notwithstanding their condition, they have some family caring
responsibilities, although the Under-Secretary will be able to reassure
the Committee on that. The issue has not been much
mentioned.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column346" />Column number: 347</div><a name="06110114000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">I invite the Under-Secretary now
or in response to a later clause, possibly in relation to private
schemes, to reflect on the importance of disability employment advisers
and personal advisers reviewing the situation not just of the person
before them as the claimant but of their family. That will obviously
influence how they are available for work, the kinds of things that
theycan do, and the constraints that they are under.
Understandably, and without prejudice to our earlier exchanges about
work load, case load, box-ticking and the rest of it, people will often
tend to consider the claimant&#146;s situation without necessarily
looking at the family in the round.</div>
<a name="06110114000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">Several hon. Members properly
raised the issue of child poverty. We will not unlock that problem
unless the solutions for those now claiming the allowance are eased or
accommodated as far as possible to meet their family circumstances.
Having said that, the amendment is tabled in a certain spirit, and we
are anxious to make progress. There is no essential difficulty with the
clause, so I shall leave my hon. Friend the Member for South-West
Surrey (Mr. Hunt) to discuss disregards in relation to a
later amendment.</div>

<a name="06110114000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">I can allay the fears of the
hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey, who is in
danger of confusing two issues. One is voluntary work, and we have said
more than once that volunteering is a stepping stone along the pathway
to work. There is a major difference if someone is working in a
commercial environment and appears not to be declaring any income from
that job. As a Member of Parliament I have known circumstances in which
someone has worked full-time in a business and has been astonished to
find out that the DWP thought they might be earning some money when
they were also claiming benefit. That scenario will be covered rather
than the type that the hon. Gentleman
painted.</div><a name="06110114000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">On capital,
perhaps I can highlight another scenario. To circumvent the capital
limits, a person might put all their capital in the name of a trusted
friend&#151;it would need to be a pretty trusted friend&#151;or a
family member. They might effectively dispose of capital so as to come
under the threshold. The clause will deal with such
scenarios.</div><a name="06110114000124"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000695"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> Is it fair to summarise the
Under-Secretary&#146;s comments as being that the clause is primarily
dedicated to dealing with abuse and deliberate attempts to frustrate
the system, rather than dealing with people with entirely legitimate
activities who might get caught in the fire? Will she at least assure
us that that is what she is trying to do in the
regulations?</div><a name="06110114000125"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000696"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> The hon. Gentleman puts his finger on the nub of
the matter. We have increased the capital limits&#151;we doubled them
in April 2000&#151;and there is now a limit of between &#163;6,000
and &#163;16,000. For older 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column347" />Column number: 348</div>people in residential care the limit is around &#163;10,000. The
clause will essentially allow us to deal with those who seek to
circumvent the rules. They are the same rules as currently exist for
income support, and they should be translated into the new
legislation.</div><a name="06110114000126"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000697"></a>Danny

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000698"></a>The
Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to discuss new
clause 13&#151;<i class="I">Earnings disregard
level&#151;</i></div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(1) The
Secretary of State may make regulations that the level of earnings
disregard for claimants of Employment and Support Allowance shall be
set at a level that he shall by

the level of earnings disregard under subsection (1) the Secretary of
State shall have regard to labour market conditions including the
National Minimum Wageas defined under section 1 of the
National Minimum WageAct 1998 (c.
39).&#146;.</div><a name="06110114000130"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000699"></a>Mr.
Hunt:</b> I, too, welcome you back to the Chair,
Mr. Hood. We are trying to make progress. We know that that
must be the case because we have not heard the weather forecast for
Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey. I regret that slightly,
because rather like &#147;The Archers&#148;, I am beginning to
follow that forecast and I am a bit curious as to how it might be this
afternoon.</div><a name="06110114000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">I thank you
for selecting new clause 13 with clause stand part, Mr.
Hood, because it is only loosely related to the clause. It deals with
the income of claimants, and there is not really anywhere else in the
Bill that is suitable to discuss that. Before speaking to the new
clause, I have a question for the Under-Secretary. Clause 16(3)(b)
gives the Secretary of State the power to disregard the capital or
income that a person possesses. Will she confirm that she might be
prepared to do that if a disabled person is asked to take part in a
consultation on Government policy and is given travel expenses? She and
I both spoke at the annual general meeting of the British Council of
Disabled People recently. One of that organisation&#146;s great
concerns is that it is often asked to participate in consultations
about policy, but often gets little or no remuneration for it. It is
particularly concerned that if its members receive any
remuneration&#151;even travel expenses&#151;it could count as
income towards their earnings disregard. Will that be one occasion on
which the Secretary of State could show a bit of
latitude?</div><a name="06110114000637"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5
pm</div><a name="06110114000132"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000700"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> Does my hon. Friend agree that this may apply to
certain people who may receive expenses or honoraria, or may decline to
claim them in relation to anything that they are required to do in
connection with user consultations under social care legislation?
Parliament encourages consultation with service users, so it would be
unfortunate if it appeared to subvert the position of users through the
earnings disregard.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column348" />Column number: 349</div><a name="06110114000133"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000701"></a>Mr.
Hunt:</b> As ever, my hon. Friend makes an important point. A
specific example of what he is talking about would be the pilots
concerning individual budgets, where it is vital to get service
users&#146; views if programmes are to be rolled out effectively and
successfully. I am sure that the Government do not intend to put off
disabled people from participating in such consultations, so it would
be great if the Minister could reassure the
Committee.</div><a name="06110114000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">Moving
on to new clause 13, I understand that the real intention of the Bill
is to tackle the barriers to work faced by many people with a limited
capability for work. It is encouraging that the Bill rolls out various
proactive support measures that could help people make the difficult
transition and engage in the world of work. However, I tabled the new
clause because I am concerned that the Bill fails to deal with a
structural problem that is a huge barrier to people re-engaging or
engaging for the first
time&#151;<i class="I">[Interruption.]</i></div><a name="06110114000135"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000702"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. May I ask the hon. Member for North-East
Derbyshire (Natascha Engel) to resume her
seat?</div><a name="06110114000136"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000703"></a>Mr.
Hunt:</b> I am grateful, Mr. Hood. I am hoping that
the hon. Lady will intervene later, because she made some interesting
interventions earlier when we were talking about Tunbridge Wells Tim
and Derbyshire Dave.</div><a name="06110114000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am concerned that built-in disincentives, including the strict rules
about how much money can count towards the earnings disregard, strongly
discourage people from engaging in the world of work. If we remove the
structural problems with the earnings disregard, we will have far
greater success with the proactive support measures advanced under the
Bill as part of the pathways
roll-out.</div><a name="06110114000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">On

included looking at the DWP website, which I am proud to have done
because it was important for our debate
today.</div><a name="06110114000142"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000707"></a>The

blame.</div><a name="06110114000143"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000708"></a>Mr.
Hunt:</b> Thank you, Mr. Hood. As a new Member of
Parliament, I shall take very seriously your advice about not getting
things transcribed things on to the record that are best left
untranscribed.</div><a name="06110114000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">The DWP
website
says:</div><a name="06110114000614"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;You
cannot usually work while you are getting Incapacity Benefit, Severe
Disablement Allowance, National Insurance Credits or Income Support
because of illness or disability. You may be able to do the following
types of work but you should check with your local Jobcentre, Jobcentre
Plus or social security office before you start.&#148;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column349" />Column number: 350</div><a name="06110114000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">Then it talks about those types of work.
Neither the Bill nor the explanatory notes make it clear
howthe dual structure works in this regard. I hope that the
Minister is able to enlighten the Committee about ESA and the dual
structure that exists at the moment, where people on income support
only have a &#163;20 earnings disregard, but those on incapacity
benefit have the permitted work higher limit of &#163;81 a week. The
Bill does not make it clear whether the Government intend that dual
structure to
continue.</div><a name="06110114000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am sure
that it will not have escaped the Minister&#146;s notice that,
curiously, there is a much lower earnings disregard for those likely to
be the poorest people involved in the programme. Will the Minister
clarify whether she thinks that it is appropriate to have two levels of
earnings disregard given that part of the benefit of introducing new
welfare reform legislation is a move towards simplicity and
transparency, where possible? Having complicated rules dependent on the
individual claimant for earnings disregard would not appear to do
that.</div><a name="06110114000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">The earnings
disregard for people on income support has not changed since its
introduction, but the labour market conditions have. Disability
Alliance told the Select Committee on Work and Pensions that until
October 2005 those on income support could work for up to four hours on
the minimum wage, but since then increases to the minimum wage to
&#163;5.35 mean that they can work for just over three hours. It
asked whether it was not incongruous that a person can work for a
certain number of hours one year, but not the next. I put it to the
Committee that that is against the spirit of the Bill&#151;a spirit
that the Opposition
welcome.</div><a name="06110114000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Select
Committee recommended that the earnings disregard be set at four hours
at minimum wage and uprated annually. New clause 13 is actually weaker
than that and would allow, but not compel, the Secretary of State to
uprate the earnings disregard in line with the minimum wage and require
him or her to take account of other labour market conditions, not just
the minimum wage&#151;other conditions need to be factored
in.</div> <a name="06110114000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">I put it to the
Minister that it is not necessarily the case that increasing the
disregard would amount to an increase in public spending. If people did
not think that it was going to affect their benefits package, they
would feel more encouraged to engage in the world of work&#151;in
many cases they are not because of the earnings disregard&#151;and to
take those first few halting steps. In that case, in the long run, the
Bill would be more successful in getting people off employment and
support allowance and back into
work.</div><a name="06110114000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
gave an interesting example from her constituency surgery when she met
someone working for a commercial organisation who did not understand
why that might be incompatible with claiming benefits. The concern is
that if the earnings disregard rules are too generous, everybody doing
a part-time job might think, &#147;I will sign on and claim benefits
at the same time as earning a wage from my part-time
job&#148;.</div>
<a name="06110114000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">Actually, the Government could
be a lot bolder with earnings disregard because of the structure of the
pathways to work programme. In reality, people have to go through a
process before being considered for ESA and talk to a personal adviser
who has much more detailed knowledge of their personal situation than
has 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column350" />Column number: 351</div>been the case before. In that situation, with that knowledge of
individual claimants, it ought to be possible to be a lot more generous
with the earnings
disregard.</div><a name="06110114000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">I thank you
again, Mr. Hood, for allowing this new clause to be debated.
To wrap up, I remind the Minister that Capability Scotland said that 50
per cent. of working-age disabled people in Scotland did not want to
engage in the world of work because they were worried that it would
threaten their benefits package. Let me remind her also that the
Secretary of State himself has talked frequently, in the House and the
media, about the relationship between poverty and worklessness. Is it
possible that by accepting the new clause we could turn the spotlight
on the barriers created by permitted hours and the earnings disregard?
Will she consider supporting the new clause as a step in the right
direction to dealing with that
issue?</div><a name="06110114000153"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000709"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I would like to add a few remarks to those of
the hon. Member for South-West Surrey on earnings disregard. It is an
important issue to raise at this stage. I shall not comment on his
nocturnal activities, but I do think that his amendment has drawn
attention to an important issue. The situation is worse than he
described because he dwelt only on the permitted working rules in
relation to incapacity benefit and earnings disregard in relation to
income support. But of course there are also earnings disregard that
apply to housing benefit. In relation to incentives to work and the
agenda to make work pay, is it worth someone going to work, as the Bill
tries to encourage people to do? Do people feel that when they go to
work, they receive a reasonable amount of the money that they
earn?</div> <a name="06110114000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">The question of
earnings disregards is important. The earnings disregard is set at
&#163;20, which means that someone can carry out less than four hours
work on the minimum wage before they start losing benefits. Depending
on which benefit they receive, they may lose it quickly, too. Recent
figures suggest that as a result of those tapers, people can then lose
their benefit at the rate of 70p to 90p in the pound of new wages
earned. If one were to suggest such rates for people at the top of the
income scale, there would be squeals of pain from the City and
elsewhere; however, the Government consider it acceptable for people at
the lowest end of the scale.</div>
<a name="06110114000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">The earnings disregard will
allow a proportion of income to be earned before the clawback starts.
It will be critical to people who want to try out not just work-related
activity, but a few hours of work a week, or to people who have a
fluctuating condition and are able to work less than 16 hours a week.
Tax credits that help people make their work more worthwhile do not
kick in until 16 hours have been worked.</div>
<a name="06110114000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would be useful if the
Under-Secretary were to address not only the earnings disregard for
employment and support allowance, but the interaction between the
different earnings disregards for different benefits. After all,
someone in receipt of ESA is likely&#151;although not
certain&#151;to be in receipt of housing and other benefits, as the
hon. Member for 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column351" />Column number: 352</div>South-West Surrey said. All earnings disregards will have a substantial
impact on the financial incentives for people to return to
work.</div>
<a name="06110114000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would be
grateful if the Minister were to explain both the Government&#146;s
thinking on earnings disregards, and her discussions and thoughts on
the idea of higher earnings disregards to help get people off benefits
and back to work and to help a range of other claimants who face
substantial disincentives. That includes high marginal withdrawal rates
of benefits. A higher earnings disregard could help someone move higher
up the ladder towards work, before that person&#146;s benefits
started being taken away. What we do about marginal reduction rates of
benefits is a matter for a separate debate, although it is important.
We could start by establishing earnings disregards at a sufficiently
generous rate that allowed people to try out work, and for work to be
financially worthwhile.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000710"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> Mr. Hood, may I ask whether I will be
replying to the debate on clause stand part as well as new clause
13?</div>
<a name="06110114000159"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000711"></a>The

<a name="06110114000160"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000712"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> Thank you for that clarification, Mr.
Hood.</div> <a name="06110114000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am delighted
to have had this discussion, because as my hon. Friend the Minister
said during the debate on clause 13, it is an important issue. He also
said that </div><a name="06110114000615"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;regulations
could, for example, state that it is paymentsafter deduction
of expenses that are prescribed for the purposes of
deduction.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, Standing Committee
A,</i>17 October 2006; c.
85.]</div><a name="06110114000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">He was interested in the
points made during that debate.</div>
<a name="06110114000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall clarify some other
points. Under incapacity benefit, as the hon. Member for South-West
Surrey said, permitted-work rules allow a person to continue receiving
benefit while they work. We recognise the importance of work. There are
two limits: the lower permitted one of &#163;20 a week and the higher
limit of &#163;86 a week, which is available in limited circumstances
and allows someone to start to make the move from part-time work into
full-time work in a supported environment. We have tried to look at the
spectrum of support that is
needed.</div><a name="06110114000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is no
evidence to show that a blanket disregard on its own is effective in
moving someone from worklessness or incapacity benefit into work. It is
a matter not just of what income should be disregarded, but of the
other mechanisms that need to be put in place. I have had discussions
with Capability Scotland and other organisations on the
confidence-building measures that we need to put in place, because the
hon. Gentleman is right: if someone is sitting on benefit for a long
time there is a security in knowing what income they have and in
knowing that they have an entitlement to certain things. If a person is
asked to leap into something that is perhaps beyond their recent
experience we need to consider how to ensure that that person has the
confidence to make the leap.</div>
<a name="06110114000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">As we all agree in this
Committee, the best way out of poverty is into work. That is why we
have extended the linking rules so that someone who holds an 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column352" />Column number: 353</div>entitlement to a benefit has the security of knowing that, subject to
their meeting the criteria, they can move back on to that entitlement
if they try work and it does not work out. It allows confidence to be
built up with the security of knowing that they have not completely cut
the cord between themselves and the benefit system. I think that that
addresses some of the issues that were raised.</div>
<a name="06110114000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">I appreciate that the hon.
Gentleman wants us to give a commitment to raising the rate, but I say,
gently, in the words of my hon. Friend the Minister for Employment and
Welfare Reform, that we cannot just take the income disregard in
isolation, as a series of measures needs to be put in place.</div>
<a name="06110114000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the point raised by hon.
Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey, decisions on how
housing benefit, council tax benefit and so on will interact with
contributory employment and support allowance cannot, of course, be
made until the structure of the ESA has been decided. Some of those
issues will be considered further down the line and, as we have already
given a commitment, will be subject to other
debates.</div><a name="06110114000168"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000713"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I understand the legal reasons for the
Minister&#146;s point. She is right to say that a range of other
factors have to be taken into account; earnings disregards cannot be
treated in isolation. However, someone in receipt of housing and
council tax benefit who starts earning more than &#163;20 a week
starts to lose benefits at the rate of 85p for every additional pound
earned, which is a substantial disincentive to work. Will the Minister
take that factor into account in thinking through how ESA should relate
to the housing benefit
issue?</div><a name="06110114000169"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000714"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> I have heard what the hon. Gentleman said, but I
have gone as far as I am prepared to go in today&#146;s
discussions.</div><a name="06110114000170"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000715"></a>Adam
Afriyie:</b> Is the Minister saying that she is not prepared
to link any disregards to the minimum wage, which was set by her
Government as a benchmark for minimum earnings and for many other
important things that underpin our society? Can the Minister make that
absolutely clear to the
Committee?</div><a name="06110114000171"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000716"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> It is lovely to hear the minimum wage being
embraced in such a wholehearted way by a party that made us sit through
a long night when we used to have all-night sittings. My hon. Friend
the Member for Dumfries and Galloway (Mr. Brown) remembers
it
well.</div><a name="06110114000172"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000717"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. We may be drifting away from the
point.</div><a name="06110114000173"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000718"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> I know, Mr. Hood, but it was worth a
try.</div><a name="06110114000174"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000719"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> The Conservative party has moved on. Will the
hon. Lady?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column353" />Column number: 354</div><a name="06110114000175"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000720"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> The proof of the pudding may be in the eating,
but I hope that we do not have to eat it for a long time. I go to my
earlier point. It is not specifically about the level of the disregard,
although as my hon. Friend said earlier, it is an important issue and
one that we will have to consider. That is probably as far as the hon.
Gentleman will tempt me today.</div>
<a name="06110114000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government regularly review
the level of disregards, taking into account a large range of relevant
factors, one of which is the prevailing labour market conditions. We
need to ensure that we do not undermine the incentives for people who
move off benefits into full-time work if that is appropriate. It is
about getting the balance right and not creating a situation where it
is more acceptable for people to be on benefit plus a high disregard,
which either the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and
Strathspey or the hon. Member for South-West Surrey highlighted. We are
currently working on how we can achieve that balance. We will be
setting out the rules on permitted work and earnings disregards in the
regulations that follow the Bill and those regulations will be subject
to debate and discussion in the
House.</div><a name="06110114000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think that I
have dealt with the specific points raised in the debate. The clause
will allow us to prescribe when a customer can be treated as having
income or capital which he no longer has, for example, where it has
been disposed of deliberately; disregard certain capital and income,
for example, the value of a customer&#146;s house or personal
possessions; and provide a capital limit so that those with capital
over this amount are not entitled to benefit. Clause 16 is a crucial
part of the Bill as it enables the value of income and capital to be
treated in a way that is similar to existing
benefits.</div>
<a name="06110114000178"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000721"></a>Mr.
Hunt:</b> I was informed by the Clerks that I needed to let
you know, Mr. Hood, before the end of the debate on the
clause whether we wanted to press new clause 13 to a vote. May I, in
that spirit, briefly respond to the Minister and explain what our
thinking on that is?</div>
<a name="06110114000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister mentioned the
minimum wage. This is central to this issue. I freely admit that I had
concerns when the minimum wage was introduced that it would price some
people out of the market. I was wrong. That has been demonstrated by
what has happened subsequently. May I praise the Minister? The minimum
wage is a brilliant mechanism to work in partnership with the pathways
to work programme. Without a minimum wage there is obviously a real
concern that employers might exploit the fact that the benefit system
exists to pay lower and lower wages and hope that the state would fill
the gap. With the minimum wage that is no longer
possible.</div><a name="06110114000180"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000722"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> I felt I should declare an interest as some
Members may recall that I had a certain degree of responsibility both
for keeping them up all night on the minimum wage and, conversely, in
receiving their attentions in Committee over two whole nights of
debate. Whatever else one may say about that process, it was right to
bring out the issues. I simply wonder whether my hon. Friend would
reflect on the fact that the more the Government succeed in raising the
acceptable level of the minimum wage, ipso facto, if 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column354" />Column number: 355</div>they do not alter the provision for disregards, the proportion of time
that is available within the rubric will be
reduced.</div><a name="06110114000181"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000723"></a>Mr.
Hunt:</b> As ever, my hon. Friend makes an important point,
and he does so in the Daventry style of debate, which we have got used
to in the Committee. The problem, as he rightly says, is that people
will be able to work for less and less under the earnings disregard as
the minimum wage increases.</div>
<a name="06110114000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Under-Secretary said that
there is no evidence that a blanket earnings disregard on its own is
effective and she is absolutely right that it must be part of a whole
package of measures, including confidence-building measures. However,
it is still a significant hurdle, and the evidence from Capability
Scotland is just one indication of that. To take other, anecdotal
evidence, disabled people who are out of work will say that their
biggest fear is doing anything that could compromise their benefits
package, which is important to them and will be part of their income
for their whole lives.</div>
<a name="06110114000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Under-Secretary also
mentioned the linking rules, which are important, but they are not
widely understood. If they are to play an important part in removing
the barrier to returning to work, the Government must make much more
progress in publicising how they work.</div>
<a name="06110114000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, I ask the
Under-Secretary to correct the Department&#146;s website. She said
that it was possible to earn &#163;86 on the higher rate of
incapacity benefit, but the website says &#163;81. I am sure that she
can ensure that her website is updated.</div>
<a name="06110114000185"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000724"></a>Mrs.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000725"></a>Mr.

clause 17, page 14, line 41, leave
out &#145;this section&#146; and insert &#145;subsection
(1)&#146;.</div><a name="06110114000192"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000729"></a>The
Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to discuss
Government amendment No. 54.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column355" />Column number: 356</div><a name="06110114000193"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000730"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> The amendments enable a person
to be disqualified from receiving payment of a contributory employment
and support allowance if they are absent from the UK or in prison,
unless regulations provide otherwise. Although they will be
disqualified from receiving payment, they will still be treated as
being entitled to benefit, and we need to be clear about the difference
between entitlement and payment. The flexibility to make exceptions in
regulations would allow us to continue to pay someone a contributory
allowance where they were, for example, absent from Great Britain only
temporarily.</div>
<a name="06110114000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
and the regulations will allow people who are absent from Great Britain
for short periods, and prisoners who receive short custodial sentences,
to continue to be entitled to ESA while disqualified from payment of
ESA, so they will keep the underlying entitlement. That will enable us
not to stop and start claims unnecessarily, wasting the time and
resources of claimants and staff. We intend to make provision through
regulations to limit the period of disqualification to six weeks, after
which a person will be treated as no longer being entitled to the
benefit.</div> <a name="06110114000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">The policy
intent for prisoners is clear: the state should not maintain someone
who is in prison through benefits. The provision allows us to
disqualify such people for payment purposes for short periods, rather
than to disentitle them. In that way, we will not waste resources by
stopping and starting claims when people serve only a short sentence.
Where someone is in prison for longer, however, we will use powers in
paragraph 1(a) of schedule 2 to remove their entitlement to benefit
altogether.</div> <a name="06110114000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">Once the
period of disqualification ends, as set out in regulations, entitlement
to ESA will cease altogether if the claimant is still abroad or
imprisoned. However, if they are no longer abroad or in prison, the
provisions will enable benefit to resume without the need for a fresh
claim. Exactly the same provision applies to incapacity benefit, and it
has been a feature of the contributory benefits system for many
years.</div> <a name="06110114000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">We strongly
believe that the benefit system should not support people who are in
prison or abroad, except in specific circumstances, as they should be
supported by other means. The ability to disqualify the payment of
benefit when entitlement is retained is important to protect public
funds.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000731"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> I am sure that the Committee
will be relieved to hear that I do not object to the principle of the
amendments, and that I shall not advise my hon. Friends to oppose them.
However, I would like a moment of the Under-Secretary&#146;s time.
First, I make the point that apparently, or overtly, the provision on
prisoners has been omitted. That may have been purely a technical
oversight, but she should acknowledge the role of my hon. Friend the
Member for Runnymede and Weybridge in drawing attention to the fact
that many of the issues involving prisoners and their benefits have
been rather overlooked by the Department. It is obviously unacceptable
for prisoners to receive benefits when they are in Her Majesty&#146;s
custody.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column356" />Column number: 357</div><a name="06110114000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">That issue
prompts a slightly more substantive point, because, as the
Under-Secretary made clear when moving the amendments, we are talking
about short periods of incarceration. What is the position regarding
available support services and the pathways to work programme? Clearly
such services are not geared towards people who are resident in prison
and may not be extendable to people who are in prison, but there may be
cases in which they could be used&#151;for example, with someone who
has a fluctuating, explosive condition, who has been put in the cells
and charged with some public order offence. There may be sensible
reasons, to do with rehabilitation, for the pathways programme to
continue at that point. If the Under-Secretary cannot give me a pat
answer, will she consider whether that should not be ruled out? I am
interested in this not in relation to the moral approbation of a crime
that has been committed, but as a realistic pathway to rehabilitation.
Many of us are interested in prisoners in that wider
context.</div><a name="06110114000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
pause on only one other matter now, although we may have some comments
to make in the stand part debate, which is the reference to Great
Britain. The hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey
has tabled amendment No. 201 to schedule 2, which raises the same
issue. As we will debate that amendment later, I do not wish to
anticipate or rehearse any of the comments that he might make, but I am
genuinely puzzled about one point.</div>
<a name="06110114000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">This country
is the United Kingdom, with Great Britain and Northern Ireland. We
know, and clause 60 reminds us, that we are not legislating for
Northern Ireland in the Bill. That may happen either by an Order in
Council or through a procedure of the devolved Assembly if it is
reconstituted and takes up its powers. I simply make the point that
moving to another part of the United Kingdom is not the same as moving
to a UK dependency such as the Isle of Man or Guernsey; it is not
leaving the UK. It is odd, therefore, that the structure of devolved
government, or otherwise, seems to preclude Northern Ireland. There may
be a perfectly innocent explanation for that, but I am genuinely
puzzled by it. I raise this issue only for completeness, and do not
make any suggestion that I wish to oppose this particular amendment,
which seems entirely
sensible.</div><a name="06110114000202"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000732"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> I shall deal first with the Northern Ireland
issue. The hon. Gentleman may have helped the whole Committee by
raising this point, because it can be confusing when we talk about
Great Britain, the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland. He makes the
point that we are a country of union, and that Northern Ireland,
Scotland, Wales and England are all part of the United Kingdom. I
thought, however, that he realised that for some significant years,
Northern Ireland has had its own social security system, which often
mirrors&#151;if not exactly mirrors&#151;the provisions of our own
social security system. However, the actual powers have resided in
Northern Ireland. I think that I am right in saying that we have a
reciprocal agreement. I know that that sounds like peculiar terminology
in the context of the United Kingdom, but that is just the way it is.
We have had that agreement since 1976, so it is not something new or
innovative that we are imposing in the Bill to link in with the current
situation. I hope that that addresses some of the issues raised. It is
long held in legislation that Northern Ireland has a slight 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column357" />Column number: 358</div>separation, but the situation often mirrors, and may well exactly
mirror&#151;I do not want to be caught out on a
technicality&#151;the social security system in the rest of the
UK.</div><a name="06110114000203"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000733"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> I am grateful to the Under-Secretaryfor
that explanation. I suspected that it might be something along those
lines, but the amendment is intended to maintain the entitlement to a
benefit, not the actual payment of it, for the comparatively short
period of six weeks, not least for administrative reasons. She has been
slightly unclear as to what would happen if, perhaps for no more reason
than taking a therapeutic holiday or staying with a sister in Northern
Ireland, a claimant was to move over there. Would the benefit be
maintained or lost? What would happen for the weeks spent in Northern
Ireland? Would the claim not fall and be replaced with a Northern
Ireland claim? We do not seek to trap the Under-Secretary, but she
might like to reflect on that at length or at her
leisure.</div><a name="06110114000204"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000734"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> I reassure the hon. Gentleman that, because of
the agreement between the social security system in Northern Ireland
and that of the other parts of the UK, which I called a reciprocal
agreement, people moving from one jurisdiction to the other do not lose
out on any non-means-tested benefit. The situation is, in a peculiar
way, unified in terms of the individual&#146;s right to be
protected.</div><a name="06110114000205"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000735"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I shall not detain the Committee long, but
there are important questions to be answered about a number of the
provisions of the clause. It is worth noting in passing that, under
previous clauses, we have discussed a number of different rules.
Failure to follow them will mean that people can have their benefit
sanctioned. This clause makes provision for circumstances in which
someone can be disqualified from receiving benefit at all. It mentions
the power to disqualify someone from receiving employment and support
allowance on the grounds of
misconduct,</div><a name="06110114000616"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the failure
without good cause to follow medical
advice&#148;,</div><a name="06110114000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">which is loose
phrasing, or the failure without good
cause</div><a name="06110114000617"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to observe any
prescribed rules of
behaviour.&#148;</div><a name="06110114000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">That means
that someone who has gone through the assessment process and been
identified as having limited capability for work, and is therefore
entitled to receive the employment and support allowance, could
nonetheless be disqualified from receiving it and therefore receive no
benefit at all for up to six weeks. That could happen to someone who
had become of limited capability for work or who remained in that
category, through their own misconduct.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column358" />Column number: 359</div><a name="06110114000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Under-Secretary has rightly
made the point that provisions to disqualify someone from benefits
already exist in incapacity benefit legislation. She said that the
Government were seeking to repeat those provisions in the context of
the Bill. I do not wish to be thought of as a pedant, but I should
point out that under IB rules someone can be disqualified
where</div><a name="06110114000618"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;he fails without
good cause to attend for or submit himself to such medical or other
treatment as may be required in accordance with the
regulations&#148;.</div><a name="06110114000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
17 replaces that fuller wording with the term &#147;medical
advice&#148;. Will the Under-Secretary spell out what is meant by
&#147;medical advice&#148;? Does it mean that someone who has had a
work-focused health-related assessment and refused to follow the
suggestion to seek further medical help or condition management, or
advice from their GP to go for a counselling session, could be
disqualified for ESA?</div>
<a name="06110114000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">The term &#147;prescribed
rules of behaviour&#148; is also worryingly vague. What do the
Government envisage by it? The matter was brought up in an earlier
amendment. I hope that, in applying the clause, the Under-Secretary and
the Government will take into account the possible effect of such rules
on those with behavioural problems or other mental health conditions
that might affect their behaviour. Any prescriptive sense that certain
forms of behaviour are required in order to qualify for benefits could
have worrying implications for people in those categories. I would
welcome any further information that she could provide on that
point.</div> <a name="06110114000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a
further question on the point about medical advice. If someone is to be
disqualified for benefit for a failure without good cause to follow
medical advice, to use the Bill&#146;s language, what is likely to
count as &#147;good cause&#148;? Who will provide the evidence that
someone has failed to follow medical advice? Will it be their GP, or
the doctor or other medical practitioner who is required to carry out
the medical
assessment?</div><a name="06110114000215"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000736"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> Would the hon. Gentleman not also like to reflect
on the difficulty of what happens if the person&#146;s GP and the
doctor examining on behalf of the Department take a different view
about the appropriate course of medical
action?</div>
<a name="06110114000216"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000737"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes a pertinent point.
There might be a disagreement about medical advice. We know from our
earlier discussions about the clause on work-focused health-related
assessments that the attendance at such an assessment could be subject
to a sanction&#151;in other words, someone&#146;s failure to turn
up could lead to their benefit being sanctioned.</div>
<a name="06110114000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">It was made clear by the
Secretary of State in a letter to me, and by other Ministers, that any
particular course of medical action or treatment is not subject to a
sanction, yet the Bill provides that simply failing to follow medical
advice will potentially be grounds for disqualification from benefit
altogether. We are not simply talking about someone having their
work-related activity premium sanctioned, but about their being
disqualified from benefit overall.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column359" />Column number: 360</div><a name="06110114000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am sure that the Government do
not intend to reverse the undertaking given on work-focused
health-related assessments in the context of this clause.None
the less, the rather vague language used about the severe penalty of
disqualification from benefit warrants a little more of the
Committee&#146;s attention, so I look forward to the
Under-Secretary&#146;s
response.</div><a name="06110114000647"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.45
pm</div>
<a name="06110114000220"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000738"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> I think that the
Under-Secretary will probably shortly be telling us that the clause is
again about delinquency or a wilful refusal to follow the rules. In
that, we can be sympathetic to the Government&#146;s position.
Equally, I find my notes on the clause in sympathy with the comments by
the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey. I
suppose that the answer to both is that we need to strike the right
balance with the right kind of consultation to ensure that the rules
work.</div><a name="06110114000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">I, too, have
some points that I would like to emphasise. First, we should check the
coverage because it appears that the disqualification rules are not
confined to those on the employment component and could apply also to
those on the support allowance. I think that Ministers might need to
reflect on that because once somebody has limited capacity for work,
they are within the frame, and if they are unable to participate in
work-related activities, they would move on to the support component. I
cannot see how that sensitive route is excluded by the
clause.</div><a name="06110114000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">My second
concern relates to serial disqualification. The Minister has made it
perfectly clear that the intention is to deal with a short-term
situation, but as far as I can see, there is nothing in the clause to
stop an officer taking the view that somebody should be disqualified
and then disqualified again, as it were, indefinitely. Will she respond
to that
point?</div><a name="06110114000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">Following on
from that, I am concerned about the definition of misconduct,
particularly if relations with the claimant are bad or, to be honest,
if the official has a bee in their bonnet. It would be arguable,
although I would think not in this Committee, that somebody with a
condition induced by smoking or the misuse of drugs such as cannabis
might well have a psychotic condition that has resulted in their
limited capacity for work. We can all take different views about the
balance between deploring or even trying to sanction such behaviour and
being understanding, but the general spirit of the Committee is to try
and take people as they are and to work with them to get them back into
the labour market.</div><a name="06110114000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am genuinely concerned that somebody might within the rubric of the
clause be able to say, &#147;It is your own fault that you have got
yourself into this position of being unable to work&#148;. Let us
take obesity: &#147;You are a very fat slob and should not be in that
position, but now you cannot work.&#148; I do not think that that is
what the Under-Secretary is targeting in the clauses, but I would like
her assurance that that is the
case.</div><a name="06110114000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall move on
to the underlying concerns of the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn,
Badenoch and Strathspey, which I too have flagged up. Let us consider
people with conditions that are somewhere between the medical and the
social. I am thinking about addictions, whether to alcohol or drugs,
or&#151;I make a distinction 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column360" />Column number: 361</div>between these&#151;mental health conditions that might well fluctuate.
Those are certainly medically relevant conditions, but they concern the
person&#146;s behaviour as well as medical condition. It would be
quite wrong to think about disqualifying, because of misconduct, people
who had a serious drink or drugs problem and whom one is trying to help
through pathways. The references to &#147;medical advice&#148; and
&#147;without good cause&#148; might make that easier, although it
is difficult to know how we tie that down or determine how far it is
being complied with.</div>
<a name="06110114000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">In all seriousness, the
Under-Secretary will be aware that many people who have got into such a
situation might lead pretty chaotic lives. In the great scheme of
things, it might be their fault, or they might have contributed to
their own difficulties. That might well be true and the origins or the
pattern of difficult behaviour might go a very long way back, but to
remove a benefit for six weeks because of misconduct might not be the
most fruitful thing to do, or the fairest.</div>
<a name="06110114000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that the Under-Secretary
will reflect on that balance and respond to the concerns that have been
expressed. In no sense does anyone here wish to subvert the intention
to stop delinquency, but it is important that the provisions are tied
down to that and not to wider
considerations.</div><a name="06110114000228"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000739"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> I am pleased that the issues have been aired,
because that allows us to deal with some of the concerns that have been
raised. I hope that I can, once again, give some comfort to Committee
members.</div><a name="06110114000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) asked whether people
with mental health conditions would feel as though they were being
victimised by the clause. I reassure him, and other colleagues too,
that we will not disqualify any claimant without taking into account
all the relevant factors, such as the likely impact of an illness on
their ability to understand and comply with advice and evidence from
their own medical practitioner, or without giving them the opportunity
to explain their position. I must reiterate the words &#147;good
cause&#148;. Disqualification takes place where there is no
&#147;good cause&#148;. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will have
appreciated, as we have progressed through the Bill, that we recognise
the seriousness of people&#146;s fluctuating mental health
conditions.</div><a name="06110114000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">Medical
advice and treatment has been a part of IB for many years. The IB
legislation contained the words &#147;medical treatment&#148; and
that has never caused any great concerns. I hope that hon. Members
recognise that we would not anticipate using this power in any
overwhelming way.</div><a name="06110114000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
think that the hon. Member for Daventry was backing up comments made by
the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey about
whether people could be disqualified if they did not take advice to
give up smoking or lose weight. If that were so, a lot of Committee
members would not qualify for our jobs. No names, no pack drill. We are
not anticipating using the power in that way; we would use it only
where, for example, a claimant disregarded without good cause advice
from their general practitioner or hospital specialist regarding
generally accepted, reasonable and non-invasive treatment that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column361" />Column number: 362</div>would significantly improve their condition. The GP will determine the
medical advice, although it will be an issue for Jobcentre Plus advisers
to decide about whether there is good cause to disregard that
advice.</div><a name="06110114000232"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000740"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I welcome that clarification. However, if
someone failed to follow medical advice offered by a GP or another
medical practitioner on a work-focused health related assessment, which
is considered reasonable as Ministers have described it, would their GP
then have to make an assessment? How would it work in those
circumstances?</div><a name="06110114000233"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000741"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> To a certain extent, perhaps we are talking at
cross purposes. The powers under the clause are intended specifically
to deal with those people who wilfully or intentionally try to get
round the regulations relating to the new employment and support
allowance by not following standard medical advice. For example,
someone may not take their medication to manage their condition, which
would put them in a worse medical condition than if they had followed
standard
advice.</div><a name="06110114000234"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000742"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> The Under-Secretary of State has made it clear
that the basic responsibility for medical advice lies with the
claimant&#146;s GP. As I understand it&#151;she will disabuse me if
I am wrong&#151;that advice is privileged between the GP and their
patient who is, for this purpose, the claimant. Therefore the personal
adviser, or the person who has conducted a work-related health-focused
assessment, has no locus in the matter. It would be an entirely private
matter if the GP said, &#147;You should no longer take these drugs or
you should take more of these drugs,&#148; and the person failed
todo it.</div>
<a name="06110114000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">I fully
understand the Minister&#146;s assurance that this may be a
precedence in IB and may never have given rise to any problems, but
there is the potential of a confidentiality problem. Of course, if
someone conducting an assessment on behalf of the Department sees an
acute medical condition, they have a professional duty to draw that to
the attention of any medical adviser in the patient/claimant&#146;s
best interests. There is at least a sensitivity there. The Minister may
like to reflect on how this will be tied up and who best will carry it
out.</div><a name="06110114000236"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000743"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman for
his comments. As usual, he makes an important point. I am please to be
able to give him the reassurance that obviously there is an issue of
confidentiality. There is the issue of customer consent to information.
It has to be informed consent. I appreciate that that is one of the
issues that I mentioned earlier about whether someone fully understands
what they are giving consent to. It is for the general practitioner to
send Jobcentre Plus the information relevant to the benefit
entitlement, not some of the wider issues that may affect the
individual. Just for the record, I point out that for the work-focused
health-related assessment, non-participation is equated to a sanction,
not a disqualification. It would be best to get the terminology
right.</div>
<a name="06110114000237"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000744"></a>Adam
Afriyie:</b> Will the Minister give
way?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column362" />Column number: 363</div><a name="06110114000238"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000745"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> I had hoped to make slightly more
progress.</div><a name="06110114000239"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000746"></a>Adam
Afriyie:</b> I appreciate the Minister&#146;s generosity in
giving way. I seek reassurance on one small point. If a
disqualification is forthcoming under the clause, is the claimant
entitled to appeal and, if so, under which
legislation?</div><a name="06110114000240"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000747"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> I can reassure the Committee that where there is
a sanction or a disqualification, there is always the right to an
independent appeal. That is just the way the system operates. I should
reiterate for the sake of clarity that this is about non-participation
without good cause in the prevailing circumstances. The hon. Member for
Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey was worried that if someone
came in and was obstreperous or did not appear to be following the
normal modes of behaviour that would somehow lead to a
disqualification.</div>
<a name="06110114000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is about misconduct that
leads to an injury or refusal to follow health and safety advice, for
example. That is what is intended under the clause. Although a number
of organisations have expressed some concerns, I hope that the
Committee will accept my reassurances that there will be adequate
training for staff and safeguards will be put in place so that
customers are always given the opportunity to explain their actions
before any disqualification
occurs.</div><a name="06110114000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">We will use
the power in the clause to disqualify benefit where a customer
persistently fails to follow acceptable rules of behaviour, for
example, where they fail to provide their address so a review of
benefit entitlement cannot be undertaken. It has been a feature of
incapacity benefit since 1996 when the incapacity benefit rules were
initially drawn up. We want to maintain confidence in the system and
protect it from abuse. The clause allows us to do that. I recognise the
concerns and I hope that I have allayed some of the
fears.</div><a name="06110114000243"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question put

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000748"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 45, in
clause 18, page 15, line 5, leave
out &#145;24&#146; and insert
&#145;60&#146;.</div><a name="06110114000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not have a great deal to say about the amendment. It is designed
simply to probe the Government&#146;s intentions in respect of pilot
schemes. I would like the Under-Secretary of State to explain her
thinking on the amount of time to be allowed for those schemes. The
Bill as drafted allows regulations for pilots not to exceed a specific
period of 24 months. Will the hon. Lady spell out why she thinks that
two years is the right period for a pilot, given that there is evidence
that longer pilot schemes allow more time for the evaluation and
understanding of their outcomes?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column363" />Column number: 364</div><a name="06110114000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">With those extremely brief
words, I look forward to the Under-Secretary&#146;s
response.</div><a name="06110114000248"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000749"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> I am not aware of any great evidence that we need
longer than 24 months, but if the hon. Gentleman wishes to present such
evidence we will be delighted to consider
it.</div><a name="06110114000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our experience has
shown that 24 months is a suitable period to review the progress of
pilots and to test new approaches to welfare. I am pleased that this is
a probing amendment; if the period were 60 months, it would be not so
much a pilot as a sentence.</div>
<a name="06110114000250"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000750"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I introduced the amendment
very briefly as the Minister will have some well-prepared responses,
but the Bill states &#147;not exceeding 24 months&#148;;
&#147;not exceeding 60 months&#148; would give the Government more
flexibility, which I am sure they would
welcome.</div><a name="06110114000251"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000751"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> The flexibility is built into the Bill because if
we need to extend a pilot beyond the 24-month period, clause 18(7)
allows for replacing one pilot with another, which would be dependent
on Parliament&#146;s approval. If it went up to five years it would
stultify the pilot rather than encouraging us to learn from it. In the
spirit in which the amendment was tabled, I ask the hon. Gentleman to
withdraw
it.</div><a name="06110114000252"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000752"></a>Danny

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000753"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 244, in
clause 18, page 15, line 15, at
end insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">&#145;(c) make it
more likely that employers will recruit and retain such
persons.&#146;.</div>
<a name="06110114000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the preceding debate we
heard how long a pilot should be. In my calculation, the piloting of
the new Labour party has been going on for nine years; perhaps that
pilot will end next year when the Chancellor of the Exchequer takes
over, but who
knows?</div><a name="06110114000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the clause
and the amendment there are powers to pilot most of, but not all, the
provisions in the Bill. The piloting provisions are intended to allow
for different variations in the conditionality regime in order to
understand what works best to help ESA claimants, and we all agree with
that. As the Bill rightly focuses on the obligations of the individual
as part of the rights and responsibility agenda, the amendment probes
for more information on how employers will be engaged in the process of
helping claimants get from welfare into work.</div>
<a name="06110114000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">As well as
the roll-out of pathways, the welfare reform Green Paper also refers to
the piloting of a new initiative in cities&#151;the so-called city
strategy&#151;to bring partners to work together to improve the
chances of claimants getting into work. As the Green Paper pointed out
on page 75, it will entail more effective engagement of local
employers. The Disability Rights Commission&#146;s response to the
Green Paper suggested that employers in city strategy areas could
recruit more people from IB through Jobcentre Plus and its providers
promoting work trials more extensively, and through local government
agencies using their procurement powers to extend the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column364" />Column number: 365</div>range of employers that recruit disabled people. In pushing the
amendment, I ask the Under-Secretary what she understands by the city
strategy agenda to get employers more involved, and how the piloting of
new ways of taking people off IB will work.</div>
<a name="06110114000258"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000754"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> The hon. Gentleman raises an interesting point,
because there must be engagement with employers&#151;the people who
will provide the jobs. My hon. Friend the Minister for Employment and
Welfare Reform and I have met employers not only in the proposed city
strategy areas, but in other areas throughout the country, to discuss
how they can play their part in making welfare reform work. For too
long, the business community thought welfare reform was a social issue,
and although it has a social dimension, it is also a serious economic
issue. We are trying to engage employers to ensure that they feel part
of the agenda, and my hon. Friend and I have met various employer
organisations throughout the country.</div>
<a name="06110114000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman asked for information about the trials that we may consider.
My hon. Friend the Member for North-East Derbyshire might be interested
in my answer, because with Tesco and Jobcentre Plus we are trialling a
scheme in which Tesco offers work tasters for up to one week to
pathways to work participants whom a Jobcentre Plus adviser refers.
Tesco will help with the application and interview.</div>
<a name="06110114000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">One big difficulty for people
who have not been in employment, and sometimes for people who have, is
how to get past the interview. If one has not been in that situation
before, it can be a real confidence shaker. It is bad enough for
politicians standing up in front of a selection committee, and most of
us have the gift of the gab. We are used to selling ourselves, but
imagine going to an interview after a long period out of work. The
support is necessary, and it will include a work-taster review with the
participant, adviser and company&#151;Tesco, in this case&#151;to
identify the further assistance that may be needed to succeed at an
interview.</div> <a name="06110114000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">The scheme
will build on many good factors that the voluntary sector has put in
place for many years. Without going into my background too much, we
would provide such support as a matter of course. The Government are
determined to explore the range of avenues that might lead to better
outcomes, and we are working hard with employers to ensure that they
think of welfare reform as an economic as well as a social issue. The
two are intertwined, and it is important that we ensure that employers,
businesses and companies feel part of the
process.</div><a name="06110114000262"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000758"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> Amendment No. 245 asks for there to be a
requirement that the Secretary of State reports annually on the
evaluation of pilot schemes. What lies behind the proposal is that,
while we all celebrate the early successes of the pathways to work
pilot, there is still a lot more information on how it has performed
that is not available in the public arena. Opposition Members are not
the only people to express worry that a full-on, all-singing,
all-dancing cost-benefit analysis of pathways to work will not be
available until next year. The pilots have been going for some time. I
am not criticising in any way some of the early successes, but it is
quite a job for all hon. Members to table written questions endlessly
and diligently to tease out
information.</div><a name="06110114000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">It might
be in the interests of a more transparent debate if we have as much
information as possible in the public realm that has come from the
evaluators at DWP and the research bodies that it commissions to
evaluate pathways to work and other pilots. It would be useful in that
context for there to be an annual evaluation of all pilot schemes, not
only pathways to work and its successors, but the other schemes that
will no doubt be put in place to test work-related health assessments
and much else
besides.</div><a name="06110114000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 5
seeks to flag up the importance of the employer in making welfare
reform work. As the Under-Secretary of State said, that is a subject to
which Ministers pay attention. I was encouraged to hear her remarks in
the previous debate. New clause focuses on the requirement that we
would like to see for the Secretary of State annually to report to
Parliament on employment and recruitment, and employment retention
practices of publicly funded employers in respect of claimants of ESA.
I do not want to open up a long debate at this stage in that respect in
Committee now because we must make progress. Moreover, access to work
has been alluded to and will be touched on in a minute by my hon.
Friend the Member for South-West 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column366" />Column number: 367</div>Surrey. As an example of what the new clause would drill down into, I
wish to remind the Committee of a DWP memo on the removal of access to
work funding from central Government Departments from October 2006. It
stated:</div><a name="06110114000619"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Access
to Work funding will be removed from central government departments
... from October 2006. Departments will be responsible for funding
from their running costs the workplace adjustments required by their
disabled staff. Central government departments can continue to use the
advice and expertise of Jobcentre Plus staff. This is in line with
practice in the DWP since
2003.</div><a name="06110114000620"></a><div class="hs_brev">The
&#145;savings&#146; to the Access to Work budget resulting from
this change will be kept within the programme. As a result of this
change Jobcentre Plus will be able to re-focus support towards people
who work for smaller
employers.&#148;</div><a name="06110114000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am quoting
the whole story, and I hope that the hon. Lady will give me credit for
that. There is a rationale and a logic to the policy change, but it did
concern Susan Scott-Parker, who asked the Secretary of State about it
in a letter on 9 June. On new clause 5, how many disabled employees did
the DWP support under the access-to-work arrangements until 2003? How
many has it supported since 2003, when it changed its access-to-work
funding regime? Could those questions be answered at the end of the
debate?</div>
<a name="06110114000641"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.15

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000759"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> Does my hon. Friend not agree that his point was
confirmed when it was made clear to me that no baseline transfer had
taken place? Other Departments, which are critical to delivering the
Government&#146;s agenda and setting a good example through the
public sector, would therefore have no additional funds and would face
the invidious choice of reproviding access-to-work funds from their
running costs or finding alternative provision. Is it not particularly
important, therefore, that the effects of the change on what is, after
all, 20 per cent. of total employment, should be evaluated to determine
whether the issue has been dealt with or whether provision has withered
on the vine, with fewer disabled people able to get work through the
public sector
route?</div><a name="06110114000275"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000760"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> I am grateful to my hon. Friend, who makes a
typically powerful and eloquent point. I am sure that the
Under-Secretary will want to respond to his point and mine, which are
closely related.</div> <a name="06110114000276"></a><div class="hs_Para">New

receipt of the allowance for longer than 3
years.&#148;</div><a name="06110114000279"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those groups are
singled out for a reason. We must remind ourselves that the aim of the
Green Paper was not merely&#151;I say &#147;merely&#148;, but
this is asking a lot&#151;to get 1 million people off the incapacity
benefit roll and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column367" />Column number: 368</div>bring it down to 1.7 million claimants by 2016. The Green Paper also set
out two other noble objectives, which were not so time limited. One was
to get1 million more older workers into employment, while the
other was to get about one third of a million lone parents off
benefits. The Bill is designed to achieve those important
aims.</div> <a name="06110114000280"></a><div class="hs_Para">The reference
in the new clause to people over 50 is important because most of us
feel that not enough reference is made to older people. We must remind
ourselves that just under half the existing stock&#151;48 per
cent.&#151;are over 50 and below the age of retirement. They form
quite a large proportion of the IB case load, and we must not forget
them. I remark parenthetically that the interests of this large group
of our fellow citizens have been flagged up in the past couple of weeks
by the Leader of the Opposition, my right hon. Friend the Member for
Witney (Mr. Cameron), in a well received and widely reported
speech. I hope that Ministers will join us in highlighting the need to
do even more to get more support for those people over the age of 50 so
that, when they are able to, they can get back into work, as so many we
know wish to do.</div> <a name="06110114000281"></a><div class="hs_Para">Age
Concern, which we all agree does marvellous work in highlighting these
issues, has reminded me of some important statistics of new claimants,
around30 per cent. of which are by people who are over 50.
That proportion has only declined slightly in the past decade. I make
no party political point; I am sure that that figure was as
disappointing at the end of the last Conservative Administration. It
has certainly not been improving. Only 29 per cent. of over-50s come
off incapacity benefit within six months compared to35 per
cent. of under-50s. Under the pathways to work pilot, this measure has
increased by 9 per cent. for those under the age of 50 but by only 4
per cent. for people over the age of 50.</div>
<a name="06110114000282"></a><div class="hs_Para">These statistics show that
pathways to work and the current regime are doing a better job for
those under, rather than over, 50. This new clause therefore draws
specific attention to the fact that reporting should be made by
reference not just to all claims and to the way in which the Act and
the new regime is helping them, but specifically to the people over 50,
because there is a differential in the performance of pathways to work
for those under and over 50.</div>
<a name="06110114000283"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will not detain the Committee
with statistics; the exact quantum might be disputed. However,
statistics show that almost 1 million older people want to get back
into paid work&#151;part-time or full-time&#151;and that this
under-employment of older citizens costs the United Kingdom economy
billions of pounds a year. I know that that is something that Ministers
and officials will concede. The new clause seeks to focus with
laser-like intensity when Ministers come to report to Parliament to
talk specifically about the effect on those over 50.</div>
<a name="06110114000284"></a><div class="hs_Para">The same arguments could be
made in reference to subsection (2)(b) of the new clause, which refers
to those with mental health conditions. Is the number of those with
mental health conditions coming off the new allowance and getting into
work higher or lower than the average? What about those who have been
in receipt of the allowance for more than three years? How are those
further away from the labour market performing compared with the
average?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column368" />Column number: 369</div><a name="06110114000285"></a><div class="hs_Para">We need that information teased
out in an annual report so that we can all see it in a handy and
useable way. We can all go to the Vote Office and pick it up without
the tedious preface of putting down large numbers of written questions.
Such information should be openly available and I hope that any
Government of any political persuasion would want the rays of
transparency shone on this particular area.</div>
<a name="06110114000286"></a><div class="hs_Para">We need to know not just what
the new regime&#151;that this Bill will usher in&#151;will do for
the general stock, but whether it will get 1 million people off the
current stock of 2.7 million. What sorts of people will be coming off
the stock and being helped? We need to disaggregate the off-flow. It is
as simple as that and this new clause will achieve
that.</div><a name="06110114000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 4 is
very much in tune with the preceding amendments to which I have spoken
in that it would require the Secretary of State to procure a report to
Parliament on the operation of this Act from the Social Security
Advisory Committee. This new clause is slightly different in intent
from the other new clause and amendments in the group, because it asks
for a report from a body that is at one remove from the Secretary of
State. We would like the Secretary of State to report, not because we
do not trust his or her bona fides to produce good information but, as
a belt-and-braces approach. Having the Social Security Advisory
Committee report to Parliament as well as the Department seems to me a
valuable safety net. By requesting the Government to provide reports or
procure them from arm&#146;s-length bodies, we want the evaluation to
be transparent, whether it is of piloting or the general operation of
the legislation.</div>
<a name="06110114000288"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before I
conclude, I shall give an example to flag up why we need to delve
deeply into some of the evaluations that are likely to come out before
2008. Our old friend the Police Complaints Authority will be not so
much piloted as subject to dummy and parallel runs. The Rethink
organisation has rightly pointed out that Atos Origin will run the
current and new tests side by side, and, more importantly, that it will
be analysing customer satisfaction surveys in 2007. It sounds
reasonable, on the face of it, that there should be an evaluation of
how well the dummy runs are operating&#151;we all have an interest in
knowing how the assessments in clauses 8 to 10 will operate in
practice&#151;but as Rethink pointed out, not many claimants are
likely to complete the surveys after spending time at an assessment
centre. They might have other things on their minds.
<i class="I">[Interruption.]</i> The hon. Member for Glasgow, North-West (John
Robertson) is speaking from a sedentary position. Does he wish to
intervene?</div><a name="06110114000289"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is suggested that such surveys are an inappropriate way to gather the
views of many claimants, including those with learning disabilities,
such as autistic spectrum disorder, and those with difficult mental
health problems. People with literacy problems might also be excluded
from participating efficaciously in the surveys, which we expect to
form a key part of the evaluation. Some of us who have noted those
observations think that there should be a more objective evaluation
procedure. If that is put in place, we certainly want to know about it
in the annual report, so that the annual reports to whichthe
amendments refer explain exactly who has done the evaluation over what
period and what the results are.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column369" />Column number: 370</div><a name="06110114000290"></a><div class="hs_Para">I sense that Government Members
are getting a bit restless, but I hope that they have taken my
observations on board. To sum up, we are calling for greater
transparency and a greater call to accountability for Ministers,
whoever they are, so that Parliament can access, in a more
user-friendly way, information on exactly how these critically
important proposals and the new regime will
operate.</div><a name="06110114000291"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000761"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I shall speak briefly in support of amendment
No. 195 and new clause 12. The amendments concern the public interest
and the way in which the operation of the Bill and various aspects of
it are monitored. They are not so much about the convenience of Members
of Parliament, although that is significant, as about making
information much more widely accessible to the general public. The
publication of reports by the Department will provide an opportunity
for members of the public to scrutinise the operation of the Bill much
more
carefully.</div><a name="06110114000642"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.30
pm</div><a name="06110114000292"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 195 requests a report to Parliament by the Secretary of State on
the operation of the powers to make regulations under the Bill. It has
been noted that there are a huge number of regulation-making powers in
the Bill, covering a wide range of matters. We shall turn in a later
clause to which of them will be subject to the affirmative resolution
and which to the negative resolution procedure. Considering their vast
range, an annual report to Parliament on their use would be a useful
addition to the body of information available to Parliament and to the
general public on the Bill&#146;s important provisions. Draft
regulations have not been available to the Committee in relation to
many of the powers, so it has been hard to consider all of them in
detail, although the Under-Secretary will agree that we have considered
a number of them in considerable
detail.</div><a name="06110114000293"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Bury St. Edmunds made an important point on new clause 12
about reports on the scheme&#146;s impact on older workers. Age
Concern&#146;s work is valuable in that respect and suggests that
older workers have not benefited as much as other categories from
pathways to work. The point has been made that a substantial part of
the Government&#146;s target of getting 1 million people off
incapacity benefit in a 10-year period could be met simply by waiting
for recipients of incapacity benefit and who are over 55 for men or 50
for women to reach retirement age. There are 1 million people in that
category and when they reach retirement age, they will come off the
benefit. The Department is therefore a long way towards meeting its
target. It is not an onerous target, but thanks to the body of people
on benefit, the Department is a lot closer to it than might be
suggested. As the hon. Gentleman said, that should not lead to people
over 50 being given less good access or less preferential treatment in
pathways to work. Reporting to Parliament on that would be a useful way
to ensure that the Government are regularly held to
account.</div><a name="06110114000294"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause
12(2)(b) relates to reports on progress in relation to people with
mental health conditions. It is important to remind the Committee that
the evaluation of pathways to work carried out by the Institute for
Fiscal Studies has found that, among people whose 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column370" />Column number: 371</div>first reason for claiming benefit relates to mental health, there is no
statistically significant difference in outcomes compared with what
might otherwise have happened. That is an important point, because
pathways to work is widely praised as being successful. Indeed, the
evaluation shows that, for many categories of benefit recipients, it
has been successful in achieving job outcomes. However, for people in
the mental health category, it has not proved so successful. There
might be a wide range of reasons for that, and the Under-Secretary has
addressed them in previous remarks, but they should be addressed. It is
not good enough to say that pathways generally works well, even though
it does not for certain people, particularly considering that we are
referring to the group that is the largest cause of new
claims.</div> <a name="06110114000295"></a><div class="hs_Para">A specific
annual report to Parliament on how welfare to work help is operating
for people with mental health conditions would be a useful way to hold
the Government to account for how the scheme is working for those for
whom it has not been seen to be so successful. The point about
longer-term claimants is relevant in that regard. I hope that the
Under-Secretary will address the matter in her response, to which I
look
forward.</div><a name="06110114000296"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000762"></a>Mr.
Hunt:</b> I see in front of me a sea of weary faces, so I
shall make my comments brief. I wish to make one comment on new clause
5. There is a huge
opportunity&#151;<i class="I">[Interruption.]</i></div><a name="06110114000297"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000763"></a>The
Chairman:</b>
Order.</div><a name="06110114000298"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000764"></a>Mr.
Hunt:</b> There is a huge opportunity for the Government if we
are trying in the Bill to change employers&#146; attitudes to
employing disabled people. The Government are the biggest employer with
1.3 million employees in the NHS alone. Not only that, but they issue
contracts worth &#163;120 billion every year to private and voluntary
sector providers. They have a real opportunity for an easy win by
ensuring that they transform their recruitment policies. Their record
has got better, but it is still not as good as it should be overall:
4.5 per cent. of civil servants are disabled, compared with 19 per
cent. of the working-age population. That is an average figure and, in
some Departments, the percentage is lower than that. In the Department
of Health, for example, which one would think would understand such
issues, the figure is only 3.3 per cent. In the Scotland Office, it is
zero, but I do not know whether that is because it has a small number
of employees and that the sample size is very small. The point is that
there are some low percentages. Presenting a report annually to
Parliament, as new clause 5 would require, would put pressure on
Governments of all colours to ensure that they make progress in this
important area.</div><a name="06110114000299"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
conclude by reminding the Under-Secretary of a response that I received
from the Financial Secretary to the Treasury in reply to a
parliamentary question on25 July. He
said:</div><a name="06110114000300"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Public
procurement law includes a provision enabling contracting authorities
to reserve contracts for supported businesses and factories employing
more than 50 per cent. disabled people.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official
Report</i>, 25 July 2006; Vol. 449,c. 1352W.]</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column371" />Column number: 372</div><a name="06110114000301"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is an opportunity even under
existing legislation for the Government to do a lot more and the
proposal in new clause 5 that an annual report should be presented to
Parliament would be the catalyst to make that happen. I commend the new
clause to the
Government.</div><a name="06110114000302"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000765"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> Many questions have been raised and I will go
through them, but first I want to pick up some general issues that have
been alluded to.</div><a name="06110114000303"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to make it clear that when we are talking about the number of
disabled workers in any organisation, we must recognise that disability
is a voluntary declaration. Hon. Members will recognise that when we
publish figures in response to parliamentary questions on the number of
disabled members of staff, we always make it clear that that
declaration is voluntary. For all sorts of reasons, we must recognise
that people may not wish to declare themselves disabled. That is a
particular issue, as the hon. Member for Daventry will recognise, for
those with mental health conditions. I make that caveat at the
beginning of my
comments.</div><a name="06110114000304"></a><div class="hs_Para">On access to
work, I am glad that the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds gave me the
opportunity to address some of the issues concerning access to work.
The letter that he read out clarifies the position, but perhaps not
quite in the way that he might have
expected.</div><a name="06110114000305"></a><div class="hs_Para">When the
Prime Minister&#146;s strategy unit reported in January 2005, it made
a series of recommendations, one of which was that if disabled people
are to be truly considered part of mainstream employment, we should
look at opportunities and options for their employment cost to be part
of mainstream employment costs. The DWP, as the hon. Gentleman
graciously highlighted, has blazed a trail with that because we have
absorbed the cost that would previously have been met bythe
access-to-work scheme. We seriously think that Departments should
assume the responsibility for access-to-work provision in their
employment budgets. Saying that disabled people may have specific
support requirements and that they should be considered as part of
employment costs is a beacon to other parts of the employment market.
It is to be applauded, not to be criticised.</div>
<a name="06110114000306"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having said that, I recognise
that concerns were raised about the recruitment and retention of
disabled workers in the Government estate. The Office for Disability
Issues has given a commitment to the major charities and players in the
lobby to monitor and evaluate the impact that the withdrawal of access
to work will have on employment and retention. We do that in the
context of another element of Government legislation, which I know the
Opposition support: disability equality schemes. We are not talking
about something that has come from nowhere, but about something that
was part of a well regarded and well respected Prime Minister&#146;s
strategy unit report that clearly highlighted the way to
equality.</div> <a name="06110114000307"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
justifiable to expect an enormous Government employer across the board
to take in some of those employment costs, because if we are truly to
get disabled people recognised for what they can do and not for what
they cannot do, we must start to think about how we support them in
employment. Government can lead the way on that.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column372" />Column number: 373</div><a name="06110114000308"></a><div class="hs_Para">The other part of the equation
is also important. Opposition Members and, indeed, some of my hon.
Friends have made it clear that some of the challenging work in the
employment of disabled people must be undertaken with small and
medium-sized enterprises, where the majority of new jobs are. That is
why we are clear that the access-to-work budget will be recycled into
the system to support disabled people in SMEs&#151; we are talking
about &#163;2.5 million or thereabouts&#151;because that is where
we need to make the breakthrough.</div>
<a name="06110114000309"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000766"></a>Mr.
Boswell</b> <i class="I">rose&#151;</i></div>
<a name="06110114000310"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000767"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> Before the hon. Member for Daventry comes in, may
I clearly indicate to the Committee that since 1997 the access-to-work
budget has quadrupled? It was &#163;15 million in 1997 and is now
&#163;60 million.</div>
<a name="06110114000311"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000768"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> Can the Under-Secretary simply confirm that the
evaluation of the performance of public sector schemes by the Office
for Disability Issues will be published?</div>
<a name="06110114000312"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000769"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> I can give the hon. Gentleman that assurance. The
Office for Disability Issues publishes an annual report, and a first
annual report has been published. The information will be in the public
domain. I cannot say whether we will do an all-singing, all-dancing
report, but it will be in the public domain, not least because part of
my role as Minister with responsibility for disabled people is to meet
regularly with representatives of the lobby. These are the very issues
that came up as part of those
discussions.</div><a name="06110114000313"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000770"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I want to obtain a brief point of
clarification. The Under-Secretary made sensible remarks about pushing
access to work out, particularly to SMEs. What steps do the Government
plan to take to promote access to work to businesses in that category,
given the relatively low level of awareness among many small businesses
about access to
work?</div><a name="06110114000643"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.45
pm</div><a name="06110114000314"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000771"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> There is a bit of an urban myth that we somehow
hide access to work under a DWP bushel somewhere. We do not, and it is
well used. I think that about 35,000 people use access to work on a
regular basis. That includes what might appear to be quite minimal
support in the form of equipment through to support staff and all sorts
of fairly sophisticated adaptations. If I had a pound for every time
that access to work was mentioned at enormous gatherings, I would be
quite a rich woman. It is not hidden away and we are pleased to be able
to announce that access to work is in
place.</div><a name="06110114000315"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member
for Bury St. Edmunds made great play of accountability and spoke
passionately about ensuring that the figures are in the public domain.
My hon. Friend the Minister looks forward to the third Wednesday of
every month when the Office for National Statistics publishes exactly
the sort of figures that the hon. Gentleman is looking for. There is no
need for parliamentary questions on some of those 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column373" />Column number: 374</div>figures because the ONS publishes them every month&#151;both the
off-flows and on-flows to incapacity benefits. The figures are not
hidden; they are in the public domain. There might still be a need for
parliamentary questions to tease out some background information, if
that is what he wishes, but the ONS does that job and it does it with
robust independence, as he will be aware from his days as an adviser in
the Treasury. The figures are not ours. They are independently
scrutinised and put in the public
domain.</div><a name="06110114000316"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman made an important pointabout older workers. Earlier
in October we introduced a new legislative framework aimed at ending
age discrimination. It has opened up opportunities for older people and
will progressively open up more. My hon. Friend said that over the last
year, some 200,000 over-50-year-olds have moved into jobs. That is a
significant change.</div><a name="06110114000317"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
disabled people moving into employment, I think that the figures show
that we are on the right track. There is still a lot to do, hence we
are keen to promote pathways to work with the voluntary sector.
However, the inactivity rates for disabled people have reduced
dramatically since 1998&#151;they have come down by about 10 per
cent. We are seeing the same trend again. Of course, there are areas in
which we have a significant amount to do, not least among people with
learning disabilities who fall way behind in employment
opportunities.</div><a name="06110114000318"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want
to give a detailed rebuttal&#151;I hope&#151;of some of the points
raised. By removing subsection (7) of clause 18, as proposed in
amendment No. 245, we would prevent the extending of a pilot beyond the
original 24-month period and replace it with a duty to report to
Parliament. Although I understand the desire for scrutiny, as I have
said, Standing Committees do not sit in isolation and there are various
ways in which information and the activity of any Department can be
scrutinised.</div>
<a name="06110114000319"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not
convinced by the arguments of the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds
about needing the Secretary of State to submit a separate annual report
to Parliament. We have a Select Committee process and the Social
Security Advisory Committee&#151;also independent&#151;which
reports annually. Those arrangements work very well and I think that
there would be a danger of over-reporting to no apparent end when we
already have pretty good procedures in place. We often talk about
over-regulation and overburdening the private sector, but dare I
suggest that there is a danger that new clause 5 would increase the
burdens on the public sector by asking for additional reports? I should
highlight the fact that Departments will have to report annually on
their progress under the disability equality
schemes.</div><a name="06110114000320"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 12
relates to the over-50s, those with a mental health condition and those
who have been receiving benefit for more than three years. I repeat yet
again that the Government are determined to ensure that the support on
offer alongside ESA is relevant and useful to every individual,
whatever their personal circumstances. We are clear that that is the
philosophy underpinning the pathways-to-work approach; it is about
looking at individuals as individuals, not as part 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column374" />Column number: 375</div>of a group or a selection of statistics, as we did in the past. The
results from pathways have vindicated that
approach.</div>
<a name="06110114000321"></a><div class="hs_Para">I ask Opposition Members to
reconsider their provisions. All our regulations, all our work and all
our statistics will be in the public domain. We have nothing to hide in
terms of our approach and we welcome constructive criticisms about how
we can improve. Indeed, we welcome the discussion in this Committee,
which has been constructive not just for the most part, but almost
exclusively.</div> <a name="06110114000322"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have
reporting means in place, which have served us well. They are
independent, and involve everyone from the ONS to the Social Security
Advisory Committee. I therefore ask the hon. Gentleman not to press his
provisions to a vote.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000778"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> The purpose of the amendments is to ensure that
the contributory and support allowance treats the additional statutory
paternity pay in the same way as other similar statutory payments made
by employers, such as statutory maternity and adoption pay. The
amendments set out in detail the relationship between the contributory
employment and support allowance and statutory payments.</div>
<a name="06110114000340"></a><div class="hs_Para">The additional statutory
paternity pay is a new statutory payment paid by employers to employees
which was introduced by the Work and FamiliesAct 2006. A
decision on when the new scheme will be introduced is yet to be made,
but we need to ensure that the ESA can take account of that. The
regulations that we will make under the clause will provide that where
a claimant is receiving one such payment from their employer, it will
be deducted from the contributory employment and support allowance
under the overlapping benefit rules. Those arrangements arethe
same as those for incapacity benefit. I therefore ask the Committee to
accept the amendment.</div>

you back to the Chair, Mr. Hood, as everyone else has. It is
a pleasure to have you here. Considering the time, I am sure that
everyone is feeling hungry; I noticed that some Opposition Members were
getting a bit tetchy, which may not be surprising. I am afraid,
however, that I shall speak to the amendment at some length, as I have
a number of points to make. Perhaps I will get through my introduction
before we break either for dinner or for a Division in the
House.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000780"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000782"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b><b class="B"> </b>This is a genuine effort to assist the
hon. Gentleman. He will note that the amendment has been signed by
members of the Committee from all political parties. I give him advance
notice that we probably will not want to speak to it, unless there is
some omission in his
speech.</div><a name="06110114000349"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000783"></a>John
Robertson:</b><b class="B"> </b>I did notice that the amendment, which I
move on behalf of myself and my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries and
Galloway (Mr. Brown), has attracted several names. The hon.
Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey, whom we now call
the Liberal one, has put his name to it, as has his missing friend the
hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Laws) and the hon. Member for
Daventry. I like to think that that is not because I am moving it, but
because it has much merit and covers a great deal of information that
all Members feel that the Government should take on board and address.
Having said that, it is a probing amendment, on which I seek answers
and some fears to be allayed.</div>
<a name="06110114000350"></a><div class="hs_Para">I particularly want to know
what more Jobcentre Plus will do to inform all ESA claimants of all
relevant benefits for which they are eligible when assessing their
claims. Macmillan, Citizens Advice and the Disability Benefits
Consortium have all raised similar concerns with me and support the
amendment, as do Opposition Members. I want to ensure that ESA
applicants are informed of all the relevant benefits, particularly
disability benefits, for which they are eligible when they make their
ESA claim at Jobcentre
Plus.</div><a name="06110114000644"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">7
pm</div><a name="06110114000351"></a><div class="hs_Para">Why introduce
such a duty on Jobcentre Plus? People with cancer need more financial
support. There is a wealth of evidence that cancer leads to a
significant fall in income and imposes considerable additional costs on
people. For example, Macmillan Cancer Support found that, among the
under-55s, seven out of 10 suffer a loss in household income with an
average fall of 50 per cent. The lack of information about benefits
cause people with cancer to miss out. The National Audit Office found
that 77 per cent. of cancer patients are not given information about
available financial
support.</div><a name="06110114000352"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
benefit advisers at Macmillan Cancer Support report that Jobcentre Plus
staff rarely inform cancer patients about disability and carer service
benefits, even when their entitlement to incapacity benefit
demonstrates a potential eligibility for disability benefits. The
scripts used by Jobcentre Plus call centres do not inform claimants
about disability benefits. The onus is usually on the claimants to
inquire whether they are entitled to them. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column377" />Column number: 378</div>As a result of the lack of information, too many cancer patients are
missing out on vital disability benefits that cannot be backdated. They
also miss out on extra income support, housing benefit and other
entitlements that can result from a successful claim for disability
living allowance.</div><a name="06110114000353"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me give an example. In September 2006, a cancer patient aged 38 visited
Jobcentre Plus at Wythenshawe to find out what she was entitled to. She
was told that, because she was receiving statutory sick pay, she would
not be entitled to any benefits. She approached Macmillan immediately
afterwards and was helped to claim disability living allowance that
also entitled her to income support and help with housing costs and
council tax. Misinformation about benefits also causes cancer patients
to miss out. Advisers at the Macmillan helpline have identified the
lack of information or misinformation by Jobcentre Plus as a major
theme among its
cases.</div><a name="06110114000354"></a><div class="hs_Para">People need all
the information available the first time that they contact Jobcentre
Plus. I welcomed the Minister&#146;s remarks to the Committee on 17
October that claimants would receive face-to-face benefits advice on
their first work-focused interview eight weeks after their claim
starts. However, having such advice at that point in the process would
mean that people who were entitled to additional benefits would have
already missed out on much-needed money, which in most cases cannot be
backdated.</div><a name="06110114000355"></a><div class="hs_Para">Furthermore,
those in the support group will not attend work-focused interviews at
all so, under the current proposals, they will have not have access to
any of the benefits advice. Is that so, and what does the
Under-Secretary intend to do to stop it happening? Ministers have
recognised the Government&#146;s need to do more to improve benefits
awareness and take-up, and both Ministers have said repeatedly that
more needs to be done to improve awareness and the take-up of benefits.
For example, the issue was raised by my hon. Friend the Member for
Keighley (Mrs.
Cryer).</div><a name="06110114000645"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">7.3

Robertson:</b> Because I have lost my place, I shall start
again from the beginning. I know that everyone was riveted by what I
was about to say. I was in the process of going through various reasons
for the
amendment.</div><a name="06110114000359"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000785"></a>Adam
Afriyie:</b> I welcome the amendment, especially on the basis
that it is a catch-all amendment. It will catch not just claimants with
terminal cancer but claimants with any terminal disease. Will the hon.
Gentleman confirm that the intention is to catch all claimants with a
terminal
illness?</div><a name="06110114000360"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000786"></a>John
Robertson:</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman for his
intervention, and the answer is in the affirmative. However, the
amendment was tabled not just for that reason but for many
others.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column378" />Column number: 379</div><a name="06110114000361"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was explaining why we have to
put duties on Jobcentre Plus, and I had given four reasons. I said that
some of my colleagues had made contributions in the House. My hon.
Friend the Member for Keighley spoke during the Second Reading debate
on 24 July. In response, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State
for Work and Pensions stated that he
would</div><a name="06110114000624"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;reflect on what my
hon. Friend has said and see whether there is anything more that we can

aware of the various entitlements that might be available to
them.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report</i>, 24 July
2006;Vol. 449, c. 622.]</div>
<a name="06110114000362"></a><div class="hs_Para">Ministers have responded
positively to recent parliamentary questions on the issue from several
MPs including the hon. Member for Billericay (Mr. Baron) and
my hon. Friends the Members for Stroud (Mr. Drew), for
Huddersfield (Mr. Sheerman) and for Calder Valley (Chris
McCafferty). Most recently, in a Westminster Hall debate on benefits
for cancer patients, my hon. Friend the Minister
stated:</div><a name="06110114000625"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I
recognise that we need to improve benefit
awareness.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, Westminster Hall</i>, 10
October 2006; Vol. 50,c.
450WH.]</div><a name="06110114000363"></a><div class="hs_Para">In addition,
156 MPs from all parties signed early-day motion 1553 on
Macmillan&#146;s Better Deal for Cancer Patients campaign, which
includes a call for the Government to use effective referral mechanisms
to inform all cancer patients about their eligibility for financial
benefits.</div><a name="06110114000364"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given
cross-party support and repeated ministerial commitments to improve the
current system, the supporting groups and I believe that the Welfare
Reform Bill provides a clear opportunity to explain how that will be
done. We believe that a key part of the solution is ensuring that
employment and support allowance claimants are told about all benefit
entitlements when they first claim. I ask again whether Jobcentre Plus
ensures that ESA claimants are informed about other relevant benefits
to which they are entitled. The Jobcentre Plus booklet &#147;Our
service standards&#148;, which is dated January 2006,
states:</div><a name="06110114000626"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We aim
to provide accurate and appropriate information and advice to help you
... understand which working-age benefits you may be able to
claim&#148;.</div><a name="06110114000365"></a><div class="hs_Para">Staff are
supposed to</div> <a name="06110114000627"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;direct you
to the right person or organisation if we cannot
help&#148;.</div><a name="06110114000366"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
in reality, that does not appear to happen. Let me give another
example. The current customer management system script used by
Jobcentre Plus call centres does not include questions that would
enable call centre operatives to identify claimants who may be entitled
to disability living allowance or attendance allowance. Nor does it
include any prompts to give information about those benefits or to
refer claimants to advice services for further information about them
or for a full benefits check. Some claimants are asked whether they are
receiving DLA or AA, but those who say that they are not are neither
asked further questions to establish eligibility nor given any further
benefit information. The situation is similar for working tax credit
and child tax credit. I believe that there is scope to change the
scripts so that at least the customer can be made aware of those
benefits and tax 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column379" />Column number: 380</div>credits. Although I accept that that does not happen 100 per cent. of
the time, once is too often, in my
opinion.</div><a name="06110114000367"></a><div class="hs_Para">New duties
and procedures are needed to trigger staff to inform claimants about
the full range of benefits to which they are entitled and then to
signpost them to the appropriate sources of support if Jobcentre Plus
cannot help. Writing an awareness and signposting role into the scripts
used by contacts and centre staff is one way in which benefits
awareness and take-up could be improved. Further changes could include
a DWP benefits inquiry line, which could be one of the main places to
which claimants are referred for a more in-depth assessment of their
disability benefits entitlement and help with form filling, which is
something that many claimants have problems
with.</div><a name="06110114000368"></a><div class="hs_Para">Jobcentre Plus
could also use resources such as UK Advice Finder to signpost claimants
to other organisations that provide specialist benefits services.
Although that would not be a one-stop shop approach, it would be an
improvement on the current reality faced by people with cancer or any
other disability who find themselves with such
problems.</div><a name="06110114000369"></a><div class="hs_Para">Citizens
Advice also raised a few points about passporting and, in particular,
access to help with health costs. That merits discussion here. The
ability to pay for prescriptions is linked to the ability to manage a
health condition, which in turn contributes to a person&#146;s
ability to undertake work. Will new claimants receiving the
contributory rate of ESA be passported to the same benefits and have
access to the same grants and loans as current claimants receiving
income support with a disability
premium?</div><a name="06110114000370"></a><div class="hs_Para">Citizens
Advice is concerned that replacing the current income support and
disability premium with a contribution-based employment support
allowance will disadvantage people receiving that form of ESA. It would
seem that they either would be able to access help with health costs
through passporting or might only be able to do so through the
low-income scheme, which requires completion of a 16-page form. The
Select Committee on Health recommended in its report on NHS charges in
July 2006 that the DWP and the Department of Health work together to
extend health charge exemptions from means-tested benefits so that the
low-income scheme can be
abolished.</div><a name="06110114000371"></a><div class="hs_Para">We do not
believe that it is the Government&#146;s intention to disadvantage
future claimants of contribution-based ESA and would therefore
appreciate clarification from the Under-Secretary on the aspect of the
Bill before us. I appreciate that I have gone on at length, but feel
that the points that I have raised are important and look forward to
her
reply.</div><a name="06110114000372"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000787"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> I hope that I can give my hon. Friend some
reassurance on his points. He is obviously right to raise the issue of
information on benefits and I am happy to say to him that the DWP
already provides a range of information on benefits and statutory
entitlements and on how to claim them. We do that through a range of
methods. Obviously, our website provides eligibility information. We
provide also a range of literature such as booklets and leaflets, which
are available to customers in many locations including advice agencies.
I shall come on to that soon. They are available in different formats
including in Braille.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column380" />Column number: 381</div><a name="06110114000373"></a><div class="hs_Para">Customers
can access advice by contacting their local office or Jobcentre Plus
direct or their benefit delivery centre. I do not know whether my hon.
Friend has been in to one recently, but the new Jobcentre Plus
facilities have direct access telephone lines at no cost to the
customer, and people can access the benefit delivery centre easily.
When notifying customers of benefit decisions, we also ensure that
there is information on a range of other benefits. Information on
employment and support allowance will be available at the first
interview under the new arrangements, so that people can make informed
choices. We must ensure that information is available at the right time
and in the right place.</div>
<a name="06110114000374"></a><div class="hs_Para">I say to my hon. Friend that I
am not sure whether a statutory duty would add anything to the
requirement that we place on Jobcentre Plus to provide information to
those people who contact it. I assure him that my hon. Friend the
Minister for Employment and Welfare Reform, Ministers in Departments
such as the Department of Health and I meet Macmillan Cancer Support
and other charities that highlight the issue of benefits information.
We are working with them closely to consider how we improve access to
information.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000788"></a>Adam
Afriyie:</b> I appreciate the comments on and intentions
towards ensuring that people with terminal illnesses receive
information. There is one group of people with terminal illnesses that
does not receive information; notification is not triggered by the
local authorities or by the Department for Work and Pensions. One of my
colleagues has raised the matter in the House. However, will the
Government introduce an amendment requiring that people with terminal
illnesses are notified of the benefits that they can receive? One or
two groups are not notified, and there is no requirement for them to be
notified.</div>
<a name="06110114000376"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000789"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> I do not want to go too far
down the track of other benefits. I am not sure of the benefits to
which the hon. Gentleman alludes; however, we work hard with the
Department of Health and with charities such as Macmillan to consider
ways in which information can be presented. That includes information
prescriptions, so that when a patient is given a terminal diagnosis,
they have information in front of them. It is a sensitive area, and
Macmillan and the Government realise that at the traumatic point in a
person&#146;s life when they are given the diagnosis, they do not
want the next discussion with a doctor to be about their entitlement to
disability living allowance and attendance allowance. The matter must
be dealt with sensitively, and we must also appreciate that people may
not know that they have a terminal diagnosis. For many reasons, the
diagnosis may be withheld from them.</div>
<a name="06110114000377"></a><div class="hs_Para">We constantly consider ways in
which we can make information available, through websites, citizens
advice bureaux, and advice agencies such as local authorities, social
services and carers organisations. We are not complacent. We recognise
that we must continue to ensure that we improve the ways in which
benefit advice, particularly disability-related benefits such as DLA
and AA, can be delivered. It will be at the forefront of our minds when
we consider the ESA and the first interviews at the beginning of the
process. In light of those reassurances, I hope that my hon. Friend
will withdraw his amendment.</div>

that questions are being asked properly. I fully take on board my hon.

<a name="06110114000386"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall be brief, because I

that we have covered more clauses in two minutes than in the previous
two hours. It was an impressive piece of
work.</div><a name="06110114000387"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment is
intended to probe the Government&#146;s thinking on the nature and
timing of the assessment phase for the employment and support
allowance. It sets out that that phase should end either on the date on
which eligibility for benefit is determined or after 13 weeks.
Ministers have made clear that the assessment phase should last 13
weeks. If entitlement for benefit is determined before the 13-week
phase is over, the entitlement should start on that date so a person
does not have to wait two or three weeks before receiving the full
benefit. That is a relatively simple but important point, not least to
those outside the House following our proceedings. I would be grateful
if the Under-Secretary would clarify the assessment phase and make it
clear that it will end after 13 weeks or on the date on which a
determination of benefit is made if, as we all hope, it happens more
quickly.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000792"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> The amendment, if I understand it correctly,
would have two main impacts. It would set the commencement of the
assessment phase at the point at which an individual makes a claim and
the end of that phase and the movement to the main phase at the point
at which the assessment process is complete, or 91 days after the claim
was made if the assessment is not finished. I believe that that is the
correct
understanding.</div><a name="06110114000389"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000793"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> That is
correct.</div><a name="06110114000390"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000794"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> Right. With the greatest of respect, to determine
the commencement of the assessment phase as the date of the claim would
not be sensible. Many customers seek to backdate their claims due to a
delay in contacting Jobcentre Plus that is no fault of their own.
Others seek to advance their claim dates on the basis that their
employer notified them of termination of contract some days down the
line. We propose, through regulations, to set the assessment phase of
the ESA as a 13-week period from the first day of entitlement. We have
based that length on the evidence from the pathways pilots, which
showed that 13 weeks is a realistic target for assessing the majority
of customers. We will aim to get the assessment for every individual
complete within the 13 weeks, but there might be instances where that
is not possible, perhaps because of a delay in the collection of
evidence or because a customer is unable to attend a medical
examination. Earlier we considered examples such as when a medical
examination has to be rescheduled because of illness or the one given,
if I remember rightly, by the hon. Member for Windsor (Adam Afriyie) of
all 246 Atos doctors being on strike on a given day. I know that was
only an indicator, and that he used a somewhat flippant
example.</div> <a name="06110114000391"></a><div class="hs_Para">We want to
ensure that customers do not lose out if the assessment phase has to be
extended for reasons such as I have described. Our proposals will also
ensure that benefit is not paid to those who are not entitled to it,
which would be a risk if everyone were automatically moved on to main
phase even if their assessment was not complete. I hope that
explanation will be accepted.
</div><a name="06110114000392"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000795"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> The burden of the point on which I sought
clarification was fairly simple. If the assessment of entitlement to
the benefit&#151;in other words, the decision that someone is
entitled to ESA&#151;is made less than 13 weeks from the date at
which entitlement starts, does the assessment phase end at that
point?</div><a name="06110114000393"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000796"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> My hon. Friend the Minister for Employment and
Welfare Reform clarified this in earlier debates. The first phase is 13
weeks and then the customer moves on to the next phase, depending on
what happens as a result of the processes during that phase. The
entitlement will not start until the end of the 13 weeks. I hope that
clarifies the point for the hon. Gentleman for the second time. I have
nearly reached the point of asking him to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="06110114000394"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000797"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I thought I would intervene, rather than come
back with another speech for the Committee&#146;s benefit. If the
assessment phase lasts13 weeks and someone&#146;s decisions
are taken before that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column383" />Column number: 384</div>period ends, is it correct that they do not start to receive the full
rate of benefit until the end of the assessment
phase?</div><a name="06110114000395"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000798"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> That is correct. There might be an opposite
position. For example, for reasons similar to those I have described,
someone might not get out of the assessment phase until 15 weeks have
passed, and if they qualify for the support allowance, it is backdated
to 13 weeks. So, 13 weeks is the threshold in respect of either having
entitlement or backdating. Principally on the point of fairness, we
could not have a situation where people could, for various reasons, be
out of the assessment phase and move into the new benefit at the end of
10 weeks while others might not get there until 15 weeks. We anticipate
that 13 weeks will be our cut-off point. In that context, I ask the
hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.</div>
<a name="06110114000396"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000799"></a>Danny

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000800"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I beg to move amendmentNo. 162, in
clause 21, page 17, line 13, after
&#145;prescribed&#146;, insert</div>
<a name="06110114000874"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#145;, and such amounts as may be
prescribed&#146;.</div><a name="06110114000399"></a><div class="hs_Para">I suspect
that it will just be me and the Under-Secretary discussing this for a
little while, but I shall try to keep the exchanges relatively brief.
The amendment seeks to probe the Government&#146;s intentions on the
payments that will be made to people during the assessment phase of the
ESA.</div> <a name="06110114000400"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is
particular concern about payments made to younger claimants during the
assessment phase. For example, there are younger age rates of
jobseeker&#146;s allowance and there have been discussions about
lower rates being payable for younger claimants during the assessment
phase. Will the Under-Secretary confirm that the younger age rates will
be payable during the assessment phase?</div>
<a name="06110114000401"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a further concern
about the availability of the disability premium. Part of the burden of
this legislation is to remove the disability premium. If it is no
longer payable during the assessment phase, will the Under-Secretary
explain how someone aged 16 or 17 will be identified as qualifying for
the higher rate of personal allowance? I shall talk a little longer to
allow the Minister to think about
that.</div><a name="06110114000402"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is clear that
the additional components will increase someone&#146;s income above
the basic allowance and will be made earlier. Despite that, during the
first 13 weeks some people may experience a drop in income. The Green
Paper on welfare reform states that more than half of new claimants for
incapacity-related benefits are out of work immediately before their
claim and for some groups the level of payments may be above the basic
allowance. Can the Minister confirm that there will be circumstances
when some people, such as those receiving statutory sick pay and those
with a disability premium in previous benefits, will experience a drop
in income for the 13 weeks of the assessment phase because they were on
previous benefits and went on to the assessment phase, which is payable
at jobseeker&#146;s allowance rate? They may qualify 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column384" />Column number: 385</div>for employment support allowance, at which point their benefit would
rise to the higher level. Have the Government given any thought to how
in such circumstances they will avoid fluctuations in income that might
otherwise apply to vulnerable
people?</div><a name="06110114000403"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000801"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> I think I understand what the hon. Gentleman is
getting at. His point allows me to confirm that we will pay a
younger-age rate during the assessment phase, but we have responded to
consultations arising from the Green Paper that allowed us to indicate
that we would not differentiate on grounds of age during the main
phase.</div><a name="06110114000404"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are looking
at a whole new system that will be more responsive more quickly to
people than the current system. The 13-week threshold will mean that if
people meet the criteria, they will move on to a higher level of
benefit than they would currently in terms of the time scale.
Obviously, we have not set the rates&#151;I do not know whether the
hon. Gentleman was trying to lever out an answer on that&#151;but we
have responded to the consultations on the youth rate arising from the
Green Paper. I hope that he accepts my clarification and that he will
withdraw his
amendment.</div><a name="06110114000405"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000802"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I am grateful for that clarification, but the
Minister has not addressed my second point. People&#151;not
necessarily young people, but perhaps adults who will be eligible for
the full rate of JSA&#151;may previously have been on other benefits
before they made an application for employment support allowance. Those
other benefits would be higher than the rate that the Government
propose to pay during the assessment phase. Those people may be on a
higher rate to start with&#151;one could list the range of
circumstances in which that would be possible&#151;but go on to a
lower rate during the assessment phase, and when they qualify after the
13-week period of employment support allowance go on to a higher rate.
There would be a U-shaped curve or fluctuation in the level of benefit
received. Have the Government given any thought to how they might deal
with people in such circumstances to ensure that the fluctuation in
income that might take place does not cause unnecessary damage to
vulnerable
individuals?</div><a name="06110114000406"></a>

assessment. As we have not set the rate, I am not prepared even to
start a discussion on the figures. However, moving from one benefit to
another is a decision that must be considered by the individual. I go
back to my earlier point: we are looking at a tightly programmed
assessment phase, so an individual will still be better off than under
the current system over a 52-week period.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000805"></a>Danny

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000807"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I shall be as brief as can be consistent with
making the intentions behind my amendments clear. Amendments Nos. 196
and 163 probe the clause on issues relating to the Disability
Discrimination Act 1995 and the Human RightsAct 1998, which we
have discussed. We want to make the regulations subject to assessments
on their impact on disability equality and subject to consultation with
the Commission for Equality and Human Rights. As the Committee knows,
that will shortly take over the Disability Rights Commission and the
other equality organisations.</div>
<a name="06110114000415"></a><div class="hs_Para">The thinking
behind the amendments is that because of the importance attached to the
public sector&#146;s disability equality duty, to the 1998 Act and to
the functions currently carried out by the Disability Rights
Commission, it is important, given that the
regulations&#151;particularly under clauses 10 to 14&#151;introduce
a conditionality of benefits, that some mechanism should be in place.
Making assessments on impacts on disability equality and requiring
consultation with the Commission for Equality and Human Rights would
help to ensure that before any regulations were published or dealt
with, the commission could be satisfied that nothing proposed would in
any way undermine the relevant duties. That would allow a degree of
independent scrutiny, which would be welcome.</div>

<a name="06110114000422"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Inverness,
Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey raised a number of probing questions on
amendments Nos. 163 and 196. AmendmentNo. 163 would provide
the Commission for Equality and Human Rights with a formal role in
developing regulations. By general acknowledgment, the Government and
the Department for Work and Pensions are right to be proud of our work
on advancing the interests of disabled people and of our close working
relationship with key stakeholder groups, including the DRC, which we
created five or so years ago. Our extensive consultations on the
development of our proposals for the employment and support allowance
demonstrate our commitment in that regard, as does the fact that we
have produced a prototype disability equality impact assessment in
advance, importantly, of our statutory obligation to do so.</div>
<a name="06110114000423"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the scrutiny of regulations,
the hon. Gentleman will be aware that existing provisions require the
Secretary of State to consult the Social Security Advisory Committee on
regulations made under relevant enactments. He will be happy to be
reminded that that is provided for in section 172 of the Social
Security Administration Act 1992. Importantly, we have added part 1 of
the Bill to the list of relevant enactments for such purposes. As the
recent review has shown, those arrangements have worked well, and I am
not convinced that adding a further layer of consultation of the sort
proposed in the amendment would aid the making of regulations. There
is, of course, the code of conduct for public and Government
consultations, which we will adhere to for future initiatives and
proposals.</div> <a name="06110114000424"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
principle behind the amendment, however, we are happy to confirm that
we will continue to confer with the Commission for Equality and Human
Rights. We have accepted that principle and demonstrated our continuing
commitment to adhere to it.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000814"></a>Mr.

We are under a statutory obligation to publish it and we certainly
intend to do that before we are obliged to do so, as a continuing sign
of our determination to work with stakeholders.</div>
<a name="06110114000427"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 196 is
unnecessary because it repeats what will be our statutory obligations
from December 2006 under the Disability Discrimination (Public

issue is already covered by current law, so I think that the hon.
Gentleman will accept that the amendment is unnecessary.</div>

states that affirmative resolutions of the House should apply only to

regulations on pilot projects under clause 18, and that all other

would delete &#147;first&#148; so that all regulations that relate

general.</div><a name="06110114000435"></a><div class="hs_Para">If I am not
mistaken, clauses 10, 11, 13 and 14 will be of significant import. Not
only should all regulations under clause 12 be subject to an

resolution, as opposed to the negative resolution. I realise that such
matters are a fine point of parliamentary protocol, but none the less
there is a clear difference between the
two.</div><a name="06110114000436"></a><div class="hs_Para">The deletion of
&#147;first&#148; would make it clear that all such regulations
would have to subject to further parliamentary debate as opposed to
being only so subjected if a resolution were prayed against. Such
procedure would be more appropriate given the extent of the public
interest in the way in which regulations relating to matters that are
subjected to work-related 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column388" />Column number: 389</div>activity and, more broadly, conditionality should be considered. Given

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000817"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> My hon. Friend the Member for Ochil and South
Perthshire (Gordon Banks) said earlier from a sedentary position that
it would be great if all our sittings took place in the evenings given
this rate of progress. Such timing certainly serves to concentrate the
mind in a way that no inducement from the Whips and the usual channels
has thus far been able to do. It is welcome and we should sit through
the witching hour.</div><a name="06110114000438"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
for the specific issues raised by the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn,
Badenoch and Strathspey, the Bill currently provides for an affirmative
debate on the first set of regulations laid under clause 12. That is so
because the clause is new; clause 11 relates to pathways, so it is the
innovative nature of clause 12 that has been set aside to be subject to
a positive
resolution.</div><a name="06110114000439"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is not
sensible for a Government to take such action, but more importantly it
is not sensible for Parliament to seek an affirmative resolution in all
circumstances along the lines of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
suggestion. It is for Parliament to decide such matters through the
usual channels and elsewhere, but not to place in the Bill a
requirement to have an affirmative resolution on all changes to
regulations. For example, on page 26 of the draft regulations, we
outline what would be considered a good cause. We have said repeatedly
that the good cause list is not exhaustive and that it can be added to
through time, best practice and from learning what
works.</div><a name="06110114000649"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.15
pm</div><a name="06110114000440"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand
the intention, in terms of parliamentary protocol and control, behind
putting in primary legislation the requirement to have an affirmative
resolution for all changes in regulations, and it is an important
intention. However, the way in which the hon. Gentleman seeks to do
that is heavy-handed and unnecessary. I do not think that Parliament
would thank us for giving it the opportunity to have affirmative
resolutions on the change of good causes, work-focused interviews,
changing the specifics on notification requested for work-focused
interviews and all the things that have to evolve as we roll out the
pathways scheme through the private and voluntary sectors
nationally.</div><a name="06110114000441"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although
I understand the sentiment of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s amendment, I
hope that he accepts that&#151;entirely unintentionally&#151; it
would create what would border on unnecessary and excessive use of the
affirmative resolution procedure for often relatively minor changes in
regulations. They have to be left to the normal practice in terms of
how we change regulations to fit the evolution of delivery mechanisms.
I reassure him that we understand his concerns, but his mechanism to
deal with them is probably unworkable and I invite him to consider
withdrawing the amendment.</div>

reassurance, and I know that all the Opposition parties will be
assiduous in scrutinising the draft regulations that are published in
order to seek debates on a negative resolution when we consider them to
be appropriate. With that in mind, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000821"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> We have set out in the schedule a number of
amendments to primary legislation that follow on from the creation of
the employment and support allowance. Since the Bill was introduced, we
have had the opportunity to identify a number of further amendments
which are necessary to ensure that the new benefit operates alongside
other benefits appropriately. For example, the amendments include
provisions to ensure that children in families that receive
income-related employment and support allowance will, in Scotland,
England and Wales, be entitled to free school meals just as families
that receive income support are. Other amendments will ensure that
recipients of income-related employment and support allowance will not
be liable to pay contributions for various services they receive from
social services, just as income support recipients are not. Further
amendments will mean that deductions can be made from income-related
employment and support allowance for council tax purposes just as they
can be made from income support.</div>
<a name="06110114000449"></a><div class="hs_Para">The changes are necessary to
ensure that recipients of the new benefit are not inadvertently
disadvantaged, that the relevant rights and obligations still apply to
them, and that employment and support allowance fits into the framework
of existing legislative provision. I urge the Committee to accept the
amendments.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000823"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I beg to move amendmentNo. 197, in
schedule 4, page 65, line 30, leave
out paragraph
6.</div><a name="06110114000487"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
purpose of this amendment is to clarify further the Government&#146;s
intentions about applying the employment and support allowance regime
to existing claimants of incapacity benefit and of income support on
incapacity grounds. The Minister made some reference to that matter in
replying to a previous debate, but a number of issues could usefully be
clarified.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column396" />Column number: 397</div><a name="06110114000488"></a><div class="hs_Para">There has been some confusion
about the plansto move existing IB and existing income support
recipients once employment and support allowance is introduced. The
Green Paper indicated that the ESA regime would apply only to new
claimants, although the response to the consultation stated that
existing claimants would be migrated across to ESA in time. That has
been the approach that the Minister has taken in his comments to the
Committee.</div><a name="06110114000489"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment proposes to leave out paragraph 6 of schedule 4 to probe the
Government&#146;s intentions. That provides for regulations to
include the migration of existing recipients on to the ESA regime.
According to paragraph 307 of the explanatory notes, migration can be
voluntary or mandatory. In Committee, the Minister stated
that</div><a name="06110114000628"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;those who are most
recent to the benefit should be those most likely to have the
opportunity to get back to
work&#148;</div><a name="06110114000490"></a><div class="hs_Para">and that the
Government have</div><a name="06110114000629"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;looked
for ways in which to migrate the newest ... claimants on to the
new ESA.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I"> Official Report, Standing Committee
A,</i>17 October 2006; c.
42.]</div><a name="06110114000491"></a><div class="hs_Para">Can the Minister clarify
whether that refers to the approach that has been taken in the existing
pathways, where existing claimants are gradually invited to attend
pre-mandatory work-focused interviews? Is that what is meant by
mandatory migration, where the choice between mandatory and voluntary
is spelled out?</div>
<a name="06110114000492"></a><div class="hs_Para">The change in
regime from either incapacity benefit or income support on grounds of
incapacity to employment and support allowance will obviously impact on
claimants in a number of different areas: the income they receive,
work-related conditions, the access to employment opportunities to
which they are subject to and the means by which their continuing
entitlement to benefit is assessed and reassessed. There are some
points in each of those areas on which I would welcome some
clarification from the Minister.</div>
<a name="06110114000493"></a><div class="hs_Para">On incomes, the
Government&#146;s response to the consultation on the Green Paper
stated that</div><a name="06110114000630"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;existing
claimants&#146; benefit levels will be
protected.&#148;</div><a name="06110114000494"></a><div class="hs_Para">Does that
refer to when an existing claimant is migrated to ESA? We have not
discussed rates in this Committee, for obvious reasons. It has been
made clear repeatedly that ESA is likely to be higher than the current
long-term rate of incapacity benefit. The Minister might wish to
confirm that in his remarks. I do not wish to probe him on how much he
expects it to be, because at this stage it is hard to know. A single
person over the age of 25 on income support with a disability premium
could receive a total of &#163;81.95 a week at the moment. Would the
income level of someone receiving more now than they would under
ESA&#151;if he can imagine any such cases&#151;be
protected?</div><a name="06110114000495"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will not
go into detail about work-related conditions and employment, but there
is clearly an issue about people who have been on incapacity benefit
for a long period. The Minister referred to the fact that he will be
looking to migrate not just new claimants but people with dependent
children in the early phase of migration, for the purpose of tackling
child poverty&#151;at least I think that that is his intention. That
could well include people who have been on incapacity benefit for a
considerable period and who have particular issues for personal
advisers to deal with. It is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column397" />Column number: 398</div>important to make it clear that in cases where people who have been on
benefit for a very long time are among those being migrated in the
early phase, advisers will have support to work with those people, not
least those with severe and enduring mental health problems. Will the
Minister clarify
that?</div><a name="06110114000496"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Green Paper
and the Government&#146;s response to the Select Committee report
anticipated a more systematic review of existing claimants through the
establishment of a unit to undertake periodic reviews and ad hoc case
checks, which might be followed by personal capability assessments
where there is doubt about someone&#146;s incapacity for work. Page
48 of the Green Paper said that it was intended to target a minority of
claimants who might seek to prolong their time on a protected level of
incapacity benefit. Will the Minister enlighten the Committee as to
what progress has been made in setting up that process, and what the
plans are for random checks and so
forth?</div><a name="06110114000497"></a><div class="hs_Para">To follow
through on how a reassessment might take place for someone who has been
migrated to the new benefits, can the Minister clarify whether existing
claimants will be subject to revised personal capability assessments
when their cases come up for review? If someone is currently on
benefits and is migrated to the new benefits, will they have to go
through the revised PCA when their case comes up for review? Obviously,
they got benefits in the first place through the existing PCA with all
its inadequacies, which we debated at some length. I should be grateful
if he clarified some of those issues in his
response.</div><a name="06110114000498"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000824"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> I will keep my questions brief. As the hon.
Gentleman said, the explanatory notes refer to regulations that could
provide for either voluntary or mandatory migration. It would be
extremely useful and important to understand what would influence
Ministers to take the voluntary route as against the mandatory route. I
know that there are two options, but it would be useful to understand
why they are
there.</div><a name="06110114000650"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.30
pm</div><a name="06110114000499"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second
question relates to the financial terms on which the migration, whether
voluntary or mandatory, will take place. For someone who was, before
the commencement of this Act, on good old-fashioned incapacity benefit,
it seems logically to be the case that, on migrating to ESA, they will
go on to the new higher rates. There is a question attached to
that.</div><a name="06110114000500"></a><div class="hs_Para">When the
migration takes place, existing claims on IB migrate on to ESA at the
higher rates. Does it not follow that an IB claimant who, for the sake
of argument, passed a PCA at the beginning of 2008&#151;weeks before
the commencement of the Bill&#151;and then migrated on to ESA would
in the act of migration have to have an assessment under clauses 8 and
9? If they were in the work-related activity component, would they have
to take the test in clause 10? It seems that the regime would have to
be repeated for the IB claimant who passed the PCA a matter of weeks
before the commencement of the Bill. Otherwise, there would be no way
in which the higher component for support or work-related activity
could possibly be awarded, unless the migrating IB claimant had gone
through the full panoply of the new ESA
regime.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column398" />Column number: 399</div><a name="06110114000501"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000825"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> The hon. Gentleman has illuminated one of the
points that I was trying to make. Has he also considered the fact that
in the situation he is describing, the roll out of pathways to work
will have taken place, so those people will have an ability to take
part in support to pathways to work while not being subjected to the
conditionality regime that someone assessed a few weeks later would be
subjected to? There is a question of balance and fairness in relation
to how those two quite similarly situated payments will be
treated.</div><a name="06110114000502"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000826"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes a good point, and in the
interests of expeditious debating I will sit down and await with keen
interest the Minister&#146;s response to my questions and those of
the hon. Gentleman.</div>
<a name="06110114000503"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000827"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> We are making fantastic progress, which I do not
wish to delay, so I will respond to the specific points raised, rather
than read out another well-crafted speech. I am glad that my hon.
Friend the Member for Ochil and South Perthshire has had the
opportunity to have a profile in the Committee&#151;he volunteered
and is here because this is something he is committed to and interested
in. He would normally fulfil his role for the Minister for Pensions
Reform, rather than in relation to employment and welfare reform, so it
is important to note that he is here due to his continuing commitment
to the issues we are discussing. Unfortunately, we will not have the
opportunity to hear his comments because of parliamentary
protocol.</div><a name="06110114000504"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our
intention, as we introduce ESA from 2008 onwards based on the national
pathways, is that as we migrate the mix of volunteerism and mandatory
migration&#151;I will say a few words about that in a
moment&#151;we will have a benefit architecture that is relatively
straightforward and that, over time, will bring together some of the
entitlements and some of the conditionality. However, that would be
with the important distinctions that we have already mentioned on
current customers of IB not having to undertake work-related activity
as a condition of receipt of benefit.</div>
<a name="06110114000505"></a><div class="hs_Para">In time, we would like to see
new customers coming into the ESA, and existing IB customers in time
also being on the ESA. That is our intention as an end point in terms
of the simplification of the inactive benefits regime. In terms of how
we get there, it is our intention that for someone who migrates on to
ESA under mandatory migration in the future, the extent
oftheir personal capability assessment, which I think the hon.
Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey alluded to, will
fall under clause 9. At that point of migration, would not be a full
PCA.</div><a name="06110114000506"></a><div class="hs_Para">The next PCA that
an existing customer of IB moving across at the point of mandatory
migration would receive would be the next scheduled PCA. There would
not be a PCA gateway on entitlement to ESA per se. As I am sure hon.
Members would accept, there would, quite rightly, be a PCA gateway
based on the clause 9 aspect to ascertain whether that existing IB
customer&#151;who may be in an exempt or non-exempt
category&#151;should be in the support group or the work-related
activity group. Clause 9 deals with the aspect that would determine
that. I hope that that answers a number of questions.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column399" />Column number: 400</div><a name="06110114000507"></a><div class="hs_Para">On volunteering, the Bill allows
migration on to the ESA benefit structure, but as we roll out pathways
nationwide between now and 2008, it is our intention to enable current
IB customers to volunteer for the pathways-style support, with the six
work-focused interviews. To enable that volunteering and the mandatory
migration at a later point, we shall build on the best experience of
the current roll-out of pathways and the various pilots that we have
spoken about in some
detail.</div><a name="06110114000508"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of the
best examples is perhaps the pilot in Somerset, which has not only
started with recent IB, but gone right through the current case load.
We shall learn from that. Our instinct is to enable the mandatory
migration through time, based on what we think we know already, which
is that the most recent and freshest claims are by the folk who are
most likely to be supported to get back into work, the additional point
being about the impact of child poverty and, therefore, migrating folk
with dependent
kids.</div><a name="06110114000509"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, we will
learn from the experience of the pilot in Somerset&#151;predominantly
there, but not exclusively so&#151;about what has been the most
successful way of supporting a significant number of customers to come
off IB and go into work and economic activity. My point is that we are
not dogmatic, and over time there might be a play-off between child
poverty and length of time on benefit. Our approach is to go with what
works.</div>
<a name="06110114000510"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000828"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> That approach is sensible. Does the Minister
envisage a time when all existing claimants will have been migrated or
does he think that there will be some categories of existing claimant
for whom a migration will never be
appropriate?</div><a name="06110114000511"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000829"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> In time&#151;I am not going to say which time,
and the hon. Gentleman would not reasonably ask me to&#151;we would
expect all customers to be migrated on to ESA, with the distinction
that existing IB customers would not have to undertake the work-related
activity, but would undertake the work-focused interviews. Through
time, as the process evolves to enable those who wish to volunteer for
the support that is available to do so, we would expect to have
migrated all those who have not volunteered to the new ESA
regime&#151;a terrible phrase&#151;with the important caveat of
protecting benefit levels at the point of
transfer.</div>
<a name="06110114000512"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000830"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> On that point, can the Minister be a bit clearer
about guaranteeing the benefits at the point of transfer? What will
that mean for an IB recipient who migrates on to
ESA?</div><a name="06110114000513"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000831"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> The hon. Member for Daventry is not with us, but,
to put it into saloon bar talk, the blunt answer is that the cash that
they have in their pocket, with whatever additions they currently
receive, will be protected at the point of transfer to ESA. The amount
that they have in cash terms will be
protected.</div><a name="06110114000514"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000832"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I am grateful for that response and, although I
do not wish to take any more of the Committee&#146;s time than is
absolutely necessary, I would 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column400" />Column number: 401</div>like to clarify a couple of points one more time. One relates to the
point in the Green Paper on establishing random ad hoc checks and the
idea of setting up a unit to undertake them, with a view to targeting
the, as the Green Paper put
it,</div><a name="06110114000631"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;minority of
claimants who...will seek to prolong unnecessarily their time on
the protected level of incapacity
benefits.&#148;</div><a name="06110114000515"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
other point relates to the PCA and how it will be applied. I take on
board what the Minister said about people not being obliged to go
immediately through a full PCA under clauses 8 and 9&#151;he
clarified the fact that they will have the clause 9 assessment.
However, I am thinking about the case of somebody who may previously
have been on incapacity benefit as a result of the old PCA and who has
been migrated from the existing benefit to the new. At some later
stage, they are likely to be called back for a full PCA under the new
regime, as described in clauses 8 and 9, and potentially in clause
10.</div><a name="06110114000516"></a><div class="hs_Para">That person might
then discover that they are no longer entitled to ESA because of the
revised scoring system, or for another reason. Will such people still
have access to the specialist advisers and sources of support that are
available under the pathways programme, which they may need by virtue
of their condition and from which they may previously have benefited
while on ESA?</div><a name="06110114000517"></a><div class="hs_Para">That may
be a difficult question to answer straight away, but it is important
that people in that unusual category should continue to benefit from
their existing support, rather than being left to the harsher
climate&#151;without intending that term to be taken
pejoratively&#151;that is applied to claimants for jobseeker&#146;s
allowance.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000833"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> I shall be brief, because we can
continue the conversation on some of the specifics if we are given the
opportunity to do so between now and 2008. The hon. Gentleman is right
that we have said that we shall carry out, on a risk-based approach,
some assessment of continuing entitlement to benefit. That ties in with
the comments made on disqualification by the Under-Secretary of State
for Work and Pensions, my hon. Friend the Member for Stirling
(Mrs.
McGuire).</div><a name="06110114000519"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
the hon. Gentleman accepts that, as part of that random approach, we
also want to ensure that customers are given the support that the Bill
will put in place, which we have considered in our proceedings in the
last few days. It is a matter of continuing entitlement to benefit, but
also of ensuring that customers get the support that we as Parliament
wish them to get. That is an important
double-check.</div><a name="06110114000520"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman would not expect me to speculate on each and every
circumstance. We have all welcomed the new PCA, which will take greater
account of mental health, illness, learning disabilities and other
conditions, based on the 46 descriptors and the 15 points. We shall
consider the most appropriate level of support&#151;not at point of
transfer, but under the new PCA&#151;when that is due, and at the
point that he identified. It is a conversation to be
continued.</div><a name="06110114000521"></a>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column402" />Column number: 403</div><a name="06110114000529"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
new clause is probing. I wish to ask the Minister to reassure the
Committee that when claimants are going through interviews and
assessment conducted under part 1, they are notified of the purpose or
purposes of the interview or assessment. The assessments will obviously
be important, as they will determine the level of benefit and the level
of conditionality attached to it. It is important that those who have
learning disabilities, or a wide range of other disabilities,
understand the purpose of those interviews or assessments.</div>
<a name="06110114000530"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also ask the Minister to
assure the Committee that those conducting the interviews or
assessments are properly qualified. We have discussed that at length
and we do not need to revert to it. Indeed, the Minister has already
given some reassurance on that point. Likewise, he assured us in
earlier debates that, as in paragraph (c), account should be taken
of</div> <a name="06110114000632"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the circumstance in

conversations on clauses 8 and 10. I confirm, for the
Committee&#146;s delight, that the provisions of paragraph (a) are
contained in page 6 of the draft regulations, which deals with
safeguards before sanctions are imposed. The question of advising the
customer at the point of claiming about the interview process is bullet
point No. 1 on page 6 of the draft regulations. I hope that I have
provided the reassurance that the hon. Gentleman seeks.</div>
<a name="06110114000533"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
possible, customers are contacted by telephone to explain the purpose
of the interview or assessment, what to expect and what to do if they
have a problem attending. We also write to all our customers, whether
or not they have been contacted by phone. We intend to continue with
that process under the ESA.</div>
<a name="06110114000534"></a><div class="hs_Para">The point that the hon.
Gentleman raises with paragraph (b) was the subject of a previous
conversation; as we heard earlier today, it is found within the
contracts. As for paragraph (c), page 26 of the draft regulations deals
with claimants failing to attend or complete an interview or

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000862"></a>Mr.
Hunt:</b> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second
time.</div><a name="06110114000573"></a><div class="hs_Para">I appreciate
that we are getting to the end of a long day and hope that I might be
able to persuade Ministers to consider the new clause. Let me explain
it briefly: it asks the Secretary of State to set up a pilot whereby
people in the support group should not be subject to the restrictions
that currently exist on permitted hours. The thinking is that people in
the support group will have been objectively assessed as having the
most severe disabilities according to the 46 descriptors that the
Minister has explained to us. Many of them are unlikely ever to be off
the support element for the length of their lives. Therefore, for those
people, breaking down any barriers that could prevent them from taking
steps towards the world of work not only would be beneficial, but might
not, I suggest to the Committee, cost the taxpayer any money at all.
Because of the nature of the disabilities that those people have they
are unlikely to move out of the support group. It may happen, but for
many it is
unlikely.</div><a name="06110114000574"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the
Minister consider the fact that for people in the support group,
particularly those subject to the lower &#163;20 earnings disregard
limit, it is unlikely that they will be able to move from just three
and a half hours work at the minimum wage to full-time employment, but
they may be able to manage part-time employment. If they are concerned
about losing their benefits package, which is vital for the
independence it gives them, they are unlikely to want to make that
transition.</div><a name="06110114000575"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have
tabled the new clause providing for a pilot because I recognise that we
are in uncharted territory and that it is possible that there could be
public spending commitments because we are talking about relaxing the
permitted hours for a significant number of people. It depends slightly
on what proportion of people are actually put in the support
group.</div><a name="06110114000576"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000863"></a>Adam
Afriyie:</b> I suspect that my hon. Friend was coming to this
point, but it might also mean a spending reduction for the DWP if a
certain proportion transfer and take up part-time or full-time work. So
this could actually be a net benefit to the Exchequer rather than a net
deficit.</div><a name="06110114000577"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000864"></a>Mr.
Hunt:</b> I am grateful to my hon. Friend because that is my
belief. As I have argued on earlier clauses, relaxing the earnings
disregard is likely to encourage more people to move closer to the
world of work and therefore reduce the number of people on the
benefit.</div><a name="06110114000578"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is
uncharted territory, which is why we have phrased the new clause as a
pilot. We might learn things about relaxing the permitted hours with
the support group which it might be possible to apply at a later stage
to the work-related activity group. We will not learn any of those
things unless we have a pilot. I ask the Minister to give careful
consideration to having this pilot.</div>
<a name="06110114000579"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have received many
representations, as I am sure all members of the Committee have, from
disability organisations who are concerned that people in the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column405" />Column number: 406</div>support group might not have the same opportunities as those in the
work-related activity group. We have discussed that endlessly and I do
not want to return to those debates, but having a pilot that showed a
bit of flexibility over the permitted hours for people in the support
group might teach everyone a little bit about how human motivation
works in these situations. If it helped people in the support
group&#151;who are, by definition, the most disadvantaged in
society&#151;to move closer to the world of work, and to develop a
degree of independence and self respect it would be
admirable.I hope that the Government will give it generous
consideration.</div><a name="06110114000580"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000865"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> Remarkable progress is being made. I shall
respond, hopefully in a similar tone to that of the hon. Gentleman when
he raised his genuine point. As he knows, there is a greater propensity
and likelihood of continued poverty among those who are assessed to be
in the support group. That is the major reason why we anticipate having
two tiers of benefit payment on the basis that it would provide a
degree of financial support to those in the support group that
otherwise would be missing.</div>
<a name="06110114000581"></a><div class="hs_Para">Customers in receipt of
incapacity benefit can undertake part-time work up to a maximum
of16 hours a week and earnings must not exceed &#163;86 a
week. We intend to carry forward similar permitted work provisions for
the employment and support allowance. I recognise that there may be
people in the support group who are able to work in excess of the
16-hour limit. The fact that someone on the support group is able to
work is not of itself a reason why he or she should be removed from the
support group. A PCA would assess whether someone should still be in
the support group. It is important to get that across when we try to
encourage those in the support group who wish to work to have the
chance to do so.</div><a name="06110114000582"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
16-hour limit is there for two reasons. First, it is there to make a
distinction between allowing part-time work while on benefit as a
stepping stone to independence and to top up earnings. Secondly, 16
hours is the recognised boundary between the out-of-work benefits
system and the in-work tax credits system. We do not need the power in
the Bill to do what the hon. Gentleman wishes to do. We have the powers
to be flexible in this sort of area already. We are looking at ways to
continue to be flexible and to improve the permitted work
rules.</div><a name="06110114000583"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000866"></a>Mr.
Hunt:</b> The Minister mentioned &#163;86 as being the upper
earnings limit for people on IB. Will he confirm that that will be case
for people on ESA, even if they are coming on to ESA on an
income-related basis? Currently those people have an earnings disregard
of just &#163;20, which is significantly
less.</div><a name="06110114000584"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000867"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> On the contributory level it
will be &#163;86. I cannot confirm that in terms of the
income-related scheme. The hon. Gentleman put his specific question
pretty fairly: the phrase he used was &#147;careful
consideration&#148;. I can assure him that we continue to look at the
most effective way of enabling improvements and flexibilities in
permitted work. We will look at the very carefully indeed in advance of
2008 and the national roll-outof

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000869"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> No. I am going to
conclude.</div><a name="06110114000587"></a><div class="hs_Para">In terms of
the specific point, we will give careful consideration to the matters
that the hon. Member for South-West Surrey raised. I hope that he
accepts that we do not need in the Bill the type of power that he seeks
to give us to do the type of thing that he wishes. We already have that
power to implement the flexibility. We will look at additional schemes
for permitted work that may reassure him and others in
future.</div><a name="06110114000588"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000870"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000871"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I beg to move amendmentNo. 257, in
clause 27, page 19, line 15, at
end insert</div> <a name="06110114000885"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#145;and those
categories of tenants to whom it
applies&#146;.</div><a name="06110114000591"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
proposing the amendment I feel a little like the minister in my
constituency whose sermon was eaten by his dog. When he arrived in the
pulpit he said, &#147;I am going to speak to you as the Lord directs,
but I shall try to do better next week.&#148; The purpose of the
amendment is fairly clear. There has been some controversy surrounding
the local housing allowance and we will no doubt go into that in more
detail in our next sitting. In respect of the amendment there has also
been some controversy about the categories of tenants. I notice that
the Minister&#146;s supporting cast has left the room, so perhaps now
is a good time to get some concessions out of him.</div>
<a name="06110114000592"></a><div class="hs_Para">The question to which I want an
answer from the Minister is which categories the local housing
allowance will apply to. Clearly, the Government&#146;s intention is
to look at housing allowance for tenants in the private sector only;
tenants in social housing whether it is provided by registered social
landlords, housing associations or local authorities, and, if I
remember correctly, those in pre-1989 tenancies, would also be exempt
from the local housing allowance. However, that is not stated anywhere
in the Bill and as far as I can see from how the Bill is constructed it
does not allow that to be made clear in regulations, although the
Minister will correct me if I am
wrong.</div><a name="06110114000593"></a><div class="hs_Para">Concern has
been expressed about the possibility of rolling out local housing
allowance to the categories of tenancy that I have outlined&#151;it
is not an exhaustive list, but the Minister knows what I mean. There
has also been a lot of concern to roll out the local housing allowance
to the social housing sector without further primary legislation. I
know that Ministers have decided that that is not what they want to do
and it would be worrying to the landlords. I hope that the Minister can
clarify that the provisions of the Bill will apply only to tenants in
receipt of housing benefit in private sector tenancies and not to any
other categories. Should any 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column407" />Column number: 408</div>proposals be made either to extend it to social housing or more
generally by virtue of a pilot, that would be subject to further
primary legislation and could not be achieved simply by regulation
under this Bill.</div>
<a name="06110114000594"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000872"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> I congratulate the hon. Member for Inverness,
Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey on something that appeared to be off the
cuff. I am not being patronising; I thought that he made a good job of
a proposal that we did not expect to reach this
evening.</div><a name="06110114000595"></a><div class="hs_Para">I reassure
the hon. Gentleman that as set out in the draft regulations we do not
propose to apply the local housing allowance approach to tenants
currently excluded from it in the pathfinders including those in the
social sector. For a customer to be entitled to housing benefit there
must be an appropriate maximum housing benefit in his case. That is the
basic condition of entitlement. As members of the Committee are aware,
proposals for housing benefit were set out in the welfare reform Green
Paper. Although our plans for rolling out local housing allowance to
the private rented sector met with strong support across the sectors,
many of those who responded to our Green Paper raised concerns, which
the hon. Gentleman expressed tonight, about the introduction of a local
housing allowance into the social sector. We have listened carefully to
those concerns, and we stated in our response that we will not proceed
with local housing allowance in that
sector.</div><a name="06110114000596"></a><div class="hs_Para">Draft
regulation 13C, which has been circulated to the Committee, sets out
the circumstances in which a local authority must calculate an
appropriate maximum housing benefit using the LHA rules. It lists all
the categories of customer to whom the local housing allowance is not
to apply where circumstances in regulation 13C arise. For example,
local housing allowance will not apply where a landlord is a registered
social landlord, local authority or registered charity, where the rent
is payable&#151;I admire the hon. Gentleman&#146;s memory&#151;in
respect of a pre-1989 tenancy agreement and includes a site charge or
mooring charge for a mobile home, caravan or houseboat, or where rent
under the tenancy is attributable to board and
attendance.</div><a name="06110114000597"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope
that I have given the hon. Gentleman the reassurance that he sought. I
am delighted to offer reassurance to those who responded to the Green
Paper consultation to raise concerns, and I ask him to consider
withdrawing his amendment.</div>
<a name="06110114000598"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110114000873"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for that
response. It has indeed offered me the reassurance that I was looking
for. I should have made it clear in my opening remarks that it is quite
right to say that local housing allowance has proved successful in many
ways in the pilots. I will have a chance to flesh that out more during
the clause stand part debate, but as she has put her response on the
record, and so that we can go home tonight, I beg to ask leave to
withdraw the amendment.
