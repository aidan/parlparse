<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that there is a financial resolution in connection with the Bill. Copies are available in the Room.
<P>
I also remind hon. Members that adequate notice should be given of amendments. As a general rule, my co-Chairman and I do not intend to call starred amendments, including any that may be reached during an afternoon sitting.
<P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Richard Allan </B>(Sheffield, Hallam): I beg to move amendment No. 1, in page 1, line 10, leave out `refusing'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take the following amendments:
<P>
No. 2, in page 1, line 14, leave out `or refused'.
<P>
No. 3, in page 1, line 17, leave out `refused'.
<P>
No. 4, in page 2, line 19, leave out `or refuse'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I am glad to begin the detailed consideration of the Bill with these amendments, which relate to the provision to allow entry clearance officers overseas to deal more substantively with applications from people to come to this country and to give entry clearance at that point instead of relying on the immigration officer at the port of entry. We support the additional clarity that that would give to travellers who are granted leave to enter the country at the point of application for their visa, but we are worried about the possible implications of a refusal at that point and wish to explore that matter with the Government. This is in keeping with our stated aim to try to assist the Government to pass legislation that accords with the international conventions to which this country is a signatory.
<P>
Our particular concern is that we risk breaching article 31(2) of the 1951 refugee convention, which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Contracting States shall not apply to the movement of such refugees restrictions other than those which are necessary and such restrictions shall only be applied until their status in the country is regularised or they obtain admission to another country''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We may impose an unnecessary restriction that prevents those suffering genuine oppression or fear of oppression abroad from coming to this country. We could not support such a policy.
<P>
To clarify the matter we wish to delete the phrases that refer to refusal. This is a substantive issue, because it will frequently be difficult precisely for those who fear oppression to gain the necessary clearance abroad. They will often be frightened to approach foreign embassies or to be seen trying to obtain a visa, and even when they manage to approach an entry clearance officer and make an application, they will often have difficulty in producing the necessary documentation to obtain a valid travel document.
<P>
We wish to see the procedure streamlined in such a way that entry clearance and leave to enter can be processed appropriately for not only ordinary travellers, as I think that the Government intend, but exceptional travellers&#151;and in this case refugees&#151;so that, even if they cannot obtain the formal documentation because of their oppressed status they can reach this country and present themselves to an immigration officer here who will decide on their status. Our concern is that the entry clearance officer's refusal of leave to enter would be taken as a complete block on a person's travel.
<P>
We are still at an early stage, but we shall return again and again to this theme. We are creating a framework within which Ministers can make more detailed orders, so we are not dealing with the substance of what they will tell entry clearance officers. However, I hope that the Minister will be able to tell the Committee that the Government do not intend to break the spirit of article 31(2) of the 1951 convention and that, through whatever orders are made, those who genuinely fear oppression in their home country will still be able to make the journey to the United Kingdom, if they believe that appropriate, to claim their right under that convention. I hope that the Minister will be able to reassure the Committee. I regret that the Bill is again imprecise and that the decision will be made later, when the Minister or his successor presents the relevant orders to effect the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. James Clappison (Hertsmere):</B> I have no problem with granting entry clearance officers&#151;or whoever is permitted to determine whether someone should have leave to enter&#151;the ability to refuse entry. However, the Minister should give a careful and considered response to the point that the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Allan) made about the provision's compatibility with our obligations under the 1951 convention and the European convention on human rights. We shall return to that point time and again in our deliberations. When the question of compatibility arises, I hope that the Minister will provide a careful explanation. I look to him now for a justification.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department </B>(Mr. Mike O'Brien): The flexibility provisions have no practical impact on the operation of our posts abroad. The Bill imposes no extra restrictions on those in posts abroad. Therefore, after the Bill is enacted, those people will continue to make the decisions that they make today. The procedures for applying for a visa for the United Kingdom and the criteria that applicants have to fulfil will not be changed. Therefore, there are no new implications for the ECHR or the 1951 convention.
<P>
Clause 1 allows us to operate immigration control more flexibly by ensuring that we are not tied to the current cumbersome methods of granting and refusing leave to enter.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 1 to 4, which were tabled by the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam, would have strange practical effects. Amendment No. 1 would allow the Secretary of State to present an order to set out new and various ways of granting leave to enter. However, it would not allow him to provide for new, additional ways of refusing leave to enter.
<P>
Amendment No. 2 would allow the Secretary of State to grant but not to refuse leave to enter before the applicant arrived in the United Kingdom. Therefore, people would have to come to the United Kingdom to be refused entry.
<P>
Amendment No. 3 would limit the Secretary of State's powers. He would be allowed to specify the form and manner of granting and varying leave, but not of refusing it. Thus, leave would have to be refused through a written notice, as happens at present. Such a provision will not work, and is nonsensical. If we provide for new methods of granting leave to enter, we need a parallel provision for refusing leave to enter. Otherwise, we shall be tied to an outdated immigration system that cannot take full advantage of new developments in technology and new ways of working.
<P>
Amendment No. 4 is different. As I have already explained, under section 4(1) of the Immigration Act 1971, the power to grant or refuse leave to enter the United Kingdom rests solely with an immigration officer, but the power to grant or refuse leave to remain rests with the Secretary of State. Subsection (7) of the Bill changes that, so that the Secretary of State can also grant or refuse leave to enter. The change is intended to streamline current procedures and lead to more efficient decision making. The provision will not apply to those who are already in the United Kingdom. It is intended that those powers will be used principally in cases in which the asylum decision must be taken by a caseworker in Croydon.
<P>
At the moment, bureaucratic work is being duplicated as a result of inefficient provisions in the legislation. It is far easier and more straightforward for the official who makes the decision to grant asylum to issue the documents that permit that to happen, rather than oblige another official, who happens to be an immigration officer, to issue such a stamp.
<P>
Amendment No. 4 would give the Secretary of State power to grant leave to enter the United Kingdom, but not to refuse such leave. That would mean that a caseworker in Croydon could undertake the consideration, decision and the granting of leave to enter, but that the power to refuse leave to enter would rest solely with an immigration officer at the port of entry. In practice, that would mean that the file would have to be sent to the port so that an immigration officer could refuse leave to enter. Such a process would create a bureaucratic burden and would tie up immigration officers in bureaucratic, nugatory work. Such work could be undertaken efficiently from a central point.
<P>
The hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam spoke about restricting refugees' access. He implied that any controls would restrict refugees' access because controlling access through immigration controls means controlling immigration and those who may come in.
<P>
There will always be some controls on refugees. I assume that the hon. Gentleman is not arguing that we should remove all controls, but is probing whether the measure will apply new restrictions on refugees' ability to enter that were not there before. The answer is no; we are not proposing new restrictions. He rightly says that ordinary travellers should travel more freely and effectively. We seek to remove unnecessary bureaucratic delays, including the need for people to be interviewed at the entry clearance point and the point of entry to the United Kingdom. Having two interviews when one would be adequate does not seem to be worthwhile.

<P>

<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I just want to clarify something. Individuals making a legitimate claim for asylum in this country sometimes make their way here without visas and are, in some ways, illegal entrants. However, they are treated properly by the system. Will the Minister confirm that those people will be no worse off in future if they apply for entry clearance and have leave to enter refused at the foreign post?
<P>
At the moment, such people may be refused entry clearance, but they can still make their way here and be treated by immigration officers as having arrived without visas. Will they be no worse off if they have entry clearance and if leave to enter is refused in the foreign post?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> There will be no difference. Should people manage to get a visa in the foreign post, they will be able to come here and claim asylum in the normal way. Should they be refused a visa and make their way here, they will be subject to normal immigration controls.
<P>
Essentially, we are simplifying procedures. It is difficult to see implications that create new barriers for people seeking to claim asylum.
<P>
The hon. Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison) asked about the provisions in relation to the ECHR and the 1951 convention. The situation is entirely the same as it is now; there are no new implications that we have to explain anything in addition to that which we havealready explained.
<P>
An official has told me that the provision would be used only for those already in the United Kingdom. However, I said that it would not be used for those in the United Kingdom. In fact, the measure will be used only for those already in the United Kingdom.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> That is leave to remain?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Yes. That is my final point on amendment No. 4.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I was seeking mainly to probe the issue, and the Minister has made a categorical statement that, after the enactment of the clause, the position will be no worse that at present. We may want to look further into the issue but, to expedite the Committee, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 69, in page 1, line 20, at end add
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`provided that leave to enter may be withdrawn or varied by an immigration officer at a port of entry when the person concerned arrives in the United Kingdom.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take amendment No. 72, in page 2, leave out lines 18 to 20.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> We now come to a different aspect of the provisions. In response to the previous amendments, the Minister said that the Government are putting no further obstacles in the way of asylum applicants who want to live here. The amendments would establish whether the effect would be to weaken the defences against certain individuals whom we may not wish to enter the country. That matter must be carefully examined. The amendments reflect our concern not take any steps that run the risk of weakening our system of on-entry controls&#151;an important part of our immigration system&#151;on individuals entering the United Kingdom.
<P>
The clause will give the Secretary of State powers to enable him to make wide-ranging changes to entry control through leave to enter. The hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam was right that we may have the framework or kernel of the provisions, but we do not know exactly how the Government are going to build that framework. We thus need to ask several questions.
<P>
The Secretary of State will be able to grant leave to enter before arrival in the United Kingdom&#151;before an individual arrives at on-entry control. Subsection (3) allows an entry visa or other form of entry clearance granted by an entry clearance officer at an overseas post to be treated as leave to enter the United Kingdom. In the White Paper, the Government said that their intention was
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``to exploit the opportunities of up to date information technology so that the processing of entry clearance applications, and dealing with the applicant at the ports and after entry, can be done as swiftly as possible''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Without quoting the Minister precisely, he echoed those sentiments in his response to the previous amendments. We all want technology to speed things up, but not at the expense of proper control. We need further examination of the provisions to establish whether there is more to them&#151;especially in their effects&#151;than simply streamlining the system to make everything go faster.
<P>
As a starting point, it is important to examine our current system of on-entry controls. Presently, on arrival at a United Kingdom port of entry, persons who are subject to immigration control must be examined by an immigration officer to establish whether they satisfy the requirements of the immigration rules for granting leave to enter in a particular category&#151;including the possibility that none of the general grounds for refusal apply to them. That is the general nature of our on-entry immigration controls.
<P>
Under clause 1, the Secretary of State is taking a power to enable the process of granting leave to enter to be carried out before arrival at the United Kingdom and by others apart from immigration officers. We must clarify both the role of on-entry control in this new dispensation and the powers to be exercised by immigration officers within the framework. That is the purpose of the amendment.
<P>
Paragraph 38 of schedule 12 is relevant. It will insert a new paragraph 2A after schedule 2 of the Immigration Act 1971 that states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> (1) This paragraph applies to a person who has arrived in the United Kingdom with leave to enter which is in force but which was given to him before his arrival.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> (2) He may be examined by an immigration officer for the purpose of establishing&#151;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) whether there has been such a change in the circumstances of his case, since that leave was given, that it should be cancelled; or
<P>
(b) whether that leave was obtained as a result of false information given by him or his failure to disclose material facts.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>That suggests that, in future, examination by an immigration officer will take place for much more limited purposes than the examination that currently takes place to examine whether someone comes within the ambit of immigration rules. Paragraph 38 will confine an immigration officer to examining only whether there has been a change in circumstances, or whether the person involved has obtained leave to enter as a result of false information or non-disclosure of material facts.
<P>
I have some questions about how the examination described in paragraph 38 will work in practice. In particular, I want to know how it will be possible to determine whether leave to enter was obtained as a result of someone giving false information or failing to disclose material facts. We must bear in mind that such leave to enter may have been obtained before a person's arrival in the United Kingdom. It may have been granted at a United Kingdom post overseas or because the Secretary of State has chosen to use his powers to grant leave to enter in other ways, such as through the provision for entry clearance in clause 1(3)(b).
<P>
When leave to enter has been granted on the basis of certain facts that have been given to an entry clearance officer at a post overseas, how will the immigration officer at the on-entry control in the United Kingdom know what information was given or what facts were or were not disclosed to the person who granted leave to enter? When someone arrives in the United Kingdom, how will the immigration officer know what that person said to obtain leave to enter? We need to know how the provision will work in practice.
<P>
We also need to know what will happen in cases in which there has been no change in circumstances and when an immigration officer has been unable to establish that false information has been given or that material facts have not been disclosed, but when the officer is not satisfied that leave to enter should be, or should have been, granted. The Minister is pulling a face, so I shall explain a little further. For example, a person may be granted leave to enter, and the immigration officer may be unable to establish whether there has been any change in circumstances or whether that person provided false information or failed to disclose material facts to an entry clearance officer. However, if the immigration officer is unhappy about whether that person comes within the ambit of immigration rules, will he still have the power to refuse that person entry?
<P>
We want to know how far an immigration officer's powers extend under the new dispensation. Therefore, we need to know what an immigration officer's examination at a port of entry will amount to. I shall come to this point again in a different context, but it is worth noting what the explanatory notes say about leave to enter being given effect through entry clearance or other forms described by the Secretary of State.
<P>
They state:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``This will mean holders will be able to pass through the port control with only a quick check on identity and on the rightful ownership of the travel document and entry clearance.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We need to know more about that.
<P>
In terms of visas and other forms of entry clearance being given effect as leave to enter, the overwhelming majority of those with entry clearance are granted leave to enter and pass uneventfully through on-entry control at present. However, every year, a significant number of people with entry clearance are refused leave to enter. The number of such persons who hold entry clearance, having been granted it overseas, but who are refused leave to enter on arrival in the United Kingdom is on an upward trend. According to a written answer from the Minister on 29 March, it rose from 530 in 1995 to 720 last year. There is no question about their identity, so presumably those persons were the rightful owners of a valid entry clearance; otherwise they would not have been in possession of it. I hope that the Minister can throw more light on the few hundred cases in which someone in possession of valid entry clearance is refused leave to enter on arrival in the United Kingdom. If he cannot do so today, perhaps he will write to me about it, as we should have that information.
<P>
I asked the Immigration Service Union about the matter in our earlier evidence-taking sittings. The Committee should bear in mind the answer given by Mr. Tincey of the Immigration Service Union, which is relevant to the amendment. He said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``A visa was aways seen as a second line of defence. There are certain things that you can ask a person, and certain things that you can do, when he or she applies for a visa, that you cannot do when he or she arrives in the country. However, on the other hand, there are many things that you can do when someone arrives in the country that you cannot do when he or she applies for a visa. Most obviously, you can look in his or her suitcase and see what money he or she has brought. It is common for visa officers to mark notes presented to them. The same five $100 bills appear time after time because a man outside is hiring that money for the purpose of the interview. You cannot do that when you arrive in Britain. You cannot hide the fact that your baggage contains a letter from your brother saying, The job is ready for you. That would all be lost if we simply relied on people on the visa issue.''&#151;[Official Report, Special Standing Committee, 22 March 1999; c.450.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That gives us some idea of the importance of the function of an immigration officer in granting leave to enter. A number of questions must be answered before we are content to permit entry clearance to be treated as leave to enter.
<P>
I also remind the Committee of Mr. Tincey's concern about a proposed three-second target for an immigration officer to deal with an individual under the Government's proposed new system. Has any such target been set and, if so, are the Government happy with it? What does the Minister think an immigration officer will be able to accomplish in three seconds when dealing with a person who presents himself at an on-entry control in the United Kingdom? It would be difficult for an immigration officer to check identity and ownership of documents in three seconds, let alone go into what happened when leave to enter was originally granted, what was said, what facts were disclosed and whether there had been a change in circumstances since then. We need answers to our questions, especially if targets are involved, because they will have a significant bearing on the issue.
<P>
Treating visas or entry clearance&#151;or anything else&#151; as leave to enter before an individual arrives at on-entry controls in the United Kingdom is an important issue. The clause gives a wide power to the Secretary of State, to which I have already adverted in passing, which he could presumably take in cases other than those in which visas or entry clearance could be treated as leave to enter. How might that power be used?
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Do the Government have powers to use any other form of earlier permission or earlier clearance other than those in subsection (3) as leave to enter? In what other circumstances might leave to enter be granted before a person arrives in the United Kingdom other than those which appear at present in the Bill, because the power that the Government are taking goes wider than that?
<P>
We should also bear in mind the evidence of the Immigration Service Union, which sees the powers in a wider context. It said in its submission:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Although introduced under the cover of apparently minor administrative alterations, these clauses involve fundamental legal changes which only make sense as an enabling device to create a European style internal immigration control requiring national identity cards, police check points etc.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The people who are charged with manning our system of entry control consider these to be extremely wide powers. Do the Government have any other plans to treat anything else apart from entry clearance and visas as leave to enter? If they do not, perhaps the Minister could explain why they are seeking to take a power in such wide terms and why they do not simply confine the power to that of treating entry visas or other forms of entry clearance as leave to enter. Why do the Government propose to take such wide powers?
<P>
Could the Minister say a little about subsection (2)(d) and the powers that immigration officers will have in such cases? Will they have the power to vary or withdraw leave? It is important to remember that, at present, leave to enter the United Kingdom lapses if the person concerned leaves the common travel area. The common travel area is made up of the United Kingdom, the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man and the Republic of Ireland. As the explanatory notes remind us, this is an area of passport-free travel: people travelling between the United Kingdom, the islands and the Republic of Ireland do not normally need to produce travel documents. We need to know a little more about that.
<P>
We also want to know if there are any plans to allow that measure to go wider. The explanatory notes tell us that an order under subsection (2)(d) would allow the individual concerned to leave the United Kingdom and then re-enter using his continuing leave to enter without having to obtain fresh leave to enter from the immigration officer.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I hate to interrupt the hon. Gentleman but he is going rather wide of the amendment. He can raise those points when we reach clause stand part.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I appreciate that, but one has to go into some detail to explain the background to the amendment. I was just coming to how that matter relates to the amendment, because it enables an immigration officer to withhold the leave to enter in any case. That is obviously relevant when someone is being treated as having leave to enter and then comes back into the United Kingdom as part of any putative common travel area. If we are giving someone leave to enter which does not lapse and he then goes out of the United Kingdom, we should know whether immigration officers will examine him each time he comes back into the United Kingdom.
<P>
I appreciate your concern, Mr. Maxton. One has to go into some detail because this is a technical matter and one must explain the background to it before one comes to the amendments. In the light of your comments I shall confine myself to questions to the Minister which I hope will clarify the issue. We have been told that leave to enter will not lapse on a person leaving the common travel area, but is that for anywhere outside the common travel area or a particular range of countries? If so, how will that range be defined? That may have been what the Immigration Service Union had in mind when it referred to a European-style system of travel. The Minister must tell us more about the way in which the Government envisage using this power. Will it enable a person to travel to and from the European Union or the European Economic Area without his leave to enter the United Kingdom lapsing, so that, for the duration of his leave to entry, he could travel to, say, Paris or Berlin but not to, say, Lagos, Delhi or anywhere else outside the European economic area?
<P>
Will there be any checks or controls on a person who has leave to enter leaving and entering the United Kingdom, or will there be passport-free travel, as is referred to in the explanatory notes, such as that which exists between the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland within the common travel area? Will an immigration officer have the power to vary or withdraw a person's leave to enter the United Kingdom each time he re-enters the UK? The amendment would provide such a power for an immigration officer in that and other cases.
<P>
Where leave to enter does not lapse when the person leaves the common travel area, will it be granted to persons from certain countries but not others? Will the dispensation be granted on a country-by-country basis? Will there be two types of leave to enter&#151;one that lapses on leaving the common travel area and one that does not? If so, what criteria will be used to decide who gets which? The Government are taking this power to create a leave to enter: we need to know how they will exercise it.
<P>
The purpose of the amendment is to examine the future role of immigration officers and on-entry control when the Secretary of State exercises powers under clause 1. Can the Minister give us clear answers about the extent to which an immigration officer will be able to vary or withdraw leave to enter at port of entry when it has been granted elsewhere? When might leave to enter be granted under clause 1 other than where entry visas or entry clearance are treated as leave to enter? Will leave to enter lapse when a person leaves the common travel area?
<P>
In the light of the Immigration Service Union's evidence to the Committee, can the Minister give us an assurance that the foundations are not being laid for a move to European immigration control, as the union put it to the Committee? Clearly its members are the experts in this matter and have an interest in it, but they are the people who see the changes in immigration policy over time and form a judgment. That suggestion, having been put by the Immigration Service Union, calls for an answer from the Government.
<P>
Amendment No. 72 probes the rather bald content of subsection (7), which I think the Minister adverted to in his reply to the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam earlier. The subsection says that the Secretary of State.
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``may, in such circumstances as may be prescribed in an order made by him, give or refuse leave to enter the United Kingdom.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is important to set the amendment against the background of the explanatory notes, which say:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Under section 4(1) of the 1971 Act the power to grant or refuse leave to enter the United Kingdom can only be exercised by an immigration officer; the power to give or refuse leave to remain''&#151;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
as opposed to leave to enter&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``or to vary an individual's leave to enter or remain can only be exercised by the Secretary of State.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is the current position but, as adverted by the Minister a few moments ago, it is changed by subsection (7), which will enable the Secretary of State to grant or refuse leave to enter as well as leave to remain. The Minister referred to an example in the explanatory memorandum which shows how the Government envisage the new power being exercised by the Secretary of State&#151;through giving immigration department caseworkers the power to grant or refuse leave to enter at the same time as they decide whether to grant or refuse asylum. Presently, the caseworker takes a decision on asylum and an immigration officer has to take a separate decision on granting or refusing leave to enter at a port.
<P>
The Minister acknowledged that the procedure was not as efficient as it could be. However, the Immigration Service Union expressed a different point of view and was so concerned that it wanted this provision left out of the Bill. Let me remind the Committee of what the Immigration Service Union says in its submission and invite the Minister to respond to it:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``An asylum application does not prohibit an application for leave to enter on other grounds. The Immigration Caseworking Directorate will have to provide in its asylum refusal letters an opportunity to make an application on other grounds. At present any additional application by a failed asylum seeker is simply resolved by the immigration officer at the same time as the asylum refusal letter is served in person. A postal asylum refusal which can be returned with a non asylum application will create another opportunity for delay. Every bogus applicant will take advantage and a new backlog of thousands of fresh applications will be created. The proposed changes to legislation are unnecessary. Port asylum applicants can be asked if they wish to apply under any provision of the rules, and that application resolved, on the day of arrival. Any further action is then suspended until the asylum application has been decided. This already applies where an asylum application is made after a person has been refused entry on other grounds``.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I shall break off from quoting the Immigration Service Union there. That is its argument in support of the amendment. The Minister should deal with the possibility that the provision will give rise to another source of delay so that when an immigration officer serves a asylum refusal, it will have to be returned with a non-asylum application. That is especially important because it is the common objective of the whole Committee to avoid any source of unnecessary delay.
<P>
If the power is to be exercised as the Immigration Service Union envisaged, there will be additional delay and the fresh application will have to be considered by the immigration caseworking department. Given the problems that the department has recently experienced and the serious problems that have arisen out of the reorganisation of the offices and working practices at Lunar house, that matter gives rise to concern. The organisation may not have to consider original applications for asylum only. When it sends out refusals to those applications, it will have to send out forms to those involved to see whether they wish to apply for leave to enter. Those applications will be returned in the post to the caseworking department at Lunar house, which will have to consider them as well.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The length of time that it currently takes to determine asylum applications and the growing backlog of work at Lunar house are matters of concern. We hope that the Minister will be able to reassure us that the provisions in the Bill will not be an additional source of delay.
<P>
One scenario is mentioned in the explanatory notes, and the Minister has referred to it. However, the power that the Secretary of State is taking goes much wider. Under the Bill, the power to give or refuse entry will not be confined to caseworkers in the Immigration and Nationality Directorate at Lunar house; the Secretary of State will have wide powers under clause 1(7) to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``give or refuse leave to enter the United Kingdom.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Will the Minister tell us the ways in which he envisages the Secretary of State exercising that power? Who else, other than immigration and asylum caseworkers, does the Minister envisage exercising the power on the Secretary of State's behalf?
<P>
An important change is being made to immigration control through on-entry control. Hitherto, the power to give or refuse entry has been reserved for immigration officers who are trained, experienced and familiar with immigration rules. If the Secretary of State is to take the power to deal with specific cases and to refuse asylum applications, will the Minister consider refining the wording of subsection (7) so that the Secretary of State will have the narrow power to deal with such circumstances rather than the wide power that the measure currently contains?
<P>
The provision in the subsection is very wide. In effect, the Secretary of State is asking the Committee to write him a blank cheque. We need to hear a few more details.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I am concerned by amendment No. 69, which would cancel the new provision for leave to enter to be routinely granted before travel by an entrance clearance. It would reintroduce the requirement for immigration officers to check everyone who arrives on these shores. We welcome the proposed provision for entry clearance officers to grant leave to enter. It is one of the principal purposes of the clause, but amendment No. 69 would reverse it.
<P>
The proposal is a radical constitutional measure in that it will bring together the management processes of two different Departments&#151;the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Home Office, both of which have traditionally dealt with these matters. It will require them to trust each other's judgments in deciding whether someone is fit to enter this country and the conditions under which he should be allowed to do so.
<P>
As a new Member in 1997, I became quickly familiar with the labyrinthine workings of the two Departments. I kept sending my constituents' case notes to the wrong Department, before being told that it was a Home Office or a Foreign and Commonwealth Office matter, depending on which Department I had inadvertently contacted. My experience since then is not that entry clearance officers abroad are lax in handing out visas. On the contrary, a steady queue of people at my surgeries tell me that the officers have been far too strict in deciding whether someone should receive a visa.
<P>
The divide between the Home Office and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office adds unnecessary burdens to travellers, the vast majority of whom are perfectly legitimate people who want to visit their families or do business in this country. Amendment No. 69 would reverse the provision in clause 1, which would allow people to go through the process only once when they apply for their leave to enter and receive the full package of leave to enter.
<P>
The vast majority of legitimate travellers welcome the provision as it is. I suspect that a number of Committee members have had urgent calls from ports relating to people who have been granted entry clearance, only to find a problem at the port. Such individuals believe that a visa in their passport gives them the right to enter the country, but they are stopped at the point of entry, although they subsequently turn out to be legitimate entrants.
<P>
As the hon. Member for Hertsmere said, that matter was a key aspect of the submission made to the Committee by the Immigration Service Union. It was useful to hear that evidence. Immigration officers are professionals and naturally believe that they are the best people to make such decisions. They are probably suspicious of their fellow professionals in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and wish to keep power for themselves. Amendment No. 69 would maintain the power of leave to enter as the sole preserve of immigration officers.
<P>
We feel that duplication of work for many standard applications is unnecessary. We are anxious about the culture of disbelief which disadvantages many people. Certainly, a number of my constituents have complained about how they were treated when they applied to travel. We are pleased that&#151;to use the Government's own jargon&#151;the Government are considering joined-up immigration controls across the two Departments, proposed in the White Paper's discussion of joint management function.
<P>
The questions asked by the hon. Member for Hertsmere usefully point to key aspects of the workings of the measure that are not explicitly outlined in the Bill, which gives permission to make orders, and does not set out the detail of the new procedures. Confidence between Foreign and Commonwealth Office operatives acting as entry clearance officers and immigration officers at the ports of entry is vital. Will the Minister elaborate how that joint management is to be achieved?
<P>
Immigration officers in the ports should not lack confidence in decisions made to grant leave to enter abroad, when they do not have power to do anything about those decisions. That would not be conducive to the effective operation of the system. Such officers must have confidence that leave to enter has been appropriately granted, as they are required to wave through people with leave on a fast track.
<P>
We are interested in exceptional cases in which the Minister makes orders. How will he do that in a non-discriminatory way? Common sense suggests that it will be natural for the Minister to allow or refuse leave to enter to be granted automatically to certain categories of visitors. Such visitors may come from certain countries or may belong to certain economic groups, and may include those who have an income above or below a particular level. How will the Minister grant leave in such cases in a way which will not be perceived as discriminatory and will not be open to challenge if, indeed, it turns out to be discriminatory?
<P>
Liberal Democrat Members do not believe that entry clearance officers are easily fooled by marked notes and so on. Indeed, my experience is to the contrary; entry officers are quite diligent. However, we wish to ensure that the rules to which such officers must work are effectively managed and easy to implement.
<P>
We do not want to fall into the trap of making the measure a discriminatory tool, which will be used to grant legitimate travellers quick, easy access, while others continue to find access extremely difficult and still face an interview when seeking a visa and again at the port of entry. That would set up a clear divide between those who are the first-class travellers and those who&#151;as far as immigration controls are concerned&#151;are travelling in steerage.

<P>

<B>Mr. Peter Bottomley (Worthing, West):</B> The Minister will probably tell us whether the powers proposed by my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere already exist. It would be odd for the Government to say that immigration officers would not be able to challenge or check someone with pre-entry clearance, and that such clearance could not be suspended. The argument put forward by the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam may not be as stark as he put it. There are some issues in the amendments which go broadly to the concerns of some of those who made representations both in our constituencies and the expert bodies.
<P>
One of my constituents, a Mrs. Nicholson in Rustington&#151;who is I suspect, like me, a supporter of the Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture&#151;would like to have a number of responsibilities and duties put on the Secretary of State so that he would not just have the power to help asylum seekers but would have a duty to consider whether they needed help. That may be something that should happen at the time of entry as it is unlikely to happen at pre-entry clearance. That is the kind of issue on which I might have tabled a probing amendment but I confess to a personal problem; my private secretary is retiring after 12 years in about an hour's time and I would not be here to push an amendment to a vote or to withdraw it.
<P>
When considering the powers at the point of entry, it is appropriate to ask the Minister what discussions he and his Department have had with the United Nations Children's Fund about whether the procedures that affect children are in full compliance with the United Kingdom's obligations. There might be a clash between the clause, and subsection (2)(d) in particular, and the interaction with the Children Act 1989 and some of the conventions which the country has rightfully signed. It would be useful if the Minister could have discussions with UNICEF and let the Committee know during the next two or three sittings whether there are any outstanding issues where the Government have not been able to satisfy UNICEF and the children's charities that are working with it.
<P>
It would also be useful if the Minister could tell us where there is a difference of opinion as the legal effect of the changes that the Government are making to the Immigration Act 1971. It is not quite as useful for hon. Members on both sides of the Committee&#151;there is no party politics here&#151;to try to assess the legal arguments as it is for the Minister to say that his legal experts have met the legal advisers of those who have made representations to the Committee to see where the honest areas of disagreement are on the impact of the words on the law.
<P>
At times, people can argue that there ought to be easier entry and I shall come to one example in just a moment. There are other times when people can argue that there should be tougher controls. However, there is also the issue of interpreting the law; rather than waiting until the Bill has become an Act, with or without amendments, and then waiting until cases are taken either to judicial review or to appeal to the tribunal or some other court action, we should perhaps see whether issues of interpretation of the law can be settled in advance. I hope that what I have said is reasonably clear. It would help the Committee if the Minister could say what the differences of opinion are on what the law will mean.
<P>
I should like to deal now with the representations made by the United Kingdom Council for Overseas Student Affairs. UKCOSA and the other groups conerned with students are worried that either at the point of entry or at pre-clearance, a student taking a course that lasts for more than a year may be given permission to enter for only a part of the course. Two things follow on from that. The first is the uncertainty about whether the course can be completed successfully and the doubt about doing finals or gaining professional qualifications in law, accountancy or a higher degree. The second question is one of cost.
<P>
Clause 3 contains the provisions on charging but it might be sensible to flag up now what might happen in the following case. For some apparently good reason, an entry clearance officer may tell a student that he accepts that it is likely that he will want to do two or three years on his course but that he will give him only a year to begin with to make sure that the course is genuine and that he makes reasonable progress. If, however, the would-be student has to apply again, will that student have to pay a second time for what had been granted the first time? It would be more sensible if clause 1 stated that although the student had the prospect of completing the course, he had to show that he was making satisfactory progress, otherwise his permission to stay would revert to the shorter period. Consultation and imagination should be used so that the regulations or primary legislation take into account what I fear is a common occurence.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> Many students at the two excellent universities in Sheffield are in a similar situation. It would be very welcome if clause 1 allowed a person to be given a student visa for a three-year course, for example, and be given leave to enter for the same period. There is a distinction between the long courses taken by higher education students and the language school courses. The Minister may have anxieties about giving a longer entry clearance for language courses.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bottomley:</B> It is about 40 years since higher and further education developed in other countries around the world. Bluntly, we should not give too much support to people who want to come here to do courses that they should be able to do in their own countries. The hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam is right to draw a distinction between courses in which it will benefit the student to study in this country and others, such as language courses. There would be no particular benefit to come to this country for an initial English course; it would be far better to come later, to take the learning of English&#151;or Welsh or Gaelic&#151;to a higher stage.
<P>
The Minister may wish to consider now, or at a later stage, adding after line 20 on page 1:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Any order under subsection 1 shall provide that leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom granted to students or others under part 3 of the statement of changes in immigration rules (HC 395) as amended shall not be shorter than the full duration of any period of studies to which that leave relates.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I do not expect the Minister to have written down those words and to answer straight away, but it is the kind of provision that would satisfy those in education and it would tie in neatly to clause 1, line 20, assuming that it remains part of the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> Hon. Members have asked a plethora of questions and I hope that I shall be able to answer some of them now. Thankfully, the hon. Member for Hertsmere suggested that I write to him about some of the many issues that he raised and I am grateful to him for that.
<P>
Many of the issues mentioned by the hon. Gentleman were raised with him by the ISU. It is a pleasure to hear that in their great new reforming style the Conservatives are listening to trade unions; would that they had done so for the past two decades. Many of the points raised will be dealt with when we discuss the details of the regulations and how they will operate, but I shall deal with the broader matters now.
<P>
Amendment No. 69 would alter the provision in clause 1 under which it will be possible for a person who has leave to enter the United Kingdom not to have that leave lapse on leaving the common travel area. The amendment would also add a condition that leave to enter may be withdrawn and varied by an immigration officer when the person concerned returns to the United Kingdom. The Bill already provides immigration officers with the necessary power. Section 3(3) of the Immigration Act 1971 provides for varying limited leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom. That includes altering duration and altering or adding to conditions. The power to vary leave to enter or remain can currently be exercised only by the Secretary of State, and not by an immigration officer, who may grant or refuse leave to enter. However, as the hon. Member for Hertsmere pointed out, schedule 12(38) grants immigration officers the power to cancel leave to enter. That would apply to a person who benefited from future leave arrangements.
<P>
In view of the combination of new powers for immigration officers and the Secretary of State's existing powers, amendment No. 69 is unnecessary.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I want to go through some of the hon. Gentleman's many points. That will take time, so perhaps he can speak afterwards.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman asked whether the provision weakened immigration control. We strongly assert that our aim is not to do that. Clauses 1 and 2 contribute to the process of making better use of staff resources and harnessing new technology as it develops. I know that the hon. Gentleman agrees that that should be done. I agree with him that new powers and technology should not be introduced at the expense of controls. There is no distance between us on that.
<P>
The Government are committed to strong, fair and effective immigration controls and to maintaining an effective immigration service. I hope that that reassures the ISU and other unions that represent immigration officers. The provisions do not represent a move to European or Schengen-style control. We have made our commitment to frontier controls abundantly clear. The Amsterdam treaty contains a special protocol to safeguard them.
<P>
I met the ISU after I read its submission to the Committee. I pointed out that it would be bizarre if the Government performed a volte face after the Prime Minister had ensured that the Amsterdam treaty contained the protocol, and after we had clearly asserted that we would maintain our border controls. The Government's policy will not change. We intend to maintain our controls and are not in the process of introducing European-style controls. The ISU accepted that.
<P>
An entry clearance officer will be able to conduct a full interview, which should be searching. It is often forgotten in debates that many entry clearance officers are immigration officers. I was not sure whether the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam understood that. Often, an immigration officer&#151;sometimes a Foreign Office official&#151;interviews the applicant and decides whether he should be granted a visa. When that person arrives in the United Kingdom, another immigration officer has to conduct another interview, ask the same questions and establish more or less the same conclusion. That is unnecessary if it entails no benefit to immigration control. The hon. Member for Hertsmere asks, rightly, whether there is any benefit to immigration control, and, if so, how we justify the change.
<P>
The hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam said that the clause constituted a radical constitutional measure because the Foreign Office and the Home Office were working together. The White Paper makes it clear that entry clearance will soon become the joint responsibility of the Home Office and the Foreign Office. Therefore, the clause is not especially radical. However, it is perhaps radical that we are achieving more joined-up government, which is part of creating the legislative base that will enable us to administer immigration controls more effectively.
<P>
The hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam said that there was a culture of disbelief, something that I do not accept. I know from discussions with many people who work in entry clearance and immigration control that they seek to serve the public honestly and to the best of their ability and want to facilitate entry for people who should be allowed to enter the country. Sometimes people seek to enter the country when they ought not to, and their entry is properly controlled. If the hon. Gentleman meets people from the immigration service, he will find that their aim is public service rather than to disbelieve or discriminate and that they will conduct themselves in a way that properly serves the public.
<P>
The hon. Member for Hallam was concerned about discrimination. He will be aware that we will introduce a provision that will bring the immigration service and the Immigration and Nationality Directorate within the provisions of the race relations legislation. That is an important innovation. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will accept that we, too, want to ensure that there is no discrimination.
<P>
I turn now to many of the points made by the hon. Member for Hertsmere. Paragraph 38 ensures that the immigration officer who receives a person at entry control can make a decision and is not obliged to accept the decision of the official at entry clearance overseas that the person should enter the country if he believes that the decision of the immigration officer of Foreign Office official abroad was wrong. Paragraph 38 clearly gives the immigration officer the ability to find out whether there has been a change of circumstances, to consider whether false information has been given and to discover whether there has been any failure to disclose material facts. He will be able to conduct whatever interview he requires to do that.
<P>
At present, immigration officers at immigration entry control are in a difficult position if they have to conduct what is, in effect, a second interview. That is entirely unnecessary because they have accepted the bona fides of the person before them. We do not want to place that obligation on immigration entry control officers, but to ensure that they can accept the decision of their colleagues abroad if that is the proper thing to do. If it is not, however, the immigration entry control officers will be able to conduct an interview to ensure that they are satisfied that the person was properly given the visa.
<P>
The second examination will be more limited, but the person will not have been given entry clearance and thereby leave to enter unless the officers are satisfied that the requirements of the Immigration Rules have been complied with. There is no point in undertaking the same examination twice&#151;that is the difficulty with amendment No. 69, which would require an immigration officer at immigration entry control to repeat a process that had already been carried out. In effect, the immigration officer will be performing the same role as he is at present in relation to those who have entry clearance. At the moment, immigration officers may refuse entry to passengers and will continue to do so in future.
<P>
Rule 321 of the immigration rules already restricts the ability of immigration officers to refuse when a person has entry clearance. New rule 2(a) and (b) will enable them to do that on similar grounds. An immigration officer will be able to cancel extant leave as a result of paragraph 38 of scheduel 12.

<P>

<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The Minister referred to a new rule: I cannot remember the number, but it ended in (a). Will he let members of the Committee have a copy of that rule and all the other relevant rules? Unless I am mistaken, we have not received any so far.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I have no problem with giving the hon. Gentleman a copy of all the immigration rules; they are public documents and we will ensure that they are made available to members of the Committee.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman made a series of points. I do not want to deal with all of them, but I can deal with some of the main ones. He raised the point made by John Tincey during the Special Standing Committee when he was asked how long immigration officers would have to check identity and documents:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Three seconds has been suggested to us.''&#151;[Official Report, Special Standing Committee, 22 March 1999; c. 450.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I do not know who suggested that to Mr. Tincey, but my senior officials are aware of no such target.
<P>
The question that the hon. Member for Hertsmere put to John Tincey was a general one&#151;I have it in front of me. People who have a clear right to enter because they have a British passport or have EU rights of entry are processed quickly. Mr. Tincey may have been referring to a broad-based average of three seconds; however, if Mr. Tincey goes to the immigration control&#151;as I am sure he has&#151;at Heathrow or elsewhere, he will find that people are stopped and properly considered. Depending on circumstances, it sometimes takes time and sometimes does not. We doubtless have immigration officers who ensure that, as we would want, they fulfil their duty to the public. If they have any suspicions or concerns about whether the entrance clearance is adequate, they will have the power to revoke it; they can also cancel extant leave if someone leaves the country, comes back and circumstances have changed in a way that would make it improper for that person to re-enter the country. The hon. Gentleman also referred to the point that John Tincey raised about money in baggage. That is covered by paragraph 38 because false representations would be grounds for re-examination and would enable the immigration officer to cancel a person's right of entry. There are therefore adequate powers to ensure that an immigration officer does the job that the public and the Government expect. The provisions cause no relaxation in immigration controls.
<P>
 STAZ
<P>
On the more detailed points, the hon. Gentleman referred to the port of entry examination as a quick check on identity. It is more than that. The notes on clauses state that we want to ensure that there is no unnecessary delay; if all that is required is a quick check that the person was properly granted the right to enter the UK, there should be no obligation on the immigration officer to go further. At the moment there is such an obligation; we want to ensure that the immigration officer does not have to repeat the interview that a colleague has already carried out. The hon. Gentleman read out a paragraph from schedule 12; I do not need to read it again. Paragraph 38 clearly provides the necessary powers.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman also asked whether there were other circumstances in which we could look at the way in which leave to enter might be granted. The answer is yes, depending on how technology develops. We want to put legal powers in place so that, if new technology enables it, we can consider new ways of granting leave to enter that still ensure proper immigration controls. That would be done by regulation, which could come before Parliament in the usual way; Parliament could then consider how the new technology operated and whether it would adequately maintain immigration controls.
<P>
Our aim is to ensure that immigration controls are not endangered by the use of new technology. The Bill would allow us to consider whether new technology could properly be introduced. The answer to the hon. Gentleman's question is yes, but we shall have to consider those future developments before going any further. At the moment, we have no intention of introducing new technology; we shall wait and see how it develops. If the hon. Gentleman wishes me to deal with any other points in relation to amendment No. 69, I shall return to them later.
<P>
I turn to amendment No. 72. Under section 4(1) of the Immigration Act 1971, the power to grant or refuse leave to enter the United Kingdom rests solely with immigration officers. By contrast, the power to give or refuse leave to remain in the United Kingdom or to change the conditions attached to an individual's leave to enter or remain, can be exercised by the Secretary of State&#151;in practice, by civil servants acting in the name of the Secretary of State. That rigid distinction between the role of the Secretary of State and one group of his staff, namely immigration officers, is illogical and can lead to inefficiency.
<P>
To cope with future demands, we must ensure that legislation reflects changing realities. It should enable us to make the most efficient use of all the staff of the Immigration and Nationality Directorate, be they members of the immigration service or of the directorate. At present, in a considerable number of cases, and particularly with applications for asylum, files travel back and forth between caseworkers in Croydon and immigration officers at the port. That delays the process and is inefficient.
<P>
At present, a caseworker in Croydon will make a decision whether to grant or refuse asylum, but the file is then passed back to the port for the immigration officer to make the subsidiary decision whether to grant leave to enter. There is no sense in that. The decision whether to grant leave to enter follows automatically from the decision whether to grant or refuse asylum. It makes good sense to allow the caseworker in Croydon to deal with both questions simultaneously. That will allow immigration officers to use their time more constructively, and it will speed up the handling of cases.
<P>
Amendment No. 72 would entirely remove that element of flexibility from the Bill. The Secretary of State would not be able to grant or refuse leave to enter the United Kingdom, and we would not be able to make any of the changes that I have outlined which could enable resources to be used more efficiently. The hon. Gentleman talked about creating new backlogs.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> We shall come to backlogs in due course. Where did John Tincey get the idea that an asylum refusal letter should include an application form for leave to enter?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I shall come to that in a moment.
<P>
The Immigration Service Union fears that the status of the Immigration Service, as separate from the Imigration and Nationality Directorate, would be undermined by the Bill. I have said that the Immigration Service will be getting new powers. Clause 1 deals with some of the service's restrictive and bureaucratic practices, which may make it more flexible, but the trade-off is that it will get other, new powers. What the Government intend may have consequences for the Immigration Service, but it can be reassured that there are no plans to undermine it.
<P>
The issue of the backlog and the way in which the procedure operates is important, because the aim of the Bill is to enable greater efficiency in operation and control, and our starting point is clear: we will take no action that would produce a new or additional backlog. In many cases the refusal of asylum is the end of the matter, and there is no scope for a further application, but we shall operate any new arrangements in a way that avoids difficulties of the kind suggested by John Tincey. We cannot anticipate every way in which the system might operate, but there will be an opportunity to give full parliamentary scrutiny to any orders that are made as we introduce greater flexibility.
<P>
Mr. Tincey seems to be suggesting that we are undermining the Immigration Service as against the IND. I am certain that that is not happening, but his fears about the way in which immigration controls will operate are unfounded. Immigration controls depend not only on the Immigration Service but on entry clearance and the way in which the IND operates. The Government want to ensure that our staff are used in the most efficient way so that we can effect firm immigration controls. The trade union is clearly looking at the interests of a group of staff employed by the Home Office. As Parliamentarians we must look at the broader issues and ask whether the measure will ensure greater flexibility and therefore more effective immigration control? It will do so. Some of the relationships between the Immigration Service and the IND may be slightly altered, although in other parts of the Bill they are altered in a different way, but overall we can ensure that firm immigration controls continue, that opportunities for new technology are created and that we make the best use of staff.
<P>
For the reasons that I have given, the Government do not accept the amendments. We must secure greater flexibility in operating controls, but we shall use that flexibility cautiously and only when we are satisfied that any changes will strengthen rather than weaken control. Hon. Members who have concerns will have the opportunity to raise them when the regulations come before the House.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Bottomley:</B> I assume that the Minister will suggest another day when concerns about students might appropriately be taken up. To aid his consideration, it may be helpful to say that his entry clearance officers and immigration officers confirm that problems sometimes arise from their over-caution in giving students leave to remain for less than the duration of their course, even when all documents are in order and funding arrangements are clear and adequate. A more sensible&#151;some might say generous&#151;policy at the port of entry could enormously reduce the pressure of demand for after-entry variations.
<P>
Students should be given leave to enter for at least their full period of study, just as we want students from this country to have permission to stay for the full period of their course in another country. At present only a minority of students coming here for longer courses are given more than a year's leave to enter the United Kingdom. The Government should consider, either now or at another stage, adding words that will secure that leave to enter is for the full period of study with, ideally, a margin for packing, settling affairs, holidays and so on. It is particularly important that appropriate instructions are given to entry clearance officers and immigration officers when the greater operational flexibility in clause 1 to which the Minister referred is brought into effect.

<P>

<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> If the hon. Member for Worthing, West (Mr. Bottomley) will forgive me, I have not dealt with all his points and it is right that I should refer to some of them. It is the price of having a large number of points from the hon. Member for Hertsmere. I shall deal with them quickly.
<P>
The hon. Member for Worthing, West asked whether an immigration officer can overrule an entry clearance officer. Yes, paragraph 38 gives him the power to do that. He asked whether I would consider placing a duty on the Secretary of State to help the victims of torture. I have met the Medical Foundation for the Victims of Torture on a number of occasions to discuss its concerns. We cannot create a mechanism whereby anyone who alleges that he has been a victim of torture automatically has a right to enter the UK. We must balance our important human rights obligations with proper and reasonable immigration controls.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman asked what discussions I had had with UNICEF. I have not met UNICEF yet, although I have met many other organisations. UNICEF has not asked for a meeting but if it does, I shall be happy to discuss any of its concerns.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman asked whether the Government would set out all the legal arguments on which there is some dispute. I know that there are a few lawyers in the Room. They will know that lawyers always disagree on the meaning of the law. One of the purposes of courts is to listen to lawyers dispute the way in which the law should be applied. I suspect that on every clause one lawyer will find some point on which to disagree with another lawyer. I am not sure that it would be productive for me to set out all the circumstances in which that might occur.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman then rightly raised the issue of students&#151;the UKCOSA point. We normally try to grant students the right to enter and remain for the duration of the course. Sometimes we may not wish to do that, perhaps if we think that adequate funding will not be available for the whole period. If evidence can be given that funding exists, the right to remain may then be granted for the full duration of the course, but people often cannot provide that evidence. In other circumstances we may wish to monitor whether a person attends the course, so it may be necessary to grant a limited period of entry and then later consider whether, if the student has attended the course, we can give him right to remain to the end of it. We try to minimise the restrictive approach.
<P>
Where we have concerns and seek reassurance by imposing conditions, students may protest and suggest to their representative organisations that the conditions should not be applied. However, we are also anxious to avoid unnecessary applications for renewal of visas or for further leave to remain to complete a course, because that generates unnecessary and nugatory work for the immigration service. We must achieve the right balance between having proper immigration controls and oversight of people who are in this country temporarily and ensuring that those who are properly here can complete their courses.
<P>
Sometimes it is difficult to make judgments in those cases, and immigration officers wish to act cautiously. I think that members of the Committee would want overseas students to study here, finish their courses and go back to their own countries in the proper way, but we know that the student route has been used on all too many occasions by people seeking to breach immigration controls. We must be sure that proper safeguards exist so that we have controls where we want to be cautious or have questions about whether the finances are there, whether a student will attend or what his objective is in coming to this country.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I shall touch on this point briefly, because I know that we want to move on. I hope that the Minister will reconsider his comments about the consistency of granting leave to enter. The experience of the university of Sheffield, which has 2,500 international students, is that students coming from the same country for the same course under exactly the same conditions can be granted different leaves to enter. That is causing a major problem because some people are effectively being discouraged from studying in this country because of problems at Croydon, which mean that when people apply for renewal they have to leave their passports for months. The Minister should think again about his assurances; my anecdotal experience suggests something very different.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> An immigration officer or other person dealing with a student's application for entry will have to make a judgment based on the individual student's circumstances. That will produce differences in the granting of leave to enter and remain in the country and in the controls imposed on the students. The hon. Gentleman's assumption that we need a consistent approach&#151;that everyone should be granted leave to remain on exactly the same basis&#151;is not in accord with our need to treat people as individuals and to consider whether firmer immigration control is compatible with decisions in particular cases.
<P>
Decisions will be individual and there is no way around that. Immigration officers and entry clearance officers are given powers to make a judgment about what is fit and proper in relation to firm immigration control. That means, as I said, individual decisions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I have listened carefully to the Minister's response. I am grateful for its tone, but I have several outstanding questions. Before I deal with them, however, may I briefly tell my hon. Friend the Member for Worthing, West that he made some important points about the victims of torture? We heard interesting and moving evidence in our earlier proceedings and I am sure that we will return to it in other contexts.
<P>
The Minister stated that much of what I said was based on the evidence of the Immigration Service Union. He had his fun about unions. However, the Immigration Service Union's evidence is part and parcel of the evidence taken by this Committee. I understand that the Immigration Service Union has a job to do on behalf of its members, which is perfectly legitimate. One should view its evidence against that background, but its members also have the most day-to-day experience of operating the system. They have far more detailed knowledge than any of us in Committee, so when they raise questions and suggest amendments, such as this, we should treat them seriously. The Immigration Service Union put specific questions. If the Minister can assure me that it is wrong and that its fears are unfounded, I would be prepared to accept that. I shall return to that in a moment, but I want first to deal with questions that I put to the Minister earlier.
<P>
I understand that the Minister does not have all the information at his fingertips, as I anticipated in my earlier contribution. I acknowledge that he may not know precisely the reasons why people granted entry clearance are then refused leave to enter. However, it would be useful and informative for our future debates if the Minister would supply such information as he has. I do not expect him to have it today, but I do expect some answers and reassurances on the broad questions that have arisen. So far the Minister's answers have been very broad indeed and have not answered all the questions I raised, particularly those about immigration officers' powers.
<P>
I am prepared to acept what the Minister says about using technology and adapting the law to provide access to the benefits of technology, but I am not prepared to do so if there is a risk of weakening our system of on-entry immigration controls or our system of immigration control in general. The powers of immigration officers exercised at the point of entry are an important consideration.
<P>
The Minister suggested that the amendment was unnecessary because of the combination of the powers that immigration officers will continue to have under paragraph 38 of schedule 12 and because of the Secretary of State's powers to vary or withdraw limited leave. However, the Secretary of State does not deal with the matter at the point of entry; that is a job for immigration officers. Therefore, will the Minister tell us what the extent of their powers will be?
<P>
I appreciate that an immigration officer can&#151;to use the Minister's term&#151;cancel leave to enter in the circumstances outlined in paragraph 38 when the person concerned has given false information, not disclosed a material fact or circumstances have changed. What if&#151;and this is the key question&#151;the immigration officer is not satisfied that someone should be granted entry and thinks that a ground for refusal exists that is not covered by the circumstances outlined in paragraph 38? What will happen if, after examining a case, an immigration officer believes that a person should not be granted entry to the United Kingdom because grounds for refusal exist?
<P>
Will the Minister tell us whether immigration officers will still have such powers under the new dispensation? Will their powers at the point of entry be undiminished? Will they have the power to cancel leave to enter on any of the grounds under which they can currently refuse leave to enter? I want assurance from the Minister that their powers will be undiminished.
<P>
I understand the Minister's point about avoiding unnecessary examinations. However, it is important that immigration officers should continue to have the power to examine particular cases even when someone has been granted leave to enter by an entry clearance officer. Will immigration officers still have the power to refuse or to cancel leave to enter on the same grounds as they do currently? Will their powers remain the same?
<P>
I appreciate that I have asked several questions, but these are complicated issues. I am not sure that the Minister replied in detail to my questions about leave to enter which does not lapse on leaving the common travel area, so I shall probe him a little more on that point. When someone is granted leave to enter which does not lapse on leaving the common travel area, does that mean that the leave to enter does not lapse when that person visits any country or will the provision be confined to a range of countries? How will the provision work? We need more detail than we have so far been given.
<P>
I hear what the Minister says about the people other than entry clearance officers who could be given the power to grant or refuse leave to enter. It is understandable that the Government will want to take advantage of technology, but a balance must be struck. We want to give the Government scope to use technology, but we need some idea of how the Government will exercise the powers. It is not good enough for the Government to say, ``Give us these powers. We don't know how we're going to use them yet, but we shall bring forward a statutory instrument when we decide.'' We need more information on who will be involved. We cannot give a broad power to the Secretary of State without knowing a little bit more about it. Is there anything more that the Minister can say about those, other than entry clearance officers, who might be entrusted with the power to grant or refuse leave to enter the United Kingdom?
<P>
We are not prepared to write a blank cheque. If other immigration rules are being drawn up, it would be helpful to have them in advance of the debates rather than to be told by the Minister, ``Well, this is being provided for in the rules and we don't have sight of the rules.'' I would welcome the Minister's assurance that he will let us have any relevant information, rules or documents that are presently to hand.
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Finally, I raise the matter of duplication of work by immigration officers and case workers on granting leave to enter when asylum has been refused&#151;the reason for the power in subsection (7). Will the Minister say more about asylum seekers who have been turned down being sent application forms for leave to enter? Are there any grounds for what John Tincey of the ISU said about the matter? Can the Minister assure us that if the Secretary of State takes that power it will not lead to further applications being sent to failed asylum seekers when they receive notice of refusal of asylum? We do not want to build delays into the system. The Minister can clear up the matter by saying, ``No, there will be one point at which all these matters will be dealt with. There is no question of further application forms being sent as the immigration service envisaged.'' The ISU has got hold of this idea; is the Minister prepared to knock it on the head and say that there is no question of further application forms being sent out? We are not prepared to write a blank cheque on such issues; we need more details than we have at present.

<P>

<B>Mr. Neil Gerrard </B>(Walthamstow): I would be grateful if the hon. Gentleman could let me know of any occasion on which the Home Office immigration and nationality department has, unsolicited, sent application forms to anyone for anything.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes a reasonable point, but I am asking the Minister to reply to the comments made by the ISU. As the hon. Gentleman will know from his careful study of the Bill, leave to enter is determined by someone; if it is the Secretary of State, how will that determination take place?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> If the hon Member for Hertsmere or any other hon. Member wants to see the immigration rules, they are in the Libaray, as they have been for a long time. They are public documents, obtainable from many places. No doubt the Table Office will provide copies to any hon. Member who wants them. The immigration rules are not secret and I see no reason why we should provide every hon. Member with a copy, as we are not considering them today.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman asked for what reasons an immigration officer may refuse a person the right to enter the United Kingdom when that person has been granted a visa and the right to enter at an entry clearance post. There are many reasons: the immigration officer may become suspicious about certain matter and want to ask whether cirmstance have changed; he may want to ask about material facts which have not been disclosed and to establish whether false information has been given, and so on. All those issues can be raised and can lead the immigration officer to refuse a person's right to enter, despite the fact that a colleague, perhaps a fellow immigration officer, has granted the right to enter at a post abroad. There are all sorts of circumstances for refusal. The hon. Member for Hertsmere says that I need not have such information at my fingertips, but there are so many reasons that it would be unreasonable to try to list them all. It is about whether a person has made a proper application and has the right to enter. The immigration officer will retain the obligation to consider such matters in the proper way.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman asked about the various powers of the immigration officer. Immigration officers are employees of the Secretary of State and therefore have the powers of the Secretary of State; they do not have to be given separate powers because they can apply the Secretary of State's powers in much the same way as any other employee of the Secretary of State. The hon. Gentleman asked in what circumstances the immigration officer should conduct an examination. He will conduct an examination if he believes that it is necessary under paragraph 38 of schedule 12. Immigration officers will have all the powers that they need to carry out their duties effectively.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman asked whether the lapse of leave to enter could refer to any country. The answer is that it could&#151;the present aim is for it to do so&#151;but the provision will enable us to make regulation so that if we wish to make a distinction we will be able to do so. The hon. Gentleman also asked how the powers would be exercised; he suggested that I did not know, but I have already given an explanation of that. All we are doing is making provisions so that if new technology&#151;metric swipe cards and the various other innovations being mentioned&#151;becomes available, we can decide whether it is appropriate to put before the House provisions that would be taken and used as part of our entry control. I am not asking the hon. Gentleman to write any blank cheques on the issue, and if he is asking me&#151;I suspect that it is not his aim&#151;to prejudge how technology will develop, that is unfair and unreasonable. It is not a question of writing blank cheques because of the secondary control of the regulations that will have to be put before the House. I shall not go into how those regulations will be made, because I would be ruled out of order, but they will ensure that we take advantage of new technology.
<P>
On the application forms about which Mr. Tincey seems to have so vexed the hon. Gentleman, we have not contemplated sending out any such forms. If people refused asylum seek to make a further application, as they sometimes do, that would be a matter for them and would be considered in the normal way. They may have proper grounds for such an application. However, the system will create greater efficiency; we would ensure that it did not create anything less. We have said that we want asylum seekers to make an application for asylum at the first possible opportunity. Those provisions are set out in the White Paper and are the basis on which we seek to proceed. Mr. Tincey and the hon. Gentleman need therefore have no concern about our trying to produce new backlogs or sending out forms. My hon. Friend the Member for Walthamstow (Mr. Gerrard) pointed out that we do not encourage people to make unnecessary applications; the provision is aimed at efficiency, not inefficiency.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I have drawn out some useful assurances from the Minister, although I am still perplexed about the position of the immigration officer. If his powers and responsibilities are to remain the same. I am curious about why the Government have taken the step that is tucked away under paragraph 38 of schedule 12 whereby an immigration officer may examine a person for the purpose of seeing whether there has been a change in circumstances or
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``whether that leave was obtained a result of false information given by him or his failure to disclose material facts.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Why limit the provision in such a way under the schedule if the intention is that the immigration officer's position should be the same as it is at present? It is perplexing. The Minister has not explained why the immigration officer at entry control in this country will know what was said and whether it was false or what was disclosed to an entry clearance officer at the post overseas.
<P>
I was interested by the Minister's admission about leave to enter not lapsing on leaving the common travel area and that it could apply to someone with leave to enter going to and coming back from anywhere. The Minister said, ``The aim is to make a distinction if we wanted to.'' We shall have to reflect on that statement. Some people would assume from the Bill that leave to enter would not lapse on leaving the common travel area and going anywhere, not just to a limited range of countries. I am pleased that I asked the Minister that question, because it seems that the provision is capable of being used to allow distinctions to be made between different countries&#151;something that has great implications that we shall have to monitor carefully in future.
<P>
The Minister has given me assurances about further applications from immigration case workers who deal with asylum cases. He is better placed than I am to know the position, but the immigration service has expressed that fear. I enjoin him to have great regard for efficiency and avoid anything that runs the risk of creating extra backlogs. The Minister referred to many matters that I will have to consider carefully and to which I might return later. However, to make a little progress, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 70, in page 1, leave out lines 21 to 26.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 71, in page 2, leave out lines 1 to 17.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> We now come to&#151;if we ever left it&#151;leave to enter being granted by an entry clearance officer. I shall do my best to avoid going over old ground, but some new questions need to be asked. As the Committee will be aware, proposed subsection (3) of the new section 3A of the Immigration Act 1971 will give the Secretary of State power to make an order providing that entry visas or entry clearance can have effect as leave to enter.
<P>
The purpose of the amendments is to explore the matter a little further, but without going over old ground. In its submission to the Committee, the ISU suggested that the proposed subsection be deleted from the Bill, something that we shall have to explore.
<P>
It said that changes and improvements will be made in the issue of visas if visas or other forms of entry clearance are to be given effect as leave to enter. It said that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``it is acknowledged that the standard of visa issue will have to be raised considerably and the current quotas for visa issues removed if the control is not to be downgraded.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Will the Minister say what plans, if any, are in place for improving the standard of visa issue? Is there to be more rigorous interviewing as part of the entry clearance process?
<P>
The next is a practical point, which has been raised in a number of submissions made in evidence to the Committee. When will the period of leave to enter commence, when will an entry visa have effect as leave to enter and how long it will last? The Minister will be aware that, at present, a period of leave to enter begins when leave to enter is granted at the port of entry. Under the new arrangements, entry clearance will be given effect as leave to enter; but when will the period of leave to enter commence?
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
On amendment No. 71, subsection (4) of new section 3A enables an order made by the Secretary of State to make provision for the number of times that clearance is to have effect as leave to enter. The provision should be considered alongside the earlier provision for leave to enter not to lapse on leaving the common travel area.
<P>
The purpose of the amendment is to explore the provision on entry clearance a little further, including how it will be decided whether an entry visa should have effect as leave to enter on a prescribed number of occasions or an unlimited number of occasions; what the prescribed conditions might be under subsection (4)(a)(iii) to which it could be made subject; and when such a clearance will be varied so that it ceases to have effect. I adverted earlier, in a different context, to the sort of examination or checks a person with such a visa would be subject to each time a visa had effect as leave to enter. This probing amendment is designed to obtain answers to those questions.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I was glad to hear that the hon. Gentleman does not want to go over old ground. We have taken two hours to consider two groups of amendments, and we have yet to consider another 65 groups of amendments to 27 clauses. If we were to deal with them all, that would take about 500 hours.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman asked about changes to the issuing of visas. We seek constantly to improve and refine the quality of our controls. The Immigration Service and the Foreign Office always seek to make decisions properly; improving the quality of our controls must therefore be ongoing. I can give a positive response. For as long as entry clearance exists, we shall ensure that it is properly done.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman asked when leave will commence. It will commence when it is intended to come into force. In other words, it will say when it commences. A person will be given the right to enter at a prescribed time, and the visa will normally last for a particular period. A visitors visa will last for for six months, and a person will be entitled to use the visa to go back and forth from the United Kingdom. However, the immigration control at the entry control point will always be able to revoke the right to enter if there is good reason for doing so. The control will remain; only the bureaucracy of the control will be reduced. The hon. Gentleman asked when leave will cease to have effect. It will cease to have effect when the leave ends. In other words, when a person is no longer entitled to be in the UK, he will no longer have leave to enter.
<P>
The effect of the amendments taken together would be to delete all the provisions in clause 1 that seek to enable a visa or other entry clearance to have effect as leave to enter the United Kingdom. That new provision is intended to be an important element in the creation of more efficient immigration control. That will save the immigration officer examining the arriving passenger from having to grant leave to enter and, as I explained, will thus considerably reduce the duplication of effort. The amendments would restore all such duplication.
<P>
Let me emphasise that all arriving passengers will still be seen by immigration staff. Immigration officers can refuse to admit people to the United Kingdom, notwithstanding the possession of a visa or other entry clearance. That safeguard will remain. However, nothing more than a quick examination to establish identity and the validity of the visa will be necessary for the overwhelming majority of passengers.
<P>
By such means, we will avoid duplication and nugatory work, ensuring that immigration officers concentrate on the job that they are paid to do. That is preferable to immigration officers going through a bureaucratic exercise which may well give them something to do, but is a restrictive practice requiring more and more of them to be employed.
<P>
I understand the ISU's view, but its members will want to ensure that they deliver a service of proper immigration control to the public. That means that immigration officers will not do unnecessary jobs and that, when visitors arrive in the UK, they do not repeat work performed by their colleagues on entry clearance, provided that they are satisfied that such work is perfectly proper and valid. By such means we will save considerable staff resources, which will be better used to target areas of potential abuse.
<P>
 todd
<P>
I hope that, in light of my explanation and reassurance that the ability to refuse leave to enter will still be available at the point of entry, the hon. Gentleman will withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I welcome the Minister's assurance that the Government intend to seek higher standards on screening and interviewing entry clearance officers. We will scrutinise the Government on that matter to ensure that their deeds are as good as their words.
<P>
I accept what the Minister said about the commencement of the period of leave. That matter was raised in a number of responses given as evidence to the Committee, and I hope that things work as smoothly as the Minister says they will. However, travel plans change from time to time. Some time before people arrive in the United Kingdom they will have to apply for leave to enter by a system in which leave is granted by an entry clearance officer overseas.
<P>
The present system is simple: people are given leave to enter for a period from their point of arrival in the United Kingdom. However, when people are given leave to enter at a point of entry post overseas, such leave may be affected by changes in travel plans. I trust that the Bill will not have the unintended consequence of people applying for leave to enter the United Kingdom and then making applications for a variation of that leave later on.
<P>
I hope that a large number of applications for extensions of leave to enter and leave to remain do not arise as a result of the Bill. However, I am happy to accept the Minister's assurance on that matter, although we shall scrutinise it and other matters later.
<P>
In the interest of making progress, and bearing in mind the Minister's views, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 125, in page 2, leave out lines 39 and 40 and insert&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `( ) But no such order is to be made unless a draft of the order has been laid before Parliament and approved by a resolution of each House.'' '.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, it will be convenient to take the following amendments; No. 73, in page 2, leave out lines 39 and 40 and insert&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(13) No order is to be made under subsection (12) above unless a draft of the order has been laid before Parliament and approved by a resolution of each House.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Government amendment No. 126, No. 75, in Clause 2, page 3, leave out lines 17 and 18 and insert&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(6) No order is to be made under subsection (5) above unless a draft of the order has been laid before and approved by a resolution of each House of Parliament.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The amendments all stem from the Committee's evidence-taking sessions. Several organisations which gave evidence argued that stronger safeguards could be incorporated into clauses 1 and 2 by making provision for order-making powers to be subject to affirmative resolution. The ISU suggested that, as did the Refugee Council and others, and I notice that the Opposition tabled amendments with a similar intent. We wish to be constructive and listen not only to those who gave evidence, but to the Opposition when they put forward reasoned and constructive points. We listened with care and we have been persuaded by them. We have therefore introduced Government amendments to provide that the orders made under clauses 1 and 2 are to be approved by affirmative resolution.
<P>
This is a good example of the valuable contribution that taking evidence has made to our consideration of the Bill and also of a constructive attempt by the Opposition to engage in discussion of the Bill. We are therefore in the happy position of having agreed on what needs to be done. I therefore hope that the hon. Member for Hertsmere will withdraw amendments Nos. 73 and 75 and I invite the Committee to accept amendments Nos. 125 and 126.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> On a point of order, as the amendments have not been moved, the hon. Gentleman does not have to withdraw them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> In the light of the Minister's comments, I am tempted to stop now. He says that I have persuaded him when I have not said a single word. Given that the Minister has accepted our amendments, I will not speak at length, but I would like to pause for a moment to claim some small credit. We will not fall into the trap of overestimating this. It is a victory but the war is by no means won.
<P>
As I am sure the Minister would be first to acknowledge, accepting the amendments is no substitute for examining the Bill in as much detail as possible. The Government's order-making power and statutory instruments for regulations and orders are all in the future. The amendments give us a better opportunity to debate the matters at a later stage, but it is still not the same as being able to debate them in Committee and to table amendments. The amendments are no substitute for that, but we welcome them. It would be churlish for us not to do so.
<P>
Finally, the Minister made a point about the amendments having been suggested by the ISU. I am not concerned about that union's interests and the practices that it does or does not want to engender. I am concerned about the strength of our immigration controls and that the Bill should do nothing to weaken them because that would lead to all sorts of consequences that we wish to avoid. That is our concern now and in future. We will listen to any points of view that may be expressed about this and we will put them to the Government and seek a response. We are not concerned about the ISU's interests; we want to ensure the public interest of keeping our immigration controls strong.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> A cynic would suggest that the Government had a few points in the Bill where they could make some minor concessions and sell them as major concessions. I would not be so cynical given the spirit of unity about these important amendments that will save the Opposition praying against negative resolutions as we will have affirmative resolutions that will allow us an automatic debate on the orders that came forward.
<P>
Very much in keeping with the comments of the hon. Member for Hertsmere, although I welcome the fact that we will have a parliamentary opportunity to debate any regulations, that is not substitute for having a more complete set of regulations within the Bill. We too support this small concession while bearing in mind that it is not the major step forward that we would have hoped for. Perhaps the Minister is saving those major concessions for some more substantive issues later in the Bill.

<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The Government have looked, listened, consulted and discussed. We have tried to ensure that the Bill developed has a result of our looking at the facts, listening to the arguments and reaching realistic conclusions. If we hear talk of victory and cynicism, the spirit in which the Government seek to deal with the Opposition will obviously be undermined. We have spoken with dozens of refugee groups and others about how to develop a constructive policy. We hope to engage the Opposition in a constructive debate.

<P>
I do not doubt the right of the hon. Member for Hertsmere to table amendments and to press the Government on how the Bill will change the law. However, we want to make progress; it is important that the Bill should become law so that we can sort out the problems in the immigration and asylum system. We are in the process not of apportioning blame but of trying to solve problems. Let us make progress. If it is a victory, it will be a victory for a Government who are prepared to listen.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Maclean (Penrith and The Border):</B> I am prompted to speak following the debate on the Government's concession to use the affirmative resolution procedure. I am not sure what the Minister would say about the spirit with which clause 1 has been approached if I were to read out some of the comments made in the many hundreds of submissions that we have all received. Although those submissions criticise various parts of the Bill that are thought to be inhumane or contrary to the European convention on human rights, they nearly all start by complaining about the draconian and sweeping powers contained in clause 1.
<P>
Part I generally, and clause 1 in particular, seems to have attracted the attention of many organisations, which are rightly concerned that clause 1 should leave no gaps. However, it is difficult to amend a clause that has such broad and general order-making powers. Allowing those orders and regulations to be made under the affirmative resolution procedure is the least that the Government could do. However, I would not want anyone to think that it will make a big difference to the scrutiny that the House will give them. During the past two years, we have all seen that such matters are now handled rather briefly and routinely Upstairs, never coming back to the Floor of the House for proper debate. It is a source of concern. I shall quote the comments of a few organisations.
<P>
The Central London Inter-Faith Refugee network and the Westminster Refugee Consortium have said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``We believe this Bill fails in its goal of a faster and fairer system of asylum procedure, and we are deeply concerned for the consequences if it is not substantially amended. The Bill will cause great hardship and injustice while offering no undertaking to increase speed and efficiency in determining applications. Its punitive and restrictive nature puts us in severe danger of breaching our international obligations under the 1951 United Nations Convention and the Human Rights Act 1998.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The consortium continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Bill gives sweeping powers to the Secretary of State, without Parliamentary scrutiny, over the liberties and well-being of a marginalised group of people.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> The increase in pre-entry control and measures against both those who use false documentation and those who assist them, are so severe that a great many genuine asylum seekers will be prevented from exercising their human right to seek asylum, leading to untold misery . . . While welcoming the flexibility which would allow the Secretary of State to regard a visa as giving leave to enter, we are concerned that visa restrictions have been, and could continue to be, imposed on countries which produce refugees, effectively preventing people from such countries from seeking refuge here.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I shall cite some of the information provided by Save the Children Fund and UNICEF. Along with many other organisations, they are deeply concerned about what is not in the Bill. The SCF has an overriding concern about the Bill, saying that it lacks specific provision in respect of asylum-seeking children, children and families and even more critically, unaccompanied children. Clause 1 is the most pertinent proposal about which to make such comments, although they can apply to other clauses. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Throughout part I in the matter of the determination of asylum claims, no provision is made in the procedures leading to leave to enter, remain in the UK or for removal in respect of asylum-seeking children, whether accompanied or unaccompanied. Part I requires amendment with explicit reference to children to ensure that they are dealt with appropriately and that their treatment is not subsumed under provision for others.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I shall not delay the Committee's proceedings by reading out more of the comments of the Save the Children Fund, but it is concerned that part I and clause 1 of the Bill are inadequate as drafted.
<P>
I come now to some of the views of Amnesty International:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Amnesty International has concerns that the very poor drafting of the Bill makes many of the provisions obscure. The Bill's provisions do not address the concerns that Amnesty International identified throughout the consultation process and in its response to the White Paper. The Bill in its current form does not deliver the promised holistic approach to the asylum determination process, nor does it make radical changes to the current asylum procedures which Amnesty International believes are inadequate to identify those in need of protection from persecution.''&#151;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and specifically on clause I, Amnesty International stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The initial determination procedure on which the Bill is silent, is barely operational at the present time. The support arrangements as proposed in the Bill are dependent on speedy decisions but no attention has been paid to the importance of well informed decision-making at the initial stages.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Although the Home Secretary has declared that, in his view, the provisions of the Bill are compatible with rights under the European Convention on Human Rights, Amnesty International does not believe this to be the case.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I have mentioned a few of the concerns of various organisations. Given that I merely wish to make the point that clause 1 is inadequate, I do not propose to vote against it. However, I cannot let eulogies on the clause pass without pointing out that it is grossly inadequate. We now have a procedure whereby the huge expanse of missing detail on clause 1 will be filled in on Wednesday mornings in Committee Room 9 or 10 over the next few years. It will not be paid attention to by many people nor will many organisations know about it. The fact that we have that process by affirmative resolution procedure does not make up for the fact that the clause is drastically inadequate. I shall not bore the Committee any longer by quoting anything from the ISU&#151;different material from that which my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere quoted to the Committee, nevertheless it makes powerful points on clause 1 that the Committee has not adddressed. While I am not opposed to clause 1, it is a serious inadequacy that we cannot let pass without comment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> It is important to put on record that the powers granted under clause 1 are very wide; the details are not sufficiently in evidence and the clause covers an area of great public importance. One organisation which submitted evidence and which attended our oral evidence session&#151;the ISU&#151;complained that no one had commented on this part of the Bill on Second Reading, even though it contains wide-ranging powers to transform the nature of United Kingdom immigration control.
<P>
I make no apologies for having gone into the matter in some detail. It is of great public importance and will be of great interest to many of our constituents who wish the strength of our immigration controls to be maintained. Our debtates on clause 1 have made up for the fact that in the eyes of some there was no mention of such matters on Second Reading.
<P>

<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> It comes rich from the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border (Mr. Maclean)&#151;who, when he was a Home Office Minister in the previous Government, proposed several Bills on immigration and asylum&#151;now to complain that the Government are introducing draconian provisions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> Does the Minister accept that that is not as incongruous as him claiming to be tough on immigration?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> We can get into such exchanges if the right hon. Gentleman wants, but we were trying to raise the profile of the debate.
<P>
The right hon. Gentleman also detailed a number of complaints made by refugee organisations about the Bill in broad terms.
<P>
The hon. Member for Hertsmere said that the ISU had complained that it was the only body that had complained about the clause; the other organisations to which the right hon. Gentleman referred were therefore presumably not complaining about the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for giving way. The ISU was complaining, in a non-political and impartial way, about the fact that neither the Home Secretary or shadow Home Secretary nor any other Member of Parliament had made any comment on that part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The clause is designed to allow greater flexibility in the way in which non-British or non-EU and non-EEA nationals are given or refused leave to enter. It will produce greater flexibility to ensure that we properly target our resources on those who abuse the immigration system. Our aim is to make all aspects of immigration control as effective and efficient as possible to facilitate genuine travellers and to combat abuse.
<P>
We have discussed in detail how the clause will operate and I will not repeat the arguments. I ask the Committee to approve the clause.
<P>
Question accordingly agreed to.
<P>
Clause 1, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill. Further consideration adjourned.&#151;[Mr. Mike Hall.]
<P>
