<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Members should ask permission if 
they wish to remove their jackets.
<P>
<B>Mr. Graham Allen </B>(Vice-Chamberlain of Her 
Majesty's Household): Is it in order for male Members 
to remove to remove their jackets?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Yes.
<P>

<P>
I am pleased to introduce the first local government Bill 
this Session and that you, Mrs. Roe, are in the Chair; I 
have not had the pleasure of serving under your 
chairmanship. You have been in the House of Commons 
longer than me and you have great experience in its 
procedures. You are supported by those procedures and by 
excellent officials. Our Committees are always conducted 
exceptionally well and hon. Members rely on your 
experience, charm and tact. I look forward to working 
with you.
<P>
I hope that we can move expeditiously through this 
short Bill, while ensuring that we give it proper attention 
and scrutiny. I hope that we can demonstrate that we can 
conduct our business efficiently and effectively.
<P>
Resolved,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>That, if proceedings on the Rating (Valuation) Bill are not 
completed at this day's sitting, the Committee do meet on Thursday 
at Nine o'clock.
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>The Chairman:</B> I remind members of the Committee 
that the Bill carries with it a financial resolution, copies 
of which are available in the Room, and that adequate 
notice of amendments should be given. As a rule, my 
co-Chairman and I do not intend to call starred 
amendments, including any which may be reached during 
an afternoon sitting.

<P>
<B>Mr. Paul Burstow (Sutton and Cheam):</B> I beg to move 
amendment No. 2 page 1, line 16, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`provided that there shall be excepted from any deemed 
reinstatement occurring in the course of the exercise of this 
assumption any want of actual repair to a hereditament arising from 
any peril customarily insured against, Acts of God, civil commotion, 
war or terrorism, or arising from the rebuilding or substantial 
refurbishment thereof'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take 
amendments No. 1, in page 1, line 26, at end add 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(8b) In applying the provisions of sub-paragraphs (1) and (8A) 
above 
{**<p10**}(a) account shall be taken of the age, locality and obsolescence  of a hereditament, and its mode and category of occupation; <P>
(b) it shall be assumed that the actual owner or landlord of a 
hereditament is the hypothetical landlord unless positive 
evidence can be produced to the contrary; and
<P>

uneconomic, account shall be taken of the probable future 
use of the hereditament and of probable changes to the 
hereditament or its locality."	.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>



<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I, too, find it a pleasure to be a member 
of this Committee. As a relatively new Member of the 
House, I find each time that I am privileged to serve on a 
Committee an opportunity to learn more of the 
procedures.
<P>
I want to explain a little of what is behind the 
amendments and ask some questions that go to the heart of 
the issues that the amendments raise. Amendment No. 2 
deals with an issue that I raised on Second Reading. I am 
concerned that the Bill makes no provision for relief for 
ratepayers whose properties have been damaged by acts of 
God, civil commotion, war, terrorism and so on. We believe 
that the amendment corrects the Bill and reinstates a 
provision that previously existed.
<P>
Amendment No. 1 attempts to address a concern that 
has been expressed by a number of organisations 
representing the views of valuers and surveyors. The 
Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, the Rating 
Surveyors Association and the Institute of Revenues, 
Rating and Valuation, which are the three leading expert 
bodies dealing with these issues, are unanimous in their 
view. In their submissions to the Department, they state 
that the Bill is unnecessary because the present law is 
clear. I am grateful for the assistance that I have had in 
dealing with these technical matters, especially from the 
Institute of Revenues, Rating and Valuation.
<P>
<B>Mr. James Gray (North Wiltshire):</B> Will the hon. 
Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I wanted to proceed a little further, but 
I shall give way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for 
giving way, despite his reluctance. he has been inspired 
by the same groups as us the three professional bodies 
to which he referred which is why we added our names 
to his amendments. Does he agree that it is worrying that 
the Government have chosen not to consult those three 
bodies fully even though the profession has made strident 
complaints about the Bill?
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I am anxious at this stage to encourage 
the Government to be positive and to listen to what is said 
in the debate. Although I said on Second Reading that I 
was concerned about the speed with which the Bill was 
proceeding, I hope that the Minister will respond 
positively today and offer a way forward that will meet 
the concerns being expressed by the profession through 
the amendments. I welcome the fact that the Conservative 
Opposition have signed up to the amendments, which 
shows the genuine concern felt outside the House about 
how the Bill has been drafted.
<P>
Amendment No. 1 attempts properly to reflect a 
number of the points contained in the explanatory notes. 
This is one of those occasions when the explanatory notes 
are far longer than the Bill. Explanatory notes 21, 22 and 
24 are not adequately reflected in the Bill, as drafted, and 
the amendment would put that right.
<P>
One of the points raised by the two amendments is that 
both statute and case law are well settled on the issue of 
repair, so it is the Government who are confused, not the 
profession. We want to test the issue a little further, to 
ensue that we are clear about the real impact of the 
Benjamin v. Anston Properties Ltd. case, which is the 
reason why the Bill has been introduced. The Government 
argue that the decision requires every property to be 
valued in its exact physical state on any given day, hence 
the practical difficulties emphasised at great length at the 
end of the Second Reading debate. A simple reading of 
the judgment given in the Lands Tribunal on the Anston 
case puts the matter into a slightly different context. Judge 
Marder said that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"it is to be assumed for the purposes of paragraph 2(1) of schedule 
6 of the Local Government Act 1988 that the hereditament should 
be valued as it physically was on the material day, taking into 
account any disrepair then existing, so far only as such disrepair 
affected the rental value of the hereditament."<P>
</UL></FONT>	
<P>
On any given day, a property will be in some state of 
disrepair, but that does not affect its market rental value. 
In a parliamentary answer that I received today, that point 
is made to explain some of the statistics that were offered 
on Second Reading.



<P>
In the real world, a tenant is under a contractual duty 
to maintain a property, and valuations are made on the 
basis that the property is either in a reasonable state of 
repair or will be so placed by the tenant under the terms 
of the lease. In some circumstances, a property may be 
allowed to fall into disrepair most usually, as in the 
Anston case, if the building has reached the end of its 
economic life and is due to be replaced. However, due to 
the complexities of the property market, there is often a 
significant delay between the building having reached that 
point and its being demolished or substantially 
reconstructed.
<P>
With the introduction of the rating of empty property 
in 1966, valuation officers have become obliged to make 
increasingly unrealistic assumptions about the 
hypothetical use of a building in order to justify a rating 
liability and thus obtain the empty rate payment. That has 
led to several unsatisfactory and inappropriate practices, 
such as soft stripping and constructive vandalism, which 
I am sure all hon. Members deprecate.
<P>
It is clear that Judge Marder's decision in the Anston 
case dealt with exceptional disrepair under the rebus rule. 
He accepted established case law that a property should 
normally be valued as being in a reasonable state of repair 
unless there was a particular circumstance to the contrary, 
as in the Anston case. The Government therefore have no 
ground to argue that that decision implies a daily 
revaluation of every non-domestic hereditament. That is 
clearly not the outcome of the Anston case. Our concern 
is that, in that respect, the Bill does not properly reflect 
the law as everyone understands it.
<P>
I am conscious of the need to make progress, Mrs. Roe, 
but I wish to make one or two further comments. The 
Minister stated that existing case law was incorporated in 
the Local Government Finance Act 1988, but nothing in 
that Act changes the basis of cases such as the Robinson 
Brothers v. Houghton and Chester-le-Street Assessment 
Committee and, more recent and perhaps more 
significantly, Snowman Ltd. v. McLean. In the second of 
those cases, the unusual level of disrepair came to the 
fore, the judge taking the view that the term 
"unreasonable"	 in the legislation was being stretched to 
unreasonable lengths to the advantage of the valuation 
officer.
<P>
It goes to the heart of the amendments that reliance 
has been placed on an important and learned textbook on 
valuation entitled "Ryde on Rating and the Council Tax"	, 
which is regarded as a leading authority on rating law. It 
was used in support of some aspects of the Bill. Although 
"Ryde on Rating"	 is one of the main textbooks on the 
subject, it is clear that the editors were merely giving a 
view, not stating the law. It would not be the first occasion 
on which the courts had held such a proposition to be 
incorrect. It is interesting to note that the counsel for the 
ratepayer in the Anston case was the joint editor of "Ryde 
on Rating"	. It is highly likely that that passage, which is 
generally regarded by the profession to be incorrect, will 
be rewritten.



<P>
The amendments attempt to give the Bill greater clarity. 
They will make clear how the law on valuation should 
work and that the rebus rule should apply but in the 
context of the Anston case, and not as Ministers have 
interpreted the law. That case is about exceptional 
disrepair, not general day-to-day disrepair. The 
amendments should be accepted, because they will give 
confidence and stability to the process of valuation. We 
fear that if it is unamended, the Bill will allow a move 
from consensual valuation to a system that will become 
increasingly adversarial.

<P>

<B>Mr. Simon Burns (West Chelmsford):</B> As we said on 
Second Reading, neither we nor the hon. Member for 
Sutton and Cheam (Mr. Burstow) think that the Bill is a 
matter about which cheap party political points can be 
made; we want to work with the Government to ensure 
that a possible loophole, which has arisen from a court 
decision, is blocked so that the law works as realistically 
and sensibly as possible. It is in that spirit that I speak to 
the amendments, to which we have added our names.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
As we said on Second Reading, the professional bodies 
are greatly concerned about what the Bill is actually 
intended to do. I shall quote what the Rating Surveyors 
Association has said, and we shall listen carefully to the Minister's response. We hope that the Government have 
got the Bill right, despite the doubts that the professional 
bodies express. The RSA has said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"We do not agree with the suggestion in the explanatory note that 
the Bill is restoring the law to a previous position. The substantial 
majority of Rating Valuers have always recognised that where 
properties are to be valued to net annual value"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
 assuming a tenant's repairing liability 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"that valuation will be based on the actual condition of the property 
within the rebus sic stantibus rule."	<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We believe that, in an attempt to block up a loophole that 
could cause problems in future, we should not open up 
the matter to much litigation, argument and dispute.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> Hear, hear.



<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for agreeing 
with that; obviously, she is entering into the spirit of the 
matter.
<P>
What consultations have the Government had with the 
professional bodies? Certainly, those bodies are of the 
opinion that there has been minimal, if any, consultation. 
Given the sheer complexity of the subject, I hope that 
there has been much consultation to try to ensure that the 
Bill will simply rectify a problem that has arisen 
unexpectedly. I hope that the Minister can assure us that 
the Government have not gone off along at a tangent and 
proposed a solution that will be nothing less than a 
disaster because of the problems that the Bill will cause 
those who have to practise and implement the legislation.
<P>
I will not, you will be pleased to know, Mrs. Roe, 
repeat all the arguments made by the hon. Member for 
Sutton and Cheam, because that would simply be 
repetition; we would gain nothing in Committee by 
simply repeating the points that the hon. Gentleman made 
on amendments to which we have added our names. 
However, I shall stress, and we shall listen to the 
Minister's response with great care, that we believe that 
amendments Nos. 2 and 1 would provide greater clarity 
about how the law should work in reality by including in 
the Bill some of the points that appear in the explanatory 
notes. We believe that simply including them in an 
explanatory note will cause not only grave concern but 
great confusion and difficulty when implementing any 
legislation that the House passes.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I am grateful for the way in which 
Opposition Members have moved and spoken to the 
amendment. Clearly, what we have here is a disagreement 
about the interpretation of the law. The Government think 
that it is our responsibility to put on to the statute book a 
law that clearly reflects both the Government's view and 
the way in which the law was operated by the Valuation 
Office before the Anston decision.
<P>
As you will have already gathered, Mrs. Roe, this small 
Bill is technical and detailed, but it has caused much 
concern throughout the profession. I am anxious to 
reassure Opposition Members and the profession that we 
take their worries seriously. It is our responsibility to 
ensure that we make clear our intentions and that the Bill 
reflects them.
<P>
The Bill is technical, but it represents the Government's 
view that the decision taken in 1998 affected the manner in 
which valuations could be made. That is why we considered 
it necessary to introduce proposals early. We have hardly 
been secretive about that or about why we want to change 
the legislation. On 29 July last year, I announced that we 
wanted to introduce such a Bill because the Anston decision 
had left us in some difficulty.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Hayes (South Holland and The Deepings):</B> 
The Minister says that she announced the proposal on
29 July, but, the case that was heard in March created a 
problem for other cases that were held between March 
and July. What are likely to be the implications for the 
cases that were heard during that interregnum? The 
Government, no doubt, were consulting and taking advice 
about such matters from the agencies that were referred 
to earlier?



<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I made it absolutely clear on Second 
Reading that the Bill will be retrospective it will apply 
from 12 March, the day after the Anston decision. 
I outlined in some detail how we would apply the 
retrospection and to whom it would not be applied. I was 
being careful at the time, so I shall not try to repeat what 
I said and get it wrong. I encourage the hon. Gentleman 
to read what I said on Second Reading.
<P>
I accept that it is always a mistake to quote experts, but 
the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam referred to my 
doing so on Second Reading. Of course, the opinion in 
"Ryde on Rating and the Council Tax"	 is that of its editor, 
but it proves that there were, and are, opinions other than 
those of the Valuation Office. Some believe that, since 
1990, all property should be valued on the basis that it is 
in a state of reasonable repair, which, I accept, is 
somewhat at variance with the position outlined in the 
briefing. Naturally, the textbook the expert opinion 
will have to be rewritten in the light of the Anston case 
and the Bill. Yet, the unanimity is not quite as unanimous 
as we have been led to believe and others in the valuation 
profession believe that it was necessary to respond.
<P>
<B>Mr Hayes:</B> Will the Minister give way?
 <P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I am sorry, but I took the hon. 
Gentleman's intervention early, and did not respond to the 
points that the hon. Member for West Chelmsford
(Mr. Burns) made. I am trying to do that now but if the 
hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings 
intervenes again, I shall forget them.
<P>
On 29 July we made an announcement, copies of which 
were sent to the major professional bodies that are active 
in rating. The announcement made clear our intention to 
legislate to reverse the Lands Tribunal decision in 
Benjamin v. Anston Properties and its effect.
<P>
My officials met representatives of the profession to 
discuss the measure and seek their preliminary views on 
the day when the Bill was laid before Parliament. The Bill 
is highly technical and, therefore, we had to work out the 
technicalities before full consultation took place. We did 
not consult about principles they were established by the 
Anston decision and our determination to respond to 
Lands Tribunal decision. The Bill is a technical measure 
that implements those principles.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> Will the Minister confirm that the 
consultation period since the Bill was laid before 
Parliament in November has been brief, and that during that 
short period the three bodies that represent the profession 
have expressed the unanimous view that the measure does 
not return the law to its position before the Anston case but 
that it moves the law, and thus potentially extends the rate 
base, among other implications?
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I think that I have already dealt with 
that point. I accept that that was the view of the three 
organisations. We have examined the Bill, and I shall say 
more in response to the amendments that the hon. 
Gentleman tabled. However, I am currently responding to 
his speech.
<P>
It is in the nature of consultation that participants 
sometimes agree and sometimes do not. I am responsible 
for making clear the basis for our disagreement with the 
representations that were made during consultation, and 
with the hon. Gentleman's representations, which are 
based on information from the professions.



<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> Will the Minister tell us, in simple 
language, why she believes that the three major 
professional bodies are wrong and the Department is 
right? In the light of the profession's fixed view that the 
measure will not achieve its aims, why has she not met its 
representatives face to face to try to thrash out the matter?
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I have made clear on several occasions 
the Government's reasons for disagreeing with the three 
organisations. I am not qualified to explain how valuers 
interpreted the Local Government Finance Act 1988, but 
the issues are not as clear-cut as some people claim. The 
Valuation Office, which is in charge of valuations, and 
was responsible for all past valuations, has a different 
view from that of the profession. It would be perverse for 
a Minister to claim that the Government did not believe 
their own agency's account of the terms on which it 
carried out valuations.
<P>
I have considered the matter carefully, but one has to 
make a decision. The Government's decision led to the 
Bill. I hope that Opposition Members do not believe that 
that is perverse, or a sign of wanting to introduce 
unnecessary legislation. We firmly believe that the Bill is 
necessary, for the reasons that I gave on Second Reading. 
I should have liked to have used parliamentary time for 
many other things, but we believe that the law on this 
matter is unclear as it stands. It is our responsibility to 
make the law clear because a valuation of non-domestic 
property for implementation next year is currently being 
undertaken.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
It is our responsibility to ensure that the point of 
disagreement is cleared up as early as possible. That is 
why we introduced the Bill. If Opposition Members will 
allow me, I shall now speak to the amendments, starting 
with amendment No. 1 and moving on to amendment 
No. 2.
<P>
Amendment No. 1 goes to the heart of the Bill and 
what we are seeking to achieve through it. As hon. 
Members have said the Bill will require valuation officers 
to assume that a hereditament being valued for rates is in 
a state of reasonable repair. It will further require that in 
deciding the reasonable repair condition of property, a 
valuer will have to ignore repair that a reasonable landlord 
would consider uneconomic. That is not a difficult 
concept. Indeed, it is one with which valuers are already 
familiar, as the Bill merely codifies what was required in 
so-called gross value cases before 1990 and what 
valuation officers have been doing in all cases since then. 
Case law going back to before 1990 and the practice 
established as a result mean that the reasonable repair 
condition of hereditament depends on the age and type of 
the property, the locality in which it is situated and all 
surrounding circumstances. That follows, necessarily, 
from the basic principle that matters relating to the 
hereditament are to be taken as they stand. In the case of 
Saunders v. Maltby, for example, in which it was 
established that non-economic repairs could be 
disregarded in valuation, the paramount question was 
what a reasonable landlord could be expected to do, 
having regard to the value of the property. It was implicit 
that the age of the property and its locality were highly 
relevant to applying that economic test of what was 
reasonable in the circumstances.



<P>
For example, some hon. Members will be familiar with 
my Department's former main building at 2 Marsham 
street. Indeed, I suspect that one Opposition Member 
spent many a long and happy hour there. I do not suggest 
that we discuss whether his occupation of Marsham street 
towers had anything to do with whether that building was 
in a reasonable state of repair. However, in applying the 
Bill's provisions in the current revaluation, valuation 
officers would assume not that 2 Marsham street was 
repaired to a high standard, but rather that it was repaired 
to a standard appropriate to a 1960s office block nearing 
the end of its useful life in that location. They might 
assume, for instance in defiance of the facts that the 
cladding of the building had been repaired so that large 
chunks of concrete no longer fell to the streets below, but 
they would not assume that the building was repaired to 
the standard of a brand new office block. In contrast, 
valuation officers would take a different view of the 
reasonable state of repair that they could expect from the 
Department's new headquarters at Eland house, and 
would act accordingly.
<P>
The first limb of the amendment states existing law, 
and, indeed, follows necessarily from the concept of rebus 
sic stantibus, to which we are discussing a limited 
exception. The clarificatory amendment that hon. Member 
for Sutton and Cheam seeks is therefore unnecessary.

<P>

<B>Mr. Gray:</B> I assure the Minister that my presence in
2 Marsham street had nothing to do with cladding falling 
off. I much preferred sitting in there looking out up from 
my flat at the building now I share the latter experience 
with the Government Whip, the hon Member for 
Nottingham, North (Mr. Allen). I hope that the 
Department will quickly remove the obstacles, so that we 
can have a finer view than we have at present.
<P>
The Minister's point is reasonable, but surely she is 
relying on the explanation of "a reasonable condition"	 
contained in the explanatory notes to the Bill, which, as 
many judges have made plain on many occasions, do not 
form part of legislation? The amendment would write that 
definition of reasonableness into the Bill, rather than leave 
it in the explanatory notes.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I myself raised this issue. The problem 
is that if we redefine reasonableness in the Bill, we may 
create problems. In a sense, that is what happened to put 
us where we are. The 1996 Act redefined the 1988 Act 
and we ended up with a different interpretation, when 
everybody had thought that it would remain the same. The 
courts have understood reasonableness in a certain way, 
and we do not want to disturb that. That is precisely why 
we do not want to include what may appear to all of us 
today an adequate definition of reasonableness, but in 
exceptional circumstances may not be sufficient. We do 
not want to disturb what has so far been accepted by the 
law.



<P>
<B>Mr. David Borrow (South Ribble):</B> May I seek 
clarification from my hon. Friend the Minister? Is she 
saying that the case law built up over many years on 
reasonableness of repair in relation to valuation for gross 
value will apply in future to rateable value rather than 
gross value of properties? Will that history apply? If so, I 
see the merits of my hon. Friend's argument that we 
should not include in statute or regulation a detailed 
definition of reasonableness when many years of case law 
exist, which give a better feel for reasonableness than a 
definition in legislation.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> Mrs. Roe, you will realise why there 
is a frisson in the Committee it is because my hon. 
Friend is a valuation officer. He is a surveyor and knows 
all about these things. My hon. Friend is right in his 
assumption, and I can tell the hon. Member for North 
Wiltshire (Mr. Gray) that the explanatory note relies on 
case law. We have not made up the wording of the 
explanatory notes for the Bill; they are constructed and 
rely on existing case law.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hayes:</B> If the wording was good enough to include 
in the explanatory notes, it could be argued that it was 
good enough to include in the Bill. Notwithstanding the 
wealth of case law to which reference has already been 
made, the Bill is bound to stimulate further litigation, as 
people with a proper interest in the matter seek to test it 
in the courts. If we do not define reasonableness, it is 
inevitable that people will seek a definition elsewhere.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I reject that 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hayes:</B> Why?
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B>  because it . I am not having a 
debate with the hon. Gentleman, Mrs. Roe, I was about 
to say "because"	 before he asked, "Why?"	 I reject that 
argument because it assumes that case law cannot be built 
on. Case law establishes reasonableness in a number of 
different circumstances, and confining it in the Bill would 
not allow the definition to develop. That would be to 
restrict the law, rather than to enable the law to work in 
a practical way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> This issue has puzzled many in the 
profession. If the law was as the Government say, why did 
neither the Government nor the Valuation Office agency 
pursue the Anston case through the courts to the next 
stage? If the law was as the Government say, why did 
they not seek to take the case further in the courts?
<P>
The Minister said that the Bill builds on case law. Why 
not use the courts to do that, instead of using a blunt 
instrument of legislation? The Bill is clearly constraining, 
and we do not seem able to amend it in a way that either 
the Valuation Office or the Government would deem to 
be satisfactory.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> The Valuation Office lodged an appeal 
against the decision of the Lands Tribunal. The 
Government considered the matter, and concluded that it 
should properly be the subject of legislation, to clarify and 
codify the law. The Bill seeks to achieve that. Having seen 
the Bill, the Valuation Office has withdrawn its appeal 
to the Court of Appeal. I hope that that answer clarifies 
the matter.
<P>
<B>Several hon. Members rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I wish to get on with the debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> During the case and on Second Reading, 
it was argued that the decision reached could open a 
floodgate that would allow many opportunities for people 
on the 1990 and 1995 rating lists to appeal. No evidence 
supports the contention that people are pouring through 
opened floodgates to use the appeals. Today, I received a 
written answer informing me that 135,000 appeals have 
been made since 1 April. I understand that that figure is 
not subsantially different from those for previous years. 
Does the Minister believe that it is substantially different? 
If it is, by how much is it different? If the number of 
appeals has not significantly increased, why have the 
Government rushed to legislate? Why not let the judicial 
process take its course through the appeal mechanism?



<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> That always has to be a matter of 
judgment. The Government have to make decisions that 
is why the Bill is before the Committee. The hon. 
Gentleman said that the Bill is an overreaction because 
the number of cases has not increased. The truth is that 
we do not know that; there is no basis for judging the Bill 
to be an overreaction. We do not know how many 
proposals would seek to rely on the Lands Tribunal 
decision and on valuation tribunal hearings. We do not 
know how many ratepayers were dissuaded by the 
Government's announcement on 29 July, when we made 
clear our intention to legislate to reverse the Anston 
Properties judgment.
<P>
If the Government were proposing major legislation 
that sought to make fundamental change, I could 
understand the hon. Gentleman's anxiety. The Bill is not 
major legislation, however, because it merely seeks to 
clarify a small part of the law on valuations of 
non-domestic property. It is important that we act to avoid 
more litigation. The Bill is more likely to achieve that 
than leaving the matter without legislation.
<P>
The second limb of amendment No. 1, proposed 
subsection (8B) (b), would require that in assessing a 
rateable value, the valuation officer should assume
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"that the actual owner or landlord of a hereditament is the 
hypothetical landlord unless positive evidence can be produced to 
the contrary".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The rateable value of a hereditament is a notional 
annual rental value attributed to a property on the basis of 
certain assumptions. One of those assumptions, as I have 
made clear, is that, other than in extreme cases, the 
property is in a state of reasonable repair.
<P>
Valuation officers have made their valuations on that 
basis since the introduction of the present system in 1990 
and before that. The valuer is required to determine the 
annual amount of rent that the property would attract for 
a tenancy from year to year if it were vacant and available 
for letting on the open market. The tenancy is notional or 
hypothetical and is not based on the characteristics of the 
landlord or tenant even if there is a landlord and a 
tenant or on the terms of any tenancy to which the 
property may be subject. That ensures that property is 
valued on a common basis and allows the burden of 
non-domestic rates to be shared fairly and equitably 
between different ratepayers rather than on the basis of 
individual property deals, which depend, in part at least, 
on the negotiating skills of the parties involved.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
The first limb of the amendment would effectively 
overturn the hypothetical basis on which rating valuations 
have historically been made. The hon. Gentleman sought 
to argue that the intention of proposed sub-paragraph (b) 
is to have the circumstances of the tenancy recognised in 
so far as the property's condition is concerned. That 
would be objectionable enough in itself, as it would assert 
the primacy of the rebus sic stantibus rule, which the Bill 
seeks to overturn in the limited circumstances of repair.
<P>
As I explained on Second Reading, the Valuation 
Office has since 1990 carried out valuations on the 
assumption of a state of common repair and, despite what 
some professional bodies maintain to the contrary, the 
Government believe that that is the right way to value 
property.



<P>
<B>Mr. Borrow:</B> I should like to pick up that point, 
although perhaps I should have declared my interest 
earlier.
<P>
I have been a member of the Institute of Revenues 
Rating and Valuation for about 20 years and I spent that 
time dealing with rating valuations. Valuations were 
carried out on the basis of a reasonable state of repair, 
under the gross value definition of the General Rate Act 
1967, and under the 1988 Act. I dealt with many 
thousands of appeals against rateable values, but I saw no 
change in the assumption of a reasonable state of repair.
<P>
I therefore find it difficult to agree that the 1988 Act 
has, in practice, made any difference to the way in which 
the state of repair has been dealt with by valuation 
officers, or the way in which it has been argued by private 
practice valuers. The Anston Properties ruling, on the 
other hand, gives a different definition of how the 1988 
Act should be interpreted and thus provides the reason for 
this Bill.
<P>
<B></B><P>
Ms Armstrong: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for 
bringing his expertise to the Committee. I was explaining 
how valuation officers have carried out their function 
since 1990. I am sure that my hon. Friend is right in 
saying that their methods replicated or followed on from 
what was normal practice before the 1988 Act.
<P>
The Government believe that that is the right way to 
value properties. The Bill makes that belief absolutely 
clear, which is another good reason for introducing it. It 
will ensure that ratepayers are treated fairly, while 
avoiding the severe administrative and practical 
difficulties that would result from valuing properties in 
their actual repair condition. I repeat that we could not 
accept the amendment, even if it did only what is claimed 
for it.
<P>
Having served as an Opposition Member, I know about 
tabling amendments, only for the Government to say that 
they are going to do something else, so I apologise for 
saying that the amendment as drafted would go much 
further than Opposition Members claim. By requiring a 
valuer to assume that the hypothetical and actual landlords 
were one and the same, the amendment would 
fundamentally undermine the rating hypothesis and allow 
rateable values to be determined on the basis of individual 
property deals, rather than on the common basis that 
fairness dictates.
<P>
For example, the amendment would mean that where a 
landlord and tenant negotiated a rent that was lower than 
general market levels, that rent, rather than a hypothetical 
rent, would be used as the basis of the rateable value. If 
we are to secure the objectivity necessary to achieve 
fairness, it is simply not possible to take into account the 
individual circumstances, financial or otherwise, of a 
landlord or tenant.
<P>
The second limb of the amendment would effectively 
wreck the Bill by requiring property to be valued in its 
actual repair condition. It is a back-door attempt to 
circumvent the intention of the Bill and it would, at best, 
take us back to the point that we had reached when the 
Lands Tribunal gave its decision in Benjamin v. Anston 
Properties Ltd. Perhaps unintentionally, its effects would 
go further and fatally undermine the integrity of the rating 
system as well as that of the Bill.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Hayes:</B> Given that the Minister has made that case 
against the amendment, how does she suggest that rating 
valuations will differentiate between improvement, 
renewal and repair when the Bill has become law?
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> It will be done in precisely the same 
way as it always has been. The Government want to 
ensure that that is what will happen.



<P>
The third limb of the amendment, sub-paragraph (c), 
would provide that in considering whether a repair is 
economic, account should be taken of the probable future 
use of the hereditament and probable changes to that 
hereditament and its locality. As such, it seeks to 
encompass three distinct, but related, concepts: the 
owner's future intention as to the use of the hereditament; 
any external factors affecting the future use of the 
hereditament; and any future circumstances in the area 
surrounding the hereditament that might affect its value. 
To some extent, those concepts are covered by the second 
limb of the amendment. The amendment is, therefore 
objectionable for the reasons that I have just explained. 
The concepts are also, to some extent, already enshrined 
in rebus and in the case law that historically underpins 
rating valuation. In the 1969 case of Dawkins v. Ash, Lord 
Pearson acknowledged that rebus could encompass, in 
his words:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"a present probability of a future happening"	.
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is therefore unnecessary to try to embrace the same 
sentiment through the amendment.
<P>
The third limb of the amendment goes further than that 
and risks creating considerable uncertainty about the basis 
of rating valuation. Indeed, it may undermine the principle 
that future events are disregarded except in so far as they 
inevitably derive from the physical circumstances 
surrounding the hereditament. In Dawkins v. Ash, Lord 
Wilberforce said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"It would seem clear that any occupier would take into account 
not only any immediately actual defects or disadvantages (such as 
planning restrictions) but disadvantages or advantages, which he can 
see coming. If the actual presence of a motorway close to the 
property depreciates it, or adds to its value, surely he must take 
account of a motorway whose irresistible progress will bring it 
alongside in six months"	.
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
However, not all future possibilities are allowable only 
those that are intrinsic to the hereditament. As Lord 
Pearce said in the same case:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"They are excluded in so far as they are accidental to the letting 
of a hereditament. They are acknowledged in so far as they are 
essential to the hereditament itself. It is, for example, essential to 
the hereditament that it is close to the sea and that humans will pay 
more highly for a house close to the sea. One can therefore take that 
into account in the hypothetical letting. It is however accidental to 
the house that its owner was shrewd or that the rich man happened 
to want it and that therefore the rent being paid is extremely high. 
In the same way I think it would be accidental to the hereditament 
that its owner intended to pull it down in the near future. For the 
hereditament might have had a different owner who would not pull 
it down. So the actual owner's intentions are thus immaterial since 
it is the hypothetical owner that is being considered."	
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Gray:</B> I am puzzled by the Minister's use of case 
law that predates the 1988 Act and the Anston case. 
Surely the whole thrust of the Lands Tribunal finding in 
the Anston case was that because it is no longer the 
landlord but the tenant who is responsible for repairs, case 
law from before 1988 no longer applies. Surely one of the 
principles behind the Bill is that because case law 
pre-1990 no longer applies, the Minister has thought it 
necessary to put it on the statute book. I have a slight 
problem as to how she knew the case law that existed 
previously in order to justify what she is doing.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> We come to the heart of the matter. 
The view is that the 1988 Act and, indeed, the General 
Rate Act 1967 built on previous experience, and did not 
change the terms of valuation, although there was a 
change from landlord to tenant. It was on that issue that 
there was a ruling in the Anston case; that was, in a sense, 
where the ruling came from.
<P>
The rating system has much relevant case law. Case 
law goes back to the 19th century, and even before then. 
The nature of the valuation the way in which it is made 
in terms of the repair of the property and the 
reasonableness of that repair was not changed by the 
1988 or the 1966 Acts. Therefore, the preceding case law 
in pertinent.<P>




<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> I claim no expertise in this matter or in the 
law indeed, I have an astonishing degree of ignorance 
when it comes to either but I have relied for my 
information upon no less a source than the Library's 
briefing for the Bill. It says quite plainly:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"In Benjamin v Anston Properties Ltd the Lands Tribunal held 
that the previous case law only applied to cases where the landlord 
was assumed to be responsible for repairs. Therefore it did not apply 
to the post-1990 system (ie. the uniform business rate) at all."	
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Either my former colleagues at the Department of the 
Environment are right, or the Library is. Perhaps the 
Minister will look into that before Report.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I certainly will. I think that part of the 
problem is that the hon. Gentleman is trying to take the 
Anston judgment and therefore the Bill beyond what 
they are concerned with. I shall certainly look at the 
matter again and come back to him.
<P>
If the third limb of the amendment were accepted, it 
would inevitably lead to more litigation. Its effect would 
be uncertain it would be debated whether it was 
attempting to change the law or not. It might ultimately 
be established that it had made no difference, or it might 
be held to have undermined the principles set out by the 
House of Lords in Dawkins.
<P>
In conclusion, therefore, each of the three limbs of the 
amendment is unnecessary or undesirable, and I hope that 
the hon. Gentleman will be persuaded to withdraw the 
amendment. If not, I will urge the Committee to join me 
in rejecting it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> Will the Minister take away from 
today's discussions the points that have been made so far 
and reflect on them? There remains great concern among 
members of the Committee and those outside this place 
about the way in which the clause, as drafted, will operate. 
I hope that the Minister will consult further with her 
officials and listen further to those in the profession and 
see whether there is some way in which the Government 
might be able to add some words to the Bill that address 
our concern in a way that they find acceptable.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> The hon. Gentleman might wish that 
he had waited until I had finished dealing with 
amendment No. 2 before making his comment. I hope that 
members of the Committee recognise that I always try to 
listen to and reflect on issues raised in debate.
<P>
Amendment No. 2 reflects the concern of some 
members of the Committee that any lack of repair arising, 
for example, from accidental damage, should be reflected 
in the valuation until that damage is repaired. The current 
position is that if a property is incapable of beneficial 
occupation, it will be removed from the rating list and no 
rates will be payable until it has been repaired. That is 
clear. However, if, for example, a fire reduced the extent 
to which the property could be used, I understand that, 
rather than sterilising it completely, the practice of 
valuation officers has been temporarily to reduce the 
rateable value for the period during which the property is 
being reinstated.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
I recognise the anxiety that the Bill may affect the 
ability to do that, but I cannot accept the amendment as 
drafted I heard that so many times when we were in 
opposition because it would not do what hon. Members 
intend it to do. However, I shall consider whether the 
underlying anxiety is justified and, if necessary, will 
introduce an amendment at a later stage.
<P>
I assure the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam that I 
shall consider what has been said today and on Second 
Reading and will consult on the matter to see whether the 
clause leaves open the possibility suggested by the hon. 
Gentleman. If it does, I shall table an amendment on 
Report. With that assurance, I hope that the hon. 
Gentleman will withdraw his amendment.



<P>
<B>Mrs. Caroline Spelman (Meriden):</B> I take a little 
encouragement from what the Minister said on 
amendment No. 1 and I urge her to allow as much time 
as possible for an active process of consultation. I did not 
take part in the debate on Second Reading. However, 
since Second Reading there has been an active process of 
consultation between the Opposition and the profession. I 
am disquieted to find that the Committee is considering a 
Bill that does not seem to have the confidence of the 
major professional organisations representing the people 
for whom I thought we were trying to legislate. I have 
read the report of the Second Reading debate and as I read 
the explanatory notes, the impression conveyed to me as 
a non-lawyer was that the purpose of the Bill was to 
simplify life for the valuers and to clarify the law. It seems 
from the information that we have received from the 
professional organisations that they have no confidence in 
the Bill. As lay person, I am left with the fundamental 
impression that we are moving away from what the 
Minister described as the real world to an increasing 
amount of hypothetical decision-making.
<P>
As a Conservative, I want the market to be allowed to 
express itself. If two identical hereditaments I had 
difficulty understanding the term and had to look it up 
next to each other were in different states of repair, the 
true market position would be a differential price, or rent, 
and rates for the two properties. I remain surprised that 
that Minister is so emphatic in rejecting the spirit of the 
amendments, which were inspired by the professional 
bodies that will have to work with the new legislation. I 
urge her again to consult actively with those professional 
bodies to ensure that we do not jump out of the frying 
pan into the fire. It has been made very clear to us that 
the professional bodies anticipate increased litigation 
resulting from the Bill. Far from clarifying matters, the 
profession is warning us that the position will remain 
unclear.
<P>
The Minister says that the Bill seeks to achieve fairness 
and consistency. However, I remain unconvinced that it 
will achieve more fairness. It is unfair to have identical 
properties in differing states of repair valued theoretically 
equal for the purpose of rates for the convenience of the 
rating profession is unfair.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Hayes:</B> I wish to affirm a couple of points that 
have been mentioned during our proceedings. Given that 
the Minister said generously that the Government were 
still considering the Bill with a view to improving its 
drafting and making it more practical, I emphasise that 
the definition of catastrophic damage must be written into 
the Bill, and so drafted as a result of proper consultation. 
The Minister looks puzzled but, frankly, no one apart 
from her feels that there has been adequate consultation 
and, by that, I mean all the professional bodies and so on.
<P>
The Minister talked about a lack of unanimity but, 
given the information that has been received by members 
of the Committee, there has, indeed, been unanimity 
unanimity in criticism. I am trying to be typically 
generous in my remarks but, if the hon. Lady wants to 
have a more robust debate about the matter, so be it. The 
definition of catastrophic damage should be written into 
the Bill and drafted on the basis of proper consultation 
with the relevant bodies.
<P>
I accept that such a change in the Bill would be fairly 
substantial, but I would welcome it. I hope that the 
Minister will re-examine the need to give some context at 
least to what is reasonable. I reject the notion that the Bill 
is likely to stop litigation; in fact, it is likely to stimulate 
it. That is the view of professional bodies. They claim that 
failure to define such detail in the Bill will stimulate the 
testing of such matters in the courts.



<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that the 
Minister's reluctance to include the definition of 
reasonableness in the Bill can be explained partially? As 
we have discovered, she is advised by her colleagues in 
the Department that pre-1988 case law may be used when 
considering such matters, whereas the advice from the 
House of Commons Library, as well as from professional 
bodies, is that such case law may not be used in such 
considerations. If case law does apply, the issue of 
reasonableness will be well known because judgments 
have been made. However, if the professional bodies and 
the House of Commons Library are right in thinking that 
case law does not apply, it is essential that the word 
"reasonableness"	 be defined properly in the legislation 
and not merely in the explanatory notes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hayes:</B> My hon. Friend makes a telling and 
valuable point. Obviously, he has spent a good deal of 
time in the Library; he is virtually resident there. His 
argument is that, because historical case law does not 
apply, the litigation that I described will be necessary to 
build up a body of relevant and applicable case law. 
Litigation will be an inevitable consequence of a failure 
to give any context or definition of reasonableness.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Meriden (Mrs. Spalman) 
was generous in saying that the motivation for the Bill was 
to make matters more simple for valuers and others. Is not, 
however, the real motivation behind it the need to stem a 
leakage in tax yield? Clearly, the Government thought that 
there would be leakage after July. Everyone has been 
terribly polite by not mentioning it, but now it is time that 
it was said. The motivation behind the Bill is the potential 
leakage in tax yield. That is the reason for the speed at 
which the Government have dealt with it, their failure to 
consult properly and their apparent unwillingness to give 
such matters a full and proper airing. Is that not the case 
and, if so, would it not be more honest of the Minster to say 
so? The Government may have a reasonable case to make; 
they may be strapped for cash. The implications of the 
Anston case may have been sensibly projected and that may 
be the motivation for the legislation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> The debate seems to have further 
confirmed the fact that legislating in this area is leading 
the Government into deep and technical waters. There is 
conflicting advice, conflicting case law and a growing 
concern that although the Government are listening to 
some of the points that have been made, they do not fully 
recognise that the Bill will not reinstate the law as it was 
but will change it. I believe having examined the matter 
and discussed it with professionals outside the House 
that the Bill would have a serious effect on small 
businesses in some of the more tertiary locations. The 
more marginal shopping centres and businesses that are 
already experiencing difficulties may suddenly, by dint of 
the legislation, be subject to disadvantageous new 
valuations.
<P>
The Bill, does not deal with a partisan matter and it is 
important to try and reach agreement. The Minister is 
making a gesture that suggests that she does not agree that 
the Bill does not deal with a partisan matter. We are trying 
to address it in a non-partisan way and I am anxious to 
proceed on that basis.



<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> Absolutely.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> It is right that hon. Members should 
make points strongly, but we should try to foster an 
atmosphere in which legitimate concerns, which have 
been drawn to the attention of all members of the 
Committee, can be expressed. That is why the Minister's 
comments about acts of God in regard to amendment
No. 2 are helpful and welcome. I hope that she will ensure 
that as the matter proceeds, there is dialogue between her 
officials and the various organisations that represent the 
profession so that we have an amendment that is as good 
as it can be and which is comprehensible to hon. Members 
of all parties.
<P>
Amendment No. 1, to which the Minister devoted most 
of her comments, goes to the heart of the matter. It is 
important that the Government continue to consider the 
issues that we have brought before the Committee today. 
My reading of the Anston case and that of many people 
who have been involved in the profession for many years, 
whose view is probably more important is that it dealt 
with exceptional disrepair. For that reason, and because 
the judgment was that the Valuation Office extended the 
term "reasonable"	 to unreasonable lengths, it seems 
strange that the Government are so keen to pursue 
legislation that would deny to businesses the protection 
that should be afforded them. The Bill appears to be 
working against the market; it would therefore have 
serious effects on the interests of business and could lead, 
in the view of many outside the House, to increased 
litigation.
<P>
The Minister said earlier that the Government did not 
know how that was to work.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> No, I did not.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I shall read the debate in Hansard; for 
the moment, I shall withdraw that comment.
<P>
The Minister said that there were concerns about the 
number of appeals, and questions have been asked about 
that. The evidence from the figures is that there has not 
been a substantial number of additional appeals. The Bill 
could further restrict the basis on which legitimate appeals 
can take place in the future, so it is not simply about 
putting the law back to where everyone thought it was. 
For that reason, I shall be seeking leave of the Committee 
to withdraw amendment No. 2, dealing with acts of God, 
but it would be appropriate to divide on amendment No. 1.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
I am anxious about the matter because I have listened 
carefully to the Minister and believe that there are some 
concerns about the drafting of the Bill. I should like to 
think that on Report, there might still be scope to find 
words that would prevent us from tabling an amendment 
that the Minister says is not perfect. I am thinking about 
this as I speak, as you can probably gather, Mrs. Roe, but 
I am anxious to ensure that there is still an opportunity on 
Report to deliberate further. I should welcome guidance, 
but I understand that if I do not press the amendment 
today, we can return to it later, whereas if I press it today, 
we can not return to it later.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The hon. Gentleman is not necessarily 
correct about that. He can press the amendment today, 
and again on Report.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> As I said at the start of today's sitting, 
these Committees give me an opportunity to learn 
procedure, which is very helpful. On that basis, I shall 
press amendment No. 1 to a Division in due course.



<P>
<B>Mr. Borrow:</B> It has been an interesting discussion and 
I have tried to clear my mind as to the thought processes 
that have led to some of the comments. With regard to 
properties valued at rateable value, the Anston case 
disregarded previous case law on the matter of reasonable 
state of repair. In certain circumstances, it was reasonable 
not to assume reasonable state of repair because it was 
uneconomic to do so. By disregarding that chunk of case 
law, the Anston case was saying that the basis on which 
the profession had generally assumed that valuations were 
done the assumption of a reasonable state of repair did 
not apply to properties valued at gross value.
<P>
We must examine how that redefinition of the law 
applies to the rating hypothesis. Properties are valued on 
a certain hypothesis that assumes a tenancy for so long, a 
relationship between landlord and tenant and a reasonable 
state of repair. The rents paid for a group of properties 
were than compared with each other to reach a level that 
was considered to be the going rate for, say, a parade of 
shops in a particular locality. The assumption was that the 
parade of shops were in a similar and reasonable state of 
repair. If we move away from that by either not redefining 
the law through legislation 
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> The hon. Gentleman says that the issue 
is about reasonableness. But, surely the point is that the 
Anston Properties case was about taking reasonableness 
to unreasonable lengths. The Bill is not about getting rid 
of the reasonable terms but about making sure that they 
are preserved.
<P>
<B>Mr. Borrow:</B> I disagree with the hon. Gentleman. In 
the Anston Properties case, the judgment states that the 
previous cases that dealt with a reasonable state of repair 
did not apply when considering properties valued at 
rateable value because those cases dealt with properties 
valued at gross value. That distinction was made. We 
could argue about whether the valuation officer in the 
Anston Properties case was reasonable or correct to 
assume that the disrepair was not economic. Both parties 
agreed that a reasonable rent for the property in a good 
state of repair was 272,000. However, in its current state 
of repair, it was assumed to be worth 17,000, in rental 
income and it was estimated that it would cost 300,000 
to put it in a good state of repair. many landlords would 
view spending 300,000 to get a rent of 272,000 a year 
rather than 17,000 a year as a good investment as the 
capital invested would be recouped in less than two years. 
Therefore, are such repairs uneconomic? However, I do 
not want to argue about that because it is not the thrust of 
the Anston case.
<P>
In the Anston case, it was claimed that we should not 
assume a reasonable state of repair, because gross value 
was used in respect of properties in a reasonable state of 
repair, and that did not apply to the Anston case. If we 
allow that decision to stand, we may reach a position that 
some Opposition Members, and some representatives of 
professional bodies, support. They believe that each 
hereditament should be valued more on its state of repair. 
Thus there would be differences between the value of 
each property on the rating list that were based on state 
of repair. As the rating list applies for five years, appeals 
might be made every year as the properties' state of 
repair fluctuated.
<P>
The proposal could lead to arguments because the only 
measure that can reflect the effect of poor state of repair 
on a hereditament is the rent. Already, a multiplicity of 
rents are defined by a range of criteria. it would be almost 
impossible to consider a single property for which a 
certain rent is passing, and to try to decide how much to 
allow for its state of repair when compared with the 
next-door property, which is valued under a different lease 
and on a different basis.



<P>
Before 1988, most non-domestic properties were valued 
at gross value. Only industrial properties were valued at 
annual value, which became rateable value. Most properties 
have been valued at a rate that assumes a reasonable state of 
repair. Case law evolved because of the problems of taking 
account of each property's state of repair. An amendment 
had to be made to the principle of rebus sic stantibus to 
bring some order to the system. The Valuation Office and 
the profession accepted that as the basis for valuations.

<B></B><P>
Mr. Hayes: The hon. Gentleman makes a sound case; 
it is clear that he speaks with considerable authority. 
However, does he acknowledge that, as the professional 
bodies suggest, valuers have always taken the actual state 
of a property into account? There has always been great 
flexibility in practice.
<P>
<B>Mr. Borrow:</B> When valuations are made, it is accepted 
that the reasonable state of repair will vary in respect of 
certain properties in a specific locality, and in a particular 
market. Before May 1997, I was a professional on 
Merseyside, where there were large Victorian warehouses. 
Given the low demand in that area for such properties, a 
reasonable state of repair for those warehouses would be 
different from the reasonable state of repair for a modern 
office block on Canary wharf.
<P>
The market always understood that reasonable state of 
repair would reflect the locality and class of property, its 
age, and the demand for such properties. That was 
reflected in case law and valuations took account of it. For 
the first time, a definition of "reasonable state of repair"	 is 
being put into legislation. The Bill will also provide for a 
valuation to be amended or reduced to effect uneconomic 
repairs. That has always been so under case law; it has 
now been placed in legislation. However, we must be sure 
that further litigation is conducted in the context of that 
case law.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> With her customary courtesy, the Minister 
has been extremely reasonable in her defence of what, to 
my mind, is a fairly indefensible position. More attention 
should have been paid to the professional bodies. I and 
the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam fear that the Bill, 
rather than solving a problem, will open up a Pandora's 
Box and produce far more litigation.
<P>
I accept that the Minister genuinely believes that that 
is not the case and that she does not seek to create such a 
situation. However, notwithstanding her defence of the 
Bill and her explanation of why the amendments are not 
acceptable, that will be the end result if the Bill is not 
amended at some point during its passage through the 
House or the other place.
<P>
For that reason, and given that amendments Nos. 2 and 
1 were tabled not only by the hon. Members for Sutton 
and Cheam and for Weston-super-Mare (Mr. Cotter) but 
by me and my hon. Friend the Member for Meriden, we 
shall press both amendments to a Division. It should be 
on record that we believe that the Government are wrong, 
not because they will not accept the amendments word for 
word of course, we do not have access to parliamentary 
draftsmen but because they will not accept the principle 
behind them. Both opposition parties genuinely believe 
that the amendments will improve the Bill, not denigrate 
it.

<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 3, in page 
1, line 20, at end insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(2A) In paragraph 2(6A) after the word "State"	 there shall be 
inserted "provided that such regulations shall not limit the material 
day to a day prescribed by sub paragraph (4) or (5) or by order by 
the Secretary of State under the provisions of sub paragraph 
(3)(b)."	.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I shall be briefer in speaking to this amendment than I 
was in speaking to the first two, as some of the issues that 
it raises were covered in that debate.
<P>
The amendment is designed to prevent the use of the 
antecedent value date or the date of the list's compilation, 
and to preserve the valuation officer's and the ratepayer's 
rights to consider using another date as part of the process. 
It is designed to allow the Government to continue to use 
the regulation-making powers that they enjoy under 
previous legislation, but to prevent the moving of the 
goalposts that the Bill encourages.
<P>
Like the two previous amendments, amendment No. 3 
is designed to secure the goalposts where everyone 
thought that they were. I hope that the Minister can assure 
us about how the clause will operate in practice, as 
members of the valuation profession are extremely 
anxious about the Bill's implications if it were to pass 
unamended.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> I, too, shall be extremely brief, because 
although the amendment is important, it can be dealt 
with shortly.
<P>
As the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam said that 
is one of the problems of following another hon. Member 
rather than leading the amendment is designed to 
prevent the goalposts from moving and to keep them 
where they are, where everyone can see where they are, 
so that no problems, doubt or confusion arise.
<P>
The amendment takes us back to a developing theme 
in the Committee: consultation. The more that the 
Committee progresses, the more anxious I become about 
consultation with professional bodies. They are the 
experts. I fully accept that experts are not always correct, 
but, however simplistic the amendment may seem. the 
aspect of the Bill with which it deals is horrendously 
complex, and, on reflection, it would have been wise for 
the Government to have spent more time consulting and 
listening to the experts.
<P>
When did the consultation to which the Minister 
alluded take place? How long was the meeting? Was it a 
stand-alone meeting of professional bodies to discuss the 
Bill and its problems, or was it a tag-on to another 
meeting that took place at the tail-end of a meeting en 
passant?
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I shall not rise to the hon. Gentleman's 
last point; perhaps he was referring to how the previous 
Government conducted themselves.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> No, I shall not.
<P>
Throughout the process, we want to ensure that we 
consult and work with the profession, with which we held 
a stand-alone meeting half an hour after the Bill was 
published. I am more than happy that members of the 
profession continue to discuss with officials to ensure 
greater clarity throughout the profession about how 
valuations will take place.
<P>
The Government have a duty to do that because 
valuations for non-domestic property have already started. 
Businesses have the right to know about the basis on 
which those valuations are being made and the 
implications thereof before the new valuations are 
implemented in 2000. Having listened to, or at least read, 
today's debate and that on Second Reading, I am sure that 
the professions will appreciate that we are seeking to find 
a way forward. Perhaps they need to meet their colleagues 
in the Valuation Office to find out why the Valuation 
Office takes a particular view and why they, largely 
representing the private valuation profession, have a 
different view. Of course, we want people to get together 
so that they understand what is happening, and we are 
prepared to facilitate that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I want to get on because I am 
concerned that I have not yet spoken to the amendment 
about which, Mrs. Roe, you have been incredibly tolerant. 
Perhaps the hon. Gentleman would like to try to 
intervene later.



<P>
Amendment No. 3 springs from the concern that the 
Bill requires a valuer to assume a state of reasonable 
repair when valuing the property at the antecedent 
valuation date and that that repair assumption somehow 
stays with the property throughout the life of the rating 
list regardless of any subsequent physical change to the 
property. I think that that concern is misplaced.
<P>
The Bill will not change the essentials of rating 
valuation. As now, a valuer will be required, when valuing 
a property, to look first at the physical extent of the 
hereditament and the nature of the surrounding locality as 
they exist either on the compilation date of the list for 
the next list, that will be 1 April 2000 or on the material 
date by reference to which he is altering the list because 
of a subsequent physical change to the property or its 
location. He will then be required to project that physical 
reality back and ask himself what the value of that 
hereditament would have been had it existed in the 
economic circumstances pertaining at the common 
valuation date the antecedent valuation date.
<P>
The only difference is that the Bill makes explicit what 
we say has always been the case: in looking at the repair 
condition of the property, the valuer must assume a state 
of reasonable repair rather than the actual repair condition. 
In other words, we are amending no other aspect of the 
process.
<P>
The Bill will displace the principle of rebus sic 
stantibus to that limited extent only; it will go no further. 
The valuer must first look at the physical extent of the 
property to be valued and he must do so on the basis of 
the hereditament as it actually exists on the day by 
reference to which he makes his valuation. It is that 
hereditament which he must assume is in a reasonable 
state of repair on the antecedent valuation date.
<P>
To put it another way, if subsequent physical changes 
to the hereditament or the locality mean that, after making 
the original valuation, that valuation has to be changed 
and if the physical changes are such as to require that a 
standard of repair different from that originally assumed 
is what would be reasonable in the circumstances, it is the 
altered assumption that will apply.
<P>
In other words, the valuer cannot assume anything other 
than a state of reasonable repair. However, what is 
reasonable will depend on the real-world situation on the 
day by reference to which he makes his valuation. 
I hope I am not convinced that that will reassure hon. 
Members that the concerns that provoked the amendment 
are unfounded.
<P>
It is very doubtful that the amendment would have the 
effect that has been suggested. In our view, it is somewhat 
ambiguous. Therefore, it is impossible to say what it 
might do in reality. I hope that the reassurance that I have 
given will allow Opposition Members to agree to 
withdraw the amendment.

<B>Mr. Gray:</B> I shall briefly respond to what the Minister 
has said. First, on the question of consulting the 
industry a theme that has run through this evening's 
debates I can do no better, if I may be permitted to do 
so, than to quote from a letter from the Royal Institution 
of Chartered Surveyors the lead institution among such 
organisations. Mr. Charles Partridge writes:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"We very much regret that there was no consultation with the 
rating professions before this measure was introduced. We are now 
in the unfortunate position of seeing rating legislation going through 
the parliamentary process which is opposed by all of the leading 
rating bodies."	
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The RICS goes on to say that it regrets that it is now so 
very late in the process.



<P>
That simply does not constitute consultation. I was 
delighted to hear the Minister say that the Valuation 
Office would now value a series of meetings with the 
three professional bodies. I hope that the Valuation Office 
or the Government will invite further comments from 
those professional bodies it looks as if the Minister will 
concede that point.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> It is not my job to say how the 
Valuation Office conducts its business. I suggest that the 
valuers associated with the professionals may like to talk 
to the Valuation Office. I made it clear that the 
Government have an ever-open door, and I think that 
those organisations know that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> I am very grateful to the Minister for that 
intervention. I am sure that the organisations concerned 
will be extremely grateful to know now albeit rather late 
in the day that the Minister would be delighted to see 
them and that, in her expression, her door is open. I am 
certain that her private office can expect some telephone 
calls tomorrow from the three bodies concerned, which 
will be seeking a meeting with the Minister, and, I hope, 
with the Valuation Office, to discuss those important 
matters.
<P>
If there were such constructive discussions, the timing 
of our Committee sittings, or the debate on Report, may 
be brought into doubt. If the professional bodies are now 
to be properly consulted, the Government may have to 
reconsider some of the Bill's provisions. The Government 
have not consulted those bodies up to now; the Minister 
has now undertaken to consult them, and I hope that she 
will listen to them. I hope that that will not be a token 
gesture to have the chaps in to find out what they have 
got to say but that as a result the Minister will carefully 
consider the extensive briefing that the bodies have given 
to us, and will consider changing the Bill, possibly 
fundamentally, in the light of it.
<P>
<B></B><P>
Ms Armstrong: The hon. Gentleman doth protest too 
much. The organisations have been consulted. Indeed, 
they have discussed their amendments with officials 
from the Department. It is not true to say that there 
has been no consultation. The letter from which the 
hon. Gentleman quoted said that it was only after 
publication of the Bill that the organisations were 
consulted. I acknowledge that; I explained the reason 
for that earlier.
<P>
This Government are always prepared to engage in 
discussion. That does not necessarily mean that we agree 
with everything that is said to us. We are not led by the 
nose; we are led by what we know is right.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> Of course, I accept the Minister's point. The 
hon. Gentleman doth protest; I think that he doth protest 
with some good reason, but I accept that perhaps he doth 
protest slightly too much. If so, I apologise to the Minister 
if I have annoyed her in any way. Nothing could be 
further from my intention. None the less, I am delighted 
that she is now prepared to listen so carefully to what the 
organisations have to say.
<P>
It may be worth asking a brief question about the 
amendment. Again, I claim no expertise in these matters, 
but pay tribute to the thorough briefing that the 
professional bodies have given to all Opposition members 
of the Committee and, no doubt, Government members 
as well. The question refers to clause 1(2)(a), which we 
are discussing under the amendment. The professional 
bodies say that there is a clear conflict between that 
provision and the current regulations in statutory 
instrument 556/92. Is there a conflict between the clause 
and the statutory instrument? If so, does the Minister 
intend to accept our amendment to it on Report? 
Alternatively, will she propose an amendment to statutory 
instrument 556/92? I readily admit, before anyone 
intervenes, that I have not read statutory instrument 
556/92. I would even go so far as to say that if I did read 
it, I am not certain that I would understand it. None the 
less, I am informed that there is a clear conflict between 
the two. Perhaps the Minister will enlighten us as to 
whether she will accept our amendment, or whether an 
amendment to statutory instrument 556/92 will be tabled.
6.15 pm

<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I have listened closely to what the 
Minister said earlier and to the intervention from the hon. 
Member for North Wiltshire (Mr. Gray). It is fair to say 
that there has been a dialogue between the various 
organisations involved in the profession the Institute of 
Revenues, Rating and Valuation, the Royal Institution of 
Chartered Surveyors and the Ratings Surveyors 
Association. It is also fair to say that all three institutions 
represent not just the private sector interest but members 
of the Valuation Office. It is true that in making their 
comments and representations to the Government, those 
involved in the Government agency have withdrawn, but 
it would be wrong to give the impression that those bodies 
do not represent both sides of the equation.

Sitting suspended for a Division in the House.

<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
On resuming 
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> It is always good to have a bit of 
exercise during a sitting.
<P>
I was saying that the amendments have kicked dialogue 
into life. That is no bad thing, and discussion is necessary 
to establish the amendments' intended effects and to find 
ways forward. I hope that that dialogue will continue. I 
was also making the point that all three of the 
organisations representing the profession represent both 
sides of it private practice and the staff of the Valuation 
Office. That should be borne in mind when weighing up 
their representations, as should the wealth of experience 
and expertise that they can bring to bear.
<P>
In view of today's debate, I suspect that it will be 
necessary to read Hansard in some detail, probably in a 
room that is not very well lit and with a warm towel 
wrapped around the head, to try to understand the 
Minister's points. Some useful and helpful points have 
emerged.
<P>
The Liberal Democrats are concerned that the Bill may 
remove the sense of compromise and willingness to 
compromise that is inherent in the valuation system. That 
concern goes to the heart of the amendment. In effect, the 
Bill could tie the hands of the Valuation Office, which is 
not the Government's intention. The amendment enables 
them to reflect further on that point and to ensure that the 
system covers properties in a general sense and that it 
reflects the point made about tone by the hon. Member for 
South Ribble (Mr. Borrow). It may also ensure a degree of 
flexibility that recognnises the reality of the marketplace.
<P>
The Minister nods. She may still speak in the House 
and change the Bill to avoid the introduction of legislation 
that many hon. Members and businesses will come to 
regret. Liberal Democrats wish to demonstrate our 
strength of feeling about the amendment. We shall 
therefore seek to press it to a Division.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I am perplexed by Opposition 
Members' views on the amendment. They have not spent 
much time in speaking to it, and I am unclear about what 
they think that it would do. We believe that the 
amendment would do precisely what the hon. Member for 
Sutton and Cheam just said that he did not intend. That is 
the problem, which lies in interpreting both the 
amendment and the Bill.
<P>
The hon. Member for North Wiltshire spoke about 
conflict with statutory instrument provisions. The 
Government do not believe that the Bill contains any such 
conflict. We will consider and discuss the matter with the 
people who gave the hon. Gentleman the relevant 
briefing, as ever. Our considered view to date, however, 
is that no conflict exists.

<P>

<B></B><P>
Mr. Burstow: I shall make my remarks as brief as I 
can.
<P>
Today's deliberations in the Committee have seemed 
like trying to wander through a very deep, dark cave 
without illumination. I have therefore been grateful to the 
Minister for the extent to which she has been able to 
clarify some of the points that have been raised by 
members of the Committee and by representatives of the 
relevant professions.



<P>
The key point is that the clause seeks to tackle a 
perceived problem rather than a real one, and could 
thereby make matters worse by leading to increased 
litigation. Other members of the Committee have pointed 
out that the measure has at least in part the Treasury's 
imprint on it. It protects, at least, the rate base, and 
could if one puts a less generous construction on the 
Bill's wording extend it further.
<P>
It has been argued during the Anston case and as part 
of the Bill's rationale that a flood tide of new appeals will 
be unleashed. The evidence from the written answer to 
which I referred earlier suggests that there has been no 
such flood tide. Members of the profession have said that 
they do not expect that to happen and that the decision in 
the Anston case was not a surprise.
<P>
The Bill will not only tie the hands of the Valuation 
Office. It will remove the scope for compromise, which 
ought to be part of the process. It will also restrict grounds 
for future appeals.
<P>
In conclusion, clause 1 which is basically the Bill 
has neither my support nor that of my hon. Friend the 
Member for Weston-Super-Mare. We will therefore push 
the amendment to a vote. Unamended, the clause is not 
safe and will leave the law in an even more confused 
state. It will have exactly the opposite effect to that which 
the Government and their explanatory notes claim.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> Again, I shall try to be as brief as 
possible. Clearly, I do not agree with the hon. Member 
for Sutton and Cheam; I suppose that one of us will be 
proved right in time.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman again asserted that the Bill would 
lead to increased litigation. By imposing an assumption, 
the Bill seeks to treat like property with like and ensures 
that a common standard continues to be imposed. We 
believe that the Anston judgment would not allow that.
<P>
The Bill will simplify matters rather than the reverse. 
Reluctantly, I shall again quote Lord Pearce in Dawkins 
v. Ash:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Inevitably more difficulties are caused when one tries to ascribe 
true values to hereditaments than when one excludes some element 
that does in real life cause variations of value and substitutes for it 
a hypothetical rule of thumb"	.
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In many senses, that is what we have been arguing about 
and it is in order to sustain that that we brought forward 
the Bill.
<P>
Clause 1 refines that part of schedule 6 of the 1988 Act 
which prescribes that the rateable value is to be found by 
estimating the rent that a hypothetical tenant would pay 
for the premises on certain assumptions. It makes explicit 
for the first time the assumption that the property is in 
a state of reasonable repair at the valuation date. That 
assumption will apply whatever the actual condition of 
the property, except in relation to any repairs that a 
reasonable landlord would consider it uneconomic to 
carry out.
<P>
The Bill will ensure that the law continues to be applied 
on the basis that was assumed when the 1988 Act was 
passed by the previous Government and in line with the 
way in which valuation officers have valued property 
since 1990. Accordingly, ratepayers will see no change in 
their rateable values.
<P>
I am not at all defensive about the fact that we, as a 
responsible Government, are concerned about the income 
from rates, but greater clarity and more certainty are also 
in the interest of ratepayers. It would be irresponsible of 
the Government not to take action when we consider it 
necessary and thus to leave ratepayers unsure about how 
matters would proceed before revaluation in 2000.
<P>
I contend that without the Bill, the rating assessments 
of 1.7 million properties would be open to question. In 
principle, valuation officers would have to assess the state 
of repair of a property at frequent and regular intervals. 
That is not a realistic option. Moreover, a ratepayer who 
chose not to maintain his property but instead let it fall 
into disrepair would be rewarded by a reduction in his rate 
liability, while one who fulfilled his repairing obligations 
would incur a higher rate liability as a result. That cannot 
be fair. I therefore urge the Committee to support clause 1.

<H4><center>Clause 2</center></H4>
<H4><center>Commencement</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the 
Bill.
<P>
</FONT><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the </B><P>
Environment, Transport and the Regions (Mr. Alan 
Meale): May I also add my thanks to those of my hon. 
Friends and Opposition Members for your gracious 
presence in the Chair, Mrs. Roe? Our proceedings have 
been shorter than you first expected.
<P>
Clause 2 deals with the commencement of the Bill. 
There is not much need to repeat the arguments that were 
advanced earlier. The clause provides that the assumption 
of a state of reasonable repair applies to future valuations 
from the date of commencement of the Act. It will apply 
also retrospectively to valuations undertaken for the 1990 
and 1995 lists. The aim is to ensure that the decision in 
the Anston Properties case cannot be exploited by other 
ratepayers as the basis for proposals to alter their own 
rateable values. It secures the integrity of the valuations 
already carried out by valuation officers for the 1990 and 
1995 rating lists.
<P>
I shall now respond to the queries of the hon. Members 
for North Wiltshire, for South Holland and The Deepings 
and for Sutton and Cheam. We do not wish to deprive 
the ratepayer company in the Lands Tribunal case of the 
benefits of its successful appeal, so the retrospective 
provisions will not apply to that case. Nor will they apply 
to any other case where a proposal for an alteration of the 
rateable value shown in the rating list was made and not 
withdrawn or finally disposed of before 12 March 1998, 
the day after the Lands Tribunal made its decision. 
Ratepayers in such cases may have sought to argue on the 
same grounds as the ratepayer in the Lands Tribunal case 
and it is right that they, too, should not be disadvantaged.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> I seek information that I am ashamed to 
say I do not know. When people want to contest a 
decision, is there a time by which they have to make the 
appeal known?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meale:</B> As I recall, the date is that of 12 March.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> When the council tax banding system came 
in, if individuals were unhappy about the band in which 
their domestic property was put, there was a fixed time 
limit in which they could appeal. I wonder whether the 
same applies under the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meale:</B> I am advised that it will be one year from 
when the decision was taken.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> I am grateful to the Minister. Will he 
answer my next question in detail, so that I do not gain 
the wrong impression? What is the reason for the 
retrospective nature of clause 2?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meale:</B> My hon. Friend answered that point fully. 
If we open up the matter for further appeals, up to
1.7 million appeals could be levelled. A line must be 
drawn by which a case is open and closed, which is the 
purpose of clause 2. The hon. Gentleman may also like to 
know that the clause adequately protects the position of 
ratepayers, who anticipated that the better view of the law 
might be that taken by the Lands Tribunal and who stand 
to benefit from that interpretation.



<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<H4><center>Clause 3</center></H4>
<H4><center>Citation and extent</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the 
Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> The Committee will be relieved to know 
that I do not intend to speak for long there is not a lot 
in the clause on which to speak.
<P>
The Bill extends to England and Wales only and I 
should be grateful if the Minister would explain what 
happens in Scotland and Northern Ireland. Perhaps the 
answer is that Scotland has a different legal system and a 
different system covering domestic dwellings and 
business properties, so the problem that resulted in the 
court case here has not arisen in Scotland. Is that also the 
position in Northern Ireland, or will the decision made in 
the court case apply elsewhere? Will the Government 
have to address the problem at a later date, particularly 
in Scotland?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meale:</B> The basis on which rating law is applied 
in Northern Ireland is different from that in England and 
Wales and rating law in England and Wales is different 
in many ways from that in Scotland. The hon. Gentleman 
rightly said that the Anston case was decided according 
to the law in England and Wales and did not affect the law 
in Scotland, so no change is required north of the border.
<P>
Standing up at this stage of our proceedings makes me 
feel like Bernard Miles in "Beat the Clock"	 because, as 
the hon. Gentleman rightly said, there is not a lot that can 
be said about the clause. It applies the provisions of the 
Bill to the rating list in England and Wales.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> You will be pleased to know, Mrs. Roe, 
that I shall not delay the Committee unduly. I am curious 
to know why the Bill will be entitled the Rating 
(Valuation) Act 1998. It may be because the Bill was first 
brought to the House in 1998, but should not the date be 
that of its Second Reading or of Her Majesty's approval of 
it? Presumably 1998 is incorrect, so will the Government 
correct the anomaly?

<P>

<B>Mr. Meale:</B> The date is that when the tribunal's 
decision was made. I hope that that answers the hon. 
Gentleman's query, but he may wish to elaborate on the 
matter during the few remaining minutes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> I am merely speculating that the date of a 
Bill refers not to the reason that caused it to be brought 
before the House but to when it is passed by the House. 
Otherwise, a Bill that is introduced because of something 
that happened during the second world war would become 
the such-and-such Act 1945. Surely the title of a Bill 
should refer to the date on which it becomes law and not 
to the reason behind it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meale:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for 
attempting to clarify the matter. The hon. Member for 
Sutton and Cheam said that the Bill had been a learning 
curve for many hon. Members, including some who have 
been in the House for many years.
<P>
I am reliably informed that the convention covering the 
date of legislation allows it to be dated at any appropriate 
point in its progress. The Government have linked the Bill 
to the date of the tribunal decision.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> The Bill was published in November 1998, 
so that was the logical date to put in the title, but as that 
was the eleventh month in the year. it became incorrect 
after a maximum of eight weeks. Will the Government 
have to table an amendment to change the date to 1999 
when the Bill finally reaches the statute book, or will that 
progression be automatic?



<P>
<B>Mr. Meale:</B> It may be helpful if I tell the hon. 
Gentleman that part of the reason is that no Government 
can anticipate the date of Royal Assent. Now that we are 
in government and have a particular approach to society, 
it is for the workings of the House to decide when Royal 
Assent will be granted and the House authorities will deal 
with that in due course. Therefore, no amendment is 
required.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 3 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Question proposed, That the Chairman do report the 
Bill to the House.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> Before everyone disappears, may I 
thank you, Mrs. Roe? I was becoming anxious that we 
would not reach this stage this evening. I am sure that you 
are pleased that we have done so. You have been 
extremely tolerant during the Committee stage of this 
difficult, complex but short Bill.
<P>
I pay tribute to the way in which hon. Members 
discussed the Bill. We all want to get it right and I 
appreciate that the Opposition's expressions of concern 
reflect their wish to get it right.
<P>
I give particular thanks to my hon. Friend the Member 
for South Ribble because his expertise and specialist 
knowledge enlightened the Committee and I am grateful 
to him for that. I am also grateful to my other hon. Friends 
who sat in the Committee with such patience listening to 
the rather convoluted debate [Hon. Members: Oh!] We 
have been trying to get through the Bill and we have 
debated it. I did not intend anything in using that word. 
I am simply saying that there have been some difficult 
debates. I thank you, Mrs. Roe, and all hon. Members for 
their contributions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> I thank you, Mrs. Roe, on behalf of my 
hon. Friends, for the way in which you looked after us and 
for your patience and guidance during our proceedings. 
I suspect that when we started at 4.30 this afternoon it 
was beyond your wildest dreams that we would be here 
at almost 7 o'clock.
<P>
As the Minister kindly said, we have had a constructive 
debate. Opposition Members expressed some concerns 
generating from our wish to help the Government to get 
the Bill right and our debate was in that spirit. The only 
tinge of regret that you could feel, Mrs. Roe, is that we 
have not gone on to a second sitting. The hon. Member 
for Nottingham, North (Mr. Allen), my hon. Friend the 
Member for North Wiltshire and myself made history last 
Thursday by being members of the first Committee to sit 
on a Thursday morning, albeit for only 18 minutes. 
I regret that we deprived you of that pleasure this week.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I much appreciate the Minister's 
comments.

Question put and agreed to.
