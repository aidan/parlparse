							<a name="0702079000360"></a>The
Minister for Local Government (Mr. Phil
Woolas):
						</b> Thank you, Mr. Benton. At the end of
this morning&#146;s sitting, I was referring to the timetable for
consultation with the public and saying how the Government&#146;s
position under the Bill is that it is up to local councils to determine
how they will ascertain the broad support from the public that is one
of the criteria asked for in the invitation to
bid.</div>
					
					<a name="0702079000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="0702079000361"></a>
							<b class="B">Alistair
Burt</b> (North-East Bedfordshire) (Con): The Minister has
made much of the fact that some authorities may have been thinking
about the process for up to two years, and thus have had plenty of time
to consult the public and give a sense of broad-based consent and so
on. What about the situation that is not uncommon in some authorities
that have submitted bids? Their bids have been brought forward at a
late stage because of a bid made by another authority.</div>
					<a name="0702079000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">A borough that is thinking of
going unitary may have done a lot of work and spoken to people within
its area, but one of the knock-on consequences of the Bedford borough
bid, for example, put a question mark over what would happen to the
rest of the area. That prompted a response from Mid Beds and South
Bedfordshire district councils that they could not reasonably have been
expected to plan or pay for by way of preparation until they knew what
Bedford borough would do. What about the time for public consultation
in districts that have been placed in such a
position?</div>
					
					<a name="0702079000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0702079000362"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> For the benefit of the Committee, it may be worth
noting that the bids or the proposals that have been made are all
public documents. It is incumbent on us to put all the material on the
website and publish it for the
House.</div>
					<a name="0702079000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">The point of the
hon. Member for North-East Bedfordshire was well made. An authority has
to show that there is broad public support for its proposal. He asked
whether there was enough time for an affected district or authority to
respond and show that it has public support. The Government will judge
such proposals across the whole of the affected area, not 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column160" />Column number: 161</div>
						only within the area that is proposed. It will be
incumbent on the proposing authority, as well as the responding
authority, to show the size of public support. That is a fair point
because it reflects the top-down
approach.</div>
					<a name="0702079000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a
balance between having a window of opportunity that is adequate for due
consideration and a period that would be destabilising in the extreme
for local authorities. I reassure the hon. Gentleman that public
support for the proposal&#151;both from the authority that is putting
it in and the affected authorities&#151;is a criterion that we shall
use.</div>
					
					<a name="0702079000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="0702079000363"></a>
							<b class="B">Patrick
Hall</b> (Bedford) (Lab): As for the pre-invitation to bid
process or the period to which the hon. Member for North-East
Bedfordshire alluded, Bedford borough asked its citizens panel.
However, I do not regard that as constituting a sufficient measure of
public interest, although it has demonstratedpublic support
for the idea of a Bedford unitary. Surely the most important
opportunity to go to town on demonstrating widespread public support
from residents, businesses and voluntary organisations would occur
after a bid has passed the initial hurdle, if indeed it does. I would
expect councils to take such action in April, May and June, whether or
not they were preparing beforehand, as the hon. Gentleman said. That is
when the work needs to be done and when the real demonstration of
public support will have to be
obtained.</div>
					
					<a name="0702079000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0702079000364"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> To emphasise the criteria, I must explain that the
period until 25 January past was, of course, the deadline for the
submission of proposals. We intend that, by the end of March, those
proposals will be subject to judgment against the criteria established.
Then the wider interests will be consulted, including affected
authorities. That period of consultation will include local elections
in those
areas.</div>
					
					<a name="0702079000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0702079000365"></a>Alistair
Burt:
						</b> We are at a difficult point, and I return to the
difficulty of the time scale. The hon. Member for Bedford made his
point well, but surely the period in which a bidding authority had to
show some degree of public support was the period up to the submission
of the bid. That is one of the criteria. My point is that some bidding
authorities had very little time to put their bid together. They will
have spent serious money on getting the bid together at a late stage,
because it would have been prompted by a proposal by a neighbouring
authority. That means that trying to gauge public consent or support
will be practically impossible.</div>
					<a name="0702079000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">Councils have had to go on a
wing and a prayer. They have spent money and put in their bids because
they think that that is the best defence mechanism against the other
proposals on the table. I do not think that the time scale has been
adequate to demonstrate any serious public consultation,
notwithstanding that the process will consider that from now on. If the
Minister finds that there is no public support or backing, authorities
will have spent money putting together a bid
unnecessarily.</div>
					
					<a name="0702079000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0702079000366"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman makes his point fairly, but the
second period of consultation does not exclude the authorities from
putting in their point of view, developing on proposals that might have
been made or&#151;</div>
					
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column161" />Column number: 162</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0702079000367"></a>Alistair
Burt:
						</b> But it was a criterion in the first
place.</div>
					
					<a name="0702079000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0702079000368"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman says that it is possible that
an authority might have got wind of a neighbouring authority&#146;s
bid and then had a short period in which to prepare its proposals. I
acknowledge that point, but it would be a strong point only if that
authority were then excluded from further
consultation. For the record, it might be worth referring the Committee
to paragraph 5.10 of the invitation to councils in England to bid. It
says:</div>
					<a name="0702079000302"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;At stage
2, the Government will consult widely with partners/stakeholders in the
areas affected by the proposals. Partners/stakeholders will thus have
an opportunity to make representations about proposals that potentially
will affect them. For these purposes, partners/stakeholders include all
local authorities, the wider public sector...business community,
voluntary and community sector. It is intended that this consultation
would be launched at the end of March with a 12-week consultation
period.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0702079000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those interested
groups include the affected councils. He has pressed his point quite
well, and I acknowledge
that.</div>
					
					<a name="0702079000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0702079000369"></a>Alistair
Burt:
						</b> On a final point, if that wider consultation in
March shows that there was in fact no public support for a proposal,
what the council has done, in extremis, is to spend a lot of council
tax payers&#146; money to put together an unnecessary bid. The
criterion that the proposals should be</div>
					<a name="0702079000303"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;supported by a broad cross section
of partners and
stakeholders&#148;</div>
					<a name="0702079000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">could not
have been tested in the time required. Provided that the Minister is
prepared to concede that money may well have been wasted in the process
because of the urgency of the timetable, I take his
point.</div>
					
					<a name="0702079000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0702079000370"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman is tempting me to say that
devolution might mean spending money. I argue that inviting councils to
put forward proposals for improving their local services and financial
efficiency could be money well spent, but I am determined to remain
neutral.</div>
					
					<a name="0702079000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0702079000371"></a>Patrick
Hall:
						</b> Let me point out that the complaint of the hon.
Member for North-East Bedfordshire is that some councils might not have
had time to spend enough money consulting a vast number of people, so
they will have spent
less.</div>
					
					<a name="0702079000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0702079000372"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> My hon. Friend&#146;s logic is normally
impeccable. I was going to say &#147;always&#148;, but he might put
amendments down, and then I would be in a difficulty. I am not sure
what the local paper in Bedford and Bedfordshire is called, although I
am sure that I will find out at some point in the next 12 weeks. I will
resist the temptation to rename the Bill, &#147;The Local Government
and Public Involvement in Health in Bedfordshire Bill&#148;, but his
point was well made.</div>
					<a name="0702079000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 4 is much narrower in
scope than people reading a report of the debate might believe. It sets
out the procedure that the Secretary of State is to followon

							<b class="B">Mr.
Philip Dunne</b> (Ludlow) (Con): I apologise to you,
Mr. Benton, and to the Committee because this is the first
sitting that I have attended&#151;I had other commitments to
fulfil.</div>
					<a name="0702079000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">I wish to ask
the Minister a couple of questions for clarification, particularly on
clause 4(2)(b), and to press him a little further on the issue of the
extent of public consultation. Authorities that cover an area in which
a proposal was made before 25 January, and which anticipated for some
months in advance of the publication of the White Paper that such a
proposal might be forthcoming, have had an opportunity to organise
widespread public consultation. That is true in the case of Shropshire,
as the Minister knows well, where three out of five districts have done
so. The consultations took the form of a public ballot, which was well
responded to, with a turnout of more than41 per cent. More
than 60,000 people took the trouble to respond to a postal ballot. That
response will, I hope, be taken into due consideration by the
Minister.</div>
					<a name="0702079000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">The thrust
of my question is that clause 4(2) states that</div>
					<a name="0702079000304"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the Secretary of State must
consult the following about the
proposal...</div>
					<a name="0702079000305"></a><div class="hs_brev">(b)
any other person he believes to have an
interest.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0702079000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the
Minister confirm that the definition contained in clause 4(2)(b) would
mean that the Secretary of State will be obliged to take into due
consideration the results of a public
ballot?</div>
					
					<a name="0702079000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0702079000374"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman makes a point about the extent
of consultation. Clause 4(2)(b) says that &#147;any other
person&#148; the Secretary of State believes to have an interest must
be consulted. Government policy is that it is up to councils to
determine how they consult on, or show a broad range of support for, a
proposal. Clearly, members of the public are included within the
definition of clause 4(2)(b). The Secretary of State would then have to
balance the various competing claims, and it would be up to the
councils affected to demonstrate what public support for proposals
there was. As is laid out in the invitation, that criterion is to be
given due regard in the consideration.
</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0702079000375"></a>Mr.
Dunne:
						</b> May I take it from that helpful response that the
Minister will not only rely on partners and stakeholders that have a
particular understanding within local authorities, but other persons,
such as members of the public and the electorate that the authorities
are there to
serve?</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
Robert Syms</b> (Poole) (Con): We are about to discuss several
interrelated clauses. It would help if the Minister would give an
explanation of how he thinks the boundary committee will work under the
Bill. We have heard that it will have two essential tasks, the first of
which is to deal with the bids that have been submitted should the
Secretary of State refer matters to it. The second is to deal with the
boundaries of authorities, some of which will not be part of the
initial process. Clearly the committee will deal with any further bids
that come along.</div>
					<a name="0702079000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the issue of boundary committee referral, the provisions clearly state
that there may be a referral by the Secretary of State, but will the
Minister say when there would not be a referral to the boundary
committee? Probably the only case that I can think of is that of a
county becoming a unitary authority, with clear boundaries and clarity

guidance must be given. It would be helpful if the Department&#146;s
guidance were published before we reach the end of the Bill. I should
also like to know whether the guidance will be general guidance for all
situations, or guidance that is specific to a bid, such as if there is
a cross-county issue or a particular conglomeration when the Secretary
of State will require information on item X or item Y.</div>
					<a name="0702079000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">Essentially, are we saying that
there will be broad-brush guidance, with certain issues that may need
to be returned to, or will the guidance be specific to particular
proposals? We could have a situation in which the Secretary of State
made a referral, and said, &#147;I am interested in this bid, but I
want to know X, Y and Z.&#148; She would then give guidance to the
boundary committee specifically to research and consider those issues.
There is not too much more that I want to mention, but I shall probably
have further questions as we examine later
clauses.</div>

						</b> That was a helpful intervention in allowing me to
provide clarification. The answer is that the guidance will be
broad-brush.</div>
					<a name="0702079000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause will apply when the boundary committee receives a request for
advice on a proposal. The boundary committee may provide advice. When
it does, it may also do one of three things. First, it may recommend
that the Secretary of State should implement the received proposal,
with or without modification. Secondly, it can recommend that the
Secretary of State should not implement the proposal&#151;full stop.
Thirdly, it can make an alternative proposal to the Secretary of
State.</div>
					<a name="0702079000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the committee
makes an alternative proposal, that proposal must deal with the whole
or part of the area that the submitting authority or authorities could
have included in their original proposal to the Secretary of State.
However, unlike proposals submitted by local authorities, the boundary
committee&#146;s alternative proposal does not have to follow
existing county or district boundaries. So the alternative proposal
procedure is the way for the boundary committee to recommend boundary
change for the relevant area. I refer the Committee to page six of the
explanatory memorandum, which explains the point.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column164" />Column number: 165</div>
					<a name="0702079000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection (6) provides that an
alternative proposal from the boundary committee may not cover an area
that includes part or all of the City of London or the Temples. Had I
not just clarified that point, the power would have existed&#151;so I
hope that Members are paying attention. Proposals additionally may not
extend to Wales. That might be of wider
interest.</div>
					<a name="0702079000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
allows the boundary committee for England to provide advice to the
Secretary of State, make recommendations on received proposals, and
make alternative proposals. The Government will be able to refer
proposals to the boundary committee only after Royal Assent&#151;if
the Bill is approved by the House. We can ask the boundary committee
for advice on any matter relating to the proposal, including looking at
the electoral arrangements for that proposal. Again, it is an
extraordinarily devolutionary and permissive framework that we are
trying to create. I hope the Committee will see fit to support the
clause.</div>

							<a name="0702079000379"></a>Mr.
Syms:
						</b> I beg to move amendment No. 19, in
clause 6, page 5, line 17, leave
out &#145;four weeks&#146; and insert &#145;three
months&#146;.</div>
					<a name="0702079000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment is part of a theme, namely the speed of the timetable, that
has been developed throughout this Bill and may last some weeks. Under
clause 6, the relevant period for consultation back to the boundary
commission is defined as four weeks. The amendment would clearly make
it 12 weeks, and three months and is designed to tease out why the
timetable is so tight. At this stage, the Minister usually gets up and
says that this follows the Conservative legislation of 1992. However, I
would be interested to know why four weeks is specified and why a
little more time cannot be left for people to make further
representations.</div>
					
					<a name="0702079000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0702079000380"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> I was hoping to be able to say that it follows the
Conservative precedent in 1972. I will attempt to explain why we think
the amendment is not necessary. Where the boundary committee is asked
for advice on an alternative proposal for a single tier of local
government, the procedure already provides for significant
opportunities for interested parties to make their representations.
Where the committee is minded to make an alternative proposal, it must
first publish a draft of its proposal and must also ensure that those
who have an interest are informed of the proposaland the
deadline for making representations to the committee on that matter.
The boundary committee must take account of those
representations.</div>
					<a name="0702079000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">Where
the boundary committee subsequently, as a result of that consultation,
makes a proposal to the Secretary of State, we provide for a further
opportunity for interested parties to make representations. The
committee must inform anybody who previously made representations on a
particular proposal that it has made a subsequent proposal to the
Secretary of State. It must also inform those people that they have a
further four weeks to make representations to the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column165" />Column number: 166</div>Secretary of State. That will be four weeks from the date, unless
revised, set by the Secretary of State for advice from the committee.
In essence, that means that Parliament has its boundary committee to
consult and look at the proposals and the four further weeks is then
another opportunity to comment on the proposal coming from the boundary
committee.</div>
					<a name="0702079000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given that
deep and broad consultation by the independent boundary committee, we
believe that four weeks is an adequate period to comment on the
proposals that arise from the consultation. A further extension of the
period&#151;I think that the hon. Member for Poole&#146;s amendment
refers to three months&#151;would have no other purpose than to
replicate the role of the boundary committee, which is, of course,
independent. That would, I argue, be an inappropriate period of time.
The reference to the Secretary of State&#146;s time period is a
further one on which to comment on the boundary committee&#146;s
proposals, having already had the substantial consultation by the
boundary committee itself.</div>
					
					<a name="0702079000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0702079000381"></a>Mr.
Syms:
						</b> Essentially what happens is that boundary committee
publishes a proposal, there is normally an inquiry, it considers the
inquiry, gives a month for people to come back with further comments
and usually goes with whatever the inquiry has decided. Under this
proposal, there does not seem to be any inquiry. That means that if the
boundary committee makes a proposal, having carried out consultations,
there are four weeks for people to respond to it. But what happens
during that four-week consultation, or with the three months under our
amendment, which would give people more time? Does the boundary
committee have to consider that and add it to the representations from
the Secretary of State, or does the Secretary of State have to consider
those further representations when she gets the main boundary committee
submission?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0702079000382"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> The Secretary of State is obliged to consider
those representations, but the purpose of the procedure is that those
would have been made prior to the ones from the boundary committee. I
suspect that the hon. Gentleman is wary of the boundary committee
making an alternative proposal outsidethe expected remit of
the proposals that have been consulted on. The boundary committee, in
its consultation period, has to pay regard to the representations that
are made. The idea of the further four weeks is to give interested
parties time to comment on the tidying up of loose ends in areas that
may have not been foreseen by the boundary committee&#151;the
unintended consequences, rather than the substance, of the proposals
that it is obliged to take into account in its consultation
period.</div>

					<a name="0702079000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was
interested in what the Minister said, because it seems to confirm my
hon. Friend&#146;s concern that there will not be public inquiries
under this procedure. If that is so, it would be as well if that were
spelled out specifically. Is that intended to be a departure from the
norm, purely for the circumstances of this small 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column166" />Column number: 167</div>tranche of changes, or does this presage a broader thought that the
Government would in future not propose to use public inquiries if local
authority boundaries are to be changed? What is the thinking behind
that?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0702079000384"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> On the face of it, the hon. Gentleman makes a
reasonable point, because there are not public inquiries in such
instances. We are not taking about the sort of procedure that is
undergone in relation to parliamentary changes, but about tweaking
boundaries. Indeed, public inquiries do not take place in such
circumstances, so we are not envisaging that that should change. This
is an open and liberal&#151;if I can use that word without too much
criticism from behind me or in front of
me&#151;measure and a reassurance to local authorities. It will put
into the legislative framework, if the House accepts it, a sensible
framework to fit the proposed new arrangement that reflects the
principles that are already in
place.</div>
					
					<a name="0702079000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0702079000385"></a>Mr.
Syms:
						</b> This has been a useful debate. Public inquiries
after local government reorganisation have not been a feature in the
past, but we have not had authorities making sometimes competitive
bids, leading to a ripple effect, with one borough making a bid and
another at the other end of the county making another to move things
forward. As the Minister acknowledged earlier in respect of
Bedfordshire and a number of other authorities, the multiple proposals
will lead to a slight headache in respect of what one ends up with. I
wonder whether it might be appropriate sometimes to put such matters to
a public inquiry. My other concern is that the provision diminishes the
work for barristers within our system, and that must be a concern for
us all.</div>
					<a name="0702079000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have had a
useful debate. I still think that the period should be slightly longer
than four weeks. That would be better, given that there is not to be a

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0702079000390"></a>Mr.

						</b> The short answer to that is common sense. If I
explain what the clause is trying to do, that may help the
Committee.</div>
					<a name="0702079000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
allows the Secretary of State to implement proposals for a single tier
of local government, as the Committee is aware. Those may be the
proposals received from local authorities, or alternative proposals
made by the boundary committee. Proposals may be implemented as I said
before with or without modification. That is to allow the Secretary of
State to implement the proposals with changes&#151;for example,
following advice from the boundary commission she may wish to amend the
boundary of the proposed area. Any order for structural change will be
subject to the affirmative procedure, as we will debate under clause
173, if the hon. Member for Lichfield wishes to make a note. Any such
order will therefore be subject to further scrutiny by the
House.</div>
					<a name="0702079000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">If a proposal
that the Secretary of State has decided to implement has not been
submitted jointly by all the authorities affected by it, she may not
implement it unless she has first consulted on the proposal as required
by clause 4. If she has asked the boundary committee for advice by a
certain date, she may implement a proposal or an alternative proposal
submitted only once six weeks have passed from that date.</div>
					<a name="0702079000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause also specifies that
the Secretary of State may decide to take no action on a proposal, as
the hon. Member for North-East Bedfordshire said. She may decide to do
that where she considers that the case for a single tier of local
government for a particular area has not been made. The clause
therefore specifies that the Secretary of State &#147;may&#148;
implement proposals that she receives for a single tier of local
government. The provision to which the hon. Member for North-East
Bedfordshire has drawn attention simply points out the face that the
Secretary of State may decide that the case has not been
made&#151;that even though the alternative route has been used, the
case is not there. I would have thought that he would welcome that
option.</div>

This is not a cherry-picking exercise. One has to weigh up the

the value for money criterion is particularly
important.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0702079000393"></a>Mr.
Syms:
						</b> We have so far had 26 proposals, of which the
Government intend to run with eight, as I read somewhere&#151;it
might be fewer, or it might be more. However, as I understand the
Government&#146;s intention, they will go forward with a proportion,
so inevitably, no further action will be taken on some. At that point,
presumably, the proposals on which no action has been taken are
dead&#151;gone. What I mean is that the Government are not going to
go forward with eight and have another eight later. When someone has
worked everything out, spent the money and put the proposal together,
it is either success or failure.</div>
					
					<a name="0702079000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0702079000394"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman, quite reasonably, is probing
for an answer to that question. The suspicion of Opposition Members
knows no bounds.</div>
					<a name="0702079000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">First, the figure of about eight
proposals, as I said in evidence, comes from the fact that
reorganisation to unitary carries up-front costs, and those costs can
be met only from the reserves of or efficiency savings by the local
authority concerned. In either instance, most obviously in the
first&#151;where the reserves are affected&#151;that would have an
effect on local government in its totality&#146;s assets and
therefore its borrowing capacity. The figure of about eight is a
macro-figure to fit in with the Government&#146;s wider economic
policy.</div>
					<a name="0702079000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, a
proposal would be given the go-ahead only if it could show that there
were cost savings to the council tax payer in the form of the council
tax not being at a higher level than it currently is. That raises the
thorny question, if it is a district moving into a county unitary or
districts coming together, whether the lower or the higher council tax
would apply. The answer is that it would be the lower council tax. An
authority would have to show that it was able to keep those costs down,
so whether or not eight turns out to be the correct figure, and whether
or not consequential proposals in neighbouring areas, districts or, in
one case, unitaries take place, one would have to take those wider
costs into account. There is a wider financial judgment to be made, as
well as the specific judgement on each of the proposals or
consequential
proposals.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0702079000395"></a>Mr.
Syms:
						</b> This is a slightly tangential point but, however one
looks at it, additional work is going to have to be undertaken by the
boundary committee, which I suspect is not a heavily funded
organisation. Who is going to pay for that? When the boundary committee
gets involved in the process of consultation or in questions of local
governance in relation to the bids that go forward, there will be some
cost. My central question is: will the Secretary of State pay? Will 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column169" />Column number: 170</div>committee&#146;s current budget cover it, or will the cost have to be
recouped from the good taxpayers of Bedfordshire, Shropshire, or
elsewhere?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0702079000396"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> I commend the hon. Gentleman on an ingenious
question. The answer is that the boundary committee is funded by the
taxpayer and would be charged with the duties of commenting on those
proposals. Of course, in the real world of government, that is another
reason why one has to take decisions efficiently. I do not suppose that
the Conservative party&#146;s leaflets in Bedfordshire&#151;no, I
must not comment on Bedfordshire. However, it is a fair question, and
the answer is that the boundary committee would
pay.</div>
					<a name="0702079000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">It might be
helpful if I comment on the 26 proposals that have come forward in the
present stage of the procedure. The Government&#146;s initial view on
which bids will proceed to stage 2 of the consultation will be based on
assessment against the invitation criteria, including affordability,
and will be announced in March. The invitation acknowledges that
decisions on restructuring will be taken in the light of overall public
expenditure, and the difficulty for any Government is that one has to
set down that overall cost envelope. However, without knowing which
proposals fulfil the criteria, it is not possible to say how many will
proceed. I believe that that is evidence of the Government&#146;s
good faith and of our genuinely open attitude and devolutionary
approach.</div>
					<a name="0702079000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
invitation adds that if the number of proposals meeting the criteria
exceeds overall affordability, the Government will prioritise proposals
on the basis of a range of factors that include delivery of desired
outcomes by the proposal&#151;benefits in services and so
on&#151;as well as use of reserves and value for moneyand
efficiency. Affordability is thereby locked in as a priority
consideration should we have to choose between proposals.</div>
					<a name="0702079000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">I genuinely believe that the
provision is a common-sense one and I commend it to the
Committee.</div>

affordability envelope, will the Minister help us further by saying how
much it is? What is the value of the affordability
envelope?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0702079000398"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> It is not possible to do that. The envelope
relates to the overall local government borrowing requirement, which is
influenced by a number of factors. The level of assets&#151;of debts
and credits at any one time&#151;is affected by many criteria, so the
answer depends on the extent of the call on reserves by the aggregate
proposals. That will determine the number of proposals that could
proceed.</div>
					<a name="0702079000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">That approach
is the responsible one to take, and I am sure that the hon. Gentleman
will support it given that he wants inflationary pressures to be kept
down, not least in relation to local
government.</div>

we know also that 10 of them are bound to fail because they conflict
directly with others. Without prejudice to which ones are successful,
we know that there are 16 places where things can happen, so we know
that 10 bids will fail. The Minister is to some extent a prisoner of
the public statements that have been made in the past 18 months by
Ministers in his Department. Ministers initially suggested that unitary
authorities were the total solution, but they gradually, and quite
properly, stepped back from that and have taken a much more permissive
and&#151;as the Minister himself sought to claim&#151;devolutionary
approach. We welcome

						</b> I accept, of course, that it is the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s job to be suspicious. To tease out clarification,
which local authorities can look at, is helpful. The situation with the
26 proposals does not contradict what Ministers have said in the period
before the last election and since. There were a number of reports that
credited Ministers with remarks that went further in terms of the
Government&#146;s desire to have more unitary councils. Indeed, some
specialist press reports said that the whole of England would be
covered by unitary arrangements. The Government have never said that.
As we all know, there has been a strong debate inside local government
itself as to what the desirable procedure is. Both those reports and
that debate reflected the lobbying&#151;if I can use that
word&#151;within local government. I remember one newspaper headline
saying that we were going to abolish all the counties. In the same
week, another 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column171" />Column number: 172</div>newspaper covering local government said that we were going to abolish
all the districts. I kept those two headlines on my desk for reference
when journalists called
up.</div>

						</b> I can assure the hon. Member for Lichfield that we
have no intention to do both. Once one has decided that a permissive
approach is the right one, one does not control what those proposals
will be. Political parties may have their views, which are then
accepted or not by their supporters. I suppose I just have to accept
that. However, by definition, that means the Government could not
prescribe in advance how many, or what type of, proposals should come
forward.</div>
					<a name="0702079000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">My right hon.
Friend the Member for South Shields (David Miliband) went out of his
way to explain to authorities during the discussions that that was why
it was not logically possible to limit the size, either minimum or
maximum, of population or geography that a successful proposal should
be, which had been the case in previous reorganisations. Once one has
accepted that there are different solutions for different
areas&#151;which might mean a large rural county area is treated
differently from an urban area&#151;one cannot prescribe the
configuration. Therefore, the debate has rendered the Government a
victim of their own permissiveness and genuine desire to be
devolutionary.</div>

did not answer the question regarding clause 7, namely that when a bid

neither in the bid nor the status quo, but suits the

alternative proposal that the boundary committee makes can include only
the whole or a part of the authority that put forward the proposal in

boundary committee could put a Machiavellian Government bid in. It

confirm that that is the case. By varying the order, the hon. Gentleman
can produce an answer that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column172" />Column number: 173</div>no one had thought of previously because, in his mind, that is the most

us directly to clause 2 and the requirement to direct. It is not
intended that the power should give the Secretary of State the
opportunity to put forward a bid that has not either been first
proposed by a local authority or subsequently, following the direction,
been put forward by a local authority as the best way forward for the
area. The reason for that, as I said before, is that the Government
cannot allow a situation whereby a solution for part of an area is not
viable in another part of the county, as would happen in the case that
we are discussing.</div>

Minister cannot impose his or her ideas anywhere. He can implement a
modification of a proposal ifthe boundary committee were to be

forward a proposal that did not have the support of the local authority
in the area concerned. It is possible that neighbouring authorities
would not have that ultimate proposal as their first choice. Were that

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0702079000409"></a>Mr.
Syms:
						</b> The clause deals with changes to boundaries. There
have always been modest changes to local government boundaries, usually
because of a growing housing estate, the sides of a road straddling a
boundary, or a rural parish being added to a borough or a town simply
because it made sense in respect of emptying the dustbins and other
basic services. During debate on the Bill, the issue was raised
occasionally of extending the boundaries of towns or cities from where
they might have been drawn in mediaeval or Victorian times because the
communities had expanded since
then.</div>
					<a name="0702079000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 9 covers a
number of constraints. Will the Minister set out in a little more
detail how the process would operate? If Leicester wanted to expand
into neighbouring boroughs, could it do so? Normally, the boundary
committee would undertake a review of all local authority boundaries. I
can understand a local authority asking the boundary committee to
review a particular boundary issue, but the Bill states that the
boundary committee may &#147;on its own initiative&#148; undertake
an inquiry. I wonder what that means. Will the boundary committee go
marauding round, trying to expand our cities and annex suburban
communities? Am I making a more sinister interpretation of the Bill? I
hope that the Minister can give an elegant reply on the
subject.</div>

								Andrew
Stunell:
						</b> My comments are addressed first to subsection
(2)(b), which refers
to</div>
					<a name="0702079000308"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the need to reflect
the identities and interests of local
communities.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0702079000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">That seems
to me to be the heart of the proposal. I hope that the Minister will
assert that that factor must be given due weight when boundary changes
are considered. Certainly in my local authority, Stockport, there have
been such changes between us and the Tameside authority and between us
and the Derbyshire authority. Those were common-sense changes to
boundaries that were no longer relevant. They were not particularly
difficult or contentious changes; they made common sense and were at
quite a low
level.</div>
					<a name="0702079000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, in the
context of the Bill, it is only right that we hear from the Minister
that he does not see clauses 8, 9 and 10 as changing existing practice
to any substantial degree. That brings me back to some of the remarks
that he made in responding to a debate on clause 2, when he referred to
this provision as though it somehow absolved him from dealing with the
point about clause 2. We are now dealing with a completely different
set of propositions, which is not directly connected, as far as one can
tell, with the proposals in clause 2. I seek the Minister&#146;s
confirmation of that point and that the extent of the provision is not
being taken beyond what one might call the common law practice of
present procedures in terms of tidying things up. Clause 8(4) contains
a list of four things that cannot be done, which is on the whole very
encouraging. Perhaps the Minister would like to underline again the
fact that there is no intention to stretch current practice in the
direction that the Opposition are concerned
about.</div>

							<b class="B">Tom
Levitt</b> (High Peak) (Lab): I rise to make a brief
contribution, having read clause 8 in some depth. I apologise to my
hon. Friend the Minister for not giving him notice of this question,
but he will appreciate why it might be particularly relevant to his
constituency and mine. Do the words &#147;local government&#148; in
the clause refer to national park boundaries, given that national parks
are arms of local government? My hon. Friend and I both have an
interest in the boundaries of a particular national park, because we
have adjacent constituencies, albeit with no road passing over the
boundary between
us.</div>

							<a name="0702079000412"></a>Robert
Neill:
						</b> My point follows on from those made by my hon.
Friend the Member for Poole and the hon. Member for Hazel Grove. I
would like some reassurance about the position of London boroughs
because, unlike in the previous portion of the Bill, the definition of
local authority and local government area in this portion&#151;by
virtue of clause 11, I think&#151;includes London boroughs. I
appreciate that it was not intended that they should form part of the
unitary changes and the associated tinkerings, but I am interested to
know for what purpose London boroughs are included in this portion of
the Bill, other than perhaps for the occasional sensible adjustment
where it is found that the odd piece of housing development strays over
the boundary between two boroughs, as I
said.</div>
					<a name="0702079000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not want to
be unduly suspicious but, asthe Minister knows, some people in
London government&#151;I am sure that such people are a great 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column174" />Column number: 175</div>minority, even in the Labour party&#151;would favour and have
occasionally advocated wholesale change to the boundaries of the London
boroughs. As the Minister knows, the Commission on London Governance,
which we referred to earlier in our proceedings, completely and on a
cross-party basis rejected any significant change of that kind. None of
the boroughs wants it.</div>
					<a name="0702079000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">Can I have some reassurance that
the measure will not be misused by someone not a million miles away
from here at City hall to set in train a reorganisation of the London
boroughs, which will make all that we have discussed in earlier clauses
on unitary authority bids look minuscule by comparison? It is clear
that the boroughs do not want such changes. The measure should be used
simply to tidy up the odd borough anomaly that we see from time to
time.</div>

							<a name="0702079000413"></a>Mr.
Dunne:
						</b> In common with Members on both sides of the
Committee, I would like the Minister to clarify a point about the
definition of local government areas in relation to city regions. The
exclusions in subsection (4) suggest that it would be possible for a
future Secretary of State to decide that he or she wished to introduce
an additional tier of elected government using the city region device.
Such a decision would not infringe any of the exemptions in subsection
(4) because existing authorities could continue. I would appreciate
clarification on whether that will be extended for city
regions.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0702079000414"></a>Mr.

made to try to get clarification has been validated by the three
interventions that we just had.</div>
					<a name="0702079000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection (4) is designed to
avoid the possibility of boundary changes effecting structural change
by the back door. The procedures would be required in any event,
irrespective of the invitation to propose changes.
</div>
					<a name="0702079000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall answer some of
the specific questions that have been raised. The measures do not
include the national parks, which are covered by separate legislation.
Of course, the authorities that have to be consulted on, or involved
in, proposals could change. It may be helpful to my hon. Friend the
Member for High Peak if I point out that the boundary committee has a
duty to take account of national parks and areas of outstanding natural
beauty when conducting its work. That is part of the definition
contained in subsection (2)(b), which mentions</div>
					<a name="0702079000309"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the need to reflect the identities
and interests of local
communities&#148;</div>
					<a name="0702079000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">and is part
of our sustainable communities strategy, although, interestingly, it is
in this and not the Sustainable Communities Bill, as I recall from my
reading.</div>
					<a name="0702079000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
question raised about London, the answer is yes. The proposals laid out
in the Bill would be required irrespective of clause 2, and are indeed
about tidying up. The assurances are in clause 8(4) to help to clarify
matters for the hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst and other
members of the Committee.</div>
					<a name="0702079000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">On city regions, there is
nothing in the Bill that allows for the idea of super-local authority
areas. Again, the issue is not subject to the measure, which is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column175" />Column number: 176</div>about the common-sense tidying up of boundaries. A review can be
instigated by a request from the Secretary of State, a local authority,
or on the initiative of the boundary committee, which has the power to
do so under existing procedures and legislation. It is part of its duty
to consider such matters, and the hon. Member for Poole will agree that
it has a good record ofdoing so.</div>
					<a name="0702079000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection (2) provides that the
boundary committee may make only recommendations for boundary change
that seem desirable to it,</div>
					<a name="0702079000310"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;having regard to the need to
secure effective and convenient local
government&#148;</div>
					<a name="0702079000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">under the 1972
definition, as we discussed earlier, and</div>
					<a name="0702079000311"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the need to reflect the identities
and interests of local communities.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0702079000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is very important. As elected
representatives, we all know that the identity and interests of a local
community cannot be determined in all cases by simple arithmetic. If
the hon. Member for Isle of Wight (Mr. Turner), to whom I
wish a speedy recovery from illness&#151;I understand that he is
doing well&#151;were on the Committee, he would be the first to make
the point that one would not want an administrative boundary for the
Isle of Wight that was not the coastline&#151;it would not make
sense. I think that Banham did that. [<span class="SmallCaps">Hon.
Members</span>: &#147;Yes.&#148;] It chopped the island in
two. I rest my
case.</div>
					<a name="0702079000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">The provision is
consistent with the boundary committee&#146;s current approach when
undertaking boundary reviews. It may recommend a boundary change, the
abolition of a local government area and/or the constitution of a new
local government area. However, it cannot make recommendations for
boundary change that would permit structural change through the back
door. That is why the Bill provides that the boundary committee may not
recommend the alteration of a boundary of a single-tier area or a
London borough that would result in the abolition of a two-tier
area&#151;to look at the point about the edge, which I think that the
London commission looked at&#151;or the alteration of the boundary of
a two-tier area that would result in the abolition of a single-tier
area or a London borough. That refers to the point made about Heathrow
airport in reverse.</div>
					<a name="0702079000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, the boundary committee
may not alter the constitution of a new local government area that
results in the abolition of an existing local government area, where
the new area includes a combination of a single-tier area and a
two-tier area. For example, the boundary committee could not recommend
that the London borough of Harrow should be merged with Watford borough
council. Furthermore, the boundary committee may not recommend the
alteration of a local government area or the creation of a new local
government area that would extend into Wales, the City of London or the
Temples.</div>

						</b> I would like a brief run around the course on clause
11, which contains rather sweeping Government powers to deal with the
implications of orders made and the ability to name new local
government areas and authorities. That is where Kellyshire comes within
the bounds of possibility, assuming some mental aberration on the part
of the Secretary of State, which I am sure will not occur.</div>
					<a name="0702079000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the face of it, these are
wide and sweeping opportunities. How on earth will the Minister
exercise such extraordinary powers? I refer to subsections (3) and (4),
which confer a whole series of powers. Subsection (4)(g) in particular
refers to</div>
					<a name="0702079000312"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the boundary
of any police area in England&#148;.</div>
					<a name="0702079000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have just been through what must have
been a bruising experience, even for the present Home Office, in
dealing with the boundaries of police areas. Attempts were made to
rearrange the police areas in fairly short order, and they all fell
foul. How does the clause relate to the boundaries of police areas?
There would be widespread concern if the creation of new local
authorities under the Bill caused any disruption to existing police
areas.</div>

mouth. Had the witness procedure only been that little bit more
extended, we could have thought ahead to these clauses and seen who
might have been able to accompany Sir Michael Lyons to give us advice
on them.</div>
					<a name="0702079000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">The boundary
of a police area in England is mentioned specifically. What is the
Minister&#146;s consideration on that? There is a series of quite
substantial powers, including powers over parish boundaries, the names
of local government areas and the names of local authorities. He will
be aware of the difficulties and debates that have raged throughout
this country following any suggestion that traditional names should be
changed or that local authorities should be named differently. Where is
the indication that there will be public consultation and a degree of
public consent to any changes made as a result of the powers in the
clause?</div>
					<a name="0702079000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think that
the Minister has got the drift of our concerns about this wide-ranging
clause. If he could enlighten us to some degree, we might be able to
come to a reasonable arrangement.</div>

							<a name="0702079000427"></a>Mr.

						</b> I rise to elaborate briefly on another provision to
back up my hon. Friend&#146;s point. Subsection (4)(e) refers
to</div>
					<a name="0702079000313"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the establishment or
membership of public bodies in any area
affected&#148;.</div>
					<a name="0702079000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">I draw the
Minister&#146;s attention to clause 23, where the definition of a
public body includes</div>
					<a name="0702079000314"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a
joint board, or joint committee, on which a local authority is
represented&#148;.</div>
					<a name="0702079000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
many local authorities, representation by local councils extends to a
vast array of bodies that would constitute public bodies under that
definition. Many of them include bodies such as charities, in which a
local authority is represented, housing associations and a host of
other bodies that, by my reading of this definition, would be caught
under the directive. It is not just a matter of the police authorities.
The definition extends across the whole gamut of the public sector
representation on bodies whether public, voluntary or
private.</div>

							<a name="0702079000428"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> The answer to the hon. Gentlemen&#146;s
questions, both from the Front and Back Benches, is that the clause
essentially translates the powers from the structural change process as
laid out in the Local Government Act 1992. There is nothing new,
therefore, in what is being proposed. What the clause relates to, which
members of the Committee have picked up, is the definition of a local
authority&#151;whether it be police or parishes is laid out in the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="0702079000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause sets
out the matters that the Secretary of State may include in an order
implementing structural or boundary change. Those matters are necessary
to achieve structural or boundary change and include, for example, the
constitution of a new local government area, the abolition of an
existing local government area, the winding up and dissolution of an
existing local authority, the establishment of an authorityas
a county council or as a district council, and consequential matters,
such as the name of a local government area, electoral matters that are
covered under clause 12 and the boundary of a parish.</div>
					<a name="0702079000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">As hon. Members have commented,
subsection (5) defines the establishment of an authority, which also
includes increasing the remit of an existing authority; for example,
where a county council takes over the functions of a district
council.</div>
					<a name="0702079000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection
(6) makes it clear that the Secretaryof State&#146;s power
to implement a proposal with modifications includes the implementation
of a proposal for an area with boundaries different from those
proposed. The Secretary of State can implement a proposal for any area.
She can change boundaries so that they do not run along existing county
or district boundaries under the procedure, as we have said before.
However, I would like to reassure the Committee that we intend to use
that power only following advice from the independent boundary
committee.</div>
					<a name="0702079000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">For example,
if we received a proposal for a single tier of local government for an
area and quite separately we received a recommendation from the
boundary committee relating to the area but with an alternative
boundary, the clause would enable us
						<div class="Column"><a name="Column179" />Column number: 180</div>to implement the proposal but with the boundaryas recommended
by the independent boundary committee. That is the extent of my
permissive review, and I hope that members of the Committee will
recognise that it is prudent to include that power in the
clause.</div>
					<a name="0702079000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection (7),
however, clarifies that the Secretary of State may not implement a
proposal that extends an area into one that is not currently under
local government control; for example, Wales, the City of London or the
Temples. The clause is translating the powers that exist under the 1992
Act.</div>
					<a name="0702079000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">In answer to the
question of the hon. Member for North-East Bedfordshire about police
authorities and other such public bodies, the provision would allow a
consequential change to a boundary&#151;to, say, a police authority
or parish&#151;to follow from a local authority boundary. That is
particularly important in combined police authority areas in which we
would want public representation through the elected
councillors&#151;nominated by the principal local
authorities&#151;who sit on such bodies to ensure that there is
coterminosity with the relevant public bodies that are listed in
subsection (4). It would, therefore, be necessary to amend the
membership of such a public body if changes such as those that I have
outlined had taken place.</div>
					<a name="0702079000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that that answers the
questions that have legitimately been asked regarding clause 11. The
provisions are rooted in the 1992 Act. The clause specifies what the
Secretary of State may include in an order that implements proposed
structural or boundary changes. It is not our desire that we should be
held responsible for the names of local council areas, which my
experience shows is often more controversial than the extent of the
boundary, the structure or anything else. I scratch my head at some of
those matters just as much as other hon. Members. I assure the
Committee that we would prefer to reach consensus on such a matter in
the local
area.</div>

							<a name="0702079000430"></a>Mr.

It is slightly more extensive than the simple requirement to ensure

one authority structure to
another.</div>
					<a name="0702079000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause

particular ward, division or electoral area. It mentions appointing
existing councillors as councillors to the new authorities for a
transitional period until the first elections for those authorities are
held. Obviously, they would be the councillors for that electoral area.
The clause also makes provision for elections to the new authority, in
case the Electoral Commission is not able to carry out a review and put
in place electoral arrangements for the new authority before it is
established. I do not believe that that has ever happened, but the
clause could, hypothetically, do so. To be fair to the hon. Gentleman,
the measure is slightly more extensive in that it covers the
transitional

Of course, under any circumstances, the elections will take place this

							<a name="0702079000433"></a>Mr.
Syms:
						</b> There are a few items that I wish to raise. Clearly,
much can go on with residuary bodies. Commitments can be entered into
by local authorities 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column181" />Column number: 182</div>for the long term. For all their benefits, private finance initiatives
can sometimes land authorities with considerable costs in the long
term, committing them to office buildings and other matters such as
computer contracts. Will the Minister reassure us about how residuary
bodies will operate and confirm that the consequence of reorganisation
will be that the successor authority does not inherit more longer term,
higher cost contracts than need be the
case?</div>
					<a name="0702079000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under the clause,
the residuary bodies will turn over most of the assets but, as we know,
a lot of local government is tied up with ancient charities, gifts of
land or school buildings which the authority is not sure whether it
owns. Things might be vested into a charitable or residuary body for
some years to come. I want reassurance from the Minister about how the
process will operate. Will the costs of running residuary bodies
dealing with the loose ends of reorganisation be taken into account for
what was described earlier as the aggregate financial
envelope?</div>
					
					<a name="0702079000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0702079000434"></a>Andrew
Stunell:
						</b> A lot of local government mythology is backed up
by some pretty clear-cut anecdotes, if not evidence that could be put
before a court, of circumstances in which councils going out of
existence have left poisoned pills for their successors in one form or
another. A notable case in my constituency goes back to 1973-74, so
such cases can be enduring. With all the attention of the Minister and
the Government on the performance of local authorities and their
regulation, will he say something about how that will be prevented from
happening in this round? What role will the residuary bodies play when
dealing with it? What will happen to the finances of the new receiving
authority if such an event takes place? The financial predictions on
which the original decision was made could easily be blown out of the
water. I should be interested to hear what the hon. Gentleman
hasto
say.</div>
					
					<a name="0702079000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0702079000435"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman has made an entirely fair and
reasonable point about residuary bodies. Indeed, I remember
representing an employee of a local authority that had been abolished
under the previous process. He had been employed to count the number of
oak trees in the area and had then been employed subsequently by the
residuary body. It took some seven years to unwind the contract, during
which time the number of trees had not changed. That is the stuff of
employment
tribunals.</div>
					<a name="0702079000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 24
deals with the contracts that local authorities may enter into during
the period. A probing amendment has been tabled to the provision, which
hopefully we shall debate. The clause under discussion enables the
Secretary of State to establish one or more corporate bodies to take
over property, rights, liabilities and the functions of those local
authorities that cease to exist as a result of either structural or
boundary changes. They are the residuary bodies to which the hon.
Gentleman refers.</div>
					<a name="0702079000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
use of residuary bodies is not, in fact, common. We do not expect that
there will be a requirement for residuary bodies in this round of
restructuring. However, it is prudent to allow a power to the Secretary
of State to provide for them until the precise implementation
arrangements for each new authority 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column182" />Column number: 183</div>are known. I am sure that members of the Committee will wish to ask
questions about such matters when we reach that stage in the
Bill.</div>
				
					
					<a name="0702079000333"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6
pm</div>
					<a name="0702079000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">A residuary body
could be used, for example, to take responsibility for any property,
liabilities or functions not transferred to the new authorities because
we do not expect that they will be required within the configuration.
For example, following a reorganisation, if there is property surplus
to the requirements of the new authority, it might be more appropriate
to transfer it to a residuary body responsible for the
property&#146;s maintenance until it is disposed of. The residuary
body would meet the costs out of its assets, and the net proceeds would
be returned at the end of that period to the new authority. That
approach was taken in the 1980s when the metropolitan counties were
abolished. There were residuary assets, and the Committee can probably
guess by now where the tree counter was
employed.</div>
					<a name="0702079000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection
(2) will allow the Secretary of State to make provision relating to a
residuary body, including provision for its constitution, membership
and power to borrow and lend money. It will also allow the Secretary of
State to require such a body to submit to him or her a scheme for its
own dissolution, because by definition residuary bodies are intended to
have ashelf
life.</div>
					<a name="0702079000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection (3)
provides for the Secretary of State to transfer any property rights,
liabilities or functions of a residuary body to any other body and
provides for him or her to give effect to a scheme for the dissolution
of that residuary body. Subsection (4) provides that the
Secretary of State may make any incidental,
consequential, transitional or supplementary provision, in particular
those mentioned in clause 15, which relate to the modification and so
on of an enactment.</div>
					<a name="0702079000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause therefore provides for the Secretary of State to establish
residuary bodies as the result of an order for structural and/or
boundary change under clause 7 or 10, whichever contains the relevant
procedure. That is the intention. As I said, it is not envisaged that
that will be required under the window of opportunity, but it might
come up through that route or through boundary changes resulting in
structural change. I therefore think it sensible for the Committee to
adopt the
clause.</div>

expenses incurred by a staff commission under this section and not
recovered from a relevant authority shall be paid by the Secretary of

					<a name="0702079000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">Can he give us any indication of where and
when he expects that provision to be triggered? Is it an indication of
concern that the costs of winding up an authority might not or should
not be met by that authority, and that the money will therefore have to
come from Parliament? If so, what provision has been made for it? What
sums are anticipated? It would be appreciated if he said something
about that.</div>
					<a name="0702079000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would
also like clarification on how the staff commission would deal with
some of the practical problems arising from reorganisation. It is a
disorienting time. During the transition, some workers may choose to
leave the authorities in transition and go to more settled neighbouring
authorities, depriving the area of key skills. In all the areas on the
fringe of London, it is easy to transfer to neighbouring areas, take
skills elsewhere and not be caught up in transition. Would the measures
involve the payment of bonuses to retain key staff during the
transition? Might short-term contracts be involved to bring in
specialised skills to cover the transition period? Who will meet the
costs?</div>
					<a name="0702079000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">Where will
pension costs lie under transition? Which authorities can be expected
to make provision for them? It is likely that authorities with very
different financial situations will be brought together. Some will have
been prudent and have significant reserves, but others will have very
few. That will affect the payment of costs and pensions and,
ultimately, the amount of council tax being paid by taxpayers. Who is
picking up the bill for the transitional process? I would be very
grateful if the Minister could enlighten us on that matter. In
particular, when does he expect the provisions in subsection (5) to be
triggered?</div>
					
					<a name="0702079000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0702079000437"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> I shall try and answer the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
questions, which once again are quite reasonable&#151;they have been
asked by trade unions, on behalf of employees, and by staff
associations during this and previous rounds of consultation.</div>
					<a name="0702079000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">The employer of local authority
employees is, of course, the relevant local authority and not the
Government. The hon. Gentleman made the point about parliamentary
accounts. Furthermore, on the 89 funds that make up the local
government pension scheme, the local council or councils&#151;they
are combined for the purposes of the pension fund&#151;are the
employer. In that case, the Government are the regulator, given that it
is a funded scheme. Of course, the points about potential redundancy
pensions under such arrangements are very important indeed. It might be
worth while for the Committee to note that the new regulations for the
local government pension scheme are currently subject to consultation
in a process that is coincidental to the proposal before the
Committee.</div>
					<a name="0702079000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
will try to deal, therefore, with transitionary periods and is similar
to the proposal that has been put forward in previous reorganisations.
I imagine that the new unitary authorities created through the process
will want to take a fresh look at their management and staffing
structures. Indeed, in large part, proposals for savings and
efficiencies would probably look at staffing costs, given that those
account for about 50 per cent. of local government&#146;s total
expenditure&#151;80 per cent. if one includes the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column184" />Column number: 185</div>commissioned or contracted sector. Nevertheless, the Government
obviously recognise that staff will be anxious about the restructuring
and, therefore, we will be holding discussions with those involved in
local government and groups such as the local government employers body
and public sector trade unions in preparing for
implementation&#151;should any go ahead through the current window of
opportunity.</div>
					<a name="0702079000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause, therefore, allows the Secretary of State to establish one or
more staff commissions to consider staffing arrangements, transfers and
problems that might arise as a result of orders for structural or
boundary changes&#151;the two procedures that might lead to such
situations. Staff commissions may also be established to advise the
Secretary of State on the steps necessary to safeguard the interests of
staff affected by such an order. That provision is broadly consistent
with previous legislation. In the reorganisations of the 1990s, staff
commissions were established with the remit to advise the Secretary of
State on the transfer of staff and to ensure that transfer schemes
established by local authorities complied with regulations made by the
Secretary of State.</div>
					<a name="0702079000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I said, staff anxieties are high on our agenda. Subsection (2) provides
that a staff</div>
					<a name="0702079000320"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;commission
can be established for the whole or any part of
England.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0702079000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">That will give
us flexibility depending on the proposals that come forward and will
allow the Secretary of State to establish a staff commission to
consider matters relating to an individual area, or number of areas,
depending on the circumstances. Subsection (3) provides that the
Secretary of State may direct the</div>
					<a name="0702079000321"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;staff commission with respect to
their
procedure.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0702079000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection (4)
will enable the Secretary of State to direct an authority or a
residuary body, relating back to clause 17, to provide the information
requested, implement any advice given by the staff commission, and to
pay the staff commission any expenses it incurs as a result of work
requested by the authority so, again, it is not a cost on the council
tax payer. Under subsection (6), the Secretary of State may wind up a
staff commission.</div>
					<a name="0702079000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
do not anticipate that funding from central sources will be required,
to address the question of the hon. Member for North-East Bedfordshire.
However, as happens often in local government, a local authority could
undertake functions and is responsible for pay and rations, as it were,
even when the functions are undertaken on behalf of the wider
community, the national Government or other agencies. Such instances
are many and varied. Clause 18 gives the Secretary of State some
flexibility to ensure that the burdens that rightfully fall on central
Government are met by them and not by local government.</div>
					<a name="0702079000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am confident that the clause
reflects previous practice and gives a wide flexibility for staffing
arrangements. However, I emphasise that the specific concerns of
individual local authorities and the public sector unions will be
subject to discussion between those bodies as the measure is rolled
out.</div>

							<a name="0702079000438"></a>Mr.
Syms:
						</b> I beg to move amendment No. 52, in
clause 24, page 15, line 28, at
end insert&#151;</div>
					<div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(5) Nothing in
this Chapter or in any direction from the Secretary of State shall
restrict a relevant authority from utilising its financial reserves to
reduce its budget requirement for council tax
purposes&#146;.</div>
					<a name="0702079000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
is a very good amendment. We have started to test some of the
propositions to do with the financial implications of dealing with the
winding up and merging of authorities. I have a few general questions
on the matter, and I tabled the amendment because I am sure that the
Minister has a very good explanation to offer to the
Committee.</div>
					<a name="0702079000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some
authorities will have large reserves, and some will have small
reserves. There is an argument that large reserves are inefficient
because they result from overtaxing people. My hon. Friend the Member
for Shrewsbury and Atcham (Daniel Kawczynski) told the House about the
reserves of the authority in his area on Second Reading. What will be
the practice when an authority with large reserves comes together with
an authority with small reserves? Will a number be put together by
simple aggregate? Will an attempt be made to return what some might
argue to be the proceeds of overtaxing to the people whose council
holds large reserves? There are other issues: some authorities have
large insurance funds, others may not. In other words, there will be
financial imbalances when two authorities meet. How does one deal with
those
imbalances?</div>
				
					
					<a name="0702079000334"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.15
pm</div>
					<a name="0702079000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister did
not have the opportunity the other day&#151;one talks about
staffing&#151;to address the single status issue, which some
authorities have dealt with more speedily than others. If two
authorities are put together, that will lead to financial imbalances.
Under clause 24, we are trying to find out how we will proceed in
dealing with financial imbalances between authorities. Will it just be
a case of hard luck? An area comes together, everything is aggregated
and, as the Minister said, people go for the lowest common denominator
in terms of council
tax.</div>
					<a name="0702079000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 52
is concerned about financially irresponsible authorities doing what I
suggested a moment ago. We were thinking of a situation in which an
authority has reserves and just returns the money in the last year
before it is merged with another authority. That is why we tabled the
amendment, which
states:</div>
					<a name="0702079000322"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Nothing
in this Chapter or in any direction from the Secretary of State shall
restrict a relevant authority from utilising its financial reserves to
reduce its budget requirement for council tax
purposes.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0702079000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">That would deal
with the Shrewsbury issue. It would allow Shrewsbury simply to give the
money back, if it wished to do that, before it was merged against its
will with another
authority.</div>
					<a name="0702079000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have
discussed staff imbalances. We want the Government to say what happens
with financial imbalances. As part of the overall submission, have
authorities to discuss how they will deal with such imbalances in
arriving at the new arrangements with the consent of the
people?</div>

							<a name="0702079000439"></a>Andrew
Stunell:
						</b> I want to take the point made by the hon. Member
for Poole a step further. As I understand it, one of the criteria that
the Secretary of State will have in mind is the council tax levels that
will arise in the combined authority. I think that I heard the Minister
say that the Government would expect that not to exceed the lower of
the levels that might be in force in the eight or more unitary
authorities. Perhaps he could underline that or not, as the case may
be. It is clearly relevant to the disposal of any reserves that might
be held by one or other of the authorities. It might well be that, to
achieve what has been described, the reserves held by one authority
would of necessity be applied to reduce the charges in another
authority or what was previously another authority area.</div>
					<a name="0702079000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">I may not be expressing myself
clearly, but I hope that the Minister can understand the points that I
am making. Clearly, that could be an aggravating feature, if I can put
it that way, of the circumstances that arose post merger. I would be
interested and grateful if the Minister gave us a response to that as
well as to the issues raised by the hon. Member for
Poole.</div>
					
					<a name="0702079000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0702079000440"></a>Mr.
Dunne:
						</b> I support the amendment moved by my hon. Friend the
Member for Poole, which has my name attached to it. I would like to
elaborate a little on the issue, as he was kind enough to refer to my
neighbouring authority and it does illustrate the importance of the
amendment and the difficulties posed by the clause as
drafted.</div>
					<a name="0702079000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">As we all
know, councils have assets of very variable amount and quality. That is
not a criticism of any individual council administration. Those assets
tend to have been built up, accumulated or spent over years, decades
and, in some cases, probably even longer than that. That is a result of
the practice and stewardship of successive councils and successive
Government policies, so this is not a party political point at all; it
is just a fact of life. Some councils are well run; some are not so
well run. Some retain substantial assets deliberately for a rainy day,
and those assets may be, as my hon. Friend said, large cash
balances&#151;for example, from the sale of housing stock where they
have not as yet spent the receipts. I am sure that, had my hon. Friend
the Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham been lucky enough to serve on the
Committee, he would be making the point more forcefully in the case of
Shrewsbury and Atcham than I
could.</div>
					
					<a name="0702079000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0702079000441"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> And probably at greater
length.</div>
					
					<a name="0702079000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0702079000442"></a>Mr.
Dunne:
						</b> I could not possibly comment on the
Minister&#146;s sedentary intervention, but I am sure that any
contribution made by my hon. Friend would be an impressive
one.</div>
					<a name="0702079000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">Other councils
have land&#151;indeed, Shrewsbury and Atcham borough council still
has farms on its books. Some of the ceremonial assets that might be up
for sale as a result of having a unitary authority might also have
value.</div>
					<a name="0702079000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">Other councils
have significant debts. If the Minister will bear with me, I shall
illustrate that some councils in Shropshire have significant debts. The
county council has substantial debts, which are in the hundreds of
millions of pounds&#151;they total at least &#163;100 million. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column187" />Column number: 188</div>
						That situation compares with the assets of the other
councils. The debts might not be purely financial ones, because
councils may have commitments and liabilities.
</div>
					<a name="0702079000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">Irresponsible
administrations might enter into liabilities ahead of elections for
party political advantage. Again, I do not regard that as a party
political point, and I am sure that none of us approve of such an
approach. I represent Ludlow, as I am sure the Minister knows. There is
an interesting contrast within Shropshire between the financial
circumstances of those who are proponents of unitary authorities and
those councils that are opposed to unitary authorities. As I have
mentioned, the county council, which is the primary advocate, has
significant debts.</div>
					<a name="0702079000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
should perhaps have declared at the outset that I still serve on South
Shropshire district council, which is an advocate of having a unitary
authority. It has sold its housing stock and has invested the proceeds,
so its receipts have now been depleted to the point where it is
operating at the minimum level of prudent reserves without entering
into debt. In the past year or so, it has been spending its reserves to
fund its priorities. It would be coming into a unitary authority with
neither assets nor liabilities and would broadly be in balance. That
contrasts with some of the councils that are opposed to having a
unitary authority.</div>
					<a name="0702079000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have already referred to Shrewsbury and Atcham borough council, which
has significant cash, although it has some commitments because of how
it plans to spend that. One of its primary concerns about having a
unitary authority is that those plans might be taken over by a
different authority with different objectives and that much of the
money instead of being spent in Shrewsbury will be spent elsewhere in
the unitary authority area. That is one of the strongest
reasonsfor concern about the proposals in the town of
Shrewsbury.</div>
					
					<a name="0702079000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0702079000443"></a>Patrick
Hall:
						</b> Is the hon. Gentleman suggesting that a council that
is not in favour of the situation into which it is getting bound might
prefer to make a huge one-off reduction in council tax as a way of
getting rid of reserves rather than to favour investment in the longer
term, albeit in a wider area?</div>
					
					<a name="0702079000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0702079000444"></a>Mr.
Dunne:
						</b> I am grateful for that intervention, because I
shall go on to explain the ramifications of the different asset
positions, if the Committee will bear with me.</div>
					<a name="0702079000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the hon. Gentleman rightly
says, the amendment is concerned with the use of reserves for a
potential annual council tax adjustment. I am not, for one moment,
suggesting that substantial reserves should be used to wipe out the
council tax bill so that residents can be told that they can have a
free ride for a year. Such an approach would be
irresponsible.</div>
					<a name="0702079000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">These
decisions are critical at the margin. This illustrates the fundamental
problem: different balances of assets will give rise to significant
problems in determining how the assets will be deployed in a new
authority. The individual councils that are responsible for the assets
at present will not be responsible for them in the future, and nor will
the residents, whose assets in the broadest sense have given rise to
that capital account. They might not bear the benefit in the future. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column188" />Column number: 189</div>
					</div>
					<a name="0702079000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">Bridgnorth district
council is opposed to having a unitary authority. It retains its
housing stock and therefore has a substantial capital asset, which is
not cashable&#151;it could not be used, as the hon. Gentleman
suggests, to adjust council tax. It is an asset, and the council has
decided not to cash it in at this point. In a future council
environment, a decision on whether to release the value in the housing
stock would be taken not by Bridgnorth residents, but by a unitary
authority. That is another strong reason why residents in that district
are concerned about the possibility of a unitary authority imposing the
sale of council housing.</div>
					<a name="0702079000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are a number of areas in
which I seek reassurance from the Minister. One is whether residents of
an area could gain any comfort in relation to asset disposal upon
change to unitary status. If the unitary authority decided to dispose
of assets&#151;for whatever purpose, whether reductions in council
tax, as the amendment suggests, or other purposes&#151;could
reinvestment and deployment of those assets be ring-fenced to the
relevant area?</div>
					<a name="0702079000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
Shropshire, we have just decriminalised parking offences, and each town
is introducing a residents parking scheme, which is having an impact on
the revenues from the off-street car parks that are owned by the
district councils. Revenues from off-street car parking
charges&#151;a locally derived source of income&#151;are at present
used to serve the district. If the districts were subsumed into a
unitary authority, would those revenues be used to subsidise parking
schemes elsewhere in the county? Such issues are very live to the
debate in Shropshire. They come down to the question of who makes
decision about assets as one makes the transition from one local
authority to another.</div>
					<a name="0702079000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the issue of transition, I
think that we all have some sympathy with the intent of clause 24,
which I shall address, if I may, Mr. Benton, when we reach
the clause stand part debate. Nevertheless, if the clause remains
unfettered by the amendment that has sensibly been suggested by
Opposition Members, there are a great many issues as to how the powers
in the clause will be exercised. I hope that the amendment will be
supported. If it is not, the Secretary of State&#146;s power to
direct will effectively emasculate the ability of councils that have
reserves to use them&#151;quite properly&#151;for their local
area.</div>
					
					<a name="0702079000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0702079000445"></a>Michael
Fabricant:
						</b> I am motivated to speak in the debate partly
because I am so fed up with hearing about Shropshire and Bedfordshire.
It is about time we heard about Lichfield.</div>
					<a name="0702079000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am far too young to recall the
last substantial boundary changes in 1973. I am told, however, that
there was a major fight, because there was a Lichfield urban council
and a Lichfield rural council. My hon. Friend the Member for Ludlow
mentioned ceremonial objects. If you were to visit Lichfield now,
Mr. Benton, you would find, in the small museum in the St.
Mary&#146;s centre, a huge amount of gold and other ceremonial
objects that came from Lichfield urban district council. Incidentally,
whereas the House of Commons has a so-called gold Mace that is actually
just silver gilt,and pretty cheap, Lichfield has two solid
gold maces&#151;one from King James, and one, I believe, from King
Charles
II.</div>
				
					
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column189" />Column number: 190</div>

pm</div>
					<a name="0702079000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">That was a
digression. As my hon. Friend the Member for Ludlow said, we must
consider how assets will be distributed, but I want to make a point
that has not been made so far. There may, just may, conceivably be a
time when it is in an area&#146;s interest to have a unitary
authority&#151;not in Shropshire, we know that, but in some other
area, though I can hardly imagine it.
</div>
					<a name="0702079000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that the
Minister can reassure people here. It would be very wrong if a local
referendum were to say that we did not want a merger, because our
assets&#151;be they two gold maces in Lichfield or assets held in
reserve&#151;would be distributed among a whole series of spendthrift
councils. A referendum could well end up with a nay vote, if the
Minister cannot now with his golden tongue&#151;if not golden
mace&#151;reassure the Committee that assets will not be distributed
in a way that prevents the prudent council from benefiting from such a
merger.</div>

							<a name="0702079000447"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> This is one of those occasions, Mr.
Benton, when the brief from one&#146;s officials is not adequate.
Quite why we did not anticipate the intervention will be the subject of
a discussion in the Department tomorrow morning. That the Lichfield
mace would be an asset is perfectly obvious. [<span class="SmallCaps">Hon.
Members:</span> &#147;Maces.&#148;] If the plural of mace is
maces, I will accept the justice of that. Had I known about it, I would
have had my beady eyes on it for reduction of council tax purposes. Now
that I do, I may re-examine the direction order and look at what powers
theremay
be.</div>
					<a name="0702079000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">My difficulty is
compounded by the fact that I can give the reassurances that the hon.
Members for Lichfield and for Ludlow are seeking, but their amendment
would not do what they say. I commend the hon. Gentlemen for the
amendment, which raises an important point and is quite ingenious.
However, it would allow the very bingeing of councils with reserves and
assets which the hon. Gentlemen wished to avoid. I will accept it at
face value, because it gives me the opportunity to explain the
Government&#146;s purpose. My third difficulty is that it may be more
helpful to the Committee if I can just briefly explain the purpose of
the clause and then refer to the
amendment.</div>
					<a name="0702079000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
allows the Secretary of State to make a direction requiring an
authority that may be dissolved as a result of these procedures to
obtain consent from herself or from such authority or person as she may
specify before it can dispose of land over &#163;100,000 in value,
enter into contracts or include an amount of financial reserves when
calculating its budget requirement for council tax purposes. I refer
the Committee to pages 9 and 14 of the document &#147;Invitations to
councils in England&#148; on making proposals for future unitary
structures, where the policy on the treatment of assets is dealt with.
The intention of the clause and the reason that I think it sensible to
recognise the point of the amendment, but to resist it, is precisely to
ensure that those authorities with reserves are not plundered in a
circumstance where a unitary authority is to be created.</div>

being prudent and having some money just in case. It goes on to
say:</div>

revenue reserves should be the final option considered, both because of
the need to preserve a contingency to meet future pressures and because
use of reserves adversely affects the fiscal aggregates in a given
year, increasing spending but not receipts and so placing further
pressure on the Government&#146;s fiscal
rules&#148;.</div>
					<a name="0702079000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
intention behind the amendment is to allow the use of reserves to
reduce budget requirements for council tax purposes. It strikes at the
point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Bedford and other hon.
Members that the more prudent position is to safeguard in the medium
and long term rather than in the short
term.</div>
					<a name="0702079000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">I turn briefly to
contracts, as opposed to reserves. Consent must be sought under the
clause for any capital contract under which consideration
exceeds&#163;1 million or which includes a term allowing the
consideration payable to be varied. That means that an authority may
not enter without consent into a capital contract for less than
&#163;1 million if provision in the contract means that its price can
go up. That will ensure that an authority cannot tie the hands of a
future
authority.</div>

							<b class="B">Andrew
Gwynne</b> (Denton and Reddish) (Lab): As I believe my hon.
Friend the Minister is coming on to say, the opposite of using reserves
is building up debts. That is where he has perhaps learned lessons from
the past. It is no surprise that a number of municipal facilities date
from between 1970 and 1974. Indeed, in my constituency the former
Denton urban district council decided after almost 80 years to build
the swimming pool that it had been campaigning for, knowing that it
would never have to repay the money that it borrowed and that that
would be a problem for the new Tameside metropolitan borough council.
That decision might have been right for Denton but it was certainly
wrong for the new council. Does my hon. Friend agree that the clause
will set that situation right for the
future?</div>

to act in the long-term interests of the council tax payer.</div>
					<a name="0702079000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">The proposals on assets and
contracts must be taken in the context of the requirement, highlighted
by the hon. Member for Hazel Grove, that the council tax payer should
not suffer as a result and should only benefit from the requirement to
equalise to the lower level. The invitation proposals require
authorities to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column191" />Column number: 192</div>
						put forward figures and plans to do that. They may
not therefore enter into a contract that is not a capital contract
without consent if the consideration exceeds &#163;100,000 and the
contract would run beyond a date specified in the direction or if,
under the terms of the contract, its period could be extended beyond
that date. </div>
					<a name="0702079000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
many examples from previous restructuring rounds of authorities that
were to be dissolved acting irresponsibly in relation to assets,
disposals and contracts. The clause is designed to ensure that that
does not happen again and that old authorities do not dispose of
valuable land, enter into long-term contracts or apply financial
reserves above a specified limit to reduce council tax in the short
term. Such actions could have a negative effect on the new
authority.</div>
					<a name="0702079000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of course,
the Secretary of State or other person specified in a direction may
consent to the disposal, to the authority entering into a contract or
to the use of reserves. The Secretary of State may specify that consent
must be sought from the new authority if it has already been
established, which would be appropriate as such decisions would affect
the new authority. The assets and liabilities of the old authority will
of course be transferred to the new, as has been the case in previous
restructuring.</div>

say something about the commensurate date? Will it be retrospective and
how will he stop, let us say, contracts being let which might do all
the things to which the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish drew our
attention? Back in 1974, we had a case or two in my own constituency as
well. I think that it was quite common. I would just be interested to
know how the Minister is going to erect a fence that prevents that
happening in quite the way he
hopes.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0702079000451"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman is right. That is what these
clauses are designed to do. The Secretary of State&#146;s power under
the clause requires an authority that is going to be dissolved to
obtain consent under the circumstances that I outlined. I hope that it
is clear that this clause does not provide a draconian power. It is not
designed, or does not seek, to remove the discretion of local
authorities to spend a reasonable amount of reserves for the purposes
of reducing their budget requirement for council tax or other
purposes.</div>
					<a name="0702079000276"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman will remember past debates about capping powers and the
relationship between reserves and revenues. Those debates highlighted
the various circumstances described by the hon. Member for Ludlow in
which very similar councils and neighbouring councils had wildly
different levels of reserves, often as a result of the sale of housing
or land assets that had been inherited in a number of ways, or in some
cases due, for example, to the ownership of ports and
harbours.</div>
					<a name="0702079000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before I
answer the hon. Gentleman&#146;s question, I will say that the
amendment would mean that those reserves that would otherwise have been
available to the new authority would no longer be available. It would 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column192" />Column number: 193</div>
						artificially, as it were, lower the council tax
level in that area for a short period which would make it harder, if
not impossible, for the new authority to equalise the council tax level
across the new area as a whole. Those actions could undermine a new
authority&#146;s financial position in terms of both the cost of
restructuring and its future consideration of equalising services and
service provision. Finally, and importantly, in a given year, an undue
use of reserves places further pressure, not just on that council, but
on the Government&#146;s fiscal rules as it adversely affects the
fiscal aggregate by increasing spending but not receipt.</div>
					<a name="0702079000278"></a><div class="hs_Para">The timing of that is important
because authorities are no doubt debating these points as we speak.
Such a direction can be given only following Royal Assent. In other
words, it is quite rightly subject to the will of this House. However,
contracts, on which such a direction can be made, can be taken into
account from31 December 2006 and that is a reasonable point.
Therefore, there is a time scale built in for
contracts.</div>
					<a name="0702079000279"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I
do not believe that I am being dictatorial in resisting this amendment.
Neither do I believe that the clause is dictatorial. It is based on the
common-sense experience that we have heard from Members on both sides
of the Committee this evening. It is not dictatorial in restricting
what local authorities can and cannot do with their reserves. It is
about prudence and best value for the council tax payer in the areas
affected in the medium and long term. I therefore ask the Committee to
resist the amendment and to support the
clause.</div>

							<a name="0702079000452"></a>Mr.
Syms:
						</b> I thank the Minister for that explanation. To be
honest, we are all a bit schizophrenic about this issue depending on
the balances that our own authorities have. Our amendment could be
dubbed &#147;the Shrewsbury amendment&#148; given that one
couldsee in those circumstances imbalances between
neighbouring authorities, which might, I suspect, be one of the reasons
that there would be less consent for and consensus on any kind of
reorganisation of local government. People will look towards their
pocket book, their baubles and various other things. Clearly, one has
to look at efficient and effective local government, but there are
going to be all sorts of imbalances and some of those will balance out.
One authority may have more assets, another more cash and another a
more efficient staffing structure; one hopes that they all balance out.
I suspect that underpinning the whole process is, ultimately, the
consent of the people in those areas, and that financial or other
imbalances are more likely to lead to non-consent to merger. That is
why Shrewsbury, Shropshire and other counties, start to come
up.</div>
					<a name="0702079000281"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clearly, it would
be irresponsible of one authority to use its reserves in one year, thus
giving its successor authority difficulties. Nevertheless, there might
be a degree of rough justice for an area that finds itself in a
particular financial situation and, having been merged into a rather
larger organisation, then finds that that is somewhat lost. However,
given the Minister&#146;s golden tongue, which we heard about
earlier, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div>

							<a name="0702079000453"></a>Mr.
Dunne:
						</b> Having forewarned that I might like to speak during
clause stand part, I would not want to disappoint the
Minister.</div>
					<a name="0702079000285"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to
pick up on the word used by my hon. Friend the Member for Poole:
&#147;consent&#148;. That gets to the heart of the difficulty with
the clause that I alluded to earlier. Where an area has a disparate
disposition of assets, with some councils that are relatively well off
and some that are in debt, much the best way to avoid a sense of
unfairness residing within the population is simply not to impose a
unitary structure on those councils against their will&#151;that is,
for the Secretary of State not to impose such a structure against the
will of the people as well expressed. The debate on that issue
highlights that fact. The Minister himself made the point well in his
earlier remarks that the Government do not intend to impose a structure
unless there is a broad cross-section of support. It says that in the
invitation to bid, and that is an appropriate way to proceed.</div>
					<a name="0702079000286"></a><div class="hs_Para">When the Minister considers all
the issues arising from our debate, I hope that he will recognise that
financial disparity is a critical one. It is particularly relevant for
those areas where local authorities have not sold the housing stock.
Bridgnorth district council, which, he may be surprised to hear, is run
by a Conservative administration, decided only last year not to dispose
of housing stock. Having consulted tenants it decided that that was the
right thing to do for its area, when it might have been thought that
the authority&#146;s natural instinct would have been to realise the
asset. That is not a party political point; it is about fairness and a
sense of injustice, for if the local council housing were sold by a
unitary authority and the funds spent to improve housing in some other
part of the county, it would be regarded as a very unfortunate
consequence of restructuring local
government.</div>
					
					<a name="0702079000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0702079000454"></a>Robert
Neill:
						</b> I promise members that I will not be going into the
history of what happened to the former Greater London Council&#146;s
civic regalia, or how I ended up in possession of Lady
Dartmouth&#146;s settee as leader of the fire authority. That must
wait for another occasion, because only one champagne moment is
permitted&#151;even at 10 to 7 at night.</div>
					<a name="0702079000288"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have a genuine inquiry with
which I hope the Minister can help. Under clause 24(2), a
&#147;relevant authority&#148; for these purposes is a local
authority that is, in effect, caught by either clause 7 or clause 10.
Looking at clause 30, which is the definition clause for this part of
the Bill, the definition of a &#147;local authority&#148; includes
&#147;a London borough council&#148;. We know that clause 7, which
deals with the unitary scenario, does not apply to London borough
councils, but clause 10 does, yet the Minister told me earlier that
clause 10 is simply for tidying up boundaries. Why, then, do we need to
have reference to London boroughs in a passage envisaging the disposal
of assets when a local authority is dissolved? If the Minister is
right, that provision could surely be removed for these
purposes.</div>

							<a name="0702079000455"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> The Committee will be pleased toknow that
I will not comment on Shropshire or Shrewsbury&#151;it would be wrong
of me to do so. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column194" />Column number: 195</div>However, the Committee will be aware that different types of authorities
have different types of assets and, because of historical
circumstances, the assets can vary widely. The local authority in my
own area recently sold a Lowry painting in which, it would argue, it
had wisely invested some 40 or 50 years&#146; ago and which provided
a good return on its investment. Others would argue that it was
disposing of an asset that belonged to the people in order to keep
council tax down. Those are the types of argument raised.</div>
					<a name="0702079000290"></a><div class="hs_Para">The county councils and
upper-tier authorities are education authorities where reserves are
held in schools and are now the asset of the school, not of the local
authority. Similarly, with housing disposals, there can be different
situations in different areas. I do not think it would be wise to stray
down the path of
Shropshire&#151;</div>

					<a name="0702079000297"></a><div class="hs_Para">On a point that the hon. Member
for Bromley and Chislehurst made regarding London, it is already
possible, and will still be possible if the measure is effected, for a
procedural boundary change between two authorities to result in the
creation of a new authority. It would not be possible for the Mayor of
London to do that under current legislation. That is why the provision
is drafted as it is. There are no proposals in the Bill to encourage
such circumstances and the boundary committee is independent. I hope
that that clarifies the matter for the hon. Gentleman. Clause 7 and
earlier clauses of the Bill on restructuring do not affect the
situation in London in that regard. On the basis of that, I ask that
the clause be agreed
