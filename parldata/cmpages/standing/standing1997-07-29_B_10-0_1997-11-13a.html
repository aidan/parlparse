</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Steve Webb </B>(Northavon): I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
Thank you, Mr. O'Hara, and good morning. We originally thought that new clause 4 would take the form of an amendment to clause 1, but it seemed more sensible to make it a separate clause.
<P>
The idea behind an adjudication standards commissioner is essentially to provide safeguards and guarantees of standards within the Government's proposed streamlined appeals process. One might well ask--I have, indeed, been asked this once this morning--whether we need to add another bureaucrat to those already involved in the appeals process. The answer to that is--[Hon. Members: ``Yes or no?'']--yes, we need another bureaucrat because of the Government's determination to get the process right first time.
<P>
The adjudication standards commissioner would be set apart from the Benefits Agency, the Child Support Agency and so forth. He would be an independent scrutineer of decision making, training and guidance. It has been suggested that there is already provision for scrutiny of the appeals process through the National Audit Office. Its remit is, however, so wide that any investigation is likely to be ad hoc and insufficiently detailed to provide the on-going and thorough safeguards that the appeals process needs.
<P>
It has been mentioned that the president of the tribunals service will produce reports, which would be welcome. Those would, however, inevitably be incomplete and he would encounter only those decisions that went to appeal, which are only a fraction of those made. It has been suggested that the chief executives of the agencies could provide a report, but such a report would inevitably be on their own employees and performance. Independent scrutiny of the appeals process would be beneficial not only to the process, but to the perception of it as fair and independent.
<P>
One of the issues raised by the new clause is that the adjudication standards commissioner would issue guidance, which is obviously most relevant in grey areas and on issues of contention, as we have already discussed. It would be inappropriate for the chief executive of an agency to issue guidance because he has, not to put too fine a point on it, a pecuniary interest in its outcome. Guidance issued particularly on grey areas needs to be seen to come from someone who is independent of the appeals process.
<P>
Working for the adjudication standards commissioner would not be a gravy train or a life-long career; nor would vast armies of officials support him. This would, however, represent a modest investment in independent scrutiny, which is presumably what the National Audit Office was supposed to provide. A body that is specific to the benefits appeals process could help us to get more decisions right first time, produce fewer appeals and ultimately save the Government money. In that spirit, I hope that the Minister will accept the new clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howard Flight </B>(Arundel and South Downs): I was the person who asked the hon. Member for Northavon (Mr. Webb) whether we needed a further layer of bureaucracy. The proposal sounds attractive because it seeks to address the concerns--mentioned earlier in the proceedings by Conservative Members--that too much power is being given to the Secretary of State, which is likely to lead to injustice. However, it is inevitable that a body such as that proposed in the new clause will become empire building. The situation is not quite analogous to the regulation of financial services or Ofwat's regulation of the water companies, where there is a natural role for an industry regulator.
<P>
Although I am sympathetic to the objectives of the new clause, I fear that it will clutter up the social security system and will not achieve the key objective of the Bill, which is the streamlining of that system. Although we can question the legal methods--which should perhaps be more honest and open--by which the Bill will achieve its objectives, the new clause is likely to undermine those objectives. It carries the risk of setting up another body to which people would start making complaints, although it would have no legal power to act as a tribunal, and would be yet another organisation cluttering up a complex process.
<P>
Sympathetic as I am to the objectives of the new clause, I believe that it runs contrary to what hon. Members on both sides of the Committee are trying to achieve through the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Oliver Letwin </B>(West Dorset): The Committee will be aware that the new clause is similar in many respects to a provision that we tried to introduce by amendment much earlier in the proceedings. We suggested that there should be a report on the workings of the new system. The term of 12 months was mentioned, but we intended that a report should be made not every 12 months, but at the end of the first 12 months. We proposed a one-off measure, which I continue to believe would have been helpful, not least because it might have allayed some of the genuine fears that have given rise to the new clause.
<P>
	Conservative Members share those fears, some of which relate to due process. I do not need to rehearse--indeed, I am sure that the Minister's patience would not last while I did so--all the arguments that we have made about due process in relation to various clauses. The lack of safeguards on process has given rise to the new clause and so we are highly sympathetic to it, as my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs (Mr. Flight) has said.
<P>
Although I do not believe that there is anything between Conservative and Liberal Democrat Members when it comes to those fears and the acknowledgement of them, the question is whether the remedy is acceptable. A remedy can often be too effective and kill the patient. My hon. Friend was arguing effectively that the new clause would kill the patient, which in this case is the Bill, the sole merit of which is to make the solution of problems more expeditious and make the system more efficient. It certainly has no other great merit in terms of its effects on English law, as we have repeatedly pointed out.
<P>
Our willingness to support the Bill and acknowledgement that it was originally proposed by a Conservative Government arises from the fact that that Government considered, as do this Government, that there was an urgent necessity to improve the effectiveness of the social security system. There are awesome attachments to the word ``commissioner''; as we have been reminded frequently during the proceedings, a commissioner stands above a mere appeals tribunal, constitutes the basis for precedent and has a particular quasi-judicial role. To create such a body and to endow it with a considerable role, similar to but going just beyond that with which an ombudsman is traditionally endowed, would be burdensome, perhaps to the extent that, as my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs has said, it would vitiate the entire enterprise.
<P>
Let me draw out the ombudsman analogy a little more to try to persuade our Liberal Democrat colleagues of the merit of those observations. An ombudsman does not keep matters under review. Most of the time, he is a passive creature who sits and waits. People come to an ombudsman with complaints. When a complaint is made, his first task is to identify whether he can properly take it on board. As the Committee will know, an ombudsman typically rejects a large proportion of complaints.
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> I recognise the good faith in which the hon. Gentleman is making his remarks. I may be pre-empting him, but we do not envisage an ombudsman-like role for the commissioner. We do not expect people to ring up the adjudication standards commissioner to say that their case was wrongly handled--that is the point of the appeals process. Our proposal would allow a broad overview and a check that the system was working to save public money that might be wasted on needless appeals.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I believe that I understand that difference; indeed, it is to that difference that I want to allude.
<P>
An ombudsman is passive. He wades through complaints and usually rejects them. In the few cases in which he is active, he is very active--and very effective, precisely because he is so focused. An abuse identified by an ombudsman has previously been identified by a complainant--it has been precisely identified as falling within the ombudsman's remit--and he can often cure the abuse; but in this case, as the hon. Member for Northavon has said, the commissioner's functions are more wide-ranging and more proactive--they are not focused on individual problems.
<P>
If I have understood its intent correctly, the new clause relates to a general overview of the workings of the Department of Social Security, certainly those matters which are dealt with by the Bill. The adjudication standards commissioner would therefore have to satisfy himself that he understood all aspects of the system and whether things were being done in the right spirit, with the right backing, in the right conditions and with the right training--some of these aspects are mentioned in the new clause. That is similar to the role of the regulator of a former nationalised industry or, in some respects, the role of a Select Committee.
<P>
The role that is being established is not that of a parliamentary commissioner--an ombudsman--but something quite new. A novel and, in some domains, interesting concept in English administrative practice is being put in place--the commissioner would regulate the Secretary of State. We have regulators of entities which are not Government bodies, but to subject a Secretary of State--even the current Secretary of State, if I can say that without offending the Minister--to regulation by a proactive regulator would create tension in administrative practice.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Webb:</B> Someone will be carrying out that scrutiny and it is proposed that the principal agent should be the chief executive of the Benefits Agency. We propose that he should be removed in favour of someone who does not have a financial interest in the advice that is given or an interest in covering up any hostile comment which might arise. Does not the hon. Gentleman agree that it would be better to have an independent person rather than someone on the inside to oversee those matters?
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I can appreciate the force of that argument. The senior official certainly has a vested interest. In fact, it is more than a vested interest. The senior official is an employee--in law or certainly de facto--of the Secretary of State and therefore cannot be a regulator of the Secretary of State. Some functions of the chief executive or permanent secretary can be independent to a certain extent, but there is no question of their being regulators of the Secretary of State.
<P>
The hon. Member for Northavon sees an advantage in giving the commissioner some power over and against the Secretary of State. That is a new, interesting and deep proposition, which I fear could give rise, as my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs said, to great complexities in adminstrative practice. We therefore doubt whether it is consistent with attempting to streamline the process. It is more likely to contribute to an impressive growth industry--the industry of regulating the Secretary of State. It will also make the Bill--and social security administration for a long time to come--more complex, not simpler.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Burns</b> (West Chelmsford): I welcome you, Mr. O'Hara, to our proceedings and I also welcome the Minister who, when I saw him last night, looked like a frightened rabbit trapped in the headlights of an oncoming car, following the disgraceful outburst in the Public Gallery against the Government's proposals.
<P>
We sympathise with some of the points made about new clause 4 by the hon. Member for Northavon. However, they are largely a rerun--with slight differences in form--of our debates on clause 1. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin) that bringing in a new bureaucratic edifice is like using a sledgehammer to crack a nut.
<P>
I have read our debates on clause 1 again, particularly the Minister's comments at columns 23 and 24 about the reporting procedures that will be in place at all levels under the new system in order for monitoring to take place. As we said then, we would have liked to have had a review after one year, not an ongoing review thereafter, to see how the new system had bedded down. We listened carefully to the Minister's reassurances when he wound up that debate. We do not want to go down the route of added bureaucracy, so we will not support the new clause.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social Security </B>(Mr. Keith Bradley): Good morning, Mr. O'Hara. I have listened carefully to the private negotiations between the hon. Members for West Dorset and for Northavon about sorting out the new commissioner's role. I regret that however much of a consensus is reached between them, we will not accept the new clause. I am sure that they will want to continue their discussions later.
<P>
We do not accept--in line with the comments made by the Opposition spokesman, the hon. Member for West Chelmsford (Mr. Burns)--that such a role is necessary. In our debates on earlier clauses I explained the arrangements that we have in hand to command public confidence in the integrity and quality of decision making. It may be helpful if I say a little more.
<P>
We are all agreed that decisions must be taken fairly and impartially in accordance with the facts and the law. The best way of ensuring high quality decisions is for agency chief executives to be accountable to the Secretary of State for the decision-making system, and for the individual decisions generated in their agency. Full accountability can be achieved only if responsibility for all the components of decision-making lie with agency chief executives.
<P>
Agencies have given considerable thought to how they are to meet their new responsibilities. Decision makers, first and foremost, need access to accurate guidance that fully reflects the law. There can be no question of that guidance being written to favour administrative convenience. Chief executives will seek impartial advice from the Department's professional legal advisers, who are experts in administrative and social security law. Agencies will draft guidance that is based on that legal advice. Agencies will publish legal guidance together with operational guidance. As now, it will be available to everyone who wishes to see it.
<P>
Agency chief executives will also be responsible for monitoring and for general oversight of the system. They will have clear performance and quality standards to achieve. There are already local systems for checking initial decisions. Agencies will review their systems to ensure that they are sufficiently rigorous. If necessary, they will enhance them.
<P>
Most agencies plan additional measures to provide assurance to the chief executive. For example, in the Benefits Agency, central quality support teams will validate local results. They will also comment on training and on local management arrangements for supporting decision making. These teams will be independent of local decision makers. The Benefits Agency will also have a standards committee. It will include a representative who is independent of the Benefits Agency and who will chair the committee. Other agencies are thinking along similar lines.
<P>
There will also be external monitoring of decision-making systems. The Government's external auditor, the National Audit Office, will continue to audit the Department's accounts. That will include checking the accuracy of decisions. If appropriate, decision making could also feature in a National Audit Office value-for-money study. We are talking to the National Audit Office about how its role could be more effective, especially in the early stages of running the new system.
<P>
As I mentioned, the president of the appeals tribunal will report on the functions of tribunals, including the quality of decisions made in the agencies for cases that subsequently go to appeal.
<P>
The new clause would give an adjudication standards commissioner a role in reviewing levels of training. The Government have always recognised that decision makers need to be supported by quality training. Agency line managers will be responsible for identifying and meeting training needs. Central quality support teams will have a role in commenting on the overall quality of training. We therefore see no need for a separate review of training arrangements.
<P>
The clause also proposes that the adjudication standards commissioner should report annually to the Secretary of State. I have already assured the Committee that we will publish information on quality standards. I reaffirm that assurance. I do not believe, however, that it is necessary to put those reporting arrangements into the Bill.
<P>
The Government are committed to giving customers accurate and speedy decisions. We will put in place comprehensive training and guidance, and we will monitor and report on the quality of decisions. We have an impressive battery of measures that will command public confidence.
<P>
In the light of my elaboration on the way in which we intend to monitor decision making and appeals, and of my comments about clause 1, which the hon. Member for West Chelmsford rightly said that I had made, I hope that the hon. Member for Northavon will feel able to withdraw the new clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for what I think is a concession. When we debated clause 1, he said of the process that he has just described:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``. . . the results of such checks will be reported to a high-level assurance committee established within each agency, which will ensure that remedial action is prompted when necessary.''--[Official Report, Standing Committee B, 28 October 1997; c. 24.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There is no mention there of an independent chair. I may have missed the Minister speaking about that--if I have, I am sure that he will correct me. I welcome an independent rule in scrutinising decision making in social security. Without tongue in cheek, I think that the hon. Member for West Dorset has made many perceptive and thoughtful contributions. He may be reassured that the Liberal Democrats feel no attachment to the word ``commissioner''--commissar, or anything similar, would do. That should not be a stumbling block.
<P>
The thinking behind the new clause was prompted by separate discussions with the Child Poverty Action Group and the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux. Both organisations believed that the safeguards proposed in the Bill were inadequate, although I am pleased to hear that there will be some independent oversight.
<P>
I am not convinced by Conservative arguments that the new clause would involve a new bureaucracy. The existing post of chief adjudication officer is to be abolished, and someone must fill that role. The only question is whether that person will be part of the agency or, as we have argued, external to it.
<P>
The Minister's reassurance to the Committee--if that is what it was--was to say that the chief executive of the agency will be accountable. However, the chief executive of the Child Support Agency is supposed to be accountable, and that agency has been a shambles from day one. I am not convinced, therefore, by the Minister's attempt at reassurance.
<P>
I recognise, however, that the Minister has made concessions over independence and scrutiny. I am grateful for that, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. David Rendel </B>(Newbury): I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
The new clause deals with the provision of information supporting claims for benefit. Proposed subsection (1) would oblige the Secretary of State to make clear precisely what information is required. Subsection (2) would ensure that, when a claim is eventually allowed, payment should begin from the date of the claim and not from the date when the information was provided.
<P>
About 14 per cent. of claims are incomplete, and a further 30 per cent. or so lack some of the necessary supporting evidence. Further information, therefore, may be required in a considerable propostion of benefit claims.
<P>
However, claimants have an incentive to provide the correct information--they will not get their benefits until that information has allowed their claim to be decided. Almost by definition, claimants are not rich: they do not have plenty of money to live on while their claims are decided. The incentive is clear, but the difficulty is that, if the relevant information is not readily available to them, they may not be able to provide it quickly in support of a claim.
<P>
The regulations that came into operation on 6 October 1997 provide that, when the necessary information is not made available within a month of its being required, benefits will be paid not from the date of the claim but from the date when the information was made available. There are some limited exemptions from those regulations, and the Social Security Advisory Committee has recommended that they should be widened as they are not sufficient to meet the need. I am worried that some people will suffer because their payments will not be allowed from the date of claim.
<P>
Anxiety has been expressed also that administrative cuts in the DSS may mean that less information will be provided, or that it will be harder for clients to get hold of the information that they need. If it is harder for clients to get information, it will be harder for them to provide it when they are asked. Indeed, the administrative cuts may make it harder for clients even to know what information is required. That, too, may cause them to provide the information relevant to their cases more than a month after it is required. As a result, they could risk losing some benefit.
<P>
I can understand why information should be provided as quickly as possible, but what is sauce for the goose should be sauce for the gander. If claimants are asked to provide information, the Secretary of State should also be obliged to ensure that the process is speeded up and made as clear and precise as possible. That is why, if the Government are demanding better provision of information by clients, it is only reasonable that the Government should provide better information themselves.
<P>
The new clause is not simply a theoretical matter which will never have any real effect. I expect that most Members of the Committee will know of the following case from the Child Poverty Action Group, which has certainly briefed members on the Liberal Democrat Benches very well on this subject. On a claim for income support, the claimant was asked how she had spent her savings. She sent in a reply, but income support was refused. The only explanation given was that the claimant had not provided all the evidence required by the Secretary of State. It was only on appeal that the adjudication officer's full written decision was made clear. When it was, it became obvious that the adjudication officer had complained that the claimant had not explained properly three different issues which she had never even been asked to address.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
When one is confronted with such a situation, it is clear that it is necessary to impose on the Government certain requirements to make sure that they play their part in this game--if I can call it that--and provide all the information necessary to ensure that a client is not denied the relevant benefit, as was the case with this claimant, who was denied income support for a considerable time. It is only fair that both sides should be put under the same obligation. That is all that we are asking for in the new clause, and I hope that the Minister will accept it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Keith Bradley:</B> The new clause seeks to place new statutory obligations on the Secretary of State to inform claimants of evidence requirements, and to award benefit from the date when benefit was claimed.
<P>
We have talked a lot about rights and responsibilities in our debates on the Bill, and new clause 5 touches on this once again. Like the hon. Member for Newbury (Mr. Rendel), I wholeheartedly agree that customers should receive benefit to which they are entitled. That is a two-way process. The agencies will do everything they can to ensure that people have easy access to information and assistance. They will provide a simple, integrated service that will meet the range of a person's needs--a service that is customer-focused and responsive. That is the whole essence of the Bill--to ensure that we have a modern system which is designed to address many of the problems that the hon. Gentleman mentioned in his presentation of the new clause. However, as I have said previously in Committee, we must balance rights and responsibilities.
<P>
Customers are required to provide information and evidence in support of their claim. This has always been the case. The existing powers in the Social Security Administration Act 1992 and the Jobseekers Act 1995, and regulations made under them spell that out very clearly. Income support and jobseeker's benefit claimants are already told what information they need to provide. That practice will be extended to other benefits.
<P>
As for the proposed subsection (1), the Committee will not be surprised that I will be resisting the proposal to set out processes in legislation. However, there is a more important point to consider. Setting out evidence requirements in regulations will not benefit anyone and indeed might mislead customers. Not everyone will have to provide the same information. What is reasonable for one individual may not be reasonable for another. Levels of evidence very depending on the type of claim, such as repeat applications or when a person is terminally ill. As a result, the regulations would be so dense as to be impenetrable.
<P>
Proposed subsection (2) should be rejected, because it breaks any link between customer responsibility and claiming benefit.
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> Can the Minister explain the philosophy behind his thinking? It seems that when people who have no money, or have a need, apply for a benefit, the Government feel the need to use a stick to encourage them to supply information that it is in their interests to supply anyway. Why does he think that people do not supply information promptly? Does he think that they are being wilful--is that why he feels the need to force them to do that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> I do not think that at all. We are trying to speed up the process so that people receive their entitlement at the earliest opportunity. When people make a claim, evidence is required. We are not using a stick but taking a sensible approach, which is used in many other financial dealings outside the benefits system--when one applies for a loan, for example, or makes an insurance claim, one has to supply the relevant information or one does not get one's entitlement.
<P>
We are trying to help customers by ensuring that information is provided as soon as possible, but, again, crocodile tears are shed by Liberal Democrat Members. They believe that we should simplify and modernise the system, but when it comes to putting plans into practice, they always try to put up barriers. The new clause would lead to a reduction in the speed with which claims are dealt with, because its provisions would apply across the board to every customer.
<P>
We want to speed up claims processing. We want, for example, more face-to-face contact so that the problems in the case that was brought to the attention of the hon. Member for Newbury by the Child Poverty Action Group would not arise. Having more of a customer focus and being able to correct decisions earlier would mean that that matter would not have had to go to appeal--it could have been sorted out much earlier. We are committed to making claim forms simpler, a better use of technology, better face-to-face contact and better customer orientation, all of which would address the issues that the hon. Gentleman has raised. I do not believe that new clause 5 would do that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> I accept all that the Minister said about the methods he is trying to introduce to speed up the process, all of which we welcome--there is no difference between the two sides on the aim of simplifying and speeding up the process wherever possible. However, what evidence does he have that claimants are deliberately withholding information to delay their receipt of benefits?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> I do not believe that that is relevant. We want to ensure that claimants know what evidence is required so that processing is quick.
<P>
It is not about a deliberate or non-deliberate failure to provide information. Claims are delayed because people do not understand what information they are required to give. We want them to understand, but putting the hon. Gentleman's provision in the Bill would lock in a system under which every claimant would be required to provide all the information that he proposes. That cannot be sensible. The new clause would not streamline the system, instead deciding how its provisions would apply in individual cases would make that system more and more complicated. We must give officers the flexibility to make sensible and early decisions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> On that specific point, the Minister may have misunderstood my original intervention. His reply referred entirely to subsection (1) of the new clause 5, whereas I was referring to subsection (2). Why is it unnecessary? What evidence does he have that people are definitely witholding information, despite the fact that they have the incentive to provide it, because they would receive their benefits that bit earlier?

<P>

<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> My response will not directly answer the hon. Gentleman's question, but it will explain that we cannot accept subsection (2) because of the way in which claims are made. The hon. Gentleman wants payment to be made from the earliest point of a claim, and a lack of evidence may delay that, but I want to make another point. Subsection (2) would remove the incentive to provide all the required information and create anomalies in the system.
<P>
In many circumstances, where there are sound reasons for doing so, we encourage people to apply for benefit early. For example, retirement pension can be claimed up to three months before retirement age is reached, although it is not paid until the claimant retires. Therefore an anomaly would occur because new clause 5(2) would allow payment to begin at the point where the person is possibly still working although, under benefit rules, there could be no entitlement. Similarly, claims are often made in advance by people who have left work and received wages in lieu of notice. Again, under new clause 5, benefit would appear payable although there would be no entitlement because of the point at which the claim was made. Consequently, customers might be extremely confused. The only practical solution would be to stop taking claims early, but that also would negate our aim, which is to make payments at the time of need. New clause (5) as drafted would cause confusion about when to apply, and about the payment date.
<P>
In common with Liberal Democrat Members, we wish to ensure that people do not lose entitlement to benefit to which they are entitled. However, customers should have clear responsibility for making claims and providing basic information in support of entitlement. They should be able to understand what is expected of them as well as the implications of failure to comply. I agree about the need to ensure that information is put to customers properly and that claim forms are simplified and make clear what information is required. There should also be swift resolution of problems by more face-to-face contact with officers. The best way to achieve that is through better agency communication and regulation, and improved procedures. That is the way forward but it is not necessary to include the new clause in the Bill, as Liberal Democrat Members wish.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> I am grateful for the Minister's response, although he failed to respond to my intervention. He appeared unable to provide the evidence that I requested but said that he would respond in a different way. When he did, he said that the wording of subsection (2) might cause an anomoly in instances where a person had claimed benefit before the date of entitlement. That in no sense answered the principle of our argument, which was that, generally, claimants should always be paid their benefits from the first date of entitlement, and should not lose entitlement merely because they were unable to prove it at the time. That principle holds.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> Subsection (2) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Where the Secretary of State makes a decision awarding a relevant benefit, the claimant shall be entitled to payment from no later than the date when the claim for it was made.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
What I am saying is that for certain benefits a claim may be made in advance of entitlement, but payment will not be made until entitlement. Enacting subsection (2) would mean that payment would be made at the time of claim. That cannot be right.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> I am not sure that the hon. Gentleman listened to what I said. I accept that the wording of subsection (2) may lead to an anomoly in the sense that he suggested. That may be so, and the wording may need to be changed to enact the principle that I seek to introduce, but the Minister failed to respond to my point about the principle that people should be paid on a valid claim from the date on which they are first entitled to it, and that that entitlement should not be restricted simply because they do not provide all the evidence on time. The Minister merely argued about wording, which I accept may be wrong. The principle should still stand that where entitlement to a claim has been proved, there should be no reason to restrict the payment of a claim to start from the date of entitlement simply because a claimant has been unable to provide the necessary information in time. The Minister has not produced evidence that people are withholding information available to them or failing to send it in on time because they feel like it or they are bored and so on.
<P>
All claimants will have the incentive to send in the information as soon as they can. There is no evidence that they are not doing so and until that evidence is produced, the principle behind the new clause still stands. However, I am happy to withdraw the new clause because I accept that it is badly worded. I hope that the Minister will see fit to table a new clause on Report. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.
<P>
Motion and clause, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> I am quite staggered to hear, after we have been sitting for 45 minutes and still have an hour and three quarters to discuss the Bill, that the Government plan to adjourn the proceedings. This is a 78-clause Bill with seven schedules. So far, we have considered just over half of the Bill. We have 31 clauses, five new clauses and two schedules still to discuss. Why have the Government decided prematurely to curtail the discussion of the Bill today?
<P>
I should also like to know the whereabouts of the Under-Secretary of State for Social Security, the hon. Member for Southampton, Itchen (Mr. Denham). This is a serious matter and it might wipe the smiles off the faces of Labour Members if they listened for a moment. If the Committee is being told that it cannot continue its debate because the junior Minister, who will take over and deal with the next clauses, is not here but performing other duties for the Department of Social Security, the Government are holding the Committee and Parliament in contempt. Where is the Under-Secretary? Why is he not here when the clauses relating to contributions for which he has responsibility have come up for debate in the order of business? Will the Minister intervene to tell the Committee where the Under-Secretary is, instead of laughing and, in effect, mocking the Committee? I ask him to respond. Will he?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. It is for the Minister to decide whether to respond. As he has not responded, I invite the hon. Gentleman to continue or resume his seat.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> I am grateful, Mr. O'Hara.
<P>
I find it astonishing that the Minister will not tell the Committee where the junior Minister is today. The Minister giggles rather than tell the Committee why the Under-Secretary is not in his place, when he is responsible for the next clauses, which when we turned up at 10.30, we expected to be discussing until lunch time. It seems to me that the Committee is adjourning early because the junior Minister responsible for the next part of the Bill is not here. Neither the Minister nor the Whip will dispute that suggestion, so I can only assume that it is accurate. If so, it is a gross contempt of the Committee that junior Ministers, who are meant to serve on Committees and debate clauses as they come up, according to the sittings motions put forward by the Government, can treat with disdain their expected attendance at Committees.
<P>
We all know that the Prime Minister finds the House an irritant that should be brushed aside whenever possible--he comes here as little as possible. But when a Committee--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The behaviour of the Prime Minister has nothing to do with the business of the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> I am sorry that I strayed out of order, Mr. O'Hara. I was trying to say that the example set by the Prime Minister is cascading down to his junior Ministers.
<P>
If Committee business is being disrupted because junior Ministers cannot be bothered to turn up when it does not suit them because they have other duties, it is a sad day for Parliament, for the Committee system and for democracy--it is morally wrong and quite outrageous. I am appalled that all those on the Government Benches can do is giggle, because they are laughing at our democratic process.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> On a point of order, Mr. O'Hara. May I seek your guidance as a new Member of the House on a point that genuinely eludes me?
<P>
The Committee is considering a Bill of great significance and length. Much associated legislation is due to be considered by the House; indeed, yesterday, a statutory instrument which is closely related to the Bill and has profound implications for the conduct of government, was considered in Committee. The statutory instrument gave rise to considerable debate, but that was curtailed by a strict time limit.
<P>
Today, consideration of the Bill--time was allocated for this morning--is to be curtailed. It would help me enormously if you, Mr. O'Hara, could explain what aspect of our processes means that time that could be used to debate these serious matters--I am sure that hon. Members would be ready to use it--is not made available simply because the Government find it inconvenient to allocate time appropriately. Is that how the Committee system, of necessity, works?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> It is the business of the Committee to determine how it proceeds with business. It is the business of the Chairman to ensure that those proceedings are conducted in an orderly manner. It is for the Committee to determine whether, despite an adjournment today, there is still sufficient time within the Government's programme to deal with all the business of the Bill--I note that there are numerous clauses to which no amendments have thus far been tabled--and for the Chairman to conduct the Committee towards that determination.

<P>

<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I am grateful to you, Mr. O'Hara, for that elucidation of the way in which the Committee structure works, which is helpful to new Members. As a new Member--this will perhaps be counted as a naive remark--there seems to be a problem about the nature of the Committee which reflects precisely on this issue. One speaks of the Committee deciding, but the Committee is dominated by the Government, which means that the Government decide.
<P>
The Committee is considering a Bill under which the Government are giving themselves many powers. The Government have at their disposal the ability to provide, or not, the time in which to consider the proposals. Would it be reasonable to curtail each successive sitting after half an hour until, eventually, the patience of all members of the Committee gave way? This process clearly demonstrates that the Government do not regard the Committee's activities as serious; they regard the Committee as an entity that is at their disposal. If that is the consitutional situation, the House of Commons should investigate it, perhaps more deeply than did our predecessors.
<P>
I suspect that the matter has not been investigated in the past because previous Governments did not treat Committees in such a manner. This is a matter of serious concern to Conservative Members.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> First, it is not for me to speculate whether there may be further adjournments. It is also not for me to speculate about why the adjournment motion has been moved. As the Chairman, I see before me a Committee, which consists of a number of hon. Members who are drawn from several parties in the House and which has a quorum--I do not see the Committee in terms of the Government side and the Opposition side. As I conduct our business and put Questions, I will be guided by the vote of the majority of members of the Committee and, where necessary, by quorum.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> On a point of order, Mr. O'Hara. Do you agree that it would be a courtesy to members of the Committee if the Government told them where the junior Minister, the hon. Member for Itchen is?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> That is not a point of order. It is not for me to consider what constitutes a courtesy on the part of the Government towards members of the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> May I just take that argument a little further? For better or worse--
<P>
<B>Mr. Keith Bradley:</B> One is supposed to make a point of order.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I have 25 years experience in the commercial world.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. There is some question as to whether we have a point of order. The motion is debatable, and I take it that the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs is contributing to the debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Thank you, Mr. O'Hara. That is indeed the case. It strikes me as customary courtesy to make an apology and explain the circumstances when emergencies arise. I have attended all manner of meetings in 25 years and that is the conduct that I am used to.
<P>
I am a new Member of Parliament, but I have come across too many instances of arrogance on the part of the new Government. This is a serious Committee, which is dealing with extremely tortuous legislation, and new Members of Parliament in particular have to do their homework to prepare for it. With one exception besides the Minister, the only hon. Members to have contributed to the scrutiny process have been Opposition Members. As a new Member of Parliament, I find the Government's casual and arrogant behaviour extremely disappointing, particularly in this instance. I ask them to apologise out of courtesy, if not due form, and to tell us why the Minister who was supposed to deal with contributions is unable to be here.

<B>The Chairman:</B> It is for the Chairman to decide whether to accept the closure motion. I have listened carefully to the arguments and Members of the Committee have--with some repetition, which is understandable because several hon. Members have spoken--made clear certain objections to the closure. I am satisfied that Members of the Committee have had sufficient opportunity to hear the arguments against the closure, and I am therefore happy to accept the motion.
