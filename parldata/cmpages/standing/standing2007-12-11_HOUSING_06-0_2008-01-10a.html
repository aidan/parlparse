							<b class="B">Grant
Shapps</b> (Welwyn Hatfield) (Con): As I was saying, our
greatest concern with homelessness is that the figures for rough
sleepers are inaccurate, and it is rough sleeping that concerns us most
here. Two main points remain to be covered.</div>
					<a name="08011135000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">The rough
sleepers unit was disbanded on the basis that the two-thirds reduction
target had been met; the unit, which can be credited with a great deal
of that reduction, was effectively wound up by bringing it into a wider
homelessness body under the Department for Communities and Local
Government. To have the new body deal simply with the wider issues of
homelessness&#151;Labour Back Benchers have pointed out that there is
a great difference between homelessness and rough
sleeping&#151;rather than having a unit that deals only with rough
sleeping may be a mistake.</div>
					<a name="08011135000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new
clause is an attempt to bring a rough sleepers steering group into
being. Its purpose is to re-emphasise the importance of tackling rough
sleeping and its consequences. We propose setting up a separately
recognised body within six months, and having it report within a
further six months. We can draw upon the experience of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column172" />Column number: 172</div>the rough sleepers unit, and the work that it did in contributing to the
reduction in rough sleeping. It worked, because it concentrated minds
on the issue, which is the point of the new
clause.</div>
					<a name="08011135000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
had anticipated an intervention along the lines of the one made this
morning by the right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich, that the
new clause would simply add to the list of objectives under clause 2.
We do not want to repeat that earlier debate&#151;it went as far as
it could&#151;but the objectives of the agency need to be set out
somewhere. The problems of homelessness and rough sleeping are
sufficiently important that I am surprised that a detailed reference
has not been made to plans to improve the lot of rough sleepers or to
re-emphasise the issue anywhere else in the Bill.</div>
					<a name="08011135000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
interested to hear from the Minister whether I have missed something in
the 280 clauses that could help, or whether he is amenable to seeing
mention of the issue in the Bill or to providing some reassurance on
the question of rough sleeping. In particular, will he comment on the
problem with the counting of rough sleepers that was referred to
earlier, when we heard that the Department counts an estimate of nought
to 10 rough sleepers as zero? I would be interested to hear whether
anything can be done about
that.</div>
					<a name="08011135000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have provided an outline of our reasons for tabling new clause 7. I
hope that the Minister will take some of those points on
board.</div>

							<b class="B">Dr.
Roberta Blackman-Woods</b> (City of Durham) (Lab): May I take
this opportunity, Mr, Gale, of welcoming you to the Chair this
afternoon and say what a pleasure it is to serve under your
chairmanship?</div>
					<a name="08011135000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to speak against new clause 7, but not because I am not interested
in the issue of rough sleepers. It is important to put on record that
the Government have put a substantial amount of effort into decreasing
the number of rough sleepers. Indeed, Opposition Members recognise that
numbers have fallen by 73 per cent. since 1998. The Government have
signalled their intention to continue the reduction, with a range of
measures to tackle new homelessness. A key aim of the Bill is to enable
more accommodation to be made available to help tackle the problem of
rough sleepers. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for West Ham
that the problem of rough sleeping goes much wider than the
availability of accommodation and involves issues of individuals and
their wider
circumstances.</div>
					<a name="08011135000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to correct the impression given by the hon. Member for Welwyn
Hatfield that the Government have not invested in social housing, which
is not accurate. By 2010, the Government will have invested about
&#163;40 billion in social housing and bringing homes up to the
decent homes standard, and about 3.6 million homes have already been
brought up to that standard. That is important, because the Government
have rightly accepted that the emphasis and priority with social
housing should be about not only improving numbers, but improving
quality and trying to tackle the decades of under-investment in social
housing under previous Conservative Governments. I want to put on the
record my support for that and for Labour&#146;s record on tackling
homelessness and investing in social housing. Of course, we want to
invest a lot more in social housing&#151;hence, the Bill&#151;but
the record is reasonable, which should be
acknowledged.</div>

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local
Government (Mr. Iain Wright):
						</b> Good afternoon,
Mr. Gale. May I wish you a happy, peaceful and prosperous
new year, as I did Mr. Benton, this morning? It is good to
have you in the Chair.</div>
					<a name="08011135000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">I welcome the
hon. Member for Montgomeryshire to the Committee. He was consigned to
the touchline for most of the morning, which I thought a bit
cheeky&#151;it does not get any better, Mr.
Gale&#151;but that was to do with the procedures of the House. The
hon. Gentleman did his best in the Hartlepool by-election to stop me
from coming here, but since I have been here, he has been kindness
personified. He is a true friend, and I look forward to battling with
him over the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="08011135000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
also pay tribute to the hon. Member for Chesterfield (Paul Holmes), who
was with us on Second Reading and during the oral evidence sessions.
His commitment to social housing, particularly council housing, is in
no doubt, and I thank him for his work in
Committee.</div>

						<a name="08011135000404"></a>
							<b class="B">Lembit
&#214;pik</b> (Montgomeryshire) (LD): May I thank the
Minister and the Committee for their generosity? I felt the
Minister&#146;s sympathy as I sat out there, homeless from the
Committee. I did my best to prevent the Minister from being elected in
his constituency, but that was because I knew that he would be too good
as a Minister. Even so, he has exceeded my
expectations.</div>
					<a name="08011135000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011135000405"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> I shall move on swiftly, Mr.
Gale&#151;we have all just had lunch and might start to feel a little
sick; mutual appreciation societies can go too far.</div>
					<a name="08011135000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have had
an interesting debate, and I have been grateful for our discussions on
the amendments, which are helping us to tease out ideas about the
agency and what it should do. I must point out that all the objects of
the agency, including improving the supply and quality of housing, must
be carried out with a view to meeting the needs of people in England,
including their housing needs.</div>
					<a name="08011135000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was
interested in the comments of the hon. Member for St. Ives on the need
for a more substantial awareness and analysis of the national housing
need&#151;I think that those were his words. It is also important
that local authorities have a central role in identifying specific
housing needs in their areas and that there is wider regional
consideration. That is why regional planning bodies and local
authorities carry out assessments of housing needs in their areas,
using advice from the national housing and planning advice unit. My
hon. Friend the Member for Edmonton made that point very well in an
intervention.</div>
					<a name="08011135000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Homes and Communities Agency will be expected to work in partnership
with those regional and local bodies to consider social housing needs
in different places. I imagine that that work will feed into regional
and local plans and the overall work of the agency. The agency will
also be expected to support local authorities and build their capacity
on housing and regeneration issues. As part of that, it is likely to
work with local authorities to develop housing needs assessments for
various places. We are keen to avoid unnecessary duplication of such
work.</div>
					<a name="08011135000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
concede that better national assessment of housing need is necessary,
but I emphasise the central role of local authorities in assessing that
need in their areas in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column174" />Column number: 174</div>conjunction with a regional perspective. I do not consider the Homes and
Communities Agency the right body to make an assessment&#151;it would
be done better by an independent researcher or body or by central
Government. One theme that I want to advance in Committee is that the
agency was set up to allow the Department for Communities and Local
Government to take a strategic and policy-making role with others
providing the delivery function, and this matter is a good example of
that. We are considering models of how better to assess housing need,
and I pledge that we shall make an announcement in due
course.</div>
					<a name="08011135000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
new clause 7, I am not convinced that we need a statutory body, which
would add a layer of bureaucracy, to consider rough sleeper services.
Both Government and Opposition Members have rightly said that in the
past 10 years, we have achieved an enormous amount in partnership with
the voluntary sector and local authorities to tackle and reduce
homelessness, particularly in its worst form&#151;rough sleeping.
Because of that, it is difficult to see what added value would arise
from the establishment of a steering
group.</div>
					<a name="08011135000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
reason why I like serving on Public Bill Committees is that themes seem
to emerge. We have discussed year zero, whether or not it is 1997,
since which everything was good and before which everything was bad.
The hon. Member for Welwyn Hatfield made an important point:
politicians and Members of Parliament are criticised an awful lot, and
I do not accept that hon. Members of any party come into public service
in order to increase homelessness&#151;I agree with him on every word
of that. However, public service, particularly the governing of the
country, is about priorities and where to allocate resources to match
those priorities and to achieve objectives. I must say that the record
of the Conservative Government before 1997 on homelessness and rough
sleeping did not match our priorities, and since 1997 this Government
have a record that is second to
none.</div>
					<a name="08011135000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="08011135000406"></a>
							<b class="B">Sir
George Young</b> (North-West Hampshire) (Con): I hope that the
Minister recognises that in 1990, the rough sleepers initiative was
launched, devoting substantial resources to reducing rough sleepers in
London, with the back-up of hostels and the co-operation of voluntary
organisations. Against that background, I hope that he will tone down
his somewhat harsh criticism of the regime before
1997.</div>
					<a name="08011135000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011135000407"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> I suggest to the right hon. Gentleman that,
although that he was a first-class Housing Minister in a Conservative
Government, he was swimming against the tide of his Administration. The
priorities were not there in the Thatcher and Major
Administrations.</div>
					<a name="08011135000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="08011135000408"></a>
							<b class="B">Lyn
Brown</b> (West Ham) (Lab): Does the Minister agree that one
issue in dealing with rough sleepers in that period was that the
problems of those on the streets were not analysed? It was therefore
not possible effectively to place resources that would get people off
the streets and keep them off the streets, giving them an opportunity
for life to come.</div>
					<a name="08011135000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011135000409"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> I agree absolutely, and I pay tribute to my hon.
Friend&#146;s work on the matter. She is a passionate champion, and
she is rightly pushing to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column175" />Column number: 175</div>ensure that we do even more, building upon our unprecedented success in
tackling homelessness and rough
sleeping.</div>
					<a name="08011135000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="08011135000410"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Nick Raynsford</b> (Greenwich and Woolwich) (Lab): Does the
Minister recall that, in the dying days of the Conservative Government
in 1996, they legislated, against the strong view of the entire
voluntary sector and our party, to reduce the statutory obligation on
local authorities to assist homeless people? That was remedied by
Labour when it returned to power, with legislation that was introduced
in 2001 and that eventually reached the statute book in 2002. The only
advances in the statutory definition of the rights of homeless people
have come under Labour Governments&#151;in 1997, with the strong
support of the Liberals, and in 2002. That is when there has been
definition in law of rights for the
homeless.</div>

							<a name="08011135000411"></a>The
Chairman:
						</b> Order. I was under the impression that the
Government want to make progress this afternoon. I cannot find anything
in what the right hon. Gentleman has just said that is remotely
connected with any of the clauses or amendments under discussion.
Perhaps we can return to the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="08011135000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011135000412"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> I want to put on record that I completely agree
with what my right hon. Friend has said. The Government have
effectively tackled the most visible form of homelessness&#151;that
of people sleeping on the streets. We want to do more, and we will. In
1998, the then Prime Minister set a target that by 2002 the number of
rough sleepers should be reduced by at least two thirds. That target,
as the hon. Member for Welwyn Hatfield has conceded, was met ahead of
time and is being sustained. I am wary of your rulings, Mr.
Gale, but it is important to focus on the real success of the past
decade. In 1998, there were 1,850 rough sleepers on the streets of
England on any single night. In 2007, as the hon. Gentleman said in his
contribution, there are now fewer than 500; he made an important point
about rough sleeping counts, which he has done outside the Committee.
That has been echoed in the Committee by my hon. Friend the Member for
Edmonton; no one is suggesting that we are collecting the number of
every single person who sleeps rough on every single night of the year.
That is not the intention, and it would be difficult to
achieve.</div>
					<a name="08011135000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">Street
counts provide a useful snapshot of people sleeping rough on a single
night. The methodology was developed by the Government some nine years
ago, in partnership with the voluntary sector. I want to reiterate that
those counted on a single night do not represent all those who may have
experienced sleeping rough over the course of a year. As my hon. Friend
the Member for Edmonton has rightly stated, street counts are still the
most robust method for measuring the changing situation on the streets
over a sustained period. That conclusion is backed up by the National
Audit
Office:</div>
					<a name="08011135000341"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
count is designed to capture the number of people sleeping rough on a
given night rather than over the course of a year. Counts might not
capture all of those sleeping rough, but because the methodology has
been applied consistently area-to-area and year-on-year, it is the most
accurate measure of the relative scale of the problem and change over
time.&#148;</div>

							<a name="08011135000413"></a>Grant
Shapps:
						</b> With respect, the Minister is somewhat skirting
around the issue. We are agreed that the count is inaccurate, because
not everyone is found and the actual number of rough sleepers is
therefore not provided. We also agree that the count gives an
indication of the trend. However, the point of the steering
group&#146;s work would be to find and define a new system for
enabling the count to include those numbers&#151;not counting them as
zero, but as the actual number that came in from the local authority.
Will the Minister address that
point?</div>

Wright:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman has raised an interesting
point. I do not want to carry out spin with rough sleeping figures. I
want to have robust evidence, so that we can drive down the figures
further. That is a major priority of the Government, and it will
continue to be
so.</div>

							<a name="08011135000415"></a>Lyn
Brown:
						</b> Does the Minister agree that because services for
the homeless and street-sleeping people have increased over the past 10
years, we now have people on the ground who know the area that they are
dealing with and where those people sleep? The count has become more
robust and more accurate as we have progressed through the decade,
because we have more knowledge of people, locally, on the ground, who
know their clients at the shelters and the
hostels.</div>

							<a name="08011135000416"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> My hon. Friend has raised an interesting point,
which is useful in moving the debate forward. That partnership between
service users&#151;I hate that phrase, but it is appropriate
here&#151;local authorities and voluntary sector groups is vital to
driving the figure down
further.</div>
					<a name="08011135000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am going to come directly to the important point about nought to 10
estimates being treated as zero, hopefully reflecting my indication and
that of the Minister for Housing that we want to be as honest, up front
and robust as possible in our methodology. I do not want to be
flippant, but the reason for the current situation is that it is not
necessary for all local authorities to carry out a full rough sleeping
count. In many areas, rough sleeping might not be an issue. Our
guidance
states:</div>
					<a name="08011135000342"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;If
the local authority feels that it has developed a rough sleeping
problem &#151; and in particular it estimates that there may be more
than 10 rough sleepers in the area, a full count should be carried out
to clarify the
situation.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08011135000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">The decision
to go for the lower end of banded estimates was based on clear
precedence, where local authority estimates consistently overestimated
the number actually found in counts. The current approach was suggested
some nine or 10 years ago in consultation with the local government
sector, and we carried out its wishes.</div>
					<a name="08011135000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am mindful
of your ruling, Mr. Gale, but I want to reiterate an
important point: we have applied the same methodology in producing the
national estimate. We accept that the total does not represent everyone
sleeping rough, but it is an accurate reflection of changes in the
scale of rough sleeping nationally. I am committed publicly to
reconsidering the matter. As part of our work with the voluntary sector
and key local authorities, we are looking at the counting methodology
and a future rough sleeping strategy in order to have as robust a
methodology as possible.</div>

							<a name="08011135000418"></a>Mr.

the hon. Gentleman
wishes.</div>
					<a name="08011135000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall return to our successes on rough sleeping, which resulted from
the effective partnership between central Government, local authorities
and the voluntary sector, which is recognised throughout the world.
Jenny Edwards, the chief executive of Homeless Link, which is the
national umbrella organisation for the voluntary sector,
said:</div>
					<a name="08011135000343"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Our
country has inspired the rest of the world in the way it has tackled
rough sleeping, with the Government, the voluntary sector and local
authorities working together. Thousands of people, many who had been
written off by society, have come off the streets and rebuilt their
lives. The key has been to make sure their aspirations are at the heart
of this journey. The progress so far inspires and encourages us to
redouble our efforts over the next few years, to get rough sleeping as
close to zero as possible in all areas of the
country.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08011135000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are not
complacent and realise that we need to look
ahead.</div>
					<a name="08011135000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
time is right to consider a rough sleeping strategy for the next three
years. We have informally consulted the voluntary sector on the key
elements of that strategy, and we will work closely with our partners
to make further inroads into rough sleeping. Our strategy needs to
bring together all the elements involved in getting people off the
streets, such as tackling their support needs, making hostels places of
change that help rough sleepers get back on track and moving people
into settled accommodation and
employment.</div>
					<a name="08011135000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have been talking about priorities in government. I have made the point
that rough sleeping and homelessness have been major priorities for the
Labour Government since 1997, backed up by substantial levels of
resources and funding allocations. It has always been important to
ensure that funding is available to tackle rough sleeping. To put the
discussion into context, we recently announced about &#163;150
million of homelessness grants for local authorities over the next
three years to help prevent homelessness and to tackle rough sleeping.
That is the biggest ever cash injection for homelessness services. In
addition, we are providing more than &#163;51 million of homelessness
grants to the voluntary sector over the next three years. Our work with
rough sleepers will extend much wider than just helping them off the
streets.</div>
					<a name="08011135000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
Minister with responsibility for homelessness, I am incredibly proud of
our considerable investment in improving hostels. Some &#163;90
million has been spent over the past three years on 175 projects in 62
areas. We want good hostels with rough sleepers being linked into
training, employment and reskilling, so that they can move on to live
independently, and we are reiterating that investment with further
spending. In the latest comprehensive spending review, we have secured
&#163;70 million of new funding for hostels over the next three
years, bringing the total investment in getting rough sleepers off the
streets up to &#163;160 million. I say to the hon.
Gentleman&#151;match
that!</div>
				
					<a name="08011135000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011135000419"></a>Grant
Shapps:
						</b> It is clear, according to the Minister&#146;s
figures, that &#163;90 million has been invested over the past three
years. However, over the next three years, that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column178" />Column number: 178</div>figure will reduce to &#163;70 million. Will the Minister therefore
confirm that there will be a cut in expenditure on hostels over the
next three
years?</div>
					<a name="08011135000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011135000420"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> No. My sense, from speaking to the voluntary
sector organisations that are involved in this, is that they are
extremely pleased with the settlement. They thought that this whole
area would be cut substantially; it has not been. The settlement allows
us to build on very real successes. A lot of the work that went on in
the previous three years was to put down markers and set up the
necessary infrastructure. We can now go on and build almost 100 per
cent. on delivery, and I think that that is very important.</div>
					<a name="08011135000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are really
moving homelessness policy away from just helping somebody to get a bed
for the night. We are helping ambition, raising aspirations and
providing training opportunities to make sure that people stay
permanently aware. Therefore, all the elements are in place to ensure
we can continue to tackle rough sleeping and further reduce the numbers
of those who are unfortunate enough to be on the streets. Our rough
sleeping strategy, which will be drawn up with our partners, represents
the way forward. It will be backed by substantial funding for local
authorities and the voluntary
sector.</div>
					<a name="08011135000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
best way to tackle homelessness is to make sure that we have the homes
necessary to eliminate it. That was why I was disappointed that the
Conservative party did not support the Bill on Second Reading and thus
did not support our aim of ensuring that we have the homes needed to
make homelessness a thing of the past. I hope that the hon. Member for
St. Ives will withdraw the amendment.</div>

							<b class="B">Andrew
George</b> (St. Ives) (LD): I am very grateful to the Minister
and others who have contributed to the debate on the two amendments
tabled by me and my no longer banished hon. Friend the Member for
Montgomeryshire. To be honest, they were intended to be probing
amendments to encourage the Minister to acknowledge that there were
difficulties. The housing market is not simplistic or two dimensional.
The figures need to be balanced for social housing, intermediate
housing and market housing. The task of establishing how sub-markets
work in different areas is much more challenging than perhaps others
had previously acknowledged.</div>
					<a name="08011135000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was
disappointed, especially in the light of my hon. Friend&#146;s
effusive remarks about the Minister, by the way in which the Minister
dismissed the arguments that I advanced in our debate this morning. The
fact is that local authorities have a statutory responsibility, but
only for housing involving certain types of need. Not all types are
picked up by the local housing register, which is not sufficiently
sensitive to take account of a wide range of needs. For example, single
men cannot necessarily express their need or get on the register quite
as easily as other groups.</div>
					<a name="08011135000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">I mentioned
rural areas. The logic is compelling. There is no point waiting for a
bus on a Sunday if there is no bus. Likewise, there is no point
expressing a need for social housing in a village where there is no
housing available. Leaving this to local authorities and their
statutory responsibilities means that those kinds of nuances are simply
not picked up. Similarly, the way in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column179" />Column number: 179</div>which the sub-market operates is not fully recognised&#151;not just in
the Kate Barker review, but also in the Government&#146;s response to
that, and in the regional assemblies and sub-regional plans. They all
seem to fail to reflect the relationship between the open market and
the need for an intermediate market. There is a need for a great deal
more work than has been provided up until
now.</div>
					<a name="08011135000370"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.30
pm</div>
					<a name="08011135000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me give an example. There is a requirement to understand properly the
extent of the need for intermediate market housing, such as low-cost
and shared ownership housing. Where the assessment is poor and the
figures perhaps provide for a large number of market houses, it makes
it much more difficult to bring forward the large numbers of
intermediate market houses that are needed in an area. That is because
landowners will always hope that their land will be apportioned for
market housing and will therefore not make it available for
intermediate markets. By getting the assessment right, we get the
figures right, and by getting the figures right, we will be more likely
to be able to
deliver.</div>
					<a name="08011135000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="08011135000422"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Andrew Love</b> (Edmonton) (Lab/Co-op): Local authorities have
a strategic role on housing in their local area. They have not only
responsibilities, but powers to allow them to intervene in the housing
market. While I accept that there are difficulties in relation to
funding, if there are other shortcomings, surely they relate mainly to
the reluctance of local authorities to use those powers&#151;to use
the strategic overview that they should have in a local area&#151;to
do what the hon. Gentleman is
asking.</div>
					<a name="08011135000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011135000423"></a>Andrew
George:
						</b> That intervention is extremely helpful because it
emphasises that if local authorities are not using the full range of
powers that they have, and doing only the minimum that they can get
away with in terms of the statutory duties, it means that the new
agency will not be as well informed as it perhaps should be by
commissioning surveys, or perhaps academic analyses, so that it can be
satisfied that the information that it gets from the ground properly
reflects what is going on and helps it in its forward planning. It is
on that basis that I am troubled by the Minister&#146;s response. I
will therefore press the amendment to a

other&#146;.</div>
					<a name="08011135000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment, which stands in my name and that of my right hon. Friend the
Member for Greenwich and Woolwich, is essentially a prompt to the
Government that the concept of sustainability, and in particular
sustainable development, should be explicitly mentioned in the
objectives of the HCA in clause
2(1).</div>
					<a name="08011135000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government have an excellent record of putting sustainability at the
heart of the development and regeneration agenda. It is reflected in
the revision of planning policy guidance note 1 to planning policy
statement 1 to concentrate specifically on sustainable development in
the planning system. It is also reflected in PPS3, where there is a
specific mention in the Government&#146;s strategic housing policy
objectives of the desire to create sustainable, inclusive and mixed
communities in all areas&#151;urban and rural. As that is a strategic
objective of the Government, it would be useful if it were emphasised
in the objectives of the HCA. Of course, the Government supported the
Sustainable Communities Bill last year, meaning that we now have the
Sustainable Communities Act 2007, which concentrates in particular on
supporting local authorities to provide sustainable
development.</div>
					<a name="08011135000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">With that
wealth of legislation and policy, the Government have clearly flagged
their direction with respect to encouraging sustainability, not only in
matters such as renewable energy or greater energy efficiency for
communities, but in ensuring that communities have access to transport,
schools, community facilities and the necessary support infrastructure.
It would be helpful if that aspect were flagged up in the
Bill.</div>

							<b class="B">Alistair
Burt</b> (North-East Bedfordshire) (Con): I want briefly to
support the amendment. The amendment brings us back to something that I
mentioned earlier: the concern at the back of some minds that what is
happening is all a numbers game that is about being determined to push
through a certain number of houses, without regard to the other things
that will make for serious, sensible, sustainable communities in the
future, such as design, quality and sustainability. Some guidance from
the Minister about how seriously he takes the issues that the hon. Lady
has raised would be
helpful.</div>

&#214;pik:
						</b> I support the amendment. It looks to me as if
sustainability is missing entirely from clause 2 in word and in spirit.
As far as I can see, there is no element of the amendment that is
compromising to the Government. As the hon. Lady has pointed out, the
Government have been clear about their support for a sustainability
agenda throughout their work and specifically in housing. I hope that
this will be one of those occasions when the Minister, after
consideration, will be able to accept an amendment that evidently has
cross-party
support.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011135000436"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> That was a short but sweet debate on an important
and serious amendment, which I thank my hon. Friend the Member for City
of Durham and my right hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich and
Woolwich for tabling. It is clear from all that has 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column181" />Column number: 181</div>happened in the past few months that the Government take climate change
and wider sustainable development extremely seriously. That is the
reason for the proposals that we have published in the Climate Change
Bill, the first of its kind in the world, to provide a clear, credible,
long-term domestic framework for the achievement of the UK&#146;s
long-term goals of reducing carbon dioxide emissions. With
responsibilities for housing, planning and regeneration, the Department
has a key role to play in tackling climate change, not least when we
think that nearly half of all carbon emissions in the UK come from
buildings and something like 27 per cent. come from
homes.</div>
					<a name="08011135000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have already made progress, as my hon. Friend the Member for City of
Durham has said and as has been recognised by the Sustainable
Development Commission and other green NGOs. Green stakeholders have
told us that the Department is critical to successful Government action
on climate change&#151;perhaps more than any other Department.
However, as the hon. Member for North-East Bedfordshire has mentioned,
sustainable development will and should be at the heart of what the
agency does, and it is crucial that the Bill makes that
clear.</div>
					<a name="08011135000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
agency&#146;s functions in relation to sustainable development are
set out in clause 34, which provides that
it</div>
					<a name="08011135000344"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;may contribute to the
achievement of sustainable development.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08011135000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, I agree with the cross-party
consensus that we need to go further. I should like to consider in more
detail the suggestion that the agency has a stronger duty to
sustainable development. I shall consider whether incorporation in the
agency&#146;s fundamental objects would be appropriate, and I will
look at the duties placed on comparable bodies, such as regional
development agencies, the Greater London Assembly and local
authorities, which are required to provide sustainable community
strategies.</div>
					<a name="08011135000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am sure the whole Committee recognises that it is important that we get
the clause right. I am clear that we must not constrain the
agency&#146;s ability to deliver new homes, or leave it open to
persistent legal challenges on matters such as its work on eco-towns
and other initiatives that will help to achieve the 3 million homes
target, which may require, frankly, the development of greenfield
sites. If we were to place on the agency an unqualified duty, it would
be almost impossible for the agency to achieve its targets. However, I
hear and agree with what the Committee has said, and I shall consider
the issue in more detail and return to it at a later
stage.</div>

					<a name="08011135000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">May
I underline something that the Minister himself said about clause 34?
In the clause, &#147;may&#148; is used, not &#147;must&#148;.
We are in changing times, and if the Government are serious about the
environmental agenda, it seems appropriate to enshrine that element in
the objects of the agency that we are setting up. There would be no
cost to the Government, but the provision would be directionally
important.</div>

for Greenwich and Woolwich tabled an amendment that added to a list,
given what he said about my amendment this
morning.</div>
					<a name="08011135000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">Returning
to my amendment, if there is one theme running through the
Government&#146;s housing policy, it is social inclusion, which is
one reason why they have introduced the Bill. Social inclusivity is a
fundamental element of the Government&#146;s homes and communities
agenda. The amendment would not add to a list; it would simply add an
adjective to an existing list. I hope the Minister agrees that we want
to build inclusive communities, and I see no reason why he cannot smile
on the amendment. To some extent, this debate overlaps with our first
debate and with the previous debate about focusing not only on building
but on building inclusive
communities.</div>
					<a name="08011135000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">By
an inclusive community, I mean something broader than accessible
housing. I mean homes and infrastructure that are planned and delivered
to empower disabled people and other groups to get out and about, which
are the sort of communities that the hon. Member for City of Durham
referred to in the debate on the previous amendment, when she said that
such communities should be sustainable. It means accessible and
integrated transport, ensuring that facilities are located in places
that everyone can reach easily and cheaply and that people in sheltered
and supported accommodation can play a full role in a properly mixed
community.</div>

Rights Commission has provided some invaluable guidance for planners
and housing professionals on what it thinks should be factored into the
planning of such communities. I hope that the Minister agrees that the
amendment would take forward the Government&#146;s agenda and put in
the Bill one of the main objectives of their housing and community
policy. On that basis, I hope that he will give me the same benign
treatment that he recently bestowed on his Back-Bench
colleague.</div>

							<a name="08011135000445"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> I am afraid that I must disappoint the right hon.
Gentleman&#151;I have sobered up quickly from my good lunch. A theme
that emerged this morning, along with year zero, was the list
principle. The amendment is unnecessary, as it takes us back to that
principle.</div>
					<a name="08011135000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 14 refers to the HCA, which, as I said this morning, will already
have the objective of improving the supply and quality of housing in
England, with a view to meeting the needs of people living there. I
suggest that that includes ensuring that housing of all tenures and
types appropriate to the needs of the community is provided. By meeting
the needs of the community, the agency will contribute to its
inclusiveness. Similarly to what we discussed this morning, I would be
reluctant for inclusiveness to be elevated above the community&#146;s
other needs. It should also be sustainable, to take into account what
we discussed on amendment No. 75, and it should be mixed. Those needs
and others are reflected in the requirement for the agency to meet the
needs of the
community.</div>
					<a name="08011135000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 12 relates to clause 86(2), which sets out one of the
regulator&#146;s 10 fundamental objectives. We shall discuss part 2
of the Bill in subsequent sittings, but it is worth my briefly
summarising objective 1, which is set out in clause 86. It requires the
regulator</div>
					<a name="08011135000345"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to encourage
and support a supply of well-managed social housing, of appropriate
quality, sufficient to meet reasonable
demands.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08011135000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
would add the word &#147;inclusive&#148; after
&#147;well-managed&#148;. The clause sets out the fundamental
objectives of the regulator, which must perform its functions with a
view to achieving them as far as possible. It will be for the regulator
to balance its objectives in carrying out each of its functions, as it
deems appropriate. The objectives are intended to provide a constraint
on how it exercises its functions under part 2 of the Bill, for example
by setting out the purposes for which it can act and matters that it
must weigh up in deciding how to
act.</div>
					<a name="08011135000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
purpose of objective 1 is to ensure that the regulator is concerned
with ensuring that adequate social housing is available to meet needs,
and with the quality of the stock and housing management. It is
expected to take a view about what is needed across the social housing
sector and to perform its regulatory functions accordingly. Adding the
word &#147;inclusive&#148; would not have any useful effect.
Objective 1 already states that the regulator must support a supply of
social housing sufficient to meet reasonable demand, which will include
demand from older or disabled people, whom we discussed earlier. Social
homes will also need to be of a quality appropriate to those using
them.</div>

					<a name="08011135000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">In addition,
both the agency and the regulator will operate under a duty of
equality, as do all public bodies. We will table consequential
amendments in due course to amend schedule 1A to the Race
Relations Act 1976, to include the regulator and the HCA. The
Disability Discrimination Act 1995 and the Sex Discrimination Act 1975,
as amended by the Equality Act 2006, now contain a general duty that
applies to all public
authorities.</div>

was a joy to watch two Privy Councillors this morning jousting and
duelling. It reminded me of the rumble in the jungle or the thriller in
Manila. However, the amendment takes us back to the list principle, so
I hope that the right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire will
withdraw
it.</div>

							<a name="08011135000446"></a>Sir
George Young:
						</b> I am a little disappointed by the
Minister&#146;s reply, because I thought that the list argument had
died in the previous debate, but it has been exhumed and deployed
against the amendment. I honestly cannot see what damage it would do to
the Bill to state that the HCA&#146;s objective should be to support
the development of inclusive communities in England, rather than simply
the development of communities. His argument is that if we were to
include the word &#147;inclusive&#148;, we should refer also to
&#147;mixed&#148; and &#147;sustainable&#148;, but he conceded
the argument on &#147;sustainable&#148; a few moments ago, so he is
in danger of contradicting
himself.</div>
					<a name="08011135000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
recognise, however, that the Government are not minded to make such a
concession, although I thought that I was simply taking their agenda
forward a stage. However, if they do not share my view, there is no

							<a name="08011135000450"></a>Grant
Shapps:
						</b> I shall try to make this contribution relatively
brief, because I believe that, on this matter, the Committee is in
agreement. The idea of CLTs has been around for a while, and they have
started to happen. I have heard this Minister and the Minister for
Housing speak in favour of them, and we, too, back them. CLTs are
useful vehicles for encouraging low-cost ownership and rental, and they
can play an important role in enabling communities to retain the
benefits of the value of land, which makes it much easier for the
Government to achieve their stated objective of reviving low-cost
housing. As I understand it, it is beyond debate that CLTs are a good
idea.</div>
					<a name="08011135000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">So
why are CLTs not moving as fast as we would like? Some pilots have been
set up, and more are coming in down the line. However, from talking to
those involved with CLTs, there appears to be some hesitation and lack
of confidence, and a concern that policy changes and other factors
might stop CLTs in their tracks. It seems that the HCA and this Bill
present an excellent opportunity to make a positive difference to the
future of CLTs. The most important thing, as with all Government
policy, is to provide a sense of certainty that the provisions are here
to stay and that those who invest in them, either financially or with
their own confidence and backing, will see CLTs flourish in 10 or 20
years&#146; time, so the investment needs to be long term. The
purpose of the new clause, and the easiest way in which to achieve that
objective, is to provide a legal definition of what a CLT would
actually do&#151;no such definition exists at the moment. I very much
hope that that will attract the Minister&#146;s eye and
support.</div>
					<a name="08011135000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011135000451"></a>Lembit
&#214;pik:
						</b> The hon. Member for Welwyn Hatfield is right
that there is a high degree of cross-party support for what the
amendments and the strategy of CLTs seek to achieve. The extent to
which land prices 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column186" />Column number: 186</div>influence the effectiveness of CLTs in any given environment is, of
course, beyond our control, and there is probably no benefit in my
going through the mechanism now. However, I am interested to know
whether the Minister and the Government are sympathetic to the concept
of CLTs. If they are, I hope that he will be sympathetic to the
amendments.</div>
					<a name="08011135000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">Once
again, this is not a party political question, but a question of how we
best manage land in the public interest. Given that the CLT agenda is
very similar to what I believe to be the agency&#146;s agenda, I hope
that we can generate a conceptual partnership in which the CLTs regard
the new agency as an ally. That will make it easier for local
communities to manage land in a way that is in their best interests,
rather than just in those of developers. Developers will not lose out,
but their activities will be made indirectly accountable to the
communities that, ultimately, their constructions will serve. I hope
that the Minister and others will take a benign view of the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s sensible
proposition.</div>

						<a name="08011135000452"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Love:</b>
						 I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Gale.
From experience of past Bills, I know that you will keep us on track
during our
sittings.</div>
					<a name="08011135000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">May
I add to the cross-party consensus on the issue? Without adding much, I
agree with almost all of what has been said so far and, without simply
repeating it, I want to emphasise the importance of the provision being
included in the Bill and the objectives. A primary function of the HCA
is to provide affordable accommodation, and I think that it is
recognised across the board that CLTs have a major part to play in
providing that affordable accommodation.</div>
					<a name="08011135000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">As has been
said, there are a number of pilots up and down the country. A lot of
them are striving hard to get the idea off the ground and to show that
it can work in practical terms, but they are meeting major
institutional barriers of a number of sorts. Making the amendment to
the Bill and including a definition of a CLT is important, and it is
particularly important to state that the land is secured for the
community, which is a principle within the
definition.</div>
					<a name="08011135000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">At
this point I should explain the difference between my amendment No. 32
and amendment No. 1. Simply, my amendment includes a commitment not
only to low-cost home ownership, which is important, but to low-cost
rented accommodation. I am simply trying to widen the narrow definition
in amendment No. 1. That has got nothing to do with any worries about
low-cost home ownership, which is incredibly important, but affordable
rented accommodation is also important. The Minister will be only too
well aware of the acute shortage of affordable rented accommodation not
only in urban areas, such as my London constituency, but in many rural
areas, where there is a problem for young families, who cannot afford
to buy, even with the subsidised prices that may be available through
community land trusts, but who can afford to rent, if more property
were available. My amendment would enable that and two other things as
well.</div>
					<a name="08011135000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
were talking about sustainable communities. We have talked in the past
about balanced communities. Providing low-cost home ownership only will
not give us balanced, sustainable communities, and we need to stretch
across. What is important, perhaps more so in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column187" />Column number: 187</div>rural rather than urban areas, is that we try to balance the community
by providing rented as well as home-ownership accommodation. Added to
that, the measure would promote mixed tenure, hopefully in a positive
way. Take an example from my constituency, where I was involved in a
development of what was meant to be a mixed tenure scheme&#151;part
low-cost home ownership and part affordable rented accommodation. All
the plans were laid out, and the development looked marvellous, and
when the houses were built, it looked even better. Lo and behold,
somewhere along the line, before getting around to selling the homes, a
wall was erected between the ownership homes and the rented homes. We
want to try and protect ourselves against
that.</div>

					<a name="08011135000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 32, with its commitment to both home-ownership and rented
accommodation and to inherently mixed communities and mixed tenure
estates, will go a long way to achieving the Government&#146;s
ambition. I come back again to the rationale that community land trusts
will be a major contributor to the objectives of the Homes and
Communities Agency, and therefore should be in the objectives of that
agency. I assume that the Minister is sympathetic, but if he is not
minded to accept the amendment, I hope that he will give sympathetic
consideration to the cross-party concerns that have been expressed, and
will try to find a way to ensure that, through this Bill, we galvanise
community land trusts to achieve what we all hope and know that they
can achieve in terms of delivering the objectives of the
agency.</div>
					<a name="08011135000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011135000453"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> I welcome the debate that we have had on these
amendments, and on the issue of community land trusts. As I think my
right hon. Friend the Minister for Housing made clear in the oral
evidence sessions in December, we are committed to community land
trusts and think that they have real potential to help provide more
affordable housing. In that regard, I hope that I can provide a further
element of cross-party consensus. Community land trusts are an exciting
model. As has already been said, we have 14 pilots under
way&#151;seven in rural areas and seven in urban areas&#151;which
are supported by the Housing Corporation. We are using these pilots to
look in more detail at how to develop the community land trust models,
and will follow the pilots with a great deal of interest.</div>
					<a name="08011135000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would point
out that the Housing Corporation and English Partnerships already have
the ability to support community land trusts within the existing
framework. The Bill gives the HCA the power to support CLTs. I do not
want to pre-empt what the agency will do when it is up and running, but
I am sure that, where appropriate, the HCA will assist community land
trusts as part of fulfilling its objects of improving the supply and
quality of housing in England. However&#151;this is a crucial
point&#151;we do not want to dictate to the agency the precise
mechanism by which it delivers those objects. Singling out a vehicle
such as community land trusts for the delivery of housing, regardless
of the merits of that particular vehicle, must suggest that this is the
preferred way to provide housing. I suggest that that is the wrong
approach.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column188" />Column number: 188</div>
					<a name="08011135000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">Similarly, I
am a big fan of local housing companies, and I think that the agency
may encourage them as well. However, I do not want to dictate the
promotion of local housing companies in the Bill. To reiterate, I do
not think that it is wise or necessary in this case to embed one
particular mechanism in legislation, as circumstances differ and times
change.</div>
					<a name="08011135000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011135000454"></a>Mr.
Love:
						</b> The Minister will be aware from the pilots
that there has been some concern that English
Partnerships has not been as positive in the process as one would hope.
Recognising that, can he give any reassurance that the HCA will not
replicate that concern, but would be more sympathetic to the objectives
of community land
trusts?</div>
					<a name="08011135000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011135000455"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> As I have said, I am personally very interested in
the manner in which the 14 pilots are operating. I want to see how they
are working and how they can help to provide the new homes that we
need. Crucially, as my hon. Friend said, I want to identify any
barriers to their development that we can help unblock. I am also very
interested in the role that the agency can play in moving forward with
regard to community land trusts. I do see CLTs as a big part of what
will happen in terms of the delivery of housing in the future. As such,
I am hoping to meet with representatives of community land trusts next
month to hear how they are operating on the ground, to listen at first
hand to their concerns, and to try to unblock the barriers. I hope that
that provides reassurance to my hon. Friend and others.</div>
					<a name="08011135000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">In summary, I
do not want to box the agency into any particular model in the Bill. I
hate this phrase, Mr. Gale, but we need to
&#147;future-proof&#148; the agency as much as possible. Innovative
new models will come forward and specifying individual models on the
face of the Bill may compromise the agency&#146;s ability to deliver.
I hope that I have reassured the Committee that I am very keen to make
sure that community land trusts prosper. I am going to take a personal
interest by seeing them next month, but I hope, on that basis, that
hon. Member for Welwyn Hatfield will feel able to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

							<a name="08011135000456"></a>Grant
Shapps:
						</b> I hear everything that the Minister says. I am
slightly surprised by the response, inasmuch as hon. Members on both
sides of the Committee agree with community land trusts. The point
that, I think, has not been addressed in the short debate is how
community land trusts get off the ground. If they are to do that, they
require the reassurance of some kind of framework, some kind of
definition. That does not exist in the Bill. One can possibly accept
the argument that it should not be written into the Bill in clause
2&#151;as that might overplay CLTs in comparison to local housing
companies or some other form of housing, but it is odd that CLTs are
not given a little more prominence in the Bill. None the less, I am
sympathetic to what the Minister said with regard to his personal
interest in community land
trusts.</div>
					<a name="08011135000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
also heard, during the evidence sessions, the Minister for Housing talk
about the 14 or so trials that are being set up. On the basis that the
results of those trials are published&#151;unlike the results of the
&#163;4 million trials into six home information pack areas, which
have never been published by this Government&#151; I would be pleased

<div class="Column"><a name="Column189" />Column number: 189</div>not to press the new clause. I seek an assurance that the results of the
trials will be published and available to the

						</b> It somewhat surprises me that it has taken until 6

for the hon. Gentleman to mention HIPs. I though it would be something
like 2 minutes past
9.</div>
					<a name="08011135000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that I have made the Government&#146;s intentions and my
personal intentions clear. This is something that we are very much
interested in. We want to see community land trusts work and we want to
make sure that any blockages to development are eliminated. To that
effect, I am working on the matter and I will meet the trusts next
month to see what we can do. I reiterate the point about defining CLTs
in the Bill. I do not want to risk failing to future-proof the agency.
I hope that the issue will be debated again on Report, but I hope that
I have made the Government&#146;s intentions clear and that the hon.

					<a name="08011135000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thank
you, Mr. Gale. I echo the warm welcome that has been given
to you by others. Can I now slightly dent the atmosphere that has been
built up, by talking about the Thames Gateway. Mr. Gale, you
were not here this morning and therefore might be unaware of an
exchange that took place. Much to our surprise, at 9.30 the Minister
for Housing tabled a written statement on the very matters that we are
talking about, including the decision by the Department for Communities
and Local Government to transfer some powers relating to the Thames
Gateway to the Homes and Communities Agency, which is the substance of
the
amendment.</div>
					<a name="08011135000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
was slightly surprised that a decision on a matter that had been under
consideration for some time in the Department was announced this
morning, at a time that did not give us any chance to consider it
before the Committee dealt with it this afternoon. I expressed myself
in strong terms this morning. I said that the Committee should have an
adjournment in order to deal with the matter. I do not blame the
Minister. He was good enough to draw the Committee&#146;s attention
to the written statement. Part of the reason why I need to explain the
amendment at some length, if I may, is the annoyance that the written
statement was produced this morning. The statement is on a topic that
the Government knew we were going to deal with. They certainly knew
from the amendments that were tabled on Monday that the matter would be
raised today.</div>
					<a name="08011135000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are two
parts to the amendment&#151;one part about the right to buy and
social home-buy and the other on the Thames Gateway. I am interested in
the Minister&#146;s view on, and determination to promote, social 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column190" />Column number: 190</div>ownership through social home-buy and the right to buy. I should like a
word from him about the way in which he intends to tackle the issue
through the Homes and Communities Agency. I do not want to linger on
that because I want to talk about the Thames
Gateway.</div>
					<a name="08011135000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment was designed substantially to give effect to a recommendation
by the Public Accounts Committee, which published a report on the
Thames Gateway on 15 November 2007, entitled &#147;The Thames
Gateway: Laying the Foundations&#148;. It was not a complimentary
report, but one suggestion that it made was that the
Department&#146;s responsibilities for the Thames Gateway be
transferred to the new agency, partly because of what the agency was
set up to do, and partly because of the Department&#146;s abysmal
record on handling the Thames Gateway.</div>
					<a name="08011135000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">I questioned
the Minister for Housing about the issue when she appeared before this
Committee on 13 December. I asked her:</div>
					<a name="08011135000346"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Do
you think...you would follow the recent recommendation of the
Public Accounts Committee and give the Thames Gateway to the HCA to
run?&#148;</div>
					<a name="08011135000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">She said in
response:</div>
					<a name="08011135000347"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
will confirm our views on precisely what will be covered by the HCA in
time for you to have those debates in

					<a name="08011135000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">The written statement
giving the Department&#146;s decision states that</div>

Thames Gateway Delivery Plan published in November.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08011135000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">For the Minister for Housing to believe
that by publishing the statement at half-past 9 this morning, she
fulfils her commitment to the Committee on 13 December that we would
know her views in time for us to have this debate, is wrong.</div>
					<a name="08011135000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">I make no
criticism of the Minister before us, but the situation is not
appropriate. There has not been any time for consultation on precisely
what the statement means. We shall discuss it now, and I hope that he
will have sufficient information to answer in detail precisely what the
Homes and Communities Agency will take over, and precisely what will be
left with the Department. There has not been any time for consultation
with outside bodies either. Over lunch time, I contacted several local
councils in the Thames Gateway area to ask whether they had been
consulted about the decision, and the answer that I have so far from
them is no. What happened between 13 December 2007 and now? Who was
consulted before the decision was made? And why, during that process,
was it not possible to give the Committee even 24 hours&#146; notice
that the matter would be dealt with in this way, knowing that it would
come up as one of the first amendments, right at the heart of the
Bill?</div>
					<a name="08011135000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
disappointed, because I cannot see any political angle to the
situation. It is either carelessness or a slight contempt, again, for
the process of Parliament for the Department to feel that, with
impunity, it can publish something when it wants, regardless of the
fact that a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column191" />Column number: 191</div>Committee will be exploring it, saying, &#147;Oh, it&#146;s all
right, it&#146;s being produced in the morning, so they won&#146;t
bother and it won&#146;t matter.&#148; It does matter, and the
Department could have done
better.</div>
				
					<a name="08011135000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">That brief
rant is over the top for me, as colleagues know, but having put it on
the record, I shall now consider the background to the amendment and
the reason why we support the transfer to the HCA but want to
explore&#151;this is what the amendment does&#151;the role of local
authorities and more of the
detail.</div>

					<a name="08011135000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
original vision of Michael Heseltine to see the area to the east of
London as a tremendous opportunity for growth and development has been
bedevilled over the past decade by the structure of the organisation
that was designed to give effect to that vision. Even Lord
Rogers&#151;a Government supporter&#151;was led in his urban task
force to contrast the way in which the gateway is being handled with
London docklands under Michael Heseltine. The structure of the earlier
project was much more tightly handled and delivered far better. In the
case of the gateway, there have been too many bodies, too many funding
streams, not enough leadership and accountability, and, by and large, a
mess, which has prevented it from delivering on its immense
potential.</div>
					<a name="08011135000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those

the days of development corporations, bypass local authorities and
local communities and simply deliver, or is he suggesting an
alternative model halfway between the corporations and what we have
now?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011135000461"></a>Alistair
Burt:
						</b> I appreciate the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
intervention. What we want to do through this amendment is, bearing in
mind the announcement this morning, explore precisely what the
Government currently have in mind. I do not think a return to a
development corporation model is right, because the local authority
involvement needs to be substantial. One of the problems has been the
expression of their needs and desires and the swiftly changing nature
of their economies, which is reflected in their plans and proposals for
the gateway. That has not come through the existing structures. I take
it that the existing structures have failed, which is why the
announcement was made this morning. It would be nice to get an
admission on that, and we are exploring what kind of structure there
should be in our amendment.</div>
					<a name="08011135000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">Following a
number of concerns raised by many different sources, the Public
Accounts Committee had a chance to look at Thames Gateway, and its
report was pretty damning. In dealing with this matter on Second
Reading, the Minister for Housing tried to bluff by saying from a
sedentary position that the report was not all that bad. Bearing in
mind what we have been through today, I think we need to examine in
more detail the PAC&#146;s conclusions and
recommendations.</div>
					<a name="08011135000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
first conclusion was this:</div>
					<a name="08011135000350"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Department&#146;s management of the programme has been weak and has
not demonstrably added value to the programme.&#148;</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column192" />Column number: 192</div>
					<a name="08011135000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">That was the conclusion that led to its
recommendation that the programme should go to the HCA to sit alongside
the other housing growth programmes to utilise the agency&#146;s
housing and regeneration expertise&#151;that is, to remove it from
DCLG control.</div>
					<a name="08011135000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is a further
conclusion:</div>
					<a name="08011135000351"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Department has not translated the vision for the programme into
comprehensive and measurable objectives, nor are there robust systems
to measure
progress.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08011135000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is a
third
conclusion:</div>
					<a name="08011135000352"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
delivery chain for the Thames Gateway is
unclear.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08011135000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
conclusion
states:</div>
					<a name="08011135000353"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Department does not know how much the regeneration of the Thames
Gateway will cost the
taxpayer.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08011135000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">A further
conclusion
states:</div>
					<a name="08011135000354"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Multiple
inward investment agencies operating within the region and the lack of
a co-ordinated marking strategy have led to poor visibility of the
programme outside the area and amongst potential
investors.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08011135000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not
quite sure precisely what the DCLG has done in relation to Thames
Gateway that gets a thumbs up and a tick, but there is not very much
there, hence the interest and concern about whether this is the right
thing for the Department to be carrying
on.</div>
					<a name="08011135000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">Then
there is the curious business about the sacking of the chief executive,
Judith Armitt. Just before the Committee met on 13 December, news
emerged rather slowly that the chief executive of Thames Gateway,
appointed barely 12 months before by the Minister for Housing herself,
was being removed. We had a little exchange about that in Committee,
when I asked the Minister for Housing about progress at the gateway,
and she gave the impression that the previous 12 months had produced
extremely strong, beneficial changes&#151;indeed, she waxed lyrical
about them. I asked her why the chief executive was being sacked if
things were so good, but she did not answer. She
said:</div>
					<a name="08011135000355"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;You
will appreciate that it is not appropriate for me to comment on
departmental staffing arrangements, which are a matter for the
permanent secretary...Those are internal civil service staffing
matters.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08011135000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
replied:</div>
					<a name="08011135000356"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I
don&#146;t think you will be able to get away with that for long, but
thank you for your answer.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;[Official Report,
Housing and Regeneration Public Bill Committee, </i>13 December 2007;
c. 121,
Q193.<i class="I">]</i>
					</div>
					<a name="08011135000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Department cannot get away from that any longer. Why has the chief
executive been removed? If progress at the gateway was poor in the
previous 12 months, why did the Minister wax lyrical about
it on 13 December? If it was good, why was the chief executive sacked?
If it was to do with the proposed change to the HCA, why was that not
stated at the time&#151;it would have been a perfectly valid reason?
If it was because of the change to the HCA, why were we not told about
the intention to move departmental responsibilities to the agency
before this morning? Frankly, the situation is a mess, and it looks as
though there has been a straightforward scapegoating.</div>
					<a name="08011135000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is not
the first problem with DCLG delivery. My hon. Friend the Member for
Welwyn Hatfield has made a lot of the HIPs issue, about which the
Department has been criticised. There has been criticism about
pathfinders and Thames Gateway, and in this case, the criticism seems
to have been taken out on a chief 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column193" />Column number: 193</div>executive, whose reputation has thus been sullied and affected, despite
having been in post for barely more than a year. She seems to be
carrying the can. I also checked with council leaders in the area,
asking whether the performance of employees has been particularly poor,
but they said, &#147;No, we don&#146;t think that&#146;s the
case; we think this is a
scapegoating.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08011135000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister may not be able to answer this, because it is personal stuff
that relates to the Minister for Housing, but it is entirely pertinent
to how the gateway is run and to whether the transfer of
responsibilities to the HCA will produce anything better than what has
been produced up to now. If it is not out of order for him to do so,
will the Minister address the unfortunate removal of Judith Armitt
?</div>
					<a name="08011135000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">Where
does the amendment leave us. It relates specifically to the involvement
of local authorities, and it covers the point made by the hon. Member
for Edmonton about the involvement of local authorities. Precisely what
will be the responsibilities of the HCA in relation to the Department?
What local authority involvement will there be? When looking at the
problems of gateway delivery, we have picked up on a sense among
authorities that they do not feel fully engaged and involved in the
process. Things can move quickly on the ground in local economies, and
sometimes local authorities know best where jobs should be created and
where investments should be made. That has not been communicated well
enough through the DCLG chain of command, or whatever there is of it.
How will that be dealt with through the agency? For the agency to
deliver effectively, we would like it to work in conjunction with local
authorities.</div>
					<a name="08011135000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">The big
question is the extent to which the agency&#146;s handling of such
matters will be different from what has happened up to now. There are
some specific problems that I have been looking for the agency to deal
with in a different manner. For example, there have been issues about
the progress made by the DCLG when the Highways Agency is involved in
decisions and where it uses its methodology in relation to congestion
and to veto vital road connections. It works more or less as a
bystander and not as a key part of the process. One would have thought
that a Department handling such matters would make sure there was a
degree of co-ordination, but that has not happened in relation to the
Highways Agency. Will that problem be sorted by the new structure?
Equally, the Environment Agency does not need to lecture the gateway on
flood risk; it needs to be actively involved in ensuring there are
improved defences and opportunities for creating space for development
around water, rather than being on the sidelines making comments. To
what extent will the HCA provide a better chance of the Environment
Agency being brought into those decisions to make sure that more is
done?</div>
					<a name="08011135000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
what extent will the agency be able to ensure that there are fewer
targets and less mess in terms of that part of the gateway? There have
been too many targets. I arrived in Newham this lunch time&#151;I
have been out to the gateway and back&#151;to be greeted by a
headline in the <i class="I">Newham Recorder</i>, which states,
&#147;Regeneration is dealt a blow&#148;. That refers to a
consortium pulling out of a &#163;3 billion project, because it wants
to concentrate on building the nearby 2012 Olympic village. That is not
a disaster for the gateway as a whole, because the work will still be
done, but a group that has been involved in a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column194" />Column number: 194</div>major project to develop Newham&#146;s old docks area has pulled out
at a late stage, because another target in the same gateway area has
assumed greater importance, leading to a headline that will be
disappointing for residents, for the Minister and for everyone else. To
what extent will targets be revised and better handled through the new
agency&#146;s
working?</div>
					<a name="08011135000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
what extent will the new agency deal better with greening
issues&#151;greening the gateway is tremendously important? I am
delighted by the greater involvement of Sir Terry Farrell, in an
appointment announced in the autumn, because he is a first-rate man and
has a clear grasp of the subject. I am interested in how greening will
take place. Who will have responsibility? Will the greening issue be
part of the Department&#146;s responsibility, or will it be
transferred to the HCA? Clearly, the integration of the greening of the
area with the planning and delivery of housing is a key
matter.</div>
					<a name="08011135000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">Lastly,
do we have another leadership problem, because the agency will be
involved alongside the DCLG, or will the agency have greater
responsibility? Where will the Minister for Housing sit in all this?
Those are my concerns&#151;I could say more things, but I will not
raise them now. My point is clear&#151;the gateway structure has been
poor. It seems to me that the Government have acknowledged that, and I
think it would help if they were to say, &#147;We got some of this
wrong, which is why we are making the transfer. It has not all been
marvellous.&#148; If it has all been marvellous, why was the chief
executive sacked? If it has not been marvellous, the Government should
say so and explain the transfer to the agency. It may be a good
development, but we need to know precisely what will be handled by
whom, what the relationship with local authorities will be, and whether
it will solve some of the practical, everyday problems that I have
mentioned.</div>
					<a name="08011135000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">If we had had
a week to consult people in the area about the impact of the
Government&#146;s decision, which was announced today and about which
the Government must have known for a little while, I would have asked
fewer questions and we would know more about it. I am sorry that the
Minister has to deal with those balls being bowled at him, but
following the release of the PAC report, we did not get a
statement&#151;oral or written&#151;from the Department. We have
not had a chance to question his colleague, the Minister for Housing,
so it falls to him to explain how the matter might be handled and
whether our solution of the HCA working with local authorities is the
best bet. Alternatively, perhaps he will explain the structure, as it
is going to work according to the Minister for Housing&#146;s
statement this
morning.</div>

							<a name="08011135000462"></a>The
Chairman:
						</b> Order. Some hon. Members may feel that some of
the remarks that I have allowed have not been entirely within the order
and context of the amendment. My view, having said what I said earlier
and not knowing that any of that was going to be said, is that they are
in order within the context of the wider clause. I indicated that I was
not going to permit a stand part debate, which remains my view more
than ever, but I felt that it was only right to allow the hon.
Gentleman to make his case. I have listened carefully to the arguments
and been briefed on the exchanges that took place this morning.
Mr. Benton ruled, quite 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column195" />Column number: 195</div>properly, that it is the responsibility of the Secretary of the State
and the Minister to determine when they release documents. However, I
ask the Minister to say to the Secretary of State that it might have
been helpful had the document been released earlier, if only because it
might have made his task a little easier this afternoon and, perhaps,
allowed us to make a little more
progress.</div>

							<b class="B">Andrew
Gwynne</b> (Denton and Reddish) (Lab): I welcome you to the
Chair, Mr. Gale. I trust that my earlier declaration of
interest during the evidence session still stands on the record,
although I would like to correct something: I am a member of Tameside
metropolitan borough council, not Thameside, which is something that
prickles the leader of the council, particularly because we are in
Greater Manchester and not Greater
London.</div>
					<a name="08011135000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
rise to discuss the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for North-East
Bedfordshire. In particular, I want to discuss the right to buy and
social homebuy, which are important. Like him, I am interested in what
the Minister has to say. The Bill envisages many hundreds of thousands
of new homes being built over several years totalling in the region of
3 million. Some of those homes will be to buy; some will be for social
rent; and some will be shared equity. On Second Reading, lots of
arguments were put forward by hon. Members, mainly on the Labour side,
concerning the long waiting lists in our constituencies and the
problems that have built up over a number of years. In some part, that
has been because of the right-to-buy
policy.</div>
					<a name="08011135000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">Right
to buy is a popular, long-standing policy, and it was once floated by
the Labour party, although it was not taken up. It was eventually taken
up by the Thatcher Government and, at the time, it was vociferously
opposed by Labour, but time moves on and we are where we are. The
policy has led to a dramatic reduction in socially rented
accommodation. The problem does not necessarily concern the
right-to-buy policy on its own, because we have not replaced those
socially rented houses that have been sold off, let alone increased the
number to meet
demand.</div>
					<a name="08011135000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">Like
the hon. Gentleman, I am interested in the Minister&#146;s response
to that element of the amendment, and I hope that he will acknowledge
that errors in allowing the social stock to diminish cannot be
repeated. Although I accept that the right to buy is a popular policy
and that it will continue, we must ensure that we build up socially
rented accommodation, prevent the stock from diminishing and keep up
with demand, so that we do not end up in the future in the situation
that we are in
now.</div>

						</b> I welcome what the hon. Member for North-East
Bedfordshire has said&#151;he may be surprised by that. He called his
speech a rant, but I would say that it was a passionate and reasoned
argument. I disagree with a lot of it, if not all of it, but it was
well contained and well produced, and I pay tribute to
that.</div>

							<a name="08011135000465"></a>Mr.

that it is somewhat curious that the hon. Member for North-East
Bedfordshire failed to justify 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column196" />Column number: 196</div>the second part of his amendment? I did not hear a cogent argument for
the inclusion of the right to buy or social
homebuy.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011135000466"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> My hon. Friend has made a really good point. I
will use the same approach as the hon. Member for North-East
Bedfordshire and take the second amendment first. He dealt with the
second amendment in three or four sentences in order to get to the
party-political bashing of the Thames Gateway, but the right to buy and
low-cost home ownership deserve better than that. I agree with my hon.
Friends the Members for Edmonton and for Denton and Reddish, whose
analysis is exactly
right.</div>
					<a name="08011135000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the 20 years or so since the right-to-buy policy has been in place,
councils have gradually diminished their housing stock, which they have
not replaced. The measures in the Bill will help councils to step up to
the plate much more, and they will ensure that there are greater
incentives for councils to be part of social housing&#151;I hope that
everybody welcomes that. The constituency of my hon. Friend the Member
for Denton and Reddish is very similar to mine&#151;we need more
houses and more social
houses.</div>
					<a name="08011135000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having
said that, it is important that a Labour Government are an ambitious
and aspirational Government for the people of the country. Nine out of
10 people would like some sort of home ownership, and it is right and
proper that the Government do all that they can to encourage that. One
of the objectives of the HCA stated in the Bill is to improve the
supply and quality of housing in England, with a view to meeting the
needs of its people. That includes ensuring that housing of all tenures
and types appropriate to meeting the needs of the community is
provided. The HCA will promote the right to buy and social homebuy,
where
appropriate.</div>
					<a name="08011135000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
a similar theme to that which I have advanced on other amendments, it
would be inappropriate to dictate to the agency the precise mechanism
by which it delivers on the face of the Bill. Regarding its objective
to improve the quality and supply of housing in England, the agency, in
partnership with others, will have the expertise to determine what is
appropriate. It does not seem sensible to elevate the promotion of a
particular tenure type over a general requirement to meet the needs of
the community. It is not wise to promote particular schemes through
legislation such as this, as circumstances differ and times
change&#151;I made a point about future-proofing on an earlier
amendment. The legislation will need to be sufficiently flexible to
work for the future as well as for today. However, I suggest that the
tasking framework will examine the issue and move it forward on the
part of the
agency.</div>
					<a name="08011135000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
spent some time over Christmas promoting a number of initiatives that
the Government have advanced with regard to low-cost home ownership.
One of those is that service personnel will be classified as key
workers, which will boost their buying power in terms of getting a
house. I hope that all members of the Committee welcome that. We will
be debating on a later clause a means by which service personnel can be
helped with regards to housing, and again I hope that that will be
welcomed. What came out clearly on Second Reading, to me and other
Ministers, was the argument made by hon. Members, and Government
Members in particular, that housing is needed not only in London and
the south-east, but 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column197" />Column number: 197</div>across the country. To that end, we have extended key worker schemes to
all regions to recognise the fact that affordability problems persist
across the board. I return time and time again to the central point,
which is that we need more homes. We need a variety of homes in order
to promote choice as much as possible, which is what the Bill and the
establishment of the HCA will help to
achieve.</div>
					<a name="08011135000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">Regarding
the Thames Gateway, we had a debate through points of order on the
manner of the statement, and I think that the hon. Member for
North-East Bedfordshire recognises my sincerity in trying to ensure
that the House, and particularly the Committee, had sight of the
statement as early as possible. I take on board what he has said, but I
think it important to set the matter in context. The Thames Gateway has
entered a new phase with the launch by the Prime Minister on 29
November of the Thames Gateway delivery plan. The plan sets out a clear
and compelling long-term strategic direction for the gateway and for
what the Government will do to provide the basis for private sector
investment.</div>
					<a name="08011135000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is vital
that the arrangements to deliver those commitments to 2016 and beyond
are clear to stakeholders and investors. Listening to the hon. Member
for North-East Bedfordshire, one could be forgiven for thinking that
the agency is up and running now and that it will take responsibility
for the Thames Gateway on Monday. That is clearly not the case, and
there is a very clear road map for how the next phase of the Thames
Gateway&#151;the exciting delivery phase&#151;will move forward in
the medium term. As I have said, the Thames Gateway delivery plan sets
out that clear direction for the coming years. Until April 2009, when
the agency becomes established<b class="B">, </b>the DCLG&#146;s Thames Gateway
executive will continue to be responsible for driving forward the
commitments in the plan. Delivery arrangements will be further
strengthened by the establishment of a new management board between the
Thames Gateway executive, the three RDAs and the regional directors of
the three Government
offices.</div>

							<a name="08011135000467"></a>Alistair
Burt:
						</b> I am slightly puzzled. There was a great fanfare at
the Thames Gateway forum for the announcement of the delivery plan. Why
was the HCA&#146;s involvement not mentioned then, only a handful of
working weeks ago? If this was the great plan and programme for the
next few years, why has a new element been introduced just five or six
weeks later? Was it known then? If so, why was it not announced? If
not, why is such a significant delivery vehicle being introduced after
the announcement of the great plan for the next 10
years?</div>
					<a name="08011135000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011135000468"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> There is no inconsistency; there is a very clear
direction. It is clear that, in the broad sense that I mentioned this
morning, communities and local government will set the strategy in the
medium term in order to ensure that we have housing, growth,
regeneration and sustainable development, and that different and
appropriate delivery mechanisms are produced as close to the community
as possible. We are going to do that with the establishment of the HCA,
and it is entirely right and proper that Thames Gateway could be part
of that. I think that the general direction was very clear. I do not
want to put words into the hon. Gentleman&#146;s mouth, but I suggest
that the amendment 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column198" />Column number: 198</div>was a probing one to make sure that we are going down that route. I know
that events have moved on, but that was certainly the way things would
have gone. It is clear that, the way things are moving, central
Government are responsible for strategy, and various organisations
&#151;centrally, in this discussion, the HCA&#151;are responsible
for
delivery.</div>

							<a name="08011135000469"></a>Alistair

						</b> I am grateful again for the Minister&#146;s
courtesy. We will know more about the allocation of functions as time
goes on. I will press him a final time on the time scale and
announcement in order to deal with the issue of courtesy to the House
and to this Committee. It is clear from what the Minister said on 13
December that there had been some consideration of the matter. When was
the decision made? If the decision was made some days ago, why were we
not told earlier. It was a material matter for this Committee, which
the Minister had promised we would be told about in time for the
debate. If it was decided very late, that sounds very strange, bearing
in mind what he has said. If it was decided some weeks ago, why were we
not told
earlier?</div>
					<a name="08011135000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011135000470"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> I have made my position quite clear: we were
discussing the various functions of the agency, including the Thames
Gateway. I tried to make sure that the Committee had sight of the
relevant statements as soon as possible, and I hope the Committee
acknowledges
that.</div>
					<a name="08011135000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">Moving
on, I think we are in a new, very exciting phase of delivery. We have
had planning and pre-delivery, but I do not want anyone to think that
Thames Gateway has been a failure. Before I was a Minister, I was a
member of the Public Accounts Committee, and I absolutely loved being
on it. I think that it is a fantastic Committee, but I have to say that
I stand shoulder to shoulder with my right hon. Friend the Minister for
Housing in her analysis that the PAC conclusion is out of date. Let me
reiterate and advance some of the arguments that my right hon. Friend
made in discussions with the hon. Gentleman on 13
December.</div>
				
					<a name="08011135000375"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.45
pm</div>
					<a name="08011135000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have had real progress with the Thames Gateway. We have had the
announcement that Crossrail will proceed through Canary Wharf and
Woolwich to Stratford and from Woolwich and Abbey Wood, bringing with
it &#163;16 billion investment, opening up new employment
opportunities and accelerating housing growth. We have had the
completion of the High Speed 1 line, with Eurostar services from St.
Pancras stopping at Ebbsfleet, thereby boosting the economic prospects
for east London and north Kent still further. We have had planning
permission for three substantial gateway projects: the London Gateway,
which is a world-class deep-water port and business park; Eastern
Quarry, which is a new residential community by Ebbsfleet station; and
Barking Riverside, which has the largest residential planning
permission ever. We have the opening of the acclaimed O2 concert venue
and entertainment complex on the Greenwich peninsula, which had over
600,000 ticket sales in its first three months. I believe Led Zeppelin
played there before Christmas and, slightly less interestingly to me,
the Spice Girls have played there as
well.</div>

							<a name="08011135000472"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> Well, of course I am. I have misled the Committee
and I apologise. We have seen a huge amount of progress. I do not want
to give the Committee the impression that it has been complete failure,
because we have seen employment growth of 9 per cent. over 2001 to
2005, which is far faster than the national average. We have funded two
new universities&#151;at Southend and Medway&#151;with nearly 5,000
higher and further education places so far to boost the skills of local
people. We have procured high-speed domestic services, serving east
London and north Kent. We have started construction of the extension to
the docklands light railway and have secured doubling of the capacity.
I could go
on.</div>
					<a name="08011135000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to give the impression that achievement has been made. It is
right, proper and crucially timely that we move to the next phase. We
have been entirely consistent in our approach and policy considerations
that those responsibilities would move to the agency in the medium term
and that the DCLG would set the strategy. I hope that, in the spirit in
which I have tried to advance things, the amendments will be
withdrawn.</div>
					<a name="08011135000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011135000473"></a>Alistair
Burt:
						</b> As always, I appreciate the Minister&#146;s style.
We already have a good relationship, and I think that he is doing a
sterling job. He will lay a good foundation for me in a couple of
years&#146; time, and I wish him well. He has made a brave attempt,
and I appreciate the spirit in which he has done
it.</div>
					<a name="08011135000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will turn to Thames Gateway in a second, but on the hon. Member for
Edmonton&#146;s point, which was a good niggle, I want to say that we
discussed housing tenure quite a bit in the oral evidence sessions.
Housing tenure&#151;both right to buy and social homebuy&#151;is
important. We commented that the Government&#146;s efforts to
encourage more people into shared ownership and the like have not been
terribly successful, but they have been trying. We had a good
discussion about that and, for reasons of brevity, I did not want to
overplay that with the amendment, which is why I did not say a lot
about it. However, the hon. Gentleman is right that the matter is
important. Both the Minister and I have dealt with it relatively
briefly, but that should not disguise its importance. I did my best in
those discussions to indicate my concern about the home ownership issue
and whether, as a nation, we are completely fixated on home ownership
and whether we need to reconsider housing tenure as one of the answers
to the future of housing supply. I stand by that point, which is
important to me, and I am sure we will consider the matter
further.</div>
					<a name="08011135000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister may not be able to answer the question why, if it has all been
so good, the chief executive was sacked. If it was because of the
change of direction and the HCA coming along in the manner that he
described and that the Minister for Housing mentioned on 13 December,
there was ample opportunity for the Minister for Housing to say that
the next phase was going to be handled differently and that the chief
executive was going, but she did not do so. As far as I am aware, the
removal of Judith Armitt remains a mystery. There is therefore a cloud
over the career of a very good chief executive, which is unfair, and I
am not certain whether the matter has been clarified. That is an issue
that should not be left, because it is unfair to her&#151;and to the
Department if there were a good reason for the change. We do not know,
and we should.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column200" />Column number: 200</div>
					<a name="08011135000210"></a><div class="hs_Para" style="text-align: left;">In
response to the Minister&#146;s general remarks, I say that,
&#147;We are where we are,&#148; which is one of the great
political phrases in our lexicon&#151;as good as, &#147;I hear what
you say.&#148; Of course, we must find out about the detail, and I
wish the Thames Gateway well. We know that there have been successes,
but people do not feel that the potential has been realised in the
manner in which it might have been. My sense is that the Government
have recognised that in their direction of travel, but that they find
it difficult to say, &#147;We got it wrong.&#148; To that extent,
it is good news.</div>
					<a name="08011135000211"></a><div class="hs_Para" style="text-align: left;">We
are still interested in how the local government aspect will be handled
and want to ensure that local authorities feel more involved with the
new structure than they did with the old, which we will test out in
times to come. However, I do not think that anything will be gained
from pressing the amendment, because the Government have already
conceded the major point in their announcement this morning. The hon.
Member for West Ham and I have struck up two wins in this session
already, which is sufficient for
me.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011135000474"></a>Mr.

an unhealthy, bipartisan relationship. The hon. Gentleman is more than
welcome to cross the
Floor.</div>
					<a name="08011135000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would like to put on the record a very serious matter concerning the
chief executive. The hon. Gentleman is aware that I cannot comment on
the circumstances surrounding the chief executive. Judith Armitt is
still an employee of the DCLG. These are internal civil service
matters, and he knows that, owing to the personal circumstances, it
would be wrong for me to comment.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011135000475"></a>Alistair

this issue probably still needs to be cleared up, because of the
uncertainty in the public mind. Until it is cleared up, difficulties
will remain.</div>
					<a name="08011135000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">With that, I
think that we have run around the issues quite a bit. We wish the
gateway well and look forward to its further progress. I shall be very
interested to see how the agency sets about the new structures, and I

						</b> It will not have escaped the attention of the
Committee that I allowed some leeway in the discussion of the former

fierceness with which I stamped on the right hon. Member for Greenwich

							<a name="08011135000477"></a>Sir
George Young:
						</b> I beg to move amendment No. 16, in
clause 2, page 2, line 1, at
end insert&#151;</div>
					<div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(1A) In
assessing the needs of people living in England in accordance with
subsection (1), the HCA shall take particular account of the changing
age profile of the
population.&#146;.</div>
					<a name="08011135000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
come to the last of the amendments to clause 2. It has been tabled by
an Opposition Back-Bench Member and therefore has a fairly short life
expectancy. To some extent, the debate on this amendment has been
reflected in some of our earlier debates on the assessment of need and
on the one that I initiated on disabled people.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column201" />Column number: 201</div>
					<a name="08011135000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
has the support of Help the Aged and Age Concern. Listening to the
debates this morning, and to those on the Bill as a whole, I am
slightly concerned that the 3 million new homes are targeted at
families and key workers, because there is the risk that the needs of
the elderly will be squeezed out. For example, the regional spatial
strategies published by the Government do not mention age as one of the
factors that need to be taken into account. Will the Minister provide
some reassurances and answer some questions? When is the
Government&#146;s national strategy for housing in an ageing society
due to be published&#151;I think that it is some time this month. It
would be helpful if we could be given some information on
that.</div>
					<a name="08011135000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">Furthermore,
can he bring us up to date on the work of his Department&#146;s
housing and older people development group&#151;it is known as
HOPDEV&#151;which is a committee driving forward the agenda for
housing in an ageing society? My concern is that, given the very large
increase in numbers of older households over the next 20 years, there
is a risk that those needs will not be taken into account unless some
reference is made to them in the Bill. I concede that we are discussing
a probing amendment rather than one that has a high expectation of
reaching the statute book, but there is a need to reassure elderly
people that, as this agenda is driven forward and money is put into
housing, the needs of the more elderly people in the population are
properly taken into account and that they are not neglected as this
agenda is driven
forward.</div>
					<a name="08011135000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011135000478"></a>Andrew
George:
						</b> I rise primarily in support of lists, because
lists in this inclusive age are not necessarily exclusive. On that
basis, the fact that a Bill may include a prompt to an agency that they
must have consideration for an ageing population does not necessarily
mean that it excludes the possibility of that agency considering other
matters as well. In any case, in support of this issue there is a
matter which the HCA should consider in its future plans&#151;the
matter of preparing itself for adaptations and, in its design
guidelines for new developments, making sure that there is the capacity
to adapt the design of properties or particular neighbourhoods to take
account of an ageing population.</div>
					<a name="08011135000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
matter which arose, as it perpetually does, in the evidence sessions,
was that of older people, particularly older single people, living in
large family houses, and of there being insufficient incentives within
the system to enable or even encourage them to move, releasing the
family house and living in appropriate&#151;very
comfortable&#151;accommodation. There are, therefore, very strong
arguments for considering the issue and for its being part of the
HCA&#146;s objectives.</div>
					<a name="08011135000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">I support the
right hon. Gentleman in hoping that the Government will not share the
view, which the right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich seemed to
take in an earlier intervention, that simply creating one additional
item on a list by implication denigrates or excludes other matters
which are therefore not included on that list. I hope the Minister will
take that into account generally, but specifically on this
issue.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011135000479"></a>Mr.

						</b> I am afraid I am going to have to disappoint the
right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire. The agency, as he is aware
and as I have 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column202" />Column number: 202</div>pointed out many times today, must carry out its objects with a view to
meeting the needs of people living in England. If that community is
ageing&#151;frankly, England is ageing&#151;it will be reflected in
their needs. We will ensure that the HCA is appropriately tasked to
provide or facilitate the provision of homes appropriate to the needs
of the community, including the ageing population. We also see a role
for local authorities in ensuring that all housing funded by the public
sector is developed to lifetime home standards from 2011, as published
in our response to the consultation on the code for sustainable homes,
and as I mentioned earlier today. We would expect the agency to work
with local authorities and support them in their efforts to develop
lifetime homes.</div>
					<a name="08011135000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">The social
exclusion unit report, &#147;A Sure Start to Late Life: Ending
Inequalities for Older People&#148;, identified a number of key
issues in relation to housing and support services for older people,
such as access to information, housing options, joining up support
services and maintenance and repair. We have started to address those
issues through technical consultation, and we will continue to work
with stakeholders to ensure that the final, updated technical guidance
included in the CSH technical manual is appropriate and achievable. The
right hon. Gentleman mentioned two direct questions: one about the
national strategy for housing in an ageing society, and one about the
strategy advisory group, the housing and older people development

Shapps:
						</b> With that, Mr. Gale, I have to say that
spending all day going through clauses 1 and 2 has no doubt moved the
Committee to move briefly through clauses 3 and
4.</div>
					<a name="08011135000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
new clauses refers to the powers and restrictions on the powers of the
newly formed agency. The clauses concentrate on the central concern,
that we certainly 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column204" />Column number: 204</div>have on this side of the Committee, about the power that will be vested
in the HCA. The HCA will, of course, collect the powers of both English
Partnerships and the Housing Corporation, but rather than just combing
the two sets of powers in one neat location, the new agency will have
additional powers. Because of the way in which the legislation is
drafted, it is not clear where some of those powers
end.</div>
					<a name="08011135000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
particular, the legislation is not specific on the protection of the
existing green belt in terms of the extent to which it can be redefined
and changed to meet objectives through what are effectively tricks,
such as claiming that it will be protected and even enlarged, but in
fact deleting and moving parts of it to achieve a particular objective.
New clause 2 addresses some of those points and also mentions the power
of the HCA&#151;the new overarching agency&#151;over local
authorities, and particularly the partnership between the HCA and local
authorities.</div>
					<a name="08011135000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the evidence session, the Minister for Housing went to some lengths to
try to reassure us that it was a benign agency, which would use its
powers responsibly and carefully by consulting local authorities. The
excellent example of Milton Keynes was drawn on as an example of where
local authorities were happy to work in partnership and in some cases
to provide powers to an outside body, in that particular case along
with English Partnerships. Our concern is that if one simply reads the
clauses and powers within the Bill, it is perfectly plain that in the
wrong hands the agency would be all-powerful&#151;it would have
awesome power. In order to have an agency with powers sufficient to
ride roughshod over local opinion, two factors are needed&#151;or
perhaps only one. It would certainly require a Minister who was
prepared to have the agency act in a particularly overpowering manner,
and perhaps a chief executive who was prepared to use the powers
contained in the Bill in a manner that was not in the interests of the
local community.</div>
					<a name="08011135000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although it
may not be the intention of the present Minister for Housing or the
newly appointed chief executive to use the powers in that way, the
danger is that a future Administration might do so. It comes down to
deciding what is the best way to deliver the Government&#146;s
objective of building 3 million homes by 2020&#151;of building far
more affordable homes and catching up on the 1980s and 1990s, when more
social housing was built every year than over the past decade. If those
objectives are to be met, it seems to us that it ought to be based on
the bottom-up rather than the top-down
principle.</div>
					<a name="08011135000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
new clauses seek in some way to introduce into the Bill the principle
that local communities know best, that they can improve the chances of
delivery instead of diminishing them. Rather than being a problem,
rather than being nimbys and rather than being the ones who always
object to developments, local communities could assist with the whole
process of development, if they were given the right incentives. If
they were trusted and able to contribute, they could help the
Government to meet those objectives faster and more efficiently. If the
resources were made available, as proposed in new clause 2, many of the
objections of local communities would
fall.</div>
					<a name="08011135000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
saying that, I draw on my constituency and my own experience. The
Government want to build 10,000 new homes. A start has already been
made: 2,000 have 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column205" />Column number: 205</div>been built and we would be happy to have 6,000. However, building 10,000
when only last week the closure of the local hospital was announced
does not sit well with local people. The problem with the powers given
under these early clauses is that the Bill does not define the limits
of the HCA&#146;s power. Effectively, communities would be constantly
overridden by the desire of the HCA to get on with things, instead of
taking account of the feelings of the community on such things as green
space and infrastructure by planning at a much more local level. That
is an overview of the things that new clause 2 seeks to
achieve.</div>
					<a name="08011135000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 13
deals with something about which I think both sides of the Committee
agree. I represent the constituency of Welwyn Hatfield, which includes
Welwyn Garden City, a new town that is often studied as an example of
good town planning. I was recently in Poundbury, Prince
Charles&#146;s new town, and it used Welwyn Garden City as an example
of good town planning. One aspect of good town planning is that one can
work and live in the same area. That cuts congestion and is more
environmentally friendly, and it was being done decades ago.</div>
					<a name="08011135000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
provisions of new clause 13 indicate our belief that the HCA ought to
consider the extent to which it is practical for industry, business and
living accommodation to be provided in the same areas. Studies have
been undertaken in many parts of the world, notably through some
incredible experiments with that approach both here and in the United
States. In the States, some of the most progressive planning thinkers
have been looking again at the principles behind the new
town&#151;the traditions of Ebenezer Howard&#151;and trying it out
again, which makes perfect sense. In Poundbury, one quarter of the
buildings are business-related and industrial. One would not know it to
look at the place. There are no smoking factories. People can literally
walk to work, which reduces congestion and is environmentally friendly.
It would make sense, through new clause 13, for the HCA to have regard
to the possibility, desirability and practicality of including
developments for commercial purposes within residential
areas.</div>
					<a name="08011135000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are also concerned about the proper assessment of flood risk, and the
new clause would again cover it. I do not need to remind anybody of the
problems that flooding caused last year. A huge amount of new housing
is proposed on flood plains, not least one quarter or even one third in
the Thames Gateway. If one is going to build in flood-risk areas, every
possible precaution should be taken and examination made to protect
those houses. The new clause would help to focus attention on flood
risk.</div>
					<a name="08011135000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, new
clause 14 would prevent the HCA&#151;that huge body with overarching
powers&#151;from distorting the local market. Reading the Bill, we
perceive a danger that has in fact happened in reality. I have some
examples if the Minister is interested. The danger is that the power to
control the marketplace&#151;the size and ability to decide to pick
up a plot of land&#151;can distort the area, its housing requirements
and its market conditions.</div>
					<a name="08011135000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have seen
the danger with English Partnerships and housing associations. It
happens at this time of year, every year, because if there is money in
the budget, it is used to pick up land so that it has been spent before
the April deadline. When that happens, local market conditions are not
always taken into account, so the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column206" />Column number: 206</div>new clause is a call to ensure that this great new body, this huge
agency, with a massive budget and the potential to shape the places in
which it operates, does not push out the normal activity of other house
builders and people who are trying to provide facilities for the
community. Instead, as the new clause says, when the agency acquires
and disposes of housing and other land, it should have regard to the
exercise of its powers and its impact on the surrounding market. The
new clause is a plea to ensure that the HCA does not skew the
market.</div>

							<a name="08011135000490"></a>Sir
George Young:
						</b> I wish to raise one particular point on
clause stand part. It relates to clause 5(1), which
states:</div>
					<a name="08011135000357"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
HCA may provide
housing&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08011135000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the
Minister explain in what circumstances the HCA itself will provide
housing? The Housing Corporation, to my knowledge, has never provided
houses; it has done what is provided for in the next subsection, clause
5(2), which
is,</div>
					<a name="08011135000358"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;facilitate the
provision of housing&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08011135000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
other words, the Housing Corporation has funded housing associations,
and they have provided the houses. I do not see why the HCA itself
needs the powers to provide
housing.</div>
					<a name="08011135000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister may say that English Partnerships had the power, which is
simply being transported in the Bill, but English Partnerships has
never had the direct relationship with housing associations that the
HCA will have. Given that we do not want centralisation and want to
devolve, why is the HCA being given powers to develop, own and provide
housing itself? I see its role as facilitator, enabler and resource
provider for other people who are going to do that.</div>
					<a name="08011135000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">When the
Minister replies to my hon. Friend, will he also explain why we need
subsection (1) and in what circumstances the powers might be
used?</div>
					<a name="08011135000377"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.15

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011135000491"></a>Andrew
George:
						</b> The intention behind the new clauses is by and
large laudable&#151;protecting gardens, for example, and ensuring
that the HCA&#146;s activities have regard to the market. Having said
that, on new clause 14, the HCA and the bodies that provide
land&#151;as the right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire has said,
it will largely be the housing associations&#151;will have a
perpetual impact on the market. Given that the purpose of the Bill is
to assist the Government in reaching a substantial target, we cannot
ignore that fact. One assumes that it will have regard to the market to
ensure that it maximises outcomes, rather than the other way
round.</div>
					<a name="08011135000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
concerns me about the new clauses is that they are primarily suitable
for another Bill&#151;a planning Bill. Sympathetic as I am to the
objectives behind them and the sentiments expressed and implied in
them, I cannot 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column207" />Column number: 207</div>support them because their implications mean they are for a planning
Bill. I am keen for this Bill to allow the HCA to count in its housing
figures properties that are currently used as second homes but that
would be changed into permanent residences, but that would require a
change in planning law. The protection of gardens would require a
similar change. I am sympathetic towards those objectives, but this
Bill is not necessarily the best vehicle to achieve
them.</div>
					<a name="08011135000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011135000492"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> I welcome your ruling on clause stand part
debates, Mr. Gale. The substantial debate that we had this
morning took into account the provisions of clauses 3 and 4, which we
moved past
quickly.</div>
					<a name="08011135000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
5 is extremely important, because it sets out the power to be given to
the agency to facilitate the provision of housing and other land. That
power is central to the HCA&#146;s ability to meet the
Government&#146;s target set out in the housing Green Paper and
contribute to the additional 3 million homes by 2020. As we have said
before, the power brings land, including public sector land, and
housing into one national agency. To ensure that the HCA can contribute
to the target, we need to allow it to be a direct provider of housing
should the circumstances require
it.</div>
					<a name="08011135000340"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent">On
the point that the right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire rightly
made, the HCA will have the option of providing housing directly, but I
anticipate that that will not be the primary way in which it will
support housing growth. I shall give an example. We would want the
agency to be able to step in if a developer went bust, rather than lose
its investment or the benefits that would have accrued had the
development been delivered. Without that specific power, the agency
would not be able to take such a
step.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011135000493"></a>Sir
George Young:
						</b> But in practice, if that happened, would not
the Housing Corporation nominate a local housing association to run it,
rather than step in
itself?</div>
					<a name="08011135000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011135000494"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> As I have said, the number of times that that
might happen would be remarkably low, but it is still important that
that power is contained in the Bill to ensure that if something like
that happens, the delivery of 3 million homes is not compromised. That
is an important
point.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011135000495"></a>Grant
Shapps:
						</b> Will the Minister explain, then, why the Housing
Corporation does not have those same
powers?</div>
					<a name="08011135000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011135000496"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> The whole point of establishing the HCA is to
bring land and regeneration under one powerful agency that consults
local authorities and works in conjunction with them to ensure that
housing need is assessed and delivered. The powers in this part of the
Bill will help to do
that.</div>
					<a name="08011135000269"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
definition of &#147;provide&#148; in the clause includes
improvement or repair. That is to enable the agency to step in to
ensure that tenants are not left to suffer in sub-standard
accommodation if their landlord fails. As with the direct provision of
housing, we do not expect 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column208" />Column number: 208</div>the agency to act as a landlord as a matter of course, but it should not
be unable to do so if the need arises.</div>
					<a name="08011135000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 5 is
necessary to enable the agency to provide land under any circumstances.
In order to unlock the development potential of a site and gain a large
proportion of affordable housing on that site, the agency might have to
provide a strip of land, perhaps to give reasonable and safe access to
the site. Without the power to provide land, that would be impossible.
Clause 5 also empowers the agency to facilitate the provision of
housing or other land, which will be essential to its work. The agency
must be free to assemble sites and make them available to other bodies
to deliver development. Without the power to facilitate the provision
of housing or other land, it would not be able to do
so.</div>
					<a name="08011135000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clauses 2 and 13 would introduce requirements to consult that would
serve to slow down or even stop the agency from delivering on the
ground. New clause 2 would add an additional level of protection to the
green belt, but that is unnecessary because the green belt is already
heavily protected and nothing in the Bill will change that. Those
further restrictions could block all development involving the agency
on the green belt. It is not our intention that the agency will be
involved in developments on the green belt as a matter of course, but
neither do we want restrictions that do not apply  to any other
body or would-be developer to apply  to the agency.</div>
					<a name="08011135000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">The green
belt is very important, and has helped to restrict urban sprawl as much
as possible. The proportion of land that is designated as green belt
has increased since 1997, but green belt is a planning designation, not
a reflection of the importance or quality of biodiversity. It is
important to protect the countryside, as we have discussed, but green
belt is not, strictly speaking, a means of doing that; it is a planning
designation. As the Prime Minister has rightly said, we do not intend
to change the provisions on green belt, which has been a helpful
planning policy tool for the past half century. It has served us well
and will continue to do so.</div>
					<a name="08011135000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me
reassure the Committee by reiterating that the creation of the agency
will not make development on the green belt any more likely. The agency
will be bound by planning legislation, like any other would-be
developer. Any development would take place only with appropriate
planning permission, and the planning process will require
consideration of whether there is sufficient justification for that
development.</div>
					<a name="08011135000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 2
would also impose an unnecessary restriction on how the agency might
deliver housing. To deliver its objectives, the agency must meet the
needs of communities. If the agency provided housing developments
without appropriate infrastructure, those developments would clearly
fail to meet the needs of the communities within them and the agency
would therefore fail to deliver on its objectives. Clause 7, which we
will discuss later, is very important for infrastructure and, with your
permission, Mr. Gale, I should like to discuss this issue in
that debate.</div>
					<a name="08011135000275"></a><div class="hs_Para">On new clause
2, we do not think that it would help the practical delivery of housing
to dictate to the agency how it must structure its developments. We
consider that the order in which a development progresses is best
determined by those delivering it, and we do not think that it would be
helpful to impose in legislation a universal order, which would tie the
agency&#146;s hands. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column209" />Column number: 209</div>Furthermore, an explicit requirement in the Bill for the agency to
provide the necessary infrastructure before delivering housing would
severely compromise its ability to negotiate with developers or other
bodies over such provision. Why would an organisation provide any
infrastructure, if it knew that the agency would have to do it anyway,
under this Bill, before development could progress? That would not help
anybody.</div>
					<a name="08011135000276"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 13 would introduce a number of additional requirements on the
agency prior to its exercising its powers, which, in some cases, would
do no more than create an extra layer of bureaucracy and overburden the
agency. It is unnecessary. The new clause would also provide for a duty
to</div>
					<a name="08011135000359"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;consult with, and
have regard to the views of, relevant local
authorities&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08011135000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">In many
cases, the relevant local authority will be directly involved anyway,
and further consultation would be a waste of time. For example,
development undertaken by the agency would still require planning
permission, which in most cases will be determined by the local
planning authority.</div>
					<a name="08011135000278"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
obligation to have regard to the preservation of gardens and urban
green spaces is met in clause 34, which enables the agency to
contribute to the achievement of sustainable development. We discussed
that at length earlier. Any development undertaken by the agency will
have to accord with national and local planning policies, and it will
be made clear in the organisation&#146;s tasking framework that we
expect high environmental and sustainability
standards.</div>
					<a name="08011135000279"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
obligation to have regard to mixed-use development sits at the heart of
the agency&#146;s objectives, which are to develop and regenerate
land. That forms an important element in national planning policy, to
which the agency will need to have regard. It will also have the power
to provide infrastructure, which will include the building of community
facilities. The final point made by the hon. Member for Welwyn Hatfield
was about undertaking</div>
					<a name="08011135000360"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;flood risk assessments before
acquiring or disposing of housing or other
land&#148;,</div>
					<a name="08011135000280"></a><div class="hs_Para">and the
introduction of</div>
					<a name="08011135000361"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a
presumption against any development on flood zones adjacent to rivers,
the sea and tidal
sources&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08011135000281"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not know
what effect that would have in my constituency of
Hartlepool.</div>
					<a name="08011135000282"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I have already mentioned, the agency will have the same obligations in
relation to developments and flood risk as any other developer. I
reiterate that clause 34 allows the agency to contribute to and
facilitate the achievement of sustainable development. The Committee
has made it clear that it would like the Government to strengthen that
clause, and I am very amenable to
that.</div>
					<a name="08011135000283"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 14 would require the agency
to</div>
					<a name="08011135000362"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;have regard to market
conditions&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08011135000284"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is a
particularly curious new clause. Whether or not the housing market
cools, affordability will remain a problem to be addressed. Regardless
of the condition of the market, regeneration will remain a priority for
this Government. We still need to increase the supply of homes that are
badly needed for our people, which is why the Government have announced
the 3 million new homes by 2020.</div>

which the HCA could end up distorting the market? That is already
happening with the current set-up, and I am concerned that it will get
embedded in the Bill as well. Perhaps he will undertake to look at
evidence that I could
provide.</div>

						</b> I am grateful for that clarification. During our
consideration of clause 10, when we will talk about best consideration
for market value, we might discuss the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point,
which is an important one. We need to strike a balance, which we can do
during our consideration of that clause. I do not think that the
agency&#146;s proposed compulsory purchase powers will affect the
housing market. The valuation of land for compulsory purchase will be
the same as by agreement&#151;the market value of the land in the
absence of the
scheme.</div>
					<a name="08011135000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
new clauses have no value in providing for additional protection or
meaningful consultation, but they would delay necessary delivery and
increase bureaucracy. I cannot believe that to be the outcome that the
hon. Gentleman intends. Should the new clauses be moved, I hope that
they will be withdrawn fairly quickly. I wish to see clause 5 stand
part.</div>

							<a name="08011135000500"></a>Alistair
Burt:
						</b> The debate provides for a short comment from myself
and an opportunity for the Minister to give us some sense of how
regeneration powers are going to be used. I shall bring to the
Committee&#146;s attention some of the briefings that we have had
from outside bodies that are concerned that the housing element will
dominate the regeneration element of the new agency and worried that,
in the pursuit of targets and numbers, other things may be lost. I will
mention two or three of those
things.</div>
					<a name="08011135000293"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
British Urban Regeneration Association does great work, and I am sure
that it is already known to the Minister. It has a particular concern.
It
says:</div>
					<a name="08011135000363"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
new agency appears to be only concerned with physical regeneration with
only passing aspiration to furthering community 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column211" />Column number: 211</div>development...The primary objective is physical regeneration
(housing and infrastructure, including premises necessary to provide
social and economic services)...Accordingly, all planning and
financial powers are oriented to land assembly, remediation, provision
or infrastructure, and development...It seems a missed opportunity
for an integrated approach to regeneration, where powers and planning
of physical regeneration are joined up community support services and
providers.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08011135000294"></a><div class="hs_Para">Perhaps
I could flesh this out a bit. In my own work in regeneration, both in
the past with city challenge and more recently in my current role, I
have been concerned&#151;as I am sure the Minister and the whole
Committee are&#151;with the problem that endemic poverty and
difficulties in some of our poorest estates are not necessarily
relieved simply by changing the physical infrastructure. Yes, one can
create bright, new houses, but a number of the people who have been in
the most impoverished housing have all sorts of
issues&#151;typically, relationship breakdown, addiction, problems
with children, poor educational achievement, low aspiration and a sense
of hopelessness. Merely moving them out, reconstructing the housing and
moving them back in again will not solve those
problems.</div>
					<a name="08011135000295"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have looked at the work done by my right hon. Friend the Member for
Chingford and Woodford Green (Mr. Duncan Smith). His work
with the Centre for Social Justice has looked at breakdown issues and
to what extent some of the things revealed can be tackled through
existing regeneration projects. One does not have to accept everything
that my right hon. Friend has put forward in his analysis of
&#147;Breakdown Britain&#148; and &#147;Breakthrough
Britain&#148; to recognise that objective evidence of a series of
problems suggests that physical regeneration is not
sufficient.</div>
					<a name="08011135000296"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
wanted to task the Minister with the issue raised by BURA. What can he
tell us about the clause 6 powers for regeneration being taken in the
broadest sense, rather than in the narrowest sense of powers purely for
land assembly and dealing with the physical aspects of regeneration?
Will the Homes and Communities Agency be able to work in an integrated
manner with other&#151;social and community&#151;aspects of
regeneration or are the powers and objectives of the agency solely
confined to physical regeneration? In the latter case, we would have to
look for other mechanisms to work with the agency to tackle the
problems that I have just mentioned. BURA is interested in that and
thinks that if the agency is not going to do that, it would be a missed
opportunity. I am sure that the Minister would not want to miss that
opportunity.</div>
				
					<a name="08011135000297"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011135000501"></a>Mr.
Love:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman has touched on an incredibly
important point. All the evidence on urban regeneration projects for
the last 40 years has been that physical regeneration by itself will
almost inevitably fail. Does he accept that one of the best ways to
intervene to reduce the level of what is called
&#147;residualisation&#148; on some estates, is to provide new
housing whereby people can be moved physically from those estates to
create a more rounded community, thereby helping in the very way that
he is talking
about?</div>
					<a name="08011135000298"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011135000502"></a>Alistair
Burt:
						</b> Absolutely. There is no question of disagreement
about that. The hon. Gentleman is right. In some of the best examples,
a combination of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column212" />Column number: 212</div>changes in land use and sometimes in density can make things work
better&#151;there can even be high density with the right sort of
public squares and open spaces&#151;and the provision of new housing
can be the key in that respect; some terrific places are being built in
some urban areas. Manchester, and other places in the north-west, are
great examples.</div>
					<a name="08011135000299"></a><div class="hs_Para">The point
that the hon. Gentleman made at the beginning of his intervention is
important. More and more we are coming to realise that it is the
combination of the two things we have discussed that is crucial.
Outside bodies, who wanted us to scrutinise the creation of the agency
in the manner to which I referred at the start of the sitting,
expressed some worry, but that is not to deny that it could work very
well. However, to ensure that it concentrates on the right thing it
must bring together, within its existing terms and objectives, personal
and social regeneration and physical regeneration</div>
					<a name="08011135000300"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second
matter arises from one or two different sources. Again, we are not the
only ones who worry about the agency pursuing targets and the numbers
game being paramount. The brief from the Royal Institution of Chartered
Surveyors
states:</div>
					<a name="08011135000364"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It
is essential that a strong commitment to regeneration is retained by
the new &#145;superquango&#146;. The RICS has concerns that the
regeneration aspects of the new body could be lost in the
Government&#146;s push to increase house building levels
significantly.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08011135000301"></a><div class="hs_Para">In its
submission to the Committee, the Federation of Master Builders,
said:</div>
					<a name="08011135000365"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Genuine
concerns about unmet housing needs and house price inflation have meant
that the emphasis is on housing numbers. Whilst we acknowledge the need
to provide more homes there is also a risk of a return to the numbers
game which characterised housing policy in the 1950s and the
1960s.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08011135000302"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
third and final point on the clause is that the federation also raises
the interesting matter of how much the new agency will be able to get
involved in improving the quality of existing housing, so that the
answers to our housing policy are based not just on the provision of
new homes. There is no doubt that new homes are needed, but there is
still the opportunity to do more with existing homes and existing areas
and the federation&#146;s submission talks a lot about that. It
says:</div>
					<a name="08011135000366"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Existing
neighbourhoods, villages and towns can solve the housing crisis by
offering an estimated 18 million family sized homes, empty and
underused buildings, ready infrastructure and other small underused
spaces that have the capacity to meet the Government&#146;s projected
housing
need.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08011135000303"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am interested in the answers to three questions: first, how will the
new agency ensure that social and physical regeneration are handled
together? Secondly, how can the Minister further reassure the Committee
and the outside bodies that made representations that it is not just a
numbers game? Thirdly, to what extent will the agency also be charged
with the need to regenerate existing neighbourhoods and communities
without new build but with existing properties, using regeneration in
that
sense?</div>
					<a name="08011135000304"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011135000503"></a>The
Chairman:
						</b> I am probably about to make a rod for my own
back, but the hon. Gentleman referred to infrastructure. As the
provisions of clauses 6 and 7 are closely inter-related, if hon.
Members wish to refer to either or both, and to take both stand part
debates together, I shall not be too
concerned.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column213" />Column number: 213</div>

							<a name="08011135000504"></a>Andrew
George:
						</b> The circumstances have changed with your ruling,
Mr. Gale. Both the clauses deal with regeneration and
infrastructure. During the evidence sessions in December I was, as the
Minister knows, seeking evidence in the Bill that the important role
played for many years by English Partnerships would be taken forward in
this new agency. The role simply was not sufficiently spelt out. As the
hon. Member for North-East Bedfordshire said, there are concerns that
the motivation behind this is to achieve a numbers gain for the
Government with regard strictly to housing. There is a fear that,
irrespective of comments about physical infrastructure, the workshop
development role of English Partnerships and its other roles in
employment and economic regeneration will be subordinated by this Bill.
Reading clauses 6 and 7, my fear is that this remains the case. The
objectives described in clauses 6 and 7 are sufficiently vague not to
reassure me that those aspects will be
covered.</div>
					<a name="08011135000306"></a><div class="hs_Para">I wanted to
make a brief contribution at this point, given that I will also raise
the matter when I move amendment No. 36 to clause 54. I am concerned
that the role that English Partnerships currently plays might not be
carried forward in the Bill as presently
drafted.</div>
					<a name="08011135000307"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011135000505"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> Thank you, Mr. Gale, for that ruling,
which I think is important and shows the very close synthesis between
the two clauses. Clause 6 sets out the power of the HCA to regenerate
or develop land, to bring about the more effective use of land, and to
facilitate the regeneration or development of land or the more
effective use of land. Clause 7&#151;which I think is one of the most
important clauses in part 1 of the Bill&#151;enables the HCA to
provide, or facilitate the provision of,
infrastructure.</div>
					<a name="08011135000308"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have had an interesting but brief debate on this, and I want to point
out that the definition of infrastructure here is the same as that used
in clause 2; that is, it includes utilities such as gas or water, and
retail or other business facilities. I expected to be criticised
because the term &#147;infrastructure&#148; was too wide, and so I
am pleased that we have not gone down that route. Indeed, the hon.
Member for North-East Bedfordshire has provided some welcome and
thought-provoking suggestions.</div>
					<a name="08011135000309"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I said
earlier, a key object of the HCA is to regenerate communities and
support their well-being. We cannot do this simply by providing the
bricks and mortar of housing. Hon. Members may recall my saying during
the oral evidence session&#151;under threat from my boss, the
Minister for Housing, my right hon. Friend the Member for Pontefract
and Castleford&#151;that if we simply plonk 3 million homes in a
field in the middle of nowhere, we will not have done our job. We need
sustainable communities that are inclusive, and that also have good,
sustained economic bases.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011135000509"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> As soon as I said &#147;inclusive&#148;, I
wondered what on earth I was doing. It is a very important point that a
healthy, strong community will be sustainable. That means more than
simply homes. A range of infrastructure needs to be in
place&#151;roads, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column214" />Column number: 214</div>retail facilities and community facilities. That is why the HCA will
work with other relevant agencies to determine what infrastructure is
needed, where it is needed and when it needs to be put in place. In
most cases, the agency will facilitate the provision of this
infrastructure, but it must also be able to be a direct provider if
necessary. That is because, if the agency delivers the needed
infrastructure for a development, it may make it more viable for a
private developer to invest in the wider development area; the
agency&#146;s provision of infrastructure would tip the development
for a private developer to provide a large element of social
housing.</div>
					<a name="08011135000314"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have seen
this in practice. English Partnerships has pre-funded the southern
section of the Bedford western bypass, the A41, which has opened up to
the south-west of Bedford two major development areas to which 2,250
homes have been allocated. That is exactly the sort of thing that I
imagine the agency doing.</div>
					<a name="08011135000379"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.45
pm</div>
					<a name="08011135000315"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
complement the provision of traditional transport infrastructure,
English Partnerships has also been involved in the provision of more
community-focused facilities, such as schools and health care
facilities.</div>
					<a name="08011135000316"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011135000510"></a>Alistair
Burt:
						</b> Will the Minister use his best endeavours to
encourage English Partnerships to work with Bedford borough council to
complete the north-western section of the same bypass by using the same
skills and facilities? It goes through my constituency and it would be
a real help if the job could be done.</div>
					<a name="08011135000317"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011135000511"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> Yes, I shall move swiftly on, Mr.
Gale.</div>
					<a name="08011135000318"></a><div class="hs_Para">The broad
definition of infrastructure is very important and quite deliberate. It
would be unusual but not impossible for the agency to provide schools
and health care facilities to attract and ensure development. English
Partnerships has already built 11 schools, one of which, in the
Greenwich millennium village, is a primary school with an integrated
health centre. Both were operational within weeks of the first
residents moving into the village. Again, that is the sort of joined-up
thinking that the agency will be able to bring&#151;the skills that
are necessary to provide sustainable communities that can really make a
difference to the quality of life in our country. It is exactly what I
want to see.</div>
					<a name="08011135000319"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for North-East Bedfordshire made a few important points about
the comments from the British Urban Regeneration Association. I fully
appreciate the fact that the issue is not just about physical
regeneration, and that is why the objects of the agency include the
continued well-being of communities. That is important, and it is why
the definition of infrastructure in clause 7 is broad.</div>
					<a name="08011135000320"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall draw
the Committee&#146;s attention to clause 33. I do not want to incur
your wrath, Mr. Gale, but the clause relates to community
service facilities and says that the agency
may</div>
					<a name="08011135000367"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;encourage or develop

							<a name="08011135000512"></a>Sir
George Young:
						</b> The clause gives the HCA powers to manage
and repair housing. I shall return to the point that we discussed
briefly in an earlier debate, as we are about to confer those powers on
the HCA. I must tell the Minister that if the HCA is going to be not
only the provider of resources to housing associations but a potential
competitor with them for such development, it will change the whole
relationship between the HCA and the housing association
movement.</div>
					<a name="08011135000327"></a><div class="hs_Para">In response
to the earlier debate, the Minister said&#151;I hope that I am
quoting him correctly&#151;that it would not be a prime objective of
the HCA to provide housing. I am not sure whether it should be any
objective&#151;prime, secondary or at all. Then, under pressure, he
described a scenario in which the HCA might have to intervene, but I
was not wholly convinced, and it does not deal with the powers in
clause 8. Is it really true that the HCA will manage and repair housing
when we have the most well-developed and efficient housing association
movement of probably any country in the world?</div>
					<a name="08011135000328"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 35
specifically relates to the HCA acquiring, constructing and converting
buildings into such accommodation. The Minister needs to make it clear
exactly what the role of the HCA is. Will it be in the business of
developing, constructing, managing and repairing, or are those powers
only to be used as a last-ditch emergency when all else has failed? If
he does see the HCA as a developer, provider and landlord, that gives a
totally different complexion to the whole debate about the role of the
HCA.</div>
					<a name="08011135000329"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that in replying to clause 8 stand part, the Minister can go a
little further than just say that it is not a prime objective of the
HCA to provide housing, and make it absolutely clear that the local
housing associations will do that, apart from in some exceptional
circumstances which he is about to
describe.</div>

shall do my 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column216" />Column number: 216</div>best to be quick. <i class="I">[</i>
						<i class="I">Interruption</i>
						<i class="I">.</i>
						<i class="I">]</i> I was
going to say that perhaps the HCA could provide
that.</div>
					<a name="08011135000331"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me try to reassure the right hon. Gentleman and clarify what the agency
will actually do in respect of housing and regeneration. I expect that
it will do several things. It will help local authorities to develop
expertise, so that they have the concentration of skills that will
allow them to step up to the plate to ensure that they can deliver what
is necessary. It will be in a position to lever in private sector
finance and to take a strategic view of how and on which sites national
needs will be best met. It will acquire land and remediate it to the
point at which it becomes viable for a developer to take on further
development of it. It will be able to determine what needs to be done
on the ground to encourage private sector investment, and to facilitate
the appropriate action for providing
infrastructure.</div>
					<a name="08011135000332"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
where the circumstances demand, the agency will be able to take a
direct role if it so wishes. Forgive me for using the same language,
Mr. Gale&#151;I know that this might not reassure the
right hon. Gentleman&#151;but the main thing will be to work in
conjunction with local authorities, housing associations and others to
bring forward the objects of the agency, rather than to do the work
directly itself. However, the option is there should it so
wish.</div>
					<a name="08011135000333"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not think that I have convinced the right hon. Gentleman, but, to
move on to a wider point, clause 8 is about how the HCA can work with
land, including buildings. The clause also gives the agency power to
reclaim land, which is something that English Partnerships has actively
undertaken with a great deal of success. Due to the range of activities
that the agency can undertake in respect of land, housing, plant and
machinery&#151;for example, acquiring, improving, managing or
disposing&#151;it will be able to adopt an innovative approach to
delivery.</div>
					<a name="08011135000334"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those
powers will give the agency the best incentive to make the best use of
the assets that it acquires, and there is a range of models to help it
do that. In order for the agency to fulfil its objects of improving
housing stock and regenerating or renewing areas in England, it will
need all of those
powers.</div>

						</b> Mr. Gale, we may have an
opportunity on clause 35 to go into this matter in more detail, but I
have to say that I do not think that such activities should be an
option for the HCA. There might be work that it has to do if there is
simply no other agency, but we will need to return later in the Bill to
its role. I hope that between now and then the Minister will be able to
go back to base and see whether he can go a little further than he has
been able to go today towards reassuring the Committee and me about the
role of the
HCA.</div>
