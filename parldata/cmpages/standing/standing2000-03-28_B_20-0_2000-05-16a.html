<B>The Minister for the Environment (Mr. Michael Meacher):</B> I beg to move amendment No. 672, in page 34, line 20, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(2) In section 15(2) of the Countryside Act 1968 (which provides for agreements between the Nature Conservancy Council and those with interests in land which is included in an area of special scientific interest, or is adjacent to such land), for ``adjacent'' there is substituted ``other''.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
The hon. Member for Ashford (Mr. Green) is looking startled, perplexed and dismayed. I am unsure whether that is because we are starting part III of the Bill, but that is where we are. Part III covers two main issues: the notification and protection of sites of special scientific interest and provisions for strengthening species enforcement. Both provisions build on the firm foundations established by the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. We shall first consider provisions relating to sites of special scientific interest-SSSIs to those in the trade-which are areas of special interest by reason of their flora, fauna, geological or physiographical features. To put it more simply, they are the best examples of our natural heritage.

<P>
SSSIs represent our finest wildlife sites of national conservation importance and we are committed to securing improvements in their identification, protection and management. That does not mean that we wish to undermine the constructive approach taken by many land managers. We recognise that the most serious threats to SSSIs come not from deliberate damage but from neglect and management that fails to protect them. More than a quarter of sites show features that are in poor condition. That is far too many.

<P>
We are significantly improving the protection and management of SSSIs through the first new wildlife legislation for nearly 20 years. Measures in part III of the Bill will give conservation agencies new powers to refuse consent for damaging activities and to serve management notices to combat neglect. The Bill will increase penalties for deliberate damage, introduce a new court power to order restoration and improve powers to act against cases of third party damage. Public bodies own some 40 per cent. of SSSIs, and their activities can significantly affect those sites. We are introducing a statutory duty on public bodies to further the conservation and enhancement of SSSIs. Those substantive measures are all included in schedule 9, which we shall discuss shortly.

<P>
I shall speak briefly to amendment No. 672. Section 15 of the Countryside Act 1968 contains important powers for the conservation agencies to enter into management agreements with owners and occupiers of land that is notified as being of special scientific interest. Such agreements are an essential component in the partnership approach, which involves land managers working together with the conservation agencies to ensure that the special features on their land are in good condition. They enable the agencies to support and encourage positive management with appropriate financial consideration.

<P>
The agencies are able to enter into agreements with owners and occupiers of notified land or land that is adjacent to a notified site. Sometimes, a site will be affected by activities that are occurring some distance away. In such circumstances, it might be useful to reach agreements with the land managers to ensure that special features on the SSSI are appropriately conserved. One example is the protection of an aquifer that is situated some distance away from-but not adjacent to-the SSSI. The amendment allows the agencies to act in such circumstances and improves the provision as drafted.

<P>
<B>Mr. David Heath </B>(Somerton and Frome): I warmly welcome the Government amendment, which covers much of the ground contained in my proposed new clause 7, which we will debate later. The inability of the countryside bodies to enter into management agreements to secure the continuing prosperity of an SSSI was a clear deficiency in the Bill. The amendment goes a long way towards dealing with that deficiency and I am grateful to the Government for having tabled it.

<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<B>Mr. Damian Green </B>(Ashford): I beg to move amendment No. 663, in page 61, line 15, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`, and on the Council's website'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to consider amendment No. 632, in page 61, line 15, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) Regulations shall prescribe the form and content of notifications made under subsection (2) above.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I am happy to assure the Minister for the Environment that I was neither dismayed nor alarmed before he made his speech on the previous amendment. He will be pleased to observe that I am still not dismayed, even after I have heard his argument, which we thought was fine.

<P>
The amendments would slightly improve the schedule. Amendment No. 663 is a modernising amendment and I commend it to the Government in that spirit. The schedule states that notifications of the special interest of land should be made in at least one local newspaper. Such information should be open and as widely available as possible. The cheap, simple and universal way of ensuring such openness is the internet. The amendment therefore suggests that the council shall put the information on its website as well as in a local newspaper. The proposal would also have practical benefits, as it would enable people who do not read a local newspaper regularly to gain access to this important information.

<P>
Amendment No. 632 would also improve provision of information and clarity. The form and content of the notices must be clear, to avoid uncertainty for the agency staff who will be involved in preparing them, to secure consistency from one part of the country to another and to reassure owners and occupiers about the information that will be available to the public about the lands that they either own or manage-an issue that is important throughout the Bill. Obviously, the notices should make it clear that notification confers no rights of public access on an SSSI. This morning, in the midst of disagreement on other matters, the Committee agreed that the protection of SSSI land was very important. One would therefore wish notification in this respect to be especially clear. Amendment No. 632 simply provides for regulations to prescribe the form of such notices. Another way to achieve that end would be to add a new schedule. It could also be done through the revised guidance that the Government are issuing to the countryside bodies under section 33 of the 1981 Act.

<P>
Those are two small but mildly improving amendments, and I commend them to the Committee.

<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (Mr. Chris Mullin):</B> After the Lord Mayor's show comes the chap who sweeps up. Not for nothing am I known as the Under-Secretary.

<P>
The requirement that SSSI notifications should be published in a local newspaper helps fulfil the Government's commitment to greater openness about SSSIs. Amendment No. 663, which would require us to publish a copy of the notification on the web would be in addition to that requirement. It is not necessary to require that to be done through legislation, although it is a logical development of the process. Indeed, steps are already being taken. English Nature, for instance, is already publishing the citation-the description of the special features-and the digital bondaries of SSSIs on its web site. The digital boundaries can be electronically plotted with the GIS-

<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> GPS-global positioning system.

<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> My brief says GIS-geographic information system-but I defer to the hon. Gentleman, as I have used GPS myself.

<P>
The matter is best left to the conservation agencies, in the light of general Government requirements for electronic communication.

<P>
Amendment No. 632 suggests that regulations should prescribe the form of notification in the local newspaper. We appreciate that members of the public may be led into thinking that, as a result of its notification, an SSSI was therefore open to public access. However, that matter can be resolved administratively, with a standard format for the notification being agreed between the agencies and the Secretary of State. It could also be covered in the code of guidance to be issued on the implementation of the new procedures in the Bill. Informal consultation is now in hand on the code, which will shortly be issued for formal consultation.

<P>
I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I think that the Under-Secretary was acting in his sweeper role. He was slightly more convincing on the second amendment-I am glad that the guidance will include notification-than on amendment No. 663, not least because some areas may not have a local newspaper. With more and other means of communication being available, one suspects that increasingly large parts of the country may not have a widely read local newspaper; those other forms of communication will soak up the available advertising revenue. It is regrettable that the Government do not wish to add such a cost-free measure to the Bill. However, I hear what the Minister says. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. James Paice </B>(South-East Cambridgeshire): I beg to move amendment No. 614, in page 61, line 26, after ``views'', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`as presented by a person of recognised land management qualifications and expertise'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
The amendment concerns the views of the council. Many issues will be involved in those views, because the schedule refers to many functions. It mentions
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>views the Council may have about the conservation and enhancement of that flora or fauna or those features<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and refers also to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the management of the land.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The purpose of inserting the obligation to ensure that whoever gives the council's views has the necessary expertise is self-evident. It is to ensure credibility and that the council's views are reached from a position of knowledge. Such provisions are not novel and appear often in legislation. The last instance that I dealt with concerned the Food Standards Authority. We several times included reference to people's qualifications in the Food Standards Bill, and it is only right that that should happen in this case. The council's views with respect to notices about SSSIs will be important. Any loss of its credibility is the last thing that we would want.

<P>
I have not stipulated what the necessary qualifications should be, because they will vary. Different qualifications will be needed to deal with land management from those needed to deal with a geological feature or rare plant. Suitably qualified people should deal with whatever arises under the provision.

<P>

<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I am sorry to say that we do not consider the amendment necessary. The views set out in the notification will be those of the conservation agency's council, which benefits already from a wealth of experience and expertise. The views will be drawn together by agency staff who are experienced in conservation management and who will also be able to seek specialist advice on difficult issues. Given that the views will be pitched at a general level, I am confident that we shall be able to rely on agency expertise. The statement of the council's views is part of the notification of the SSSI to the owner and occupier, who will have an opportunity to object or make representations to the agency's council.

<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I hear what the Under-Secretary says, which seems unnecessarily rejectionist, if I may coin such an expression. Our suggestion would not harm the Bill and in my view would add to it. The Under-Secretary does not consider it necessary and I hope that nothing ever happens to prove that it is. I accept his assurances that suitably qualified people will always be used and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 633, in page 62, line 4, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and any entry in the register of local land charges in relation to such a notification shall include the address of the Council and state that further details of the notification may be obtained therefrom'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
The amendment is another attempt to improve the clarity of information. There are concerns that the local land charges register often provides little useful information about an SSSI that affects a landholding. One example is provided by the register entry for one of the river SSSIs. It fails to point out that the SSSI comprises not only the river but a margin of up to 10 m inland from the top of the bank. Anyone inspecting the register on seeking to purchase such land could reasonably be expected to assume that the SSSI included only the river. If the purchaser started to cultivate land within the 10 m strip, there would be trouble with the countryside bodies. An offence could be committed with no ill intent on the part of a new landowner. Ways must be found of ensuring that anyone interrogating the register can readily obtain further relevant information on the SSSI. There would otherwise be a danger of the register letting down English Nature or the Countryside Council for Wales by not informing new owners that land was in an SSSI. Damage and enforcement action might result, which could have been avoided had the search automatically led to fuller proper information being available at the start of the process.

<P>
The amendment seeks to tackle the problem by requiring the register to note that land is part of an SSSI and to provide the address of the relevant local office so that further investigations might be prompted. That could then become part of the habit of anyone buying land that might appear to be near, but which is actually on, an SSSI. If the principle of caveat emptor is to be applied, the emptor might be encouraged to know that he or she will be getting full information when buying.

<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> Oh dear, I am afraid that I must ask for this amendment to be withdrawn as well. The general problem with this and the preceding amendment is that they are over-prescriptive. We are anxious not to be over-prescriptive in the Bill. I would have thought that that would generally have fitted with the philosophy of the Opposition, although I can see the hon. Member for Mid-Sussex (Mr. Soames) making faces at me.

<P>
The format of entries in the local land changes register, which covers issues wider than those of the Department, is an administrative matter. A legislative provision is not required. Further, the Lord Chancellor's Department which has a say in the matter, is concerned not to include too much detail on the register. That could make the register larger and more complicated and might set a precedent that others would want to follow. Although a contact address for the conservation agency would be a useful piece of information, any person conducting a search would surely seek further information on discovering that a site was notified as an SSSI. The need to update existing records, if the amendment was passed, would be an additional complication. That would be a large bureaucratic exercise. I must thus ask for the amendment to be withdrawn, although it pains me to do so.

<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> We can share the Under-Secretary's pain. Of the gallery of reasons that he gave, that the measure would force public bodies to update their records was possibly the weakest reason that I have heard any member of the Committee give. Clearly, public bodies should have up-to-date records. If the records are not up to date, they should keep them up to date since they are meant to be providing a public service. Having got that off my chest, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 678, in page 62, line 28, leave out ``28(2)'' and insert ``28(3)''.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may consider the following: Amendment No. 664, in page 62, line 28, after ``28(2),'' insert ``, (3) and (4)''.

<P>
Government amendment No. 679, in page 63, line 17, leave out ``28(2)'' and insert ``28(3)''.

<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> Amendments Nos. 678 and 679 correct drafting errors.

<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> In your infinite wisdom, Mr. Malins, you have included in the group amendment No. 664, which has nothing to do with drafting changes. It has a more significant intent than that. It looks like just a couple of figures but its purpose is to create equity in the notification procedures for SSSIs. The Bill maintains the provisions in the 1981 Act so that, when the Nature Conservancy Council first notifies a landowner of an intent to designate an area as an SSSI, it must consult the stakeholders over a period of three months. The Bill also extends the NCC's powers to vary the matters after the notification. However, that subsequent variation or modification is not subject to further notification to the landowner or other interested parties. The amendment would require notification to be given of an intention to extend variations or modifications after the initial notification has been given.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Amendment No. 664 is in this group of amendments because, if amendment No. 678 is agreed to, it will fall. Does the Under-Secretary wish to respond?

<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> Not in those circumstances.

<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I would appreciate it if the Under-Secretary did respond. I accept what you say about amendment No. 664 falling, Mr. Malins, but I should like to know what is wrong with what we want to do.

<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I am always happy to speak, but if the amendment falls, there is not much to add. This is a dispute between those who favour more regulation and those who favour less. The only thing added by amendment No. 664 would be to retain the advertisement of a variation to a notification in a local newspaper. A de-notification is advertised in that way. We are including the right to make representations to the NCC. A variation that does not include changes to the area of land does not need to be advertised.

<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<P>
Amendment made: No. 679, in page 63, line 17, leave out ``28(2)'' and insert ``28(3)''.-[Mr. Meacher.]

<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 680, in page 63, line 38, leave out ``part of'' and insert ``land included in''.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss Government amendments Nos. 685, 689 and 693.

<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> This is another group of technical amendments. We received some helpful comments from groups that closely scanned the provisions and we have tried to develop proposals to take full account of the views expressed. That dialogue continued as the detailed legislative proposals were published. The questions and comments that we received have helped us to ensure that the provisions are expressed clearly.

<P>
The Bill contains a number of references to land that forms part of an SSSI. People found that reference unclear. They were not sure about the extent of land covered and in particular whether it would include all the SSSI. That is our intention but, to avoid any doubt, we want to make it clear that all land in an SSSI will be covered as well as any part of it. The amendments provide that clarification by inserting references at appropriate points to any land within an SSSI.

<P>
<B>Mr. Nicholas Soames </B>(Mid-Sussex): Is the Under-Secretary generally satisfied with Government amendments and the structure of the Bill? Does he believe that the Government are in complete compliance with the European habitat and wild bird directives. He may know that Margot Wallström, an Environment Commissioner in Brussels, has expressed some concern about our failure to act on those directives. Will he assure the Committee that we are at all stages in compliance with them?

<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I can certainly assure the Committee that we believe that to be the case. Those who think differently should draw my attention to particular instances, which we would be glad to consider.

<P>
<B>Mr. Soames:</B> But has the hon. Gentleman not seen the extensive comments-they appeared in The Sunday Telegraph, so they must be true-[Laughter.] I do not know why the hon. Gentleman should think it funny. The newspaper was commenting on Ms Wallström's great concern about the fact that we are not complying with the directives, because if we are not it will not be possible for members of the general public to wander at will over sites of special scientific interest and special protection areas.

<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> My understanding is that we are in compliance. I shall certainly study the article in The Sunday Telegraph to which the hon. Gentleman referred, although I do not usually read that or any other Sunday newspaper.

<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<P>

<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 682, in page 63, line 44, leave out ``written''.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss Government amendments Nos. 684, 688, 690 to 692, 694 and 698.

<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> These are technical amendments about the giving of notices in writing. We were keen to ensure, when drafting the provisions, that people should be quite clear about the procedures to be adopted and the information to be given. Instances of confusion and misunderstanding often arise when a notice is given only verbally. We want to minimise the scope for that. Amendment No. 698 therefore inserts into section 52 of the 1981 Act-which is about the interpretation of part II of that Act, and which therefore applies to the provisions on SSSIs-that references to ``notice'' and ``notification'' mean notice or notification in writing. The other amendments, including the lead amendment, delete references in schedule 9 that become unnecessary as a result.

<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I seek further clarification about the effect of the amendments. My reading of this group of amendments is that it will be more likely that verbal and therefore confusing notice will be given, because they would remove ``in writing'' or ``written''. I understood the Under-Secretary to say that the amendments would make it more likely, indeed essential, that such notice would be written rather than oral. If so, I shall take his word for it. On the surface, however, the amendments do the opposite of what he says.

<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> That is not my understanding. The purpose of the amendments is to prevent any possibility of confusion where a notice is given verbally. We want to minimise the scope for that. I hope that is as clear to him as it is to me.

<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 635, in page 64, line 9, at end insert-
{**UF5**}
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(d) that the operation is carried out in accordance with the terms of an agreement under the 1981 Act, the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979, the Environment Act 1995, the Agriculture Act 1986, the Forestry Act 1967, or section 68 of this Act'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
Amendment No. 635 seeks to add in line 9 on page 64 the principle that an operation should be carried out under the terms of an agreement under a number of further Acts.

<P>
New section 28C(3)(c) means that any activities carried out by the owners and occupiers of SSSIs would not constitute an offence if they were carried out with the consent of English Nature or the Countryside Council for Wales, or under a management agreement with either of those bodies, or a management scheme or notice prescribed by either of those bodies. Amendment No. 635 would extend the provision so that the activities of an owner or occupier who was managing the land under an environmental land management scheme with other bodies such as the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, English Nature or local authorities would not constitute an offence either.

<P>
The usual practice is for the body offering an environmental land management agreement on an SSSI to liaise with English Nature or the Countryside Council for Wales on the terms of that agreement. The land management activities required under the agreement are therefore usually in line with the management required to safeguard the SSSI. However, the possibility remains that an owner may do work under the terms of such an agreement which English Nature or the Countryside Council for Wales subsequently consider damages the SSSI. Therefore, it is possible that an owner, acting in good faith at the behest of one Government body, could unknowingly leave himself open to enforcement action by another agency. Amendment No. 635 seeks to avoid that situation arising.

<P>
I will briefly mention some examples of such bodies and the schemes that they run, some of which have already been referred to. They include MAFF and Welsh Assembly schemes; the stewardship schemes-Tir Gofal and Tir Cymen; and the Forestry Commission's woodland grant scheme and farm woodland grant premium scheme. English Nature has section 17 agreements on ancient monuments, and the Countryside Agency will be able to make agreements under the power provided by clause 68. Owners may have a management agreement with bodies, other than English Nature and the Countryside Council for Wales, so it is possible, though not likely, that a landowner could unwittingly find himself carrying out an activity that English Nature or the Countryside Council for Wales consider damages an SSSI. Amendment No. 635 would provide a safeguard against this.

<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> We are sympathetic to the purpose of the amendment. It is desirable to avoid unnecessary overlap. I am advised that the amendment is technically deficient, but we will consider it. On that basis, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I shall be delighted to do so. We never claimed to have all the wisdom in drafting. If the amendment is technically deficient, I look forward to the Minister introducing a sufficient one. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Soames:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Malins. I believe that I have received accurate information that parts of the Bill are outwith European directives. It seems to me to be entirely improper that the Committee should debate matters that do not come within the framework of those directives. Can you clarify that matter for the Committee?

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I hear what the hon. Gentleman says. However, there is nothing to prevent the Committee from considering the Bill. The issue that the hon. Gentleman raises is a matter for debate. It is for Ministers to defend their position. To put it in the vernacular, it is all part of the hurly-burly of debate, not a matter for the Chair.

<P>
<B>Miss Anne McIntosh </B>(Vale of York): Further to that point of order. Mr Malins. Last week, we met the commissioner, Ms Margot Wallström, and it might help the Committee if the Minister would say whether the Government are in breach of the directive. The scenario to which my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Sussex refers poses a real problem for the Committee's work on the Bill. I understand that the Government might not yet have identified the sites that they must identify under the habitats and wild birds directives, to which the United Kingdom is a signatory.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> That is not a point of order for the Chair. It is a matter for debate. In particular, it is a matter for the Minister, who will have heard what the hon. Lady has said, and who may choose to respond at an appropriate stage to allay any fears.

<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I may be able to assist. Further to what I said to the hon. Member for Mid-Sussex, I understand that, like several other countries, we are behind in implementing the EU wild birds and habitats directives. We accept that that is the case and steps are being taken to rectify the situation. As far as we are aware, the Bill is entirely consistent with the directives. Indeed it adds to conservation.

<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> Amendment No. 683 requires the conservation agency's council to inform the owner or occupier of the reasons for imposing conditions on a consent, imposing a time limitation, refusing, modifying or withdrawing consent.

<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I am grateful to the Minister not only for tabling his amendment after we tabled ours, but for tabling an amendment in starkly similar terms to ours. I accept the superiority of the Government's drafting. During the Committee, we have seen the many ingenious ways in which the Government have put their name to our amendments, and this is yet another example. We are more than happy to put our expertise at the Government's disposal.

<P>
The amendment makes an important improvement to the Bill, which does not require a statement to be given of the reasons why a consent has been refused or why any particular condition or time limit has been imposed. In the interests of clarity and openness, it is essential that English Nature or the Countryside Council for Wales should state in detail their reasons for refusing consent or attaching conditions or time limits to a consent. That is the purpose of amendment No. 636, which would allow an owner occupier to exercise the right of appeal available under section 28D. Government amendment No. 683 would achieve much the same thing, and I am sure that it will do so in a more cast iron way. We welcome the Government amendment.

<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<P>

<B>Mrs. Brinton:</B> The overall purpose of all four amendments is to strengthen the responsibilities of statutory undertakers and public bodies in relation to conservation of sites of special scientific interest.

<P>
Amendment No. 423 would increase the scope of the duty of statutory undertakers to further the conservation and enhancement of SSSIs. It would ensure that the duty extends to include the earlier activity of formulating plans. For example, Rainham Marsh SSSI is the largest area of grazing marsh in the inner Thames and is home to many wintering waterfowl, water vole and rare insects, such as the scarce emerald damselfly. The unitary development plan for the London borough of Havering has identified Rainham marshes as an area for major development, which would destroy much of the SSSI. The amendment would ensure that proper regard was had to the SSSI in the plan.

<P>
Amendment No. 422 would ensure that the duty on statutory undertakers to further the conservation of SSSIs would apply not only to their activities on sites but to their activities outside SSSIs, where a site would be affected. The existing activities of statutory undertakers away from SSSIs-those that would not be captured by section 28F-can have a major impact on SSSIs. For example, the Lower Derwent Valley SSSI is one of the most important species-rich wildflower flood meadows left in Europe, but water abstraction elsewhere in the catchment area now leads to very low water levels in the SSSI, especially in dry periods. A wider duty to further the conservation of SSSIs would ensure that water abstraction was managed to the benefit of the SSSI.

<P>
Amendment No. 424 would require statutory undertakers to give weight to the conservation of SSSIs when there is a conflict between their new duty to further the conservation of SSSIs and other primary functions, in a similar way to that required of national park authorities. For example, the Crown Estate is under a statutory duty to achieve best financial return from the estate. It currently disposes of unlet shooting rights on the foreshore. Wildfowling is not necessarily incompatible with the conservation of SSSIs, as long as sufficient wildfowl refuges are available within the estuary. However, many estuaries have insufficient wildfowl refuges. For example, only 5 per cent. of the Wash is a wildfowl refuge. The amendment would ensure that the Crown Estate has due regard to SSSI interest when managing the estate.

<P>
Amendment No. 425 would allow statutory undertakers to exercise their existing powers, such as their power to make byelaws, for the purposes of furthering the conservation of SSSIs. In most cases, existing powers can be exercised only for very specific purposes. For example, the Sea Fisheries (Wildlife Conservation) Act 1992 gave sea fisheries committees a duty to have regard to marine conservation, but their powers could be exercised only for the benefit of fisheries and not for that of marine conservation. It was not until the Environmental Protection Act 1995 took effect-it was enacted under the previous Government-that a new purpose was added to their powers, which enabled them to make byelaws to conserve the marine environment.

<P>
The amendments would increase the responsibilities of statutory undertakers and public bodies. That is nothing less than private landowners and the public would expect, so I hope that Ministers will favour the amendments.

<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I congratulate the hon. Member for Peterborough (Mrs Brinton) not only on the amendments but on the extremely good work that she has done on the all-party group. We all recognise her commitment to wildlife in general and to marine wildlife in particular, for which I know that she has done a lot of work in various forms in this place. It is good to see her back in the Committee after her gruelling fact-finding trip abroad last week, about which tales are already circulating.

<P>
The Opposition agree with the essential point of the amendments, which is to give to the statutory undertakers duties ensuring that they cannot exercise their functions in a way that means that wildlife protection is less well served in the areas under their control. The hon. Lady gave us a tour of some of the more attractive parts of east England. In particular, she made valid points about the Rainham marshes and the Wash, which are extremely important conservation areas. She said, and I use her words, that only 5 per cent. of the Wash could act as a refuge, but I remind her that that is still quite a significant area. Those of us who know the area well, including my hon. Friend the Member for South-East Cambridge (Mr. Paice), will confirm that it is a prime example of a location where the interests of people who enjoy shooting and wildlife conservation come together extremely well and are managed successfully.

<P>
The hon. Lady has pursued a fruitful line of argument by tabling the amendments and I join her in urging the Ministers to accept them.

<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I, too, pay a warm tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for Peterborough for her careful preparation of the amendments and for her graphic portrayal of their application. I also pay tribute to her for her general work, which, as the hon. Member for Ashford said, has covered a range of wildlife issues, and for her energy and enthusiasm in pursuing that work in a number of ways.

<P>
Having said that, and while I recognise the hon. Lady's concerns and have a lot of sympathy with her aims, I am not convinced that all of the amendments are necessary. We will, however, consider the matters that they arise, some of which are of great importance. We have been concerned for some time that existing legislation does not fully deliver protection for SSSIs; indeed, that view is widely held. One issue that we have considered especially carefully is the role of public bodies both when they operate within SSSIs and when their activities affect such areas indirectly. However, the structure of the Bill takes account of the issue and fully delivers the obligations that we seek to impose. If that is not so, I will listen, now or on Report, to the arguments that suggest that we are failing.

<P>
I have listened carefully to my hon. Friend's argument but I am not convinced that the amendments to include provisions regarding the formulation or consideration of plans or projects are necessary. The provision is implicit in the clause. However, I accept that the duty on public bodies relating to activities that take place off site, when they affect the special features of a SSSI, should be made clear. I am happy to assure her that we will consider the issue further.

<P>
Amendment No. 424 would give greater weight to the SSSI duty when there was a conflict of interest. We expect public bodies to pay full regard to the new duty that we are imposing on them, and that the duty will be rigorous. The Government are also firmly committed to the principle of sustainable development. As I said this morning, that principle involves the balancing of interests, including social factors. I have said repeatedly that I expect the nature conservation interest to be paramount when there is a conflict. That remains my view. My problem is with insisting that that should always and without fail be the case. I do not believe that view to be justified. One could envisage exceptional circumstances in which the other duties of a public body outweighed the nature conservation interest with regard to SSSIs. Such a situation would be exceptional and not the rule, but one cannot automatically rule out the possibility in every case.

<P>
In any event, the conservation agency would be fully involved in a decision under the procedures in new sections 28F and 28G. It would have full opportunity to advise the public body on the operation and on the best way of carrying it out, if it was imperative.

<P>
I have more difficulty with amendment No. 425. I am not sure that I have fully understood its thrust. New subsections (2B) and (2C) seem to relate to the public body's existing functions, and the former would add new section 28E(1) as an additional function. However, that new section contains simply a duty, so the amendment seems not to achieve anything. If the intention is to give public bodies an extra locus to perform nature conservation works outside their normal duties, that would be a radical change to their role and function. I am saying not that that would be wrong but that such a change would go much wider than the scope of an amendment. Public bodies are established and funded for specific purposes. It would not be right to make such universal changes through amendments without considering the implications for each body. If I am correct, the ramifications would go far wider than I could justify.

<P>
I have a lot of sympathy with my hon. Friend's points. We will certainly consider further the matters that she raised. We are concerned to ensure that public bodies take account of activities off site, when they would affect the special features of a SSSI. I hope that, on the basis of what I have said, my hon. Friend will be content to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mrs Brinton:</B> I thank my right hon. Friend the Minister for his consideration and am content beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment in the knowledge that he is prepared to consider further some of the issues.

Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>

<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I shall not detain the Committee long with this amendment. It is in the same vein as the previous group and would require statutory undertakers to reinstate any damage that stems from their operations under new section 28F of the 1981 Act. Its merit stands alone and it is obvious that if, when carrrying out some operation, a statutory undertaker damages a site of special scientific interest, it should be required to put it right. It is not always possible to restore 100 per cent. any damage to a SSSI, more is the pity, but it should be done as much as possible and it should be clearly stated in law that that obligation applies to statutory undertakers.

<P>
<B>Mr. David Lepper </B>(Brighton, Pavilion): Amendment No. 606 was tabled by my hon. Friend the member for Falmouth and Camborne (Ms Atherton), who is unwell and unable to be here today. It is in tune with the amendment moved by the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire because it would take further the requirement for restoration by statutory undertakers. Figures show that 75 English and Welsh SSSIs have been damaged in 119 separate incidents by the activities of section 28E authorities since 1991. Damage may be temporary-for example, when laying cables and temporary tracks for pipelines-and it is often possible for the land to be restored. However, if the damage is permanent-for example, when flood defence work is carried out-it would be appropriate for the public body to pay compensation. The sanctions in the amendment would encourage practices that minimise damage because restoration and compensation would be complicated and costly if the damage were significant.

<P>
There are two examples in Sussex, but not in my constituency.

<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown </B>(Cotswold): Conservative Members support the thrust of amendment No. 606, but will the hon. Gentleman explain to whom the compensation will be provided?

<P>
<B>Mr. Lepper:</B> It will be provided for restoration of the site, so it will go to the body responsible for that restoration.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> The amendment states that the site should be restored
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>where practicable and where not practicable shall provide suitable compensation.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am trying to ascertain to whom that compensation will be paid. Compensation will not be necessary if it is not possible to restore the site.

<P>
<B>Mr. Lepper:</B> I take the hon. Gentleman's point, on which my right hon. Friend the Minister has views.

<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I do indeed, and I shall try to help.

<P>
I support the general principle that any damage caused by the operations of a statutory undertaker or anyone else should be subject to reinstatement. The duty on public bodies is a general duty, which sits alongside the other duties on section 28E authorities. My concern is that the amendment is potentially open ended, to the extent that it would not provide for the restoration to be practical or carried out at a reasonable cost. I do not for one moment suggest the approach should not be pursued because it is costly, although there are circumstances in which it would be impractical or prohibitive in cost to carry out a restoration. I acknowledge that there may in principle be merit in examining the issue of restoration in relation to section 28E authorities, and I am happy to give the matter further thought.

<P>
Amendment No. 606 is more specific. It refers to operations that are carried out by section 28E authorities but it introduces a further requirement of compensation, where restoration is not practicable. When restoration is practicable, the expectation is that it will be carried out, but when it is not practicable, although the term ``compensation'' is used, it refers not to a sum of money but to the need to find an alternative site that compensates for the loss of the original site. To that extent, it involves different issues from those that are raised by asking to whom compensation should be paid-different propositions are involved.

<P>
The agencies will have the chance, under section 28F, to respond to a section 28E authority's notice. That response may well involve restoration or compensatory measures. On the grounds that I said that I would give further thought to this issue, I hope that the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire will withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I am glad that the Minister acknowledges the wisdom of the approach in principle. I readily grant that the issue is open ended. I contend, and the Minister seemed to imply, that the fact that a project is prohibitively expensive does not mean that the body should not take the relevant action if it brought such action on itself. I accept his reservations about the details, but I am grateful to him for agreeing to consider in principle whether restoration should be the responsibility of statutory undertakers. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and every owner and occupier of that land'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> The amendment would make what I hope is a fairly obvious improvement. As the Bill is currently drafted, a section 28E authority has to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>give written notice to the Nature Conservancy Council before carrying out<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
operations that could damage the landscape or wildlife. The amendment, and that which is grouped with it, would ensure that owners and occupiers were treated in the same way as the Nature Conservancy Council and informed if any damaging operations were likely to be carried out.

<P>
Simple fairness suggests that public bodies should have a duty to inform occupiers of the land of any intention to carry out a potentially damaging operation. Clearly, land managers and owners should be aware of any such move, so that they can appeal against it and be involved in the process of decision making that would precede any damaging operation, or try to minimise damage by making appropriate adjustments to management practices.

<P>
It is the owners and occupiers who will suffer the long-term financial effects of damaging operations. Moreover, they-and everyone else-will lose the tangible benefits that an SSSI brings. The Nature Conservancy Council can perhaps be regarded as representing the wider community, which clearly has an interest in the question of damage to an SSSI, but the owner or occupier of the land has an even greater interest. He shares the wider community's interest, but has a personal interest that, in many cases, is financial or commercial.

<P>
It is a matter of simple equity that the Bill should be amended so that damaging operations cannot be carried out unless owners and occupiers of land are informed at a stage sufficiently early to allow action to be taken where possible and necessary.

<P>
<B>Mr. Soames:</B> I support the extremely sensible, level-headed amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Ashford. Only in countries such as Russia or Britain could interference by public bodies on people's land be sufficiently great to require one to suggest that the Government should include in legislation the phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>and every owner and occupier of that land.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Given the astonishing arrogance of some public bodies with which landowners are required to deal, and given the apparent right of those bodies to enter and interfere with such land without alerting the landowner, whatever its designation, it is essential that reference to owners and occupiers be included in this provision.

<P>
By way of illustration, I shall cite the case of a friend who recently corresponded with English Nature, which is one of the worst organisations of its type in respect of such matters. He wrote to ask about a normal land management matter, and English Nature replied:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Our health and safety manager has requested of me to make further enquiries before we can consider a request to allow access.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The land on which his people would be operating is high and steep, and he wanted to ensure that the health and safety manager-one wonders why English Nature has a health and safety manager-would have an input into the management of the land.

<P>
It is essential that the Government accept this minor amendment, which would merely tidy up and clarify an otherwise monstrous intrusion.

<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> Those who live in glass houses should not throw stones. Before accusing others of arrogance or activities reminiscent of communist Russia, the hon. Member for Mid-Sussex should be sure of his facts.

<P>
When proposing to carry out or authorise operations on land that they do not own, we expect public bodies, as a matter of policy and good practice, to notify owners and occupiers of any land, regardless of whether it contains special interest features, or whether operations are likely to be damaging. That is a much wider issue than the protection of SSSIs.

<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
The hon. Gentleman has been present for much of the discussion, and I have taken pains to make it clear that I expect maximum consultation, information and communication. There is absolutely no question whatever of seeking to override rights-there should be due warning, a full opportunity to make representations and an appropriate right of appeal. We are trying to place a legislative obligation on public bodies to notify conservation agencies of operations and authorisations likely to damage special interest features, because we want to ensure that conservation agencies can comment at an early stage on the nature conservation impact.

<P>
I take issue with the hon. Gentleman's gross calumny of English Nature. All public bodies can be criticised for the way in which they carry out their duties, but I believe that English Nature does an excellent job. It tries to strike a balance between looking after the public interest by preserving biodiversity and wildlife, and protecting the due and legitimate rights of landowners to go about their proper business. The number of complaints made by landowners is tiny-one could probably count them on the fingers of one hand-so the hon. Gentleman should withdraw his comment, which was unfair and disproportionate.

<P>

<B>Mr. Soames:</B> I am the first the acknowledge that the right hon. Gentleman is extremely consensual. Indeed, those who have made representations to him in respect of the Bill have been impressed. They expected to find a twin-headed hydra with blood coming from its mouths, but were impressed to discover someone who is extremely courteous and helpful. Of course, he listened to nothing that they said, just as he ignored the points that we made this morning in respect of game conservancy.

<P>
I am afraid that I cannot withdraw my comments on English Nature. If the right hon. Gentleman and his party really believe that only a miniscule number of complaints have arisen from the actions of English Nature and other bodies and bureaucrats who interfere in people's land, trample everywhere and have the apparent right of unmitigated access, they are indeed totally out of touch with the countryside.

<P>
I shall write to the hon. Gentleman about the case of my friend, to which I referred earlier. English Nature produced a six-page document-a ``site hazard assessment''-for a moor. That is barmy. People such as my friend live and work in the hills. They know what goes on there. They need no ``site hazard assessment''. We are not dealing with a GLC clearance operative who is told that he should not get his arm caught in a waste disposal machine. The right hon. Gentleman is living in cloud-cuckoo land.

<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> Others will judge which of us is living in cloud-cuckoo land. I accept that objections are made in certain cases. I am also conscious that we are straying from the terms of the amendment which seeks to ensure that owners and occupiers are properly informed before action is taken. I have made it clear that that will happen, and I believe that English Nature will inform such people in every case.

<P>
Procedures have been established to deal with the considerable tensions that arise from asserting the public interest, protecting biodiversity and wildlife, and protecting landowners. Most landowners understand the purpose of English Nature and the conservation agencies and co-operate fully with them. Only a very small number are intransigent and extremely difficult. The previous chair of English Nature, who was appointed by the previous Government, the Earl of Cranbrook, for whom I have the greatest respect, made it clear to me that his relations with landowners and those with land management interests were, on the whole, extremely cordial, but that a tiny number were very difficult.

<P>
There is no question that the purpose of the amendment is fully carried through. The only issue is whether it should be statutory. We believe that it is a matter of policy and good practice and that the advance notice gives the conservation agency an opportunity to comment at an early stage on the nature conservation impact. That is right and that we should support it. I do not consider that amendments Nos. 665 and 666 are necessary or appropriate and I hope that they will not be pressed, on the grounds that what they seek is already in place.

<P>
<B>Mr. Soames:</B> I apologise for the length of my earlier intervention.

<P>
I am aware that the Minister is trying to strike a balance, but I assure him that the balance is not struck. It is not intransigent landowners who feel put upon; it is almost every landowner and farmer in the land, and they will feel a great deal more put upon because of the Bill. I assure the Minister that what he says is normal custom and practice is not normal custom and practice, however much I know he would like it to be, and I would like it to be. The Government have accepted almost none of our very sensible suggestions. It cannot cost them anything to add the words ``and the landowner''. I cannot understand why the Minister is so leery of and nervous about adding that phrase, as it would give added protection, which I assure him does not exist. However much he may fancy that we live in an idyllic world, in which landowners are nicely rung up by people saying, ``Can we please come and do this, that and the other'', that is not true. I urge the Minister to give the landowner the additional protection in the Bill to which they are entitled.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I support my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Sussex. Perhaps I may give the Committee an example. The body involved may intend to be courteous, but if these matters are not enshrined in statute, officials can shelter behind that fact and may become over-officious. I had that problem with my local authority. Before I put it on record, I wish to say that I think that it is one of the best-run local authorities in the country.

<P>
Somebody who was running a three-day event course suddenly found a planning inspector wandering around the course without having obtained any permission whatsoever. When I complained to the chief executive, the local authority grubbed around and found in statute that its officials did have the right to enter the land without any prior notice, although, since I complained, it has not happened again, as far as I know.

<P>
Therefore, I urge the Minister to consider the proposal seriously. It is a simple matter of courtesy, it would not cost the Government any money and it would remind officials in local authorities that they should pay heed to the proper courtesies and notify the owners and occupiers of the land.

<P>
<B>Mr. David Heath:</B> I understand why the Minister is resisting the amendment: no doubt he considers it to be otiose. I am not sure that that is correct. There is a need to ensure that landowners are aware of operations that may affect their land. I believe the amendment may be slightly more important than the Minister may think on first reading because section 28F(2) means that notification applies to operations on land that is not included in the SSSI, so it could be land in different ownership. Therefore, there would be no necessity, and probably no normal protocol, for the statutory undertaker to advise the other landowner that an operation was taking place that could affect the SSSI interest on the land under the amendment and under subsection (1). Therefore, there is merit in the amendment, and I ask the Minister to consider carefully whether it might be a valuable addition to the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I shall respond to that and I can probably help the Committee. I repeat that I think that the number of occasions when such an occurrence happens is relatively small. However, I am prepared to look at the evidence to the contrary. If the hon. Member for Mid-Sussex has evidence that this practice is significant or widespread, or even on a greater scale than I had realised, perhaps he will supply me with that evidence.

<P>
I will look at the amendment again. There is no difference between us about the objective, which is that those who own the land should be given advance information about the authority's intentions. Unlike the hon. Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown), I strongly support the authority's intentions in seeking to make a difficult judgment between conflicting tensions-privacy for the landowner and the need to protect biodiversity and wildlife. If the system is breaking down or that is not happening, I am more than happy to consider making it a statutory requirement. I am not giving a commitment at this stage, but if the hon. Gentleman provides me with the evidence-no doubt there will be further consultations outside the Room-I will consider it. If it will make a difference to relations over the issue, I should be more than happy to consider it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I am obviously grateful for the Minister's move as far as it goes, but the debate has provoked more emotion than I anticipated and the half-concession that he has made has not addressed it. I am sure that my hon. Friend will have a great deal of evidence to back up his case, but even if the Minister does not regard it as good enough, we tabled the amendment-which the Minister says merely reflects current practice-to prevent any slippage from the highest standards.

<P>
If the world is as the Minister sees it and there is little friction between landowners and conservation bodies, the amendment will not alter anything. It will merely mean that, as the years go on, it will be impossible for friction to be caused by lack of information. If the world is as my hon. Friend sees it, the amendment will have a significant effect on the conservation bodies, forcing them to behave better, and will therefore remove that cause of friction.

<P>
I can see no downside for anyone involved in this process as a result of the Government's accepting our amendments. Where I part company from the Minister is that it is not a question of whether a particular problem needs to be addressed at present; it is that that problem would be removed permanently if the Government accepted the amendments. Therefore, I shall continue to press them.

<P>

<B>Mrs Brinton:</B> The overall purpose of the amendments is to extend the provisions of paragraph 28F, on the duties of statutory undertakers in relation to carrying out operations, to the activities that statutory undertakers may give consent to others to carry out. Under the Bill as it stands, those consenting bodies do not have to have regard to conservation agency advice, and no attempt to minimise damage is necessary. The amendments would insert into paragraph 28F the phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>or cause or permit to be carried out<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
in relation to section 28E authorities carrying out damaging operations. Such authorities would then be responsible for ensuring that damage is minimised in respect of operations to which they have consented but are carried out by others. That would bring the responsibilities of public bodies more in line with those of private owners and occupiers.

<P>
I shall give an example to illustrate why that is important. In Dungeness, in Kent-an area of coastal shingle of European significance-the National Grid consented to the erection of a fence close to a colony of rare early spider orchids, without consulting English Nature beforehand. When the fence was completed, a 5m swathe, 500m long, had been cut through the precious SSSI. Although National Power pleaded guilty to permitting a damaging operation, under the Bill it would have to have very little regard for the SSSI-probably no regard at all-before consenting to such damaging activity in future. The amendments would address that anomaly.

<P>
If amendments Nos. 413 to 417 were accepted, paragraph 28G, on the duty of statutory undertakers in relation to authorising operations, would not be needed, and amendment No. 418 would delete it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> My hon. Friend has again explained the background to amendments in the light of experience, and proposes changes to the Bill that would take account of the bad incidents that have occurred at SSSIs.

<P>
The amendments would extend the duty on public bodies, when ``causing to be carried out'' or ``authorising'' any operations on an SSSI, to ensure that least damage is caused to the special features. However, we believe that the Bill covers the circumstances in which a public body causes operations to be carried out, for example, when it employs a subcontractor. That is implicit in the ``exercise of its functions''. However, I take note of what the hon. Lady said, and if she will pass the details to me, I shall look further into the examples that she gave. I shall then make a further judgment as to whether I am correct in believing that the necessary powers are already in the Bill.

<P>
As to the other element of the proposal, in which a public body is authorising or granting consent for an operation, we believe that the procedures in the Bill provide adequate safeguards for nature conservation, without giving them absolute priority. I believe that nature conservation should be paramount in the majority of cases, but it is possible to envisage circumstances in which that might not be the case. However, there will always be the opportunity for dialogue between the public body and the conservation agency. The procedures outlined in section 28G will ensure that the agency is made aware of the proposals, has the opportunity to be involved in discussions about them and can influence the way in which they are implemented.

<P>
I am not being complacent, but I must repeat that we believe that the hon. Lady's proposals are already covered by the Bill. However, I shall have a further careful look at the application of the drafted procedures and at how they might be expected to bear on the cases that she has raised. If the Bill would not deal with them adequately, I shall look into the matter further. I am not promising any changes, but I shall look into the issues further, in the light of what she has said. On that basis, I hope that she will agree to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mrs Brinton:</B> I thank the Minister, and I shall be delighted to furnish him with the details of the examples. On that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. David Heath:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 485, in page 66, line 40, leave out ``operations likely to'' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`any operation specified in the notification or which may'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss amendment No. 662, in page 66, line 40, leave out from ``functions,'' to end of line 42 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`any operation specified in a notification made under section 28(1)(b)'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> The amendment returns to an earlier discussion on the possible malign effect of statutory undertakers on SSSIs. The Minister was kind enough to say on that occasion that he would consider whether there was a case for a firmer line on restitution in certain cases.

<P>
I am sure that the Minister would agree that the avoidance of damage in the first instance is far better than restitution. The difficulty with the wording of the Bill is that there is a lack of parity between the responsibilities of statutory undertakers and those of private individuals carrying out similar operations. The statutory undertakers will have to advise the conservation agencies of their intention to carry out an operation only if, in their view, it is likely to cause damage. That is a subjective test. It would be fine if the statutory undertakers were in full possession of the facts and able to make such an assessment.

<P>
However, there are at least two sets of circumstances in which that might not be the case. Setting aside the prospect of the statutory undertakers wilfully disregarding the damage that they might do, the first possibility is that they might be ignorant of the likely effects of an operation. They might carry out an operation in good faith, believing that it would not damage an SSSI, although it would do so. The conservation bodies would certainly be aware of the likelihood of such damage.

<P>
Secondly, the operation might form part of a cumulative effect that would be damaging to an SSSI. The individual action might be minor but its effects, taken with others, might be substantial. We have all come armed with examples for our discussion of this schedule; I have a couple. The first is a case of ignorance, relating to Blindley heath SSSI, an area of wet heath in Surrey. The parish council had the sensible idea that they should clear an area of the heath, so that the pub sign was more visible. I am sure that the good burghers of Blindley heath saw that as a sensible thing to do. The council contracted workers to clear part of the heath.

<P>
Unfortunately, what the council did not realise was that the work was causing substantial damage to part of an SSSI. They did not consult English Nature, before flail mowing the area and removing trees from a pond. As a result, nightingale and great crested newt habitat was destroyed. In that case, an authority that I have no reason to suppose was not acting in good faith damaged an SSSI, having felt that there was no need to notify the relevant conservation body.

<P>
My other example relates to a case of small incremental damage leading to rather more substantial overall damage. Lough Neagh, in Northern Ireland, is an important nature conservation site and a habitat for whooper swan, pochard, tufted duck, scaup and goldeneye. The lough suffers badly from sewage discharges and major drainage schemes. In 1996, 60 cases of damage caused by activities that should have been notified to the authorities were recorded. Many of those activities were carried out by section 28E authorities.

<P>
I must confess a certain amount of guilt, when mentioning Lough Neagh. The last time I was there, I was in the company of a captain of the Royal Marines, who took me across Lough Neagh on a rigid inflatable boat at high speed, in an attempt to dislodge me from the back. If a large Liberal Democrat in a wetsuit does not cause damage to the habitat of the birds that I mentioned, I do not know what does. In the company of a homicidal subaltern in the Royal Marines, I may, unwittingly, have caused some damage.

<P>
It is, however, a serious problem, which merits the Minister's attention. The most obvious thing to do is to create parity between the statutory undertakers and private individuals, so that any activity that may cause damage will be notified. The conservation bodies can give advice on whether the operation should be carried out, and, if so, how. That would be in the interests not only of the SSSI, but of the statutory undertakers, particularly if the Minister is minded to bring forward proposals for compulsory restitution. It is better that the statutory undertakers be armed with information about the consequences of what they plan to do before they start, than that they find out later, to their cost and to the cost of council taxpayers, or whoever picks up the bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> The hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath) has described the reasons behind his amendment well. Our amendment is based on the same premise-equity.

<P>
It is difficult to see why we should expect more of a private landowner than of a statutory undertaker. It is inequitable to put such a huge onus on private landowners. For example, section 28C(1) requires a private owner or occupier to give written notice to English Nature or the Countryside Commission for Wales, before carrying out any operation specified in the notification. As the hon. Gentleman said, that does not apply to statutory undertakers, who have to give notification only if, in their judgement, what they plan to do may cause damage. What concerns me, apart from the equity issue, is who would question their opinion of what might cause damage. If, in extremis, they were challenged about any particular action, it seems to me that, as the Bill is drafted, they would simply need to say ``We didn't think it would do any harm'' and they would have fulfilled their obligations under the Bill, even if, after the event, it was clear that their action had caused some harm. That comes back to the point about restitution, to which the hon. Gentleman rightly referred.

<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
The equity point is significant, not least because the Bill suggests that private owners and occupiers are somehow more of a problem to SSSIs than statutory undertakers. I do not believe that there is evidence of that. I certainly do not think that private owners and occupiers should be given the impression that the Government trust them less than they do statutory undertakers.

<P>
The hon. Member for Somerton and Frome gave some examples to which I would add another general example that is particularly common in my part of the world, where a number of SSSIs in the fenland area depend on the water level. The hon. Gentleman probably has similar SSSIs in his constituency. I can imagine a statutory undertaking doing something somewhere without realising that it could alter the water table around an SSSI and thereby having a damaging effect on it. If all they can say is, ``We didn't think it would have that effect'', they have got away with it.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman has made a valuable introduction to his amendment. Ours uses slightly different words to achieve the same ends and I commend at least one of the two to the Minister.

<P>

<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> We consider that the Bill already catches the operations listed with the notification, as, by implication, they will be operations that may damage a feature of the site. The wording of the clause is intended to catch the activities listed as likely to damage the site with the original SSSI notification and any activities that may take place off site but which have an effect on the SSSI. Both amendments make particular reference to the operations specified in the notification, but the section 28E authority will not necessarily have details of those operations.

<P>
I agree with the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome that it is better to avoid damage than to have to make it good later and I am prepared to consider amendment No. 485. I hope that that will satisfy the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire, who said that I should accept one or the other, and that he will therefore not press amendment No. 662.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for saying that he will consider amendment No. 485. He did not demonstrate enormous enthusiasm, but perhaps that will come when he reflects further on the merits of the case and especially when he appreciates the argument of equity between statutory undertakers and private individuals, for whom he has no difficulty in arriving at a different formulation.

<P>
On the basis of his undertaking to consider the matter further, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> This is a probing amendment. We have already discussed in relation to various groups of amendments the specific problems that arise with land outside an SSSI that may be affected by works. Amendment No. 616 addresses a similar problem. Section 28F(2) says that the need for written notice should apply
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>even if the operations would not take place on land forming part of a site of special scientific interest.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment suggests that it should apply on land adjoining such a site. We wish to probe whether that is what Ministers intend or whether they intend something wider.

<P>
<B>Mr. David Heath:</B> I accept that the hon. Gentleman said that it was a probing amendment, I am concerned that it would immediately undo the benefit of the new provision in respect of aquifers, which may be at some distance from an SSSI and not necessarily in land adjacent to it. It would be a shame if that benefit were lost.

<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> Indeed. That is one example, and one can think of many, where the relevant land could be some distance from the SSSI. As I said, it is a probing amendment, because I should be interested to hear from the Minister whether it is a universally applicable provision or whether, under the Bill, the land must have a physical connection or proximity to the SSSI. I am aware that, if the amendment were passed, it would be rather restrictive, which might not in all circumstances be desirable, but it serves to probe Government intentions and should be treated in that way.

<P>
<B>Mr. Lepper:</B> I speak in support of amendment No. 661, which takes the proposal in amendment No. 616 further and enables the courts to order the restoration of SSSI damage, even when it is caused by statutory undertakers' activities outside the SSSI.

<P>
There are many examples of SSSIs being damaged by work undertaken on land outside the SSSI. Garry bog in Northern Ireland, Halvergate marshes, Avon river, Lower Derwent valley and Ouse washes are just a few of them. Section 28F(2) requires statutory undertakers to inform English Nature or the Countryside Council for Wales if they intend to carry out an activity outside an SSSI that might affect it. However, in paragraph 3(2) to schedule 9, the requirement to restore damage is restricted to SSSI land on which the activity was carried out. Amendment No. 661 would remove that restriction.

<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I am suitably probed by amendment No. 616. We cannot accept it, but I can provide the hon. Member for Ashford with the assurance that he seeks. The provision will apply whether or not the operation is on land that is directly adjacent. I hope that that satisfies him and I ask him to seek to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment No. 661 appears to extend the power to make a restoration order to cases where the damage has been caused by an activity off the SSSI, for offences under section 28M(2) and (3). That raises the issue of whether a restoration order should be capable of being made when a public body has failed to notify the conservation agency of operations that may be off site but which affect the SSSI. I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Brighton, Pavilion for drawing that matter to our attention-we shall consider it. On that basis, I hope that the hon. Member for Ashford will withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I accept that the Under-Secretary feels suitably probed. I am grateful to him for his response. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<P>
Government amendment No. 695.

<P>
<B>Mrs Brinton:</B> The overall purpose of amendments Nos. 419 and 420 is to ensure that statutory undertakers give due consideration to the impact of operations that might damage an SSSI.

<P>
Proposed new subsection 28F requires statutory undertakers who are considering carrying out damaging activities on an SSSI to take account of advice from nature conservation agencies. However, that is a permissive requirement-they do not have to take regard of such advice. Amendment No. 419 would not require section 28E authorities to follow the advice that is given to them but it would at least delete the provision that states that they do not have to have any regard for such advice. For example, an old mineworkings SSSI in Ceredigion, Wales, is nationally important for the lichens that live there. The local council had permission to carry out reclamation work within the SSSI, but it ignored the advice that was given to it by the Countryside Council for Wales. Damage was caused, and many rare lichens were lost.

<P>
Proposed new section 28F requires statutory undertakers to minimise any damage that they might cause to an SSSI when carrying out operations. That provision is okay, as long as the statutory undertaker selects the least damaging way of carrying out the operation in the first place.

<P>
Rainham marshes is nationally important for over-wintering and breeding of waterfowl, such as teal, redshank and lapwing. The London borough of Havering needed to clear away some rubbish that had been fly tipped, which is a disgraceful practice. Although clearing it away was a legitimate activity, the way in which it was carried out damaged a large area of SSSI grassland.

<P>
Amendment No. 420 would place an obligation on section 28E authorities that might carry out a damaging operation in an SSSI to demonstrate that there are no reasonable ``less damaging alternatives'', and that the need for the operation is more important than the SSSI's interests.

<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> Amendment No. 419 would remove the duty to inform the conservation agency that the public body had taken no account of advice. However, the intention of my hon. Friend the Member for Peterborough seems to be to impose a duty to take some account of the agency's advice. The Bill is drafted in such a way as to ensure that the conservation agency is fully consulted when a public body intends to carry out any operation likely to damage a site and that its advice on whether an operation should go ahead or be carried out in the least damaging way will be considered. We have included a requirement for the public body to inform the agency how it has taken that advice into account and amendment No. 420, although not detracting from the drafting, is unnecessary.

<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
Public bodies already have a good working relationship with the agencies and, in that climate, a full debate on an operation should enable them to agree the best way of carrying out the operation in question.

<P>
Government amendment No. 695, however, clarifies the position by requiring public bodies to make a statement of what account they have taken of the council's advice and parallels the provision that already exists in section 28F(5).

<P>
<B>Mrs Brinton:</B> Having listened to my hon. Friend, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mrs Brinton:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 421, in page 67, line 24, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(7) Where the Council does not assent to the proposed operation or assents to the proposed operation but with conditions, any dispute between the Council and a statutory undertaker shall be determined by a person appointed for the purpose-

<P>
(a) by agreement between the Council and the section 28E authority; or

<P>
(b) failing such an agreement, by the Secretary of State, and on any such reference the person so appointed may confirm the decision of the Council or give the section 28E authority such directions as he think appropriate.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
The overall purpose of the amendment is to allow the nature conservation agencies or statutory undertakers to seek the opinion of the Secretary of State when there is disagreement on how or whether a proposed damaging operation should proceed. When a statutory undertaker wishes to carry out a damaging operation, section 28F requires it to consult the nature conservation agencies and they in turn state that the proposal should not proceed or that it may go ahead with conditions. The authority must demonstrate how it has taken account of the agency's views, but, at the end of the day, it may proceed with the damaging activity and there is absolutely nothing in the world that the conservation agencies can do about it. For example, Dorset heath is an SSSI and an internationally important mosaic of wet and dry heaths and valley mires. It is important for reptiles such as sand lizards and breeding birds such as Dartford warblers. One local authority has leased land to a parish council, which intends to convert the heath into urban parkland. English Nature objected to that, but under the Bill nothing can be done to stop it.

<P>
The amendment is adapted from provisions in the Norfolk and Suffolk Broads Act 1988. It would not require a public inquiry to be held, but would require the Secretary of State to direct the amendment of the proposed operation to avoid damage.

<P>

<B>Mr. Green:</B> I am sorry to interrupt the hon. Lady's peroration because she was giving us a tour of some beautiful areas. The amendment refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>a person appointed for the purpose.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Will she tell the Committee from which pool and from how wide a background that person should be drawn? I sympathise with the purpose of the amendment, but would like clarification on that point.

<P>
<B>Mrs Brinton:</B> I am happy to respond. This is a probing amendment and I would want to consult other agencies and the Government on that.

<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> Again, my hon. Friend has given us the benefit of a well prepared amendment. It would introduce a dispute resolution mechanism when a public body disagreed with the advice of the conservation agency and the two bodies could not resolve the issue. The amendment proposes that a person, to be agreed between the two bodies-the hon. Member for Ashford is being rather unimaginative in assuming that it would prove too difficult to find someone with relevant expertise who is acceptable to both sides-could be appointed, or that the Secretary of State could appoint a person to settle the dispute between them. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman does not really want to press the matter.

<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I did not say that it would be too difficult to find someone; I simply wanted to know what sort of person would be appointed. The Minister is proceeding under a misapprehension.

<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> In the majority of cases, it is unlikely that such a procedure would be necessary, because public bodies will continue what are, in the vast majority of cases, positive relationships with conservation agencies. It should be possible to resolve any disputes through discussion between the two bodies, but in exceptional cases where a public body proposes to carry out damaging operations, it must say why, explain how it has taken account of English Nature's views, and tell the council when it will start the work. That may give the council the opportunity to raise the issue with Ministers who, in particular circumstances, will have the right to investigate why the activity is proceeding. In extremis, the council can seek a judicial review of the decision of a section 28E body.

<P>
In any event, the public body's decision will override the advice of the conservation agency, so there is no need for a dispute resolution procedure. Having said that, I am adamant that there should be-under the provisions in the Bill, there will be-full and adequate consideration, and the conservation agency must be consulted before a final decision is taken. On that basis, I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Peterborough is satisfied that the Bill will achieve her objective.

<P>
<B>Mrs Brinton:</B> Based on the Minister's full reply, I am happy to accept his assurances, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and shall take into account any conditions imposed by any existing management agreement'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
The amendment, which is brief, succinct and pointed, relates to the role of SSSI management agreements. Given the import of the provision, there will almost certainly be such agreements, but the linkage is unclear. The agreement will be between the successor to the Nature Conservancy Council and the landowner or occupier, and, as I understand it, will be confidential. It is not on the public record, and I am told that a different management agreement with different landowners could exist within the same SSSI.

<P>
Where statutory undertakers, who may be empowered to carry out work, are the owners or occupiers, they will be familiar with the management agreement, but others who are empowered as undertakers should also be familiar with the agreement. Therefore, when considering the council's response, they should take into account the conditions imposed by any existing management agreements. The amendment does not say categorically that they must adhere to those conditions, but they must take them into account, as they would take into account any advice from the council, in deciding whether to permit the proposed operations and what conditions to attach to them.

<P>
Although this is a probing amendment, it raises an important issue. We are trying to establish the intention behind the new management agreements and how open such agreements can be, given that the statutory undertaker could be a third party to the arrangement.

<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I hope that I can meet the hon. Gentleman's concerns. The amendment would introduce an extra requirement into the process. Under the Bill, the public body will take account of advice from the conservation agency, in deciding whether to grant permission, authorisation or consent. The amendment would require it also to consider any conditions imposed by an existing management agreement.

<P>
The public body is already required to consult the conservation agency when considering an application, and any management agreement would, no doubt, be drawn to its attention by the agency or, almost certainly, by the applicant. In reaching a decision, the body would be bound by the general duty imposed by section 28E to further the conservation and enhancement of the special features of the SSSI. In exercising that duty, the body is bound to take account of the advice of the conservation agency. The Bill deals with the situation envisaged in the hon. Gentleman's amendment, and, on that basis, I hope that he will withdraw it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 487, in page 68, line 13, leave out ``both'' and insert ``all of these''.

<P>
No. 488, in page 69, line 25, after ``conserved'', insert ``, enhanced''.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> Amendments Nos. 486, 487 and 488 form a coherent group. They all deal with the fact that the Bill allows for management agreements to conserve the current condition of a particular habitat within an SSSI. However, the Bill does not allow for the enhancement of the habitat by management agreements. There may be strong arguments for that, not least because there has been such wide destruction or degrading of SSSIs in recent years and, therefore, those that are left are of greater importance. It is possible that such habitats could be improved-I use that word with great caution, because ``improvement'' can often mean destruction-and there are ways of managing an SSSI that might encourage biodiversity and enhance its interest.

<P>
We should also take into account the effect of climate change, and the fact that we might see the migration of various species from one place in the country to another. We might need to establish new SSSIs in substitution for those lost elsewhere because of the effects climate change-for example, changes in water levels or ambient temperature-which may turn a habitat that was extremely good for a particular species into one that is inappropriate.

<P>
For those reasons, it would be an excellent idea for a management plan to provide for enhancement. It would not be undertaken lightly, but reserved for certain circumstances. One would also need a mechanism to deal with the contract between the owner of the land and the conservation body to ensure that the enhancement was taking place and that both sides of the bargain were being kept-hence the need for amendment No. 488, which would allow a management notice to be served if there was a failure on the part of the owner or occupier to carry out the enhancement measures to which they were committed. That would be subject to an appeals procedure, as are management notices under the Bill.

<P>
<H5>6.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
Finally, will the Minister explain the interrelationship between management schemes for SSSIs and schemes for the enhancement of the environment that are administered by other Departments? It is important to establish clarity and crosscutting-the current word of art-between the various schemes, so that conflicts do not arise between Departments over the same area of land. For an owner interested in entering into an agreement, the worst thing would be to receive conflicting advice from two Departments that were trying to secure different objectives on the same land.

<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I appreciate and support the intention of the amendments in wishing to add the requirement to enhance SSSIs.

<P>
We aim to ensure that SSSIs are in a favourable condition, and the systems that we propose will help to deliver that. Conservation agencies will be required to serve a statement with the notification of a site, which will briefly set out the ideal management in the conservation interest, including any views it has on how those interests may be enhanced. There is a difference between management schemes and management notices. A management scheme is a detailed document that clearly sets out the management required to restore the special interest on a site, where that is neessary, and ensures the continuing positive management of special features. A management notice would be used where features were in a poor condition, for example through neglect, and where the agency could not persuade the land manager to undertake necessary work of restoration and conservation.

<P>
We have agreed that public bodies should be under a duty to conserve and enhance SSSIs, but have said that they should lead by example. The amendment would go beyond what we might require from private land managers. The objective that we seek to share with public bodies is that they should sustain special sites in favourable condition. That is covered by proposed new sections 28H and 28I. While agencies would, of course, be able to encourage voluntary action that might deliver additional benefits, it would not be right or proper to require public bodies to achieve standards that exceed those that we expect of private land managers.

<P>

<B>Mr. Heath:</B> I am grateful to the Minister, but a little puzzled by his line of argument. The amendment would offer three options for a management scheme. It could deal with conserving, restoring or enhancing the flora, fauna and so on. The Nature Conservancy Council would be acting beyond its powers were it to introduce a management scheme for the enhancement of an SSSI without the amendment that I have proposed. The Minister says that that possibility would be open to it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I have been addressing the hon. Gentleman's amendment simply in terms of enhancement, but, as he rightly says, it goes wider than that. It is only fair and right that public bodies and private land managers should be on a par: we should not expect more of public bodies. However, both parties should be expected to undertake not only restoration, where necessary, but positive management and enhancement of the site.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman also asked about links between public bodies and Government Departments. It is a wide question. English Nature liaises with all Departments to co-ordinate action on SSSIs. In particular, strong links have been established with the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to ensure complementarity with agri-environment schemes on sites, avoid double funding and maximise conservation gain. Co-operation beween Departments is never ideal-there is always room for improvement-but the planning between, in particular, the DETR and MAFF, and the co-ordination which, under the present chairman, is being achieved with all Departments, including others with major interests like the Ministry of Defence, is on a better scale than we have achieved before.

<P>
I can give the hon. Gentleman a full assurance on the issue that he raises and I hope that, on that basis, he will seek to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> Clearly there is no great chasm of difference between the Minister and me on this issue. However, it still worries me that, although, on a number of occasions, he said that it was open to the Nature Conservancy Council to produce management schemes that included the enhancement of an SSSI, as proposed new section 28H(2) is worded, the scheme is for conserving or restoring, neither of which suggests an improvement in the site beyond that which exists at that point or existed prior to damage.

<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I accept that.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> Clearly we have a common understanding. I think that the Minister is saying that he does not feel that it would be appropriate for a management scheme to go beyond that optimum point-the situation pertaining or the situation that has pertained. There is a scintilla of difference between us there, because I can envisage circumstances in which it would be advantageous for the conservation bodies to formulate a management scheme that would create a better class of SSSI, particularly, as I said earlier, in responding to climate change. That would be on a voluntary basis, but I am not convinced that the Nature Conservancy Council could enter into a management scheme on a voluntary basis or on a non-voluntary basis, because it would be acting ultra vires.

<P>
I do not expect the Minister to say that he is now convinced by what I have said. However, I ask him to consult his officials again on this issue, because it would be a shame if we could not carry out an obligatory or an optional scheme simply because the Nature Conservancy Council had not been given the powers to enter into management agreements.

<P>
I give the Minister a chance to read the advice that he has now been given, but it has not prompted him to leap to his feet. Therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 667, in page 68, line 13, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(2A) The management scheme may specify that access provided under section 2(1) of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 should be excluded for reasons under section<P>
</UL></FONT>
28H(2)(a).'.

<P>
The amendment also relates to management schemes, although it need not detain the Committee as long as the previous set of amendments. It is partly an attempt at consistency.

<P>
Ministers will be aware that proposed new section 119D in new schedule 4 enables footpaths to be diverted to protect SSSIs. The amendment applies that principle to the management schemes covered by schedule 9. Clearly, in certain circumstances damage could be caused to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>flora, fauna or geological or physiographical features<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
in these areas as much as by people walking on footpaths.

<P>
It is relevant to consider that over 60 per cent. of the heather moorland in England and Wales, over which one assumes much of the new access will be extended, is currently designated as an SSSI. Therefore, I seek to introduce consistency. Where Ministers have tabled amendments to apply the same idea in relation to footpath diversion, it should apply also to access land, if it is agreed under a management scheme. Since management schemes have to be agreed by both sides it would have to be agreed by a conservation body too. Therefore, it could not be imposed unilaterally but only as part of a management scheme. However, we contend that the power to do so should be included in such a scheme.

<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> The amendment is not necessary, as the exclusion or restriction of access may be achieved under clause 24. That is a killer fact. I therefore hope that the hon. Gentleman will seek to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> It may or may not be a killer fact, but the Minister has, dangerously, allowed me three minutes to respond. He could have gone on longer and explained it in greater depth. If he is assuring the Committee that management schemes will enable such protection to be given to SSSIs, I am suitably grateful for such an assurance and beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
