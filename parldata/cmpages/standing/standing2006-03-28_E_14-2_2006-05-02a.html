<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050316000268"></a>Jacqui

Smith:</b> May I say what a pleasure it is to be back after

our snack break? I have a suspicion, however, that the hon. Member for

South Holland and The Deepings (Mr. Hayes), who is not yet here, will

have fitted in more than a snack.</div>

<a name="06050316000016"></a><div class="hs_Para">Moving away from our digestion,

I remind hon. Members that before the suspension I was, I hope,

reassuring them about the provisions already in the special educational

needs code of practice which require a list of schools, including

special schools, in an area to be brought to the attention of parents

during the statementing

process.</div><a name="06050316000017"></a><div class="hs_Para">I intended to

talk about the fact that the guidance to local authorities on the

provision of choice advisers already states that such advisers will be

expected to have an understanding of special needs policy and provision

in the area for children with special educational needs. Advisers will

also be expected to draw on the knowledge and expertise of local parent

partnership services in providing advice to parents. I hope that my

comments reassure hon. Members that we are clear that choice advisers

have an important role in respect of children with special educational

needs and that we have made that clear in the choice advice

guidance.</div><a name="06050316000018"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment

No. 192 relates to monitoring and quality assurance of the work of

choice advisers. We have already made provision for that through the

choice advice support and quality assurance network, which will be

operated by the voluntary and community sector. That network is

external to and independent of local authorities and will have a key

role in ensuring the impartiality of the advice given by choice

advisers. It will examine the quality of what is

offered.</div><a name="06050316000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">In addition

to that work, we plan to contract for formal external evaluation of

choice advice. That evaluation is likely to focus on issues including

the effectiveness of choice advice delivery and operations; the

effectiveness of our measures to ensure independence of choice advice;

the impact of local authority and/or school performance management

arrangements on choice advisers; parental perception of the quality of

that advice; and the impact of the 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column641" />Column number: 642</div>advice on admissions patterns for disadvantaged children and on social

mobility.</div><a name="06050316000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">With regard

to amendment No. 388, a key element of providing choice advisers for

parents will be ensuring that the individuals appointed receive full

training to enable them to provide the advice that parents need. I can

assure the Committee that SEN and disability legislation, along with

admissions law, the school admissions code and other equality

legislation, will be part of that training. This is a broader

requirement than the amendment proposes and will also cover

schools&#146; own descriptions of what they offer contained in the

online school profile, their ethos and any special facilities,

including those for children with special educational needs and

disabled children.</div><a name="06050316000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">New

clause 46 and amendment No. 387 relate to professional standards for

teachers. The Secretary of State already has the power to set

professional standards for teachers and does so in secondary

legislation and associated guidance. There is no need to set out

specific standards in primary legislation, but I assure hon. Members

that the current standards for teachers are under review. It is

proposed that, once revised, they will include a standard that requires

teachers to know and comply with current legislation on the well-being

of children and young people, a standard that requires teachers to know

and understand the role of others when dealing with children who have

special educational needs and/or disabilities and a standard that

requires teachers to communicate effectively with parents and carers.

That provision, too, will be stronger than the amendment, which talks

only about people

demonstrating</div><a name="06050316000245"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;an

understanding of special educational needs and disability

legislation&#148;.</div><a name="06050316000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that

I have reassured hon. Members on the amendments and that they will not

press

them.</div><a name="06050316000023"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050316000269"></a>Mr.

Gibb:</b> I am grateful for that response from the Minister

and I am reassured by some things. The external evaluation for choice

advisers is a useful measure to ensure that the quality of advice being

given is good. I am also reassured by what she had to say about the

training of choice advisers and by her comments regarding standards for

teachers. I understand why they are set out in secondary legislation,

but in this Committee we can only table amendments to primary

legislation. I was reassured by her mention of the current positions

under review, and I was content with what she had to say about the new

words concerning professional standards in relation to children with

special educational needs and disabilities.

</div><a name="06050316000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, I am not yet

convinced by the Minister&#146;s response concerning the requirement

in amendment No. 47 that choice advisers give full information

regarding the provision of special schools available in the

geographical area. Committee members have seen too many examples of

parents being denied this information. It will send a clear message if

we include in the Bill the provisions in amendment No. 47. I was

particularly struck by the real-life experience outlined by my hon.

Friend the Member for Mid-Bedfordshire (Mrs. Dorries). In light of

that, and other experiences 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column642" />Column number: 643</div>from outside the House of which I have been made aware, I would like to

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050316000291"></a>Mr.

Leigh:</b> I must admit I am very hurt that the Minister has

not seen fit to accept any of my amendments so far. Despite all the

plaudits that I have given her, and the advances that I have made to

her through my speeches, they have been all cruelly rejected. However,

there comes a moment when one gets angry, and I am a bit angry about

this aspect of the Bill. It first motivated me to take an interest in

the legislation, and I put my concerns directly to the Prime Minister,

face to face, in the Liaison Committee.</div>

<a name="06050316000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">The reason why I feel angry is

no secret. I am interested in faith education&#151;specifically

Catholic education, but Anglican education, too&#151;particularly in

London, where such schools are oversubscribed. It is no secret that the

Prime Minister sent his sons to the London Oratory school, which has

always interviewed pupils. I have sent a son there and another of my

sons is going there next year. Some people think that Conservative MPs

have a go at the Prime Minister over the London Oratory only because

they are trying to make a political point. I feel strongly about the

school not because I want to make such a point but because it provides

a superb ethos, and that is precious.</div>

<a name="06050316000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">Presumably, the Prime Minister

had to be interviewed to get his children into the school. Having

enjoyed the education that it gives, it is wrong that he 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column644" />Column number: 645</div>should now put his name to a Bill that will ban that and other faith

schools from interviewing. I feel strongly about the issue and I freely

admit that I speak from personal experience. I cannot believe that the

Prime Minister or the Minister in their heart of hearts really want

this unnecessary clause.</div>

<a name="06050316000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon. Friends support the

Bill. Some parts of it are really worth while and will provide a small

impetus towards getting more choice and diversity. All that is fair

enough. However, why does there have to be this mean-minded little

clause to ban interviews, just to appease the Bill&#146;s critics? As

my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton has said

many times, the Bill was going to get an enormous majority in any

event, so the clause was quite unnecessary.</div>

<a name="06050316000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">Perhaps I will be told,

&#147;Edward, don&#146;t worry about the banning of interviews;

only a few schools interview now.&#148; But why on earth do we have

to use a sledgehammer to crack a nut? Given that only a few of the

3,500 schools interview, do we need the clause? I do not think so.

Relatively few schools interview, but I am aware only of faith schools

that do so.</div>

<a name="06050316000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">Incidentally, the Bill makes it

clear that interviews can be held to ascertain a propensity for

boarding. I would have thought that a state boarding school, or a state

school that takes some boarders, could use that as a device not only to

ascertain the aptitude of children in respect of boarding,

but&#151;horror of horrors&#151;in a hidden way to select parents

who are middle-class or support the ethos of the school. Apparently,

interviewing is allowed for some things, but a faith school cannot

interview to preserve its ethos.</div>

<a name="06050316000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have a lot of time for the

Chairman of the Education and Skills Committee, the hon. Member for

Huddersfield (Mr. Sheerman), and he feels strongly about this issue. He

is very knowledgeable and perfectly entitled to his point of view, but

I understand that he, along with many others in this House and many in

the educational world, is strongly opposed to faith schools. I happen

to think that those people are

wrong.</div><a name="06050316000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a bit

of a hidden agenda. I do not think that many such people are really

opposed to existing faith schools&#151;the very small number of

Jewish schools or the long-established Anglican or Roman Catholic

schools. Some people who oppose faith schools are opposed really to

Muslim schools, not because of nasty, racist views or views against

Muslims or any other such thing, but because they are worried that such

schools will create a ghetto mentality. They are particularly worried

about single-sex Muslim schools, which provide different education for

girls and for boys.</div>

<a name="06050316000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">We live in a very politically

correct society, and although nobody dares admit it, I think that many

people opposed to faith schools have that hidden agenda. Others oppose

such schools because they believe that they cherry-pick and use the

interviews, which are supposed to assess Anglicanism or Catholicity, as

a hidden means of selecting middle-class pupils.</div>

<a name="06050316000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">I can speak only from personal

experience of a Catholic primary school, a Catholic comprehensive 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column645" />Column number: 646</div>school and an Anglican school&#151;Lady Margaret school in London, to

which I tried and failed to send a daughter and which also interviewed

at that stage. When I went to those schools to be interviewed with my

children, it was clear that the questions asked were a genuine attempt

to test the commitment, particularly of the child, to the Catholic or

Anglican faith. It will be said by the opponents of such interviews

that when the headmaster or the deputy head asks a 10-year-old child

what he or she understands about Easter, it will be easy&#151;it will

happen in a trice&#151;to work out the social background of the child

and so on. The opponents of interviews say that they are hidden a means

of selecting middle-class parents.</div>

<a name="06050316000259"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">8.15

pm</div><a name="06050316000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not

believe that. I genuinely believe that the London Oratory school and

others that I have come across are trying in a difficult world to

preserve their ethos. That is important. Such schools tend to be

oversubscribed. Many parents living in inner-city areas find it quite

difficult to gain access to really good education unless they are

prepared to pay for a private school&#151;most cannot afford to do

so&#151;or unless they get a priest to sign a chit in order to get

the child into a faith school.</div>

<a name="06050316000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is distressing to attend

open meetings at such schools as I have done, because one comes to

realise that some are oversubscribed by as much as 8:1. Many parents

will be bitterly disappointed at not getting their children a place.

What can be done by those who run schools that are so oversubscribed?

They are comprehensive schools: that is in the statute. They cannot

select on ability&#151;we are not going to have that debate again. It

is only fair that a Catholic school should give preference to Catholics

and an Anglican school should give preference to Anglicans. I presume

that the same applies to Jewish schools, although I suspect that the

constituency for that faith is much smaller and easier to

manage.</div> <a name="06050316000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">If we are

going to give preference, how should it be done? What is the best way

to do it? The best way is surely to interview. It will be said that

interviews cause much stress and difficulty. Frankly, the stress is not

due to the interview but to being turned down&#151;often for what are

thought to be unfair reasons. It will be said that a form can be filled

in by the local priest&#151;I presume that the same applies in the

Anglican world&#151;and that the form is supposed to determine

one&#146;s commitment. If a Catholic school is oversubscribed by 8:1

or 7:1, or even 6:1, we are surely agreed that it should give

preference to people who are strongly committed to their faith. That is

a given, but how does one determine it?</div>

<a name="06050316000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have seen the form. I also

know that some London parishes are booming because of the great influx

of people from the Philippines, from Poland and from other areas. In

some parishes in the outer areas of inner London, 2,000 or 3,000 people

are coming to services on Sunday mornings. How can the parish priest

possibly know whether or not someone is a keen Catholic? We all know

what goes on. Because parents are so desperate to get their children

into the few faith schools, they will turn up at church a few times, if

possible make themselves known to the parish priest and get the priest

to sign the form because they want 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column646" />Column number: 647</div>their child to get into a faith school&#151;all because the other

schools are rubbish. It is virtually impossible for many priests to

know who is in their parish and to give a proper r√(c)sum√(c)

of their faith, so a lot of cheatinggoes

on.</div>

<a name="06050316000077"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050316000292"></a>Jacqui

Smith:</b> The hon. Gentleman is making the case that because

lots of new Catholics are arriving from Poland and the Philippines,

particularly in the capital, interviewing should remain. How does he

think someone newly arrived from Poland without much English would fare

in an oral

interview?</div><a name="06050316000078"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050316000293"></a>Mr.

Leigh:</b> That is a fair point. Schools should be very

careful in how they handle the situation, but I think that they are

experienced. My impression is that they make no attempt to disadvantage

people because of difficulties with language. A genuine attempt is

being made to conduct the interviews in an understanding way. They

could be done through interpreters or by using help. They are not

brutal occasions. They are not like House of Commons Committees; they

are not confrontational. The people involved are experienced in posing

questions. Many people can be given help. What the Minister says is not

necessarily an argument against

interviews.</div><a name="06050316000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

trouble with not having interviews and basing everything on a form is

that it is difficult to obtain an accurate answer. A Catholic priest

told me that priests do not want to become spiritual policeman. They do

not become priests&#151;Anglican or Catholic&#151;to go through

this heartrending business of having to make a decision. They are faced

with 10, 15 or 20 forms that John McIntosh from the London Oratory

school, or the head teacher from another school, has demanded. They do

not want to have to say whether X is a good Catholic. Such a situation

is ridiculous. It is not what those religions are about. They should be

welcoming to everybody. Priests want this burden placed on the school

and not on

them.</div><a name="06050316000080"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050316000294"></a>Sarah

Teather:</b> Surely the Catholic priest should simply be

ticking a box to say whether someone is a practising Catholic and not

determining the extent to which someone has a religious

commitment.</div>

<a name="06050316000081"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050316000295"></a>Mr.

Leigh:</b> I agree that that is supposed to be the situation.

However, it is difficult for someone running one of the huge parishes

in London to say with any certain knowledge whether or not someone is a

practising Catholic. This the last thing that a priest wants to do;

they do not want to have to tick a box that could affect

somebody&#146;s entire future by saying that he or she turns up every

Sunday. Such a situation would be ridiculous. They should not be

required to do that, because it is unfair on them.</div>

<a name="06050316000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">I go to my local parish in

Market Rasen in Lincolnshire. My constituency does not have any

Catholic schools but there is a Catholic primary school in Brigg and a

Catholic secondary school in Lincoln. The issue is different there.

Those schools are not oversubscribed; the parishes are small and

stable; and people are well known in the area. There is not a great

mobility of population. The system works there, but 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column647" />Column number: 648</div>things are much more difficult in London. It is wrong to put priests in

this invidious position.</div>

<a name="06050316000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">Why is the clause included? Why

are interviews being banned?</div>

<a name="06050316000084"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050316000296"></a>Mr.

Chaytor:</b> Is not the answer to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s

previous question the fact that the Roman Catholic Church and the

diocesan authorities have argued, along with the Government, that

interviews should not be part of the admissions

process?</div><a name="06050316000085"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050316000297"></a>Mr.

Leigh:</b> I am glad that the hon. Gentleman made that point

because I was coming to it. I took John McIntosh, the headmaster of the

London Oratory school, to see Cardinal Murphy Cormac-O&#146;Connor

about this precise point. The hon. Gentleman might not agree with this,

but the Catholic Church is terrified of the potential attack on faith

schools and knows that the issue is controversial. I freely admit that

it is controversial, because people get very upset when they are turned

down.</div> <a name="06050316000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">We all know

people who have tried to get into certain schools and who have come

knocking on our door. Loads of complaints are received about various

Catholic schools that people have not got into. They complain to the

hierarchy, for which it is an unwanted hassle. By the way, I think that

the hassle will get even worse once everyone has to do things by a form

because there will be nothing then between the Church and complainants.

The Church is worried about this matter. Things have been admitted to

me off the record. People do not want to say this publicly. They say,

&#147;Let us throw this out and give this away so that there will be

no further attacks.&#148;</div>

<a name="06050316000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">I freely accept a point that

goes against me: there are people in the Catholic hierarchy who are

opposed to interviews, which are controversial in the Catholic Church,

as they are anywhere else. Just because people are Catholics or

Anglicans does not mean that they cannot take a political point of

view. Some of them oppose interviews.</div>

<a name="06050316000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Gentleman should not

accept that there is a universal view in the hierarchy, in the Catholic

Education Service and among Catholic schools that interviews are bad.

Most Catholic schools used to interview. Relentless pressure has been

put on them to stop it. One by one they have given up the battle, and

only a few are left. My understanding, from those people whom I have

talked to, is that that was not a right that they wanted to give up.

The change has been gradually forced upon them. Few schools now

interview. I return to the point: a legal case has been fought over the

past year and the London Oratory has won its battle. Why, if it is such

a tiny problem, do we need the clause?</div>

<a name="06050316000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">In summary, this goes back to

my belief that it is fundamentally wrong to lay down in statute that

schools should proceed in a certain way. The Minister constantly says,

&#147;We do not want schools to select pupils; we want parents to

select schools.&#148; That works in many parts of the country but in

some parts of the country&#151;particularly in the capital but maybe

in other areas where schools are oversubscribed&#151;it does not.

Where a school is oversubscribed and its primary ethos is based on its

faith it should be allowed, if it wants, to 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column648" />Column number: 649</div>interview. I am not forcing it to do so. If a school wanted to give up

interviewing it could have done so years ago. Some schools are

presumably quite happy not to interview. All I am saying is that if

they feel from their local knowledge and the way they run their school

that they want to interview, they should. My amendment puts back into

the Bill their right to interview.</div>

<a name="06050316000090"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050316000298"></a>Mr.

Chaytor:</b> I shall resist the temptation to be drawn into a

debate about the merits or otherwise of the admission practices of

faith schools. I am sure that the Whip will be delighted to hear that.

However, it may be a subject to which we return on Report. I can recall

an interesting discussion with the hon. Gentleman after the Education

Act 2002, which included a significant amendment on faith schools. I am

sure that many such issues will return on Report.</div>

<a name="06050316000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to speak to amendments

Nos. 213 to 215, which are simple and straightforward. Amendment No.

215 simply proposes that academies should be brought into the general

prohibition on interviewing. The reason why it is important to do so

follows the arguments that we have already had about academies and why

they should be properly part of the local family of schools, and be

required to conform to the practices to which neighbouring schools must

conform.</div> <a name="06050316000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

amendment also arises from the use in some academies of what are called

structured discussions. I am not sure whether the term

&#147;structured discussions&#148; appears in the academies&#146;

agreement with the Department, nor am I sure exactly how an interview

differs from a structured discussion. I suspect that the relationship

is similar to that between selection by ability and by aptitude. I do

not want to reopen that debate at this point, but it seems to me fair

and reasonable that the prohibition on interview should apply equally

to academies.</div>

<a name="06050316000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments Nos. 213 and 214

would include the term &#147;or written test&#148; after

interviews. That is important because a number of schools still use

written tests. Clearly, the use of written tests as a supplementary

admissions procedure is a form of quasi-11-plus selection. It is

permitted and not explicitly prohibited, and it can take a variety of

different forms, from informally asking students to write about their

family background and summer holidays to more sophisticated written

tests that fall short of an explicit test of academic

ability.</div>

<a name="06050316000260"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">8.30

pm</div><a name="06050316000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the

Committee will indulge me for a moment, I will quote from the

admissions policy of one school. I will not name the school because it

would be invidious to name individual schools as part of the

Committee&#146;s debates, but the policy will highlight the way in

which written tests are used. The school is nominally non-selective,

but it is a faith

school.</div>

<a name="06050316000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">It spells out the requirements

for submission of a successful application by saying, &#147;Parents

and guardians are reminded they must do the following five things if

their applications are to be considered 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column649" />Column number: 650</div>properly. First, come to an open session.&#148; The open sessions are

on Wednesday evening, Thursday afternoon or Thursday lunchtime.

Clearly, that limits the number of parents who are available to go to

an open session&#151;and at is at the open session where the

admissions prospectus is available and where information on the school

is given by the teaching

staff.</div><a name="06050316000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">&#147;Secondly,&#148;

they are told, &#147;collect a prospectus from the school and return

it to the school by the date set by the LEA.&#148; Fine: we accept

that. &#147;Thirdly, bring the child for the assessment test on a

Saturday morning. Fourthly, telephone the school to check that the

primary school reference has been received and that it has been used on

the correct form.&#148;</div>

<a name="06050316000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">These details might have been

more relevant to the previous set of amendments on the various forms of

covert admissions procedure that some schools use, but I mention it now

because it highlights the use of the written assessment test&#151;not

any old written assessment test, but one that takes place only on a

Saturday morning at a specific time. This represents an aggregate set

of procedures each of which is designed to keep out certain kinds of

parent&#151;those who do not have resources or time, an understanding

of the process or a child with the relevant level of academic ability

to pass the written assessment test.</div>

<a name="06050316000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given the arguments that the

Government have rightly advanced in their determination to press

forward with the prohibition of interviews&#151;a determination on

which they are to be congratulated&#151;it seems to me entirely

logical to match that prohibition with a prohibition on written tests,

and the skeletal code of practice on admissions that was circulated

last week makes no reference to

that.</div><a name="06050316000099"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050316000299"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> The clause, like its two predecessors, adds little

to the spirit or practice of the proposed legislation. It should not be

there, and it is only there because&#151;as my hon. Friend the Member

for Gainsborough has suggested&#151;the Government felt they needed

to placate their critics on the left. We did not need the stuff on

selection, which was unwarranted; we did not need the stuff on

admissions, which was unwanted; and we do not need this either. The

Committee will understand that Conservative Members are extremely

sceptical about the clause and we have proposed to amend it

accordingly.</div> <a name="06050316000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.

Member for Bury, North&#151;lest I stray&#151;will no doubt tell me

that I am concentrating on intake. He said that last time I spoke, many

hours ago, when I spent the whole time talking about the difference

that schools could make. I spoke about the difference that they could

make to social mobility and the difference that they could make to

academic performance, yet he told me that I was preoccupied by intake.

So, I repeat, I am interested in the difference that schools can make.

We have already heard that things such as the support of parents, the

relationship between home and school and the ethos of schools matter.

They matter because they are likely to have an impact on the chances of

the children who attend schools.</div>

<a name="06050316000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is in that spirit that we

have tabled amendment No. 48, which would allow faith schools to

continue to interview to assess religious commitment and practice;

amendment No. 49, which would enable any interview 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column650" />Column number: 651</div>conducted to assess intended compliance with a home school contract;

amendment No. 406, which would allow interviews as well as audition or

other oral or practical test to determine aptitude; and amendment No.

208, which would ensure that a ban on interview did not apply to pupils

who were over compulsory school age.</div>

<a name="06050316000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">The regulatory impact

assessment states that</div>

<a name="06050316000246"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The Government believes

that interviewing is subjective and should play no part in the

admissions process. This position is reflected in the School Admissions

Code of Practice. Although few schools interview, the Government wishes

to legally prohibit the use of interviewing except where it is

necessary to assess a child&#146;s

suitability&#148;</div><a name="06050316000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">for a state

boarding place. As my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough said, the

Government make a great deal of something that few schools

do.</div> <a name="06050316000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">My reasoning that

the clause is unnecessary is supported by my hon. Friend&#146;s

remarks that this matter affects very few schools. Like him, I am

surprised that the Minister has failed to grasp his point or to succumb

to his overtures. I do not mean to be ungallant, but that has more to

do with her taste than his charm. The case that my hon. Friend makes

respecting faith schools seems strong. It is supported by no less a

personage than the Archbishop of Canterbury, who says

that</div><a name="06050316000247"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;faith schools have

a generally excellent academic record&#148;,</div>

<a name="06050316000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">Which he adds can lead to claims that

they are selecting the brightest children, particularly because they

often interview parents to assess their religious commitment. He

describes such claims as &#147;a persistent

misrepresentation&#148;. Like his predecessor, he called for national

criteria for all faith schools, allowing for standardisation of

admission criteria to deal with such misinformation about their

intentions.</div> <a name="06050316000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is

not just the view of the Archbishop of Canterbury&#151;as though he

were not a high enough authority. It is that

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050316000300"></a>The

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Skills (Phil

Hope):</b> The

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050316000301"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> I shall come to the highest of all authorities

later. It is the view of the Prime Minister himself, who chose to send

his child to an interview at the school already mentioned by my hon.

Friend, who has the advantage of having so many children that he can

speak with authority about a range of schools. The Prime Minister

persuaded the Secretary of State to intervene to defend the right of

the Oratory school to continue to interview. <i class="I">The Independent

</i>reported last

year:</div><a name="06050316000248"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The

school selected by Tony Blair for his three older children has been

given the green light to carry on &#145;selecting&#146; pupils by

interview in a ruling from his Education Secretary, Ruth

Kelly.&#148;</div> <a name="06050316000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">Inevitably, the

Secretary of State was accused of hypocrisy. It turned out that a

nearby school, the Gunnersbury Roman Catholic school in Hounslow, west

London, was not allowed to continue interviewing. Almost

simultaneously, it asked for the same permission but it was not granted

the same largesse. Perhaps it is a pity that the Prime Minister does

not have as many children as my hon. Friend. Then many schools might be

able to continue that good practice.</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column651" />Column number: 652</div><a name="06050316000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">We need to be clear that

interviews for faith schools are supported by the people I mentioned

because they are a useful means by which those schools can assess

children and, perhaps more importantly, parents. At the same time, they

are an important opportunity for parents to assess the school. Why

should parents not go along to an interview and get the measure of a

school?</div><a name="06050316000111"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050316000302"></a>Mr.

Leigh:</b> What is to stop some pushy middle-class parent

effectively interviewing the headmaster, saying, &#147;My little

Johnny has applied to this school, and I would like to be shown around

the school and to meet you, Mr. Head Teacher,&#148; and charming him

to make their mark? Would that not be even more unfair? There is

nothing to prevent that from happening, is

there?</div><a name="06050316000112"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050316000303"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> No. I suppose that if a parent demanded the right

to interview the head, it would be an odd head who did not grant it. I

was speaking just this morning to the head teacher of a school in my

constituency. When I ran into him he said, &#147;I have a meeting

with a parent who wants to interrogate me about some aspect of the

school. It&#146;s not a meeting I am looking forward to.&#148; I

guess that, as a good headmaster, he felt he had to conduct the

meeting.</div><a name="06050316000113"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050316000304"></a>Meg

Hillier:</b> I feel that I must cut through some of the drivel

coming from the Opposition Benches. In the fantasy world in which the

hon. Gentlemen are living, they seem to have forgotten that when

children apply for a school, they have to go through an admissions

process run by the education authority that is more or less blind,

after which they are allocated to a school. At that point, or even

before, the parents might wish to meet the head teacher, but the head

teacher does not choose the pupils. Pupils are placed in a school by

the open allocations

process.</div><a name="06050316000114"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050316000305"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> It seems to me to be entirely appropriate that

there should be a process at the Oratory and other such schools that

allows them to interview parents and children. Judging by the

popularity and results of that particular school, I do not think that

that practice has gone wrong, and clearly it is a practice that is

endorsed by the hon. Lady&#146;s leader, the Prime Minister, who not

only sent his children there but I presume was happy with the

interviewing process that it continues to carry out. Presumably, he

would not have asked the Secretary of State to intervene in order to

allow it to continue to interview if he had not been

happy.</div><a name="06050316000115"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050316000306"></a>Mr.

Leigh:</b> I am sorry, but we must correct the

drivel&#151;if that is a parliamentary phrase&#151;that is being

uttered on the Government Benches. If the suggestion is that somehow it

is completely open to local authorities in London to distribute

children around schools, it is not true. Ultimately, under the new

admissions criteria and rules that have been introduced in the last

couple of years, schools in London can select the pupils they want.

That is the truth. That is not some cosy fantasy world but the real

world, in which some schools are hugely

oversubscribed.</div><a name="06050316000116"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050316000307"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> The statement about making interviews illegal

raises important questions. If interviews are

which the Bill

acknowledges&#151;</div><a name="06050316000261"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">8.42

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050316000308"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> The proposal to make interviews illegal raises

several questions. If interviews are necessary to assess a

child&#146;s suitability for boarding provision, why are they not

suitable to determine aptitude or religious conviction? If interviews

are subjective, why are they suitable for selection in any instance?

Will the Government continue to use interviews when recruiting civil

servants? Are not interviews part of the life experience of most of us,

and should not parents have the opportunity in the form of an interview

of meeting those who work at the school? If the Government are opposed

to interviews per se, should not they ban interviews for all

pupils?</div><a name="06050316000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">John McIntosh,

the head master of the Oratory school, argues that interviews are

necessary to determine the commitment of parents to the school&#146;s

religious ethos. Surely it is nonsense that schools continue to

audition and test potential pupils to select up to 10 per cent. on

aptitude, but not to interview them. What is the difference between an

audition and an interview in terms of subjectivity? Nothing can be more

subjective than an audition or an oral test, yet the Government accept

that they are desirable for certain pupils. Why is one way of

determining an aptitude okay and another

not?</div><a name="06050316000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">Does the clause

mean that interviewers will not be allowed to converse with candidates

during an audition? Will there be a vow of silence during oral tests,

where no questions are asked by the interviewer and no questions

permitted from the child being assessed? The Minister should answer

those questions when she sums up the

debate.</div><a name="06050316000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the

objective of the Bill is to increase school autonomy, the Government

surely must agree that a school should be completely in control of

discipline. That is why our amendment on home-school contracts would

make them enforceable. If parents and children do not sign up to a code

of behaviour and stick to it, it is surely inappropriate for those

children to attend the school. If schools can use interviews to

determine suitability for boarding, why can they not use interviews to

determine whether a home-school contract will be adhered to?</div>

<a name="06050316000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph 5.13 of the White

Paper

states:</div><a name="06050316000249"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Home-school

agreements can be a powerful tool in making clear to parents what they

can expect from their child&#146;s school&#151;particularly when

they join a new school&#151;and also setting out parents&#146; own

responsibilities in supporting the

school.&#148;</div><a name="06050316000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph 5.14

states:</div>

<a name="06050316000250"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Home-school agreements

have been a requirement since 1999, but many schools have not yet

exploited their potential. We therefore plan to update and relaunch

guidance on home-school agreements to ensure that all schools are aware

of the potential benefits and to provide more information about good

practice. 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column653" />Column number: 654</div>We want to learn more about where home-school agreements work best and

to enable schools to exploit the energy and commitment of parents. We

will set a clear expectation that schools should keep agreements both

updated and

practical.&#148;</div><a name="06050316000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">In respect of

the example of home-school agreements at Oulton Broad primary school in

Suffolk, it is stated in the box at the top of page 68 of the White

Paper:</div><a name="06050316000251"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The

home-school agreement is displayed in the school&#146;s entrance

hall, and sets out clearly the expectation that both the school and the

family will play their part in the child&#146;s education. The school

consults parents about reviewing the agreement every three years, and

it is used in day-to-day conversations, where necessary, with parents

to clarify responsibilities, and emphasise the role that both sides

play.&#148;</div><a name="06050316000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore, a

school can have day-to-day conversations with parents and it can use

those conversations to update its policy and to amend what it does, but

it cannot do that in through the medium of an interview when the

parents&#146; children join the school. If a school is expected to

have a conversation with parents about the home-school agreement

agreement, why can it not interview to ensure compliance as part of

admission?</div><a name="06050316000127"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050316000309"></a>Meg

Hillier:</b> Let me put a situation to the hon.

Gentleman&#151;not a hypothetical situation, but one that is very

real in my constituency. A child&#146;s parents may have come from

another culture: not only do they not speak English, but they are not

literate in their own mother tongue. During the primary school years,

the child may have often been taken back home to visit the family,

which has resulted in him or her having been absent from their primary

school at different times. How would those parents fare at a secondary

school interview? Would it be fair to the child of those parents to be

discriminated against because the parent, regardless of how ambitious

they might be for their child, could not play the interview system as

well as an articulate

parent?</div><a name="06050316000128"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050316000310"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> One suspects that a good school, sensitive to such

circumstances, would be able to adapt its process to deal with that

reality just as easily in respect of an interview&#151;indeed, I

would argue more easily&#151;than it would in respect of an oral test

or audition. I do not underestimate the good will and ingenuity of

governors, head teachers and teachers in dealing with precisely the

kinds of challenges the hon. Lady describes. We are not suggesting that

every school must interview, or prescribing the nature of that

process.</div>

<a name="06050316000129"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050316000311"></a>Meg

Hillier:</b> The hon. Gentleman may feel some impatience at my

intervening again, but I just wish to reiterate that the oral test that

he talks about is of the child, whereas the interview is of the parent.

That is an important

difference.</div><a name="06050316000130"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050316000312"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> The nature of the oral test or audition will depend

on what the school is looking to discover. We know that the Government

are committed to developing and delivering specialisms for schools; to

enable them to select up to 10 per cent. of their pupils by aptitude, a

range of measures to assess aptitude will be put in place. I should

have thought it right that schools take account of the circumstances of

children who might have a particular aptitude but who fall into 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column654" />Column number: 655</div>the categories the hon. Lady describes, and nothing in our amendment

would be injurious to schools&#146; efforts to achieve that aim. I do

not share her fears because I trust teachers, governors and head

teachers to implement the measures in a way that is both fair and

practical.</div> <a name="06050316000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">While we

are on the subject of tests for aptitude and ability, it is perhaps

worth looking again at the Government&#146;s position, which, I

suggest, is untenable. Earlier in our consideration the Minister said

that she was happy with tests for aptitude in some subjects but not in

others: she said that it was perfectly permissible to test a

child&#146;s aptitude for languages, for example. She said that one

would be looking for potential rather than proven ability. I refer the

Committee in that context to the Education and Skills Committee report

of 2003, which

said:</div><a name="06050316000252"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We are

not satisfied that any meaningful distinction between aptitude and

ability has been made and we have found no justification for any

reliance on the distinction between

them.&#148;</div><a name="06050316000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member

for Brent, East has mentionedDr. Philip Hunter, the chief

schools adjudicator. When asked whether it was possible to distinguish

between tests for ability and tests for aptitude and whether one could

accurately predict future levels of attainment, he said no, he was not

clear about that. He does not believe that that can be done&#151;or

at least he did not believe it when interviewed by the Select Committee

in its next study of the matter, in 2004.</div>

<a name="06050316000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Select Committee went on to

say:</div><a name="06050316000253"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;As the

Department is unable to support its policy on selection by aptitude

with evidence as to its efficacy and is unwilling to commission

research on the subject, it is difficult to understand why the practice

should be allowed to

continue.&#148;</div><a name="06050316000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">Nevertheless,

the Government are happy to continue to support the principle of oral

tests and auditions to assess aptitude but, paradoxically, they are

unhappy with interviews to gauge the suitability of a child and the

commitment of his or her parents to a particular school&#151;notably

to faith schools, but the same might apply to other schools

too.</div> <a name="06050316000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">The simple truth

is that interviews are not widely used, but where they are used, those

engaged in the process believe that they are a helpful tool. The clause

is unwarranted, unwanted and unnecessary. Those schools that interview

should be allowed to continue to do so. I suspect that the provisions

have more to do with dogma than any educational advantage that they

might bring. We shall of course wait to hear what the Minister says,

but unless she can be rather more convincing than she was about

selection and admissions, we will press the amendments. We are not

satisfied that the Government have made a persuasive case on

interviews. I commend our amendments and new clause to the

Committee.</div><a name="06050316000136"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050316000313"></a>Sarah

Teather:</b> I would like to place on record the fact we think

that the clause is helpful, for precisely the reasons to which the hon.

Gentleman alluded. He was trying to imply that an interview process

would be like a job interview, but we are not talking about a job

interview. Such interviews are not necessary because there is no need

for an interview to meet the criteria that are allowed under the

admissions code. It is perfectly possible to meet those criteria

without having an interview. The only reason one would want an 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column655" />Column number: 656</div>interview would be to obtain information that is not allowed under the

admissions code. Having interviews therefore seems to make no

sense.</div><a name="06050316000137"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050316000314"></a>Annette

Brooke:</b> Does<b class="B"> </b>my hon. Friend agree that jobs

interviews are used to choose future employees, whereas most of us are

very much against schools choosing

pupils?</div><a name="06050316000138"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050316000315"></a>Sarah

Teather:</b> My hon. Friend makes a good

point.</div><a name="06050316000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member

for South Holland and The Deepings makes a reasonable point when he

notes the apparent disparity between auditioning for musical ability

and testing for an aptitude for languages, and the other rulings on

interviewing. However, I have already placed on record my view about

the difference between aptitude and ability and the fact that it is

difficult to test, so I shall not repeat it.</div>

<a name="06050316000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">We tabled amendment No. 436

before seeing the draft code, so I shall make some brief remarks about

it and we will not press it to a Division. It is intended to probe some

of the definitions relating to interviewing. I shall also make brief

remarks on the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Bury, North,

and the Conservatives&#146; amendment No.

429.</div><a name="06050316000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">The term

&#147;interview&#148; is generally thought to mean a formal

appointment, but most of the concerns that hon. Members have raised

have been about more informal contact. The hon. Member for Bury, North

went through the admissions policies for a London school, which

displayed clearly the extent of informal contact that can take place

between a school and a family prior to the admissions process. Such

issues cause particular concern.</div>

<a name="06050316000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our aim in tabling the

amendment is not to monitor every phone call between a school and a

family. We simply want to place on record the fact that informal

contact can be obtained just as easily on the telephone as in person.

As we have seen from the example raised earlier, there could be many

telephone conversations between a school and a parent to check that

every stage of the admission application process is in place. During

those conversations, all sorts of other information could be

gained.</div><a name="06050316000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have raised

my concerns about interviewing to test religious commitment, and it is

not clear to me how or why we would want to do that. What will we be

trying to test? The hon. Member for Gainsborough talked about

questioning a child on their knowledge of Easter and holy week, but the

test is not for a celibate vocation to the priesthood or to tell

whether a child understands the catechism well enough to take their

first communion. It is simply about going to a school, and such an

interview seems entirely inappropriate. I cannot see why it is not

possible simply to append a certificate to say that a child has been

baptised, or an indication from the local priest that a child seeking

to go into a secondary school has taken his first communion. If a

school is greatly oversubscribed, just how committed will we ask

families to be? How will we test that commitment? Will there be a

requirement to be entirely dogmatic about all aspects of the catechism,

or will we allow the more liberal approach to faith to 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column656" />Column number: 657</div>which most practising Catholics in this country adhere? That is probably

as much as I can say without being

excommunicated.</div><a name="06050316000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">I

support amendment No. 215 and the sentiments expressed by the hon.

Member for Bury, North on written tests. As I stated earlier, we are

unhappy with amendment No. 49 and the requirement suggested by the

Conservatives that schools should use home-school contracts as part of

the admissions process. Such contracts should be used as a tool to work

with families, not as a blanket policy. I can see that there may be

some situations in which, for instance, a child has been excluded from

a number of schools, and a contract prior to admittance to another

school would be useful. However, it should always be used on an

individual basis. Using it as a blanket policy would be highly

discriminatory, often against the very young people who most need

support, and is likely to be extremely unhelpful. We have a right of

access to free education for all, and making that conditional upon

behaviour that has not even occurred would be totally contrary to our

principles.</div><a name="06050316000145"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050316000321"></a>Jacqui

Smith:</b> And I always

deliver.</div><a name="06050316000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">As we have

heard, the clause prohibits schools from interviewing parents or

children as a means of determining admissions. I do not intend to go

into detail on why we believe that that is right, except in response to

some of the amendments. We have discussed the need to ensure an

objective, transparent admissions framework under which there is fair

access; that is in itself a sufficient argument against a process of

interviewing that is none of those things and that can be conflated

very easily into admitting children to school on the basis of their

ability, their family background, their articulacy, or a range of other

factors that really should not be part of a school&#146;s admissions

criteria.</div><a name="06050316000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments

Nos. 204, 48, 208, 205, 369 and 406 would make exceptions to clause 40,

most notably in the case of faith schools but also for entry to sixth

form and to determine applicants&#146; aptitude for particular

subjects. New clause 9 proposes that there be no restrictions whatever

on the processes used to admit children to a school. It is the old

free-for-all proposed by the hon. Member for Gainsborough. He can be as

nice as he likes to me, but I am afraid that he will not 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column657" />Column number: 658</div>persuade me that that is a good way to ensure fair access to schools for

our

children.</div><a name="06050316000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">Permitting

faith schools or others to conduct admission interviews, as a small

minority still do, is something that the Government and the main faith

groups oppose as potentially unfair to parents and children. Most faith

schools undoubtedly adopt transparent admission criteria and practices

that are easy for parents to understand, but there is clear evidence

that some do not and that interviews have been used as a justification

for a complex set of admission criteria that can be difficult for some

parents to understand. Not only do those interviews discriminate in

terms of the children admitted once they have applied to a school, but

they are also likely to impact on who is willing to apply in the first

place.</div> <a name="06050316000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not agree

with the argument that it is necessary for schools to interview in

order to determine faith adherence, and neither do the faith groups.

They agree that a priest, a rabbi or an imam&#146;s reference should

be sufficient to determine whether an applicant should have any

priority under its faith criteria; a Christian school might, say, look

at baptismal records as an alternative. Furthermore, our experience has

shown that a number of faith schools that use interviews do so to

determine who, in their judgment, is the most religious among the

applicants or has the greatest degree of faith. It is difficult to make

a tangible and objective assessment of such things. Interviews fail

that test of transparency and objectivity and we therefore think that

they have no place. We are supported in that view by the Church of

England Board of Education and the Catholic Education Service, both of

which support us in outlawing interviews. We are also supported by the

Education and Skills Committee on that point.</div>

<a name="06050316000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">I must say that the case that

the hon. Member for Gainsborough was making&#151;that somehow or

other the Government had browbeaten the Churches into giving that

support&#151;was frankly ludicrous. It was not the Government who, on

7 February 2006, persuaded the Church of England Board of Education and

the Catholic Education Service to write an open letter to the BBC,

which stated:</div>

<a name="06050316000254"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Both the Church of

England and the Catholic Church have pressed government over the past

few years to outlaw interviews for the selection of pupils for Church

schools.&#148;</div><a name="06050316000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">That could not

be much

clearer.</div><a name="06050316000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.

406 calls for an exception to the ban on interviewing so that admission

authorities can interview candidates who are applying for admission on

the basis of their aptitude for a particular subject. Like the hon.

Gentleman, I do not intend to reiterate the distinction between ability

and aptitude, which I believe I clarified this morning, but it is clear

that interviews tend to rely on the ability of the child to articulate,

rather demonstrate their aptitude in an objective way. They are more a

test of ability than of aptitude. If a school has a specialism in a

particular subject and is selecting on the basis of an aptitude for

that subject, it is reasonable to expect it to have an objective way of

assessing applicants&#146; aptitude. I do not believe that subjective

interviews would fulfil that purpose. Such an assessment would, of

course, have to be related to aptitude, which is why we allow auditions



<div class="Column"><a name="Column658" />Column number: 659</div>or other oral and practical tests. Extending that to allow more general

interviewing would lead inevitably to selection by ability or other

factors unrelated to

aptitude.</div><a name="06050316000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">In

response to one of the points made by the hon. Member for South Holland

and The Deepings, of course there would be discussion during the course

of an audition, but it is clear that that discussion should not go

beyond the aptitude that is being tested. Similarly, we do not think

that it is necessary for schools to interview prospective candidates

for entry to sixth form, as proposed by amendment No. 208. The school

admissions code states clearly that pupils should not be interviewed

for entry to year 12, and the use of minimum attainment requirements at

GCSE level and ordinary oversubscription criteria should be more than

adequate to allocate sixth-form

places.</div><a name="06050316000159"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050316000322"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> Would the right hon. Lady regard an audition or an

oral test as subjective? I am interested to know where she sees an oral

test

applying.</div><a name="06050316000160"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050316000323"></a>Jacqui

Smith:</b> No, as I suggested earlier, there is evidence to

support the ability to test aptitude for modern languages through an

oral test that might involve a child recognising principles in a

language other than his or her own. Those tests tend not only to be

more objective, but are based specifically on aptitude within the

limited number of subjects for which selection on that basis is

allowed. They do not veer into areas of ability, such as the ability of

the child to articulate, and the range of other issues that can be

brought into an

interview.</div><a name="06050316000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment

No. 215 seeks to prevent academies from interviewing candidates for

admission. I must reiterate that academies are required by law to cater

for children of all abilities. As with other maintained schools, they

are required to act in accordance with the school admissions code and

to comply with admissions laws by virtue of their funding agreements.

This is a contract between the Secretary of State and the academies

trust. They are not allowed to interview parents or pupils, even if it

is described as a structured discussion or otherwise, or to introduce

selection by ability, other than by fair banding. This is consistent

with other types of

schools.</div><a name="06050316000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">City

technical colleges have used some of the structured discussions that

the hon. Gentleman described. However, we are now in the position where

all but two CTCs are becoming academies and will be covered, therefore,

by the need to comply with admissions arrangements in the way that I

have described for

academies.</div><a name="06050316000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments

Nos. 213 and 214 seek to prohibit the setting of written tests in

addition to the outlawing of interviews. The first problem is that as

we discussed earlier, the School Standards and Framework Act 1998 means

that existing fully or partially selective arrangements remain in

place. Those grammar and other selective schools that remain have to

have an objective means of allocating their places, and the setting of

written tests is, at least, a fair and equal way of doing so in those

circumstances. However, I recognise, particularly given the example

that my hon. Friend the Member for Bury, North gave, that despite 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column659" />Column number: 660</div>the fact that the amendment would impact on that, he was not referring

to those particular circumstances. I hope that I will reassure him in a

minute.</div><a name="06050316000164"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050316000324"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> I am sorry to interrupt the right hon. Lady again

but I want to be absolutely clear. Why is a written test or an

interview more subjective than an audition? Let us for a moment buy the

right hon. Lady&#146;s argument that there is an innate propensity in

children: an inner capacity to learn languages. Why is an audition more

or less subjective in her terms than an interview or a written

test?</div><a name="06050316000165"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050316000325"></a>Jacqui

Smith:</b> Actually, my argument was that an audition is an

appropriate way to test aptitude for the ability to gain from a musical

education in a specialist school. The hon. Gentleman is arguing that he

wants to extend selection on the basis of ability and he wants to be

able to test and interview for that. That is where we

disagree.</div><a name="06050316000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was about

to address the case mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Bury,

North concerning use of a written assessment test that did not fulfil

those criteria. My view is very clear, as is the view taken in the

code: unless such a written test is for banding arrangements it is not

appropriate to use it in the way that he described. I can assure my

hon. Friend that although such use is not mentioned by the existing

code, the new code will make it clear that it is prohibited. Given what

he said about the other types of activities that he described, I am

keen to ensure that they too are ruled out by the new code. We shall

cover that as the code develops from a skeleton to a fully-fleshed body

of provisions.</div><a name="06050316000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also

share the concern that the hon. Member for Brent, East has expressed by

tabling amendment No. 436. Any form of interviewing&#151;face to face

or by telephone&#151;should be ruled out. I believe that in fact the

clause already prevents admissions arrangements from including the use

of interviews, but I am willing to clarify the wording of the code so

that any form of interview, including those conducted by phone, is

caught by the provisions in the

clause.</div><a name="06050316000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.

49 seeks to make the signing of a home-school agreement a part of

school admissions arrangements. The Government are extremely positive,

as is the skeleton code, about the contribution that home-school

agreements can make&#151;it was the School Standards and Framework

Act that made home-school agreements compulsory for all schools. As the

hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings said, we have undertaken

to revitalise and review their use, and we shall do that, but we do not

believe that the willingness of parents to sign a home-school agreement

should determine whether a child gets a place at a school. That would

be a fundamentally different purpose for home-school agreements. They

are not contracts in a legal sense; they are statements of shared

objectives between home and school, setting out the expectations and

responsibilities of each

party.</div><a name="06050316000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not think

that school admission should be contingent on promises of good

behaviour or on judgments about past behaviour, although that is not to

say that parents do not have a fundamental and important responsibility

to ensure their children&#146;s good 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column660" />Column number: 661</div>behaviour at school, and we shall have an opportunity when we reach part

7 of the Bill to discuss our proposed strengthening of provisions

relating to parenting contracts and parenting orders to ensure that

that responsibility is absolutely

clear.</div><a name="06050316000170"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050316000326"></a>Mr.

Gibb:</b> For what reasons might a parent refuse to sign a

home-school

contract?</div><a name="06050316000171"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050316000327"></a>Jacqui

Smith:</b> There might be a range of reasons why they may

refuse, although I hope that they would not refuse, and I would expect

them always to sign. My argument is that it would give a different

function to home-school agreements if they were made part of admissions

arrangements. My objective for such agreements is to build an

understanding of the responsibilities that are shared between parents

and schools, whereas the hon. Gentleman&#146;s objective is to

reintroduce a method of selection by the back

door.</div><a name="06050316000172"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050316000328"></a>Mr.

Gibb:</b> That is simply not true, and I do not understand why

insistence on signing of a home-school contract before admission of a

child is any more draconian than parenting orders or the range of

legislation that the Minister wants to introduce to enforce proper

parental responsibility. The measure would be far less draconian and I

see no reason why parents should not be happy to sign such

contracts.</div><a name="06050316000173"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050316000329"></a>Jacqui

Smith:</b> I quite agree that parents should be happy to sign

home-school agreements, but they should be happy to sign them on the

basis that signing is a matter of clarifying responsibilities and

building engagement between home and school, not about reintroducing a

set of admission criteria. Those are two completely separate

purposes.</div><a name="06050316000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">We encourage

schools to meet parents to discuss home-school agreements, but that

does not mean that the discussion should become a surrogate interview

to determine admission. It should be an opportunity to discuss the

school&#146;s policies and the role of parents in supporting the

child as a member of that

school.</div><a name="06050316000264"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.30

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050316000353"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> And none more so than the hon. Gentleman. So I

shall speak briefly.</div>

<a name="06050316000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 41 locks schools into a

three-year contract with their chosen admissions system. Two years

would be more flexible, allowing schools to tailor their admissions

system over a reduced period. The White Paper, which has become

something of a bible for Opposition Members, says:</div>

<a name="06050316000255"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;No one approach towards

admissions will work in all circumstances. This is why we want to

ensure that all self-governing schools (Foundation, voluntary aided and

Trust)&#148;&#151;</div><a name="06050316000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">for that

is what they were then going to be called&#151;</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column662" />Column number: 663</div><a name="06050316000256"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;are free to use the approach to

fair admissions that they think will best meet their local

circumstances, as long as it is compatible with the Admissions Code. We

want them to be able to do so without having to go through a complex

and bureaucratic process.&#148;</div>

<a name="06050316000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">We, too, want the emphasis to be with the

schools. The schools are closest to the needs of the children and,

therefore, most able to assess the impact of their admissions

arrangements. We feel that the greater flexibility offered in our

amendments would be of immense benefit to schools and so improve the

Bill.</div>

<a name="06050316000211"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050316000354"></a>Jacqui

Smith:</b> What a pleasant surprise that the hon. Gentleman

was so brief.</div> <a name="06050316000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">Fair

and open admission arrangements help children to access good-quality

schools, while unfair and unclear admission arrangements can increase

social segregation and limit parents&#146; choice of school. Clause

41 therefore builds on the rules in the School Standards and Framework

Act to ensure that admission arrangements that are approved as part of

a proposal to open a new school or expand a successful or popular

school should remain in place for a fixed period. That will also ensure

that schools adjudicator determinations on objections to admission

arrangements are binding for a fixed period.</div>

<a name="06050316000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">As hon. Members will see, the

draft regulations that we circulated would prevent further changes in

admission arrangements in the two school years following the year in

which a change was authorised to a school. That would make for a total

of three years in which the arrangements were frozen, but the hon.

Member for South Holland and The Deepings wants to restrict that period

to two years. We proposed that the freeze should be for three years,

because two years is insufficient time for good practice&#151;whether

in new schools or expanding schools, or following an objection to the

adjudicator&#151;to become embedded and truly effective.</div>

<a name="06050316000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">In defence of the three-year

period, I should say that we made it clear in the White Paper that we

intended to take the route set out in the Bill. If the White Paper

really is the hon. Gentleman&#146;s bible, as he says it is, he will

want to support this particular element of it. As it is, his amendments

would change it. We should, however, stick with the intention in the

White Paper.</div>

<a name="06050316000215"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050316000355"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> The Minister has been persuasive. The hour is late,

and dinner awaits. [<span class="SmallCaps">Hon. Members:</span>

&#147;Where?&#148;] I shall not titillate members of the Committee

by describing my dining details. You know them, Mr. Chope, and you are

holding them like a secret close to your heart. Suffice it to say that

this was a probing amendment. I simply say that the Minister might want

to look at the issue again because the admissions situation will be

dynamic, particularly for the new and expanding schools that she

described, and schools might need to react to changing circumstances

with appropriate vigour. That is why we have probed the issue and why

we continue to think that the matter could be considered. However, on

the basis of the Minister&#146;s persuasive remarks, I beg to ask

leave to withdraw the amendment.</div>

<a name="06050316000228"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050316000358"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> We are making great progress and we now turn to

clause 42 in that spirit. The clause allows anyone to make an objection

to a proposed admissions 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column664" />Column number: 665</div>system, regardless of their evidence or reasons for doing so. There is

at least a possibility of vexatious objections that are motivated by

some personal grudge, not by the school&#146;s best interests. Our

proposals suggest that safeguards should be put in place to protect

what might already be a complicated and bureaucratic process. As I said

on amendments tothe previous clause, the White Paper was

clear about the three-year period, but it was just as clear about the

need to avoid the process becoming bureaucratic and complex.</div>

<a name="06050316000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under our proposals, any

objector would be expected to lodge a proper case, which should ensure

that the admissions process is undergone easily. Amendment No. 92 goes

into detail about how an objection might be handled, providing a

meritorious and detailed case for an objector&#146;s decision,

setting out why the specific arrangements to which he objects damages

his school or, in the case of a local education authority, other

schools in the local authority area, and providing substantive evidence

to support his case. The amendment goes on to state that an adjudicator

should not hear an objection that cannot meet that test. It mentions

specifically</div>

<a name="06050316000257"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;unreasonable, vexatious,

frivolous or otherwise unmeritorious&#148;</div>

<a name="06050316000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">objections.</div>

<a name="06050316000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is not an unreasonable

addition to the Bill, given that there may be those who lodge

objections without good or just cause. For those reasons, the

amendments are helpful. They are probing amendments because, generally

speaking, as you know, Mr. Chope, we support the Bill and are anxious

to ease its passage through the Committee and the House, although that

will not always be easy.</div>

<a name="06050316000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">I read at the weekend that a

number of people on the Government Benches who oppose the Bill, perhaps

having heard the contributions made by me, my hon. Friend the Member

for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton and other members of the Committee,

are growing in number. I gather that the hon. Member for Bury, North is

whipping up discontent among his hon. Friends. I am anxious not to have

any truck with that; as I have said before, we want to help the

Minister on her journey towards enlightenment, which is why we tabled

these simple amendments.</div>

It makes the point that the localauthority, other local schools and the admission forum have importantpowers to refer any school to the adjudicator when it fails to complywith the mandatory provisions. That is true, but the section does notrefer to the powers of parents to refer individual schools&#146;practices to the adjudicator. Parents <div class="Column"><a name="Column665" />Column number: 666</div>do have powers, but they are severely prescribed by the Secretary ofState&#146;s powers to make regulations as to the issues on whichparents can refer problems tothe adjudicator.</div><a name="06050316000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are several anomalies:for example, under the existing regulations laid down by the Secretaryof State, parents cannot refer the question of 10 per cent. selectionby aptitude to the adjudicator. However, they can refer to theadjudicator the case of a school that deliberately takes fewer pupilsthan the proposed admissions limit. To all intents and purposes theeffect of this on parents in the immediate catchment area will be thesame, but because of the regulations that the Secretary of State haslaid to prescribe these powers to parents, only one problem could bereferred by a group of parents.</div><a name="06050316000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is an argument that weadvanced on earlier clauses. If we are serious about giving parents agreater voice in the development of our education system andencouraging them to challenge more frequently and more assertively thepractices of individual schools that are designed to prevent fairaccess, it seems only logical that parents should have exactly the samepowers to refer issues to the adjudicator as are now held by individualadmissions authorities, local authorities and the admissionforum.</div><a name="06050316000265"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.45pm</div><a name="06050316000237"></a><div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050316000360"></a>SarahTeather:</b> The Liberal Democrats are very sympathetic to thepoints raised by the hon. Member for Bury, North and we look forward tothe Minister&#146;sreply.</div><a name="06050316000238"></a><div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050316000361"></a>JacquiSmith:</b> To ensure a fair admissions system that gives everychild, whatever their background, an equal chance to succeed, it iscrucial that we have a robust and independent system for consideringobjections to admission arrangements and for ensuring that they arefair. That, of course, is what the clausecovers.</div><a name="06050316000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.92, which was moved by the hon. Member for South Holland and TheDeepings, would place conditions on the circumstances in whichobjections could be made to the schools adjudicator or the NationalAssembly for Wales. I agree with him, of course, that we should notwant frivolous or vexatious objections to be considered. There has beenno evidence of that happening since 1999 when the first objections weremade. The question whether an objection has merit should be for theschools adjudicator, who is best placed to consider all theinformation. We should not try to fetter the discretion of theadjudicator or the Assembly as the amendment proposes.</div><a name="06050316000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is also important that theschools adjudicator should have flexibility to make decisions based onlocal circumstances and the merits of individual cases. The amendmentwould substantially reduce flexibility and change the balance of thesystem to favour the interests of schools rather than families andchildren. For those reasons I opposeit.</div><a name="06050316000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 216,which was tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Bury, North, wouldremove the <div class="Column"><a name="Column666" />Column number: 667</div>power to prescribe in regulations the type of objection that parentscould make to the adjudicator. I strongly agree with him that parentsmust be able to complain about admission arrangements that theyconsider unfair, but we consider that to avoid numerous unjustified,repeated and costly referrals, formal objections by parents should berestricted to the use of pre-existing partial selection or, as my hon.Friend outlined, cases in which the admission number for a particularage group is lower than the number indicated, as happens now. However,parents can ask their local authorities to object on other grounds toadmissions arrangements and in addition parents are, as we discussedearlier, represented on admission <div class="Column"><a name="Column667" />Column number: 668</div>forums by parent governor representatives; those forums will be able toobject to arrangements in future.</div><a name="06050316000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that my hon.Friend will agree that, as has been ably demonstrated in today&#146;sdebates, the process of admissions can, particularly for individualparents, be a quite worrying and tense time. I am sure that he wouldnot want any parent, instead of going through the existing process ofapplication and, if unsuccessful, appeal, to be in the position oftaking objections about a school&#146;s admissions arrangements totheadjudicator.</div><a name="06050316000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">Debateadjourned.<i class="I">&#151;[Mr.Shaw.]</i></div><a name="06050316000244"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Adjournedaccordingly at twelve minutes to Ten o&#146;clock, till Tuesday 9 Mayat half-past Teno&#146;clock.</i></div></td></tr></table><a name="end"><table width=90%><tr valign=top><td colspan=2>&nbsp;<br>
