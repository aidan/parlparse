Chairman:
						</b> Before we begin, I will make a few preliminary
announcements taking us through what we are going to do. I am happy for
hon. Members to remove their jackets. Will they ensure that their
mobile phones and pagers are turned off or switched to silent? I remind
the Committee that there is a money resolution in connection with the
Bill, copies of which are available in the room. I also remind hon.
Members that adequate notice should be given for amendments. As a
general rule, I do not intend to call starred
amendments.</div>
					<a name="071204107000009"></a><div class="hs_Para">As we are
still in the early days of taking oral evidence in Public Bill
Committees, it might help if I briefly explain what is proposed, so
that the procedure is clear. First, the Committee will be asked to
consider a programme motion, which is on the amendment paper, for which
debate is limited to half an hour. We will then proceed to a motion to
report written evidence. I am glad that the Minister has just come in
as he will propose the motions. They are followed by a motion to permit
the Committee to deliberate in private, in advance of the oral evidence
session. I hope that we can take all those stages
formally.</div>
					<a name="071204107000010"></a><div class="hs_Para">Assuming
that the motion is agreed to, the Committee will move into private
session. When we get through the formal part of our proceedings, we
will ask the public to withdraw and the Committee will decide how it
will ask questions. Once it has deliberated, the witnesses and members
of the public can come in. At that stage, the oral evidence session
will begin.</div>
					<a name="071204107000011"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the
Committee agrees to the programme motion, we will hear oral evidence
first. As there is only one set of witnesses, there has been a
discussion, through the usual channels, that if appropriate we will
take a 10-minute break and then go into the line-by-line consideration
of the Bill as part of this morning&#146;s sitting. That has not
happened before in a Public Bill Committee, and it is up to the
Committee to agree to it. We have moved rooms to allow us that
flexibility, should the Committee so wish. If the Committee does not
agree to that, we will move into line-by-line scrutiny in the afternoon
sitting. Those are decisions for the
Committee.</div>

the wording of the motion, what would be the procedure if, after

to discuss the evidence? Could we proceed in that way? I am concerned
that if we pass the motion, we cannot subsequently sit in private in
that sitting after the witnesses have been admitted even if the

Either we will suspend at that stage and move on to line-by-line

line-by-line consideration. It is possible for the Committee to decide
to take evidence from more witnesses as the Bill goes through the
Committee and to sit in private again then. However, this is a short
Bill and we do not have a lot of sittings. Coming back into a private
sitting to discuss what happened in the open sitting is not possible.

							<b class="B">Mr.
Robert Flello</b> (Stoke-on-Trent, South) (Lab): The
issue of the face value of the student loan book is of concern and
interest to me. Historically, Governments of all persuasions have not
always been as successful as we might have wished in valuing assets
that have been sold off, whether one wants to look back to the 1980s or
more recently. My concern is about who has valued the student loan
book, and how you have made sure that that valuation is robust, so that
there is no vested interest in terms of the financial markets knowing
that they will ultimately pick up something that will make them a large
profit at the expense of the taxpayer. Finally, regarding the future
value of the student loan book, how have you projected forward to
ensure that its value in future is recognised in this current valuation
and that, for future sales, that value is
reflected?</div>
					<a name="071204107000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								Bill
Rammell:
							</b>
						</i> I would say this, would I not, but I think
that, regarding this Government&#146;s management of student loan
finance since 1997, we have a good track record of getting the
estimates correct. We already have a track record in respect of the
sale of the mortgage-style student loans, where I think that we
demonstrated value for money.</div>
					<a name="071204107000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clearly, the
Bill gives us enabling powers to undertake value-for-money assessments
over a long period of time and also to undertake sales of the student
loan book. In order to arrive at valuations, we have undertaken those
assessments internally and also with external advice, and consequently
we have robust estimates. However, within the context of having
enabling provisions, we have said within the forthcoming three-year
comprehensive spending review that we are looking to make sales to the
tune of &#163;6.3 billion. Having said that, if we do not judge that
the market conditions are appropriate for those sales and we do not
think that we will get value for money, those sales will not go ahead.
Just because we are passing the legislation does not mean that the
sales will automatically take place within a certain time
scale.</div>

on that subject? I wonder whether or not there has been any discussion
of the National Audit Office report into QinetiQ and, if there has
been, has that informed your deliberations about value for money for
the student loan
book?</div>

								Bill

						</i> We obviously look at all reports regarding
the sale of Government assets. However, what we are looking at here is
a particular type of sale where we have a robust track record. The sale
of the mortgage-style loans that took place in 1998 demonstrated value
for money, but I am not sitting here today saying that, by passing this
Bill, we will automatically undertake x amounts of sales within y
periods. It will depend on the market circumstances and on both the
internal advice and the external advice that we receive about market
conditions. If we cannot demonstrate value for money, the sales will
not
proceed.</div>

						</i> We undertake detailed internal assessments
through my own officials in conjunction with those at the Treasury. We
have also sought external commercial advice about the way in which
these sales will be conducted. We will be appointing a sales adviser to
administer the establishment of the special purpose vehicle that will
be set up to take on board the loans that are sold. There will also be
a rigorous ongoing assessment of the market conditions to determine the
stage at which x amounts of loan finance are sold. Overseeing that
process, the National Audit Office has already indicated that it will
review the first tranche of sales and will be reporting to the Public
Accounts Committee. Within that context, there is a rigorous and robust
framework in place to ensure that we not only get value for money, but
demonstrate that we have achieved

to that question and before I start my series of questions, what
mechanisms are in place to test market conditions? As other people
asking questions have made clear and as the Minister has said, this
matter is partly about track record, but it is also partly about market
conditions. It would not be beyond the wit of man to devise a set of
circumstances where you could test market conditions by
well-established mechanisms. Has that been
done?</div>

						</i> Recently, there has been some market
volatility. While I think that there is still some market volatility,
there are indications that the situation is improving. It is crucial
that I make it clear that, while we indicated in the comprehensive
spending review that we intend to recoup &#163;6.3 billion from these
sales over the next three-year period, that is not set in tablets of
stone. A major element of the internal and external advice that we will
receive will focus on the market conditions and whether they are ripe
for getting best value for money. If, according to both the internal

the sales will not
proceed.</div>

						</i> There are three elements to understanding
how the value-for-money equation will work. The first is that the
market understands the nature of these loans because they are different
from consumer credit. We have to ensure that the market 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column5" />Column number: 5</div>understands their particular characteristics. The
second element is to ensure that the market is functioning properly,
with proper
competition.</div>
					<a name="071204107000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
third element is to do some form of value-for-money comparator, which I
think is the element to which you are referring. That is to do with
estimating the difference between the value for money of retaining the
loans on the Government&#146;s balance sheet and selling them into
the market. That is a complex calculation and is about trying to
discount the future cash flows that will come from loan
repayments, as against a lump-sum payment coming to the
Government soon. Those are estimates rather than complete
answers.</div>
					<a name="071204107000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">We must also
factor it in that there will be some transfer of risk from the
Government to the private debt owners. That element of risk will have
to be given a financial value and factored into the equation. To do
that, we are getting advice from our colleagues in the Treasury,
speaking to the NAO and taking advice from commercial companies that
can help us in the overall sale
process.</div>

drawing on precedent. We have the precedent of the sale from 1998 and
1999. What specific lessons were drawn from that? What international
comparisons are there? Has this been done elsewhere and what can
reasonably be learned from that? The critical thing is that we get best
value for money, that we sell at the right time and that the matter is
managed as effectively as possible. It would be useful, therefore, to
get some feel for what the Government have learned from past experience
here and
elsewhere.</div>

						</i> I will make some comments and Mike might
wish to follow up. Certainly, this is a different type of sale to the
1998 sale, which had an ongoing discount arrangement. That is built
into the sale price with these sales and that, in part, is because the
rules governing the accounting for Government debt have changed. If we
conducted this sale on the basis of the 1998 sale, we would not
demonstrate that we were transferring the debt from the public to the
private sector, so that is certainly different from what happened in
1998.</div>
					<a name="071204107000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">With regard to
international comparisons, it is difficult to draw analogies. There are
few examples of countries that have gone down the road that we have
taken, where the student finance system is derived from the public
sector. Obviously, there is a huge amount of student debt in the United
States, but that tends to be private debt, so I am not sure that there
are easily comparable international
examples.</div>

from previous debt sales. As the Minister said, there are significant
differences between 1998-99 and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column6" />Column number: 6</div>now, but the continuing element is that there is an appetite in the
market to buy debt of that sort, and that makes us confident that there

answers that you have just given. First, on the point about
mortgage-style loans, could you give some indication of the level of
discount that was given, which you undertook to do after Second
Reading? Secondly, on the point about transferring risk, is not it the
case that if a student dies or goes bankrupt, the Government underwrite
that risk? To what extent are we really transferring risk to the

						</i> That is the key element that we are
transferring to the private sector. Through the competitive bidding
process, investors will make a judgment about the attrition
rate&#151;for want of a better phrase&#151;that will potentially
take place over the 25-year duration of the repayment of the student
debt. That will take into account factors such as how often students
are likely to earn more than &#163;15,000 a year, above the
threshold, how often they are likely to be unemployed, how many of them
might be permanently disabled and how many of them might die. In those
circumstances, a judgment is reached on what is reasonable to put
forward as a proposal for the sale, and that is part of the way that we
demonstrate value for money.</div>

fixed terms and conditions, but there are elements of risk that will
transfer, as well. You mentioned that bankruptcy, death and permanent
disability are reasons for the loan to be cancelled as part of those
terms and conditions, but the risk associated with the loans is rather
wider than that.</div>
					<a name="071204107000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
mortgage-style loans, it is quite difficult to ascribe a precise
discount because the loans were sold for face value with an interest
rate subsidy that has been paid and continues to be paid because those
loans are not yet all paid off. Therefore, it is quite difficult to
ascribe a discount value. As the Minister mentioned, it would be unwise
to say what sort of a discount the Government are prepared to take on
loans this time around, before the loans sale process has not even
started.</div>

Budget report&#151;in paragraph 6.42, from memory&#151;states that
the sale will yield some &#163;6 billion. On Second Reading, the

relation to that figure. It is a projection for 2010-11. I cannot
square that with the current face value of the book. Presumably, you
have made projections of how the face value will change over that

vary the proportion that we sell to meet that target. That is very

there is a concern in some quarters that, when Government assets are
sold&#151;certainly, when one goes back 20 years&#151;the financial
markets, for example the merchant banks, had two attempts to make some
money: one was in the form of additional profit from an asset that was
perhaps sold at undervalue; the other was that they could make money
from the advice that they gave and by presenting the asset to market.
Can you give me some information about what proportion of the value of
the sale you anticipate having to pay out in costs to make that sale?
Indeed, can you give me some information about the costs of the advice
that you are receiving from the independent advisers? Furthermore, how
are you testing those costs to ensure that they really are value for
money and that the taxpayer is not bearing a disproportionate cost as
against any other person putting something to

a compensation clause to assure the private purchaser on that basis.
The implication of your question is: why should a private purchaser go
through with this process? Based on detailed external advice, we
believe that there is an appetite for this type of sale. It enables
investment organisations to diversify their portfolio and to get a
secure level of income over a period of time. In general terms,
graduates who are repaying their student loan finance are a sound
source of repayers. Taking all those factors into account, the advice
that we have indicates, and our judgment is, that there will be a
market for this sort of
sale.</div>

we had with many of the early private finance initiative contracts,
where the contractors made the big money, not by delivering the service
or the goods directly, but by rebundling it and selling it on when
interest rates changed? Huge amounts of money were made by the private
sector at the expense of the taxpayer, simply by refinancing after the

circumstances with this approach are identical with or analogous to PFI
sales. Clearly, in the competitive bidding process, the purchaser makes
a judgment about the implicit discount rate and, yes, over the course
of time that can be an overestimate or an underestimate. I think that
through the competitive bidding process and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column12" />Column number: 12</div>the other criteria that we are using, we will be able to
demonstrate value for money. However, the Government
no longer having to bear that risk by getting the private sector to
bear it over the longer term is one of the advantages to the Government

						</i> I think that the loans sale is not quite the
same as the PFI refinancing that you mentioned. However, we think that
there will be a process by which the loans are restructured and
securitised to be sold into the market in the form of bonds. We think
that there are advantages in doing that. It allows investors to buy
into a different sort of asset class. It allows for the matching of the
investor&#146;s risk appetite. It also allows the adjustment of the
terms of the loans to what investors would like to buy. Those three
factors are important in adding value, compared with just selling the
loans straight. Those processes will be an important part of the sale
process.</div>

that you just advanced are precisely those that were advanced for PFI,
when many of us pointed out these sorts of difficulties. Sadly, those
difficulties came to pass. Windfall profits were made, particularly on
early PFI contracts, to the point where in later PFI contracts there
was a kind of clawback on refinancing windfall profits. I am asking
whether, to whomsoever you sell, you are going to put some kind of
windfall clawback in your sale agreements, in the event that the loan
purchaser, in a fast-changing marketplace, makes a windfall profit

go back to your financial advisors, because you can transfer the risk
on a one-way bet so that, if things start to fall apart, the loan
purchaser will bear the cost, and if there is a windfall profit through
refinancing, the Government can claw back some of the profit. If you
have that kind of one-way bet, of course there will be a price to pay;
the sale proceeds will be lower because it will be riskier for the
loans purchaser. However, you can have precisely the kind of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column13" />Column number: 13</div>arrangement that we have under current PFI, whereby if things go
belly-up, the PFI contractor has the problem, and if the contractor
refinances and gets a windfall, the taxpayer will get some of the money
back. I respectfully suggest that you go back to your advisors on that.
If they are telling you that you cannot go down that route because it
would not be transfer of risk, I suggest that they are wrong.</div>

loans. The funds will then be raised via a process of securitisation
and bonds against those sales. That will allow the trading of those
bonds on the markets. I think that that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column14" />Column number: 14</div>should ensure a robust income stream. I cannot rule out that, at some

population. The access rate has increased significantly, yet the
graduate earnings premium remains substantial and robust; on average,
over the course of their working life, it is worth about
&#163;100,000 more, net of taxation, for a graduate than for someone
with two A-levels. I refute, based on that evidence, that graduates are

That does not strike me as being a complete transfer of risk if there
is something in there that means that the taxpayer can be tapped up for

						</i> I wonder if it would be helpful to explain
what the borrowers whose debt is sold will see and experience. The Bill
provides that the Secretary of State can constrain the new owner to use
the Student Loans Company and HMRC to collect repayments in the same
way as is done now. Borrowers whose debt is sold will see exactly the
same terms and conditions, such as the &#163;15,000 threshold, the 9
per cent. of the excess condition and the 25-year cut-off. All those
conditions will be reproduced for borrowers whose debt has been sold.
There will be no material difference between a borrower whose debt has
been sold and one whose debt has been retained by the Government. It
will still be HMRC collecting the repayments and the Student Loans
Company will still maintain the loan
accounts.</div>
					<a name="071204107000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
difference is in where the proceeds from the repayments will go. They
will be funnelled into the SPV that owns those debts and then
distributed as interest payments and principal payments to bond
holders. The constraints that will be put in the contract between the
Secretary of State and the owners of the debt&#151;the special
purpose vehicle&#151;will be the use of HMRC to collect and the
Student Loans Company to maintain the accounts. Also, all the terms and
conditions set out in statute and regulations will apply as much to the
sold loans as to the retained ones.</div>
					<a name="071204107000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">With regard to clause 3(6),
imagine at the moment that the sale process will be through
securitisation and a special purpose vehicle. That may be true this
year, next year and the year after that, but in five years&#146; time
it might be done by some other mechanism. Clause 3(6) provides a
variety of ways in which the requirements on the owner can be laid down
to ensure that the borrowers experience no material difference. The
reason that subsection (6) says transfer arrangements
&#147;may&#148; is that the Secretary of State will chose the
appropriate way for each case. It should not say that he will do all of
them, because they are
alternatives.</div>

Any future Government could undertake to do so. For instance, I know

interest, which we are not. It is within the Government&#146;s
discretion to vary it, but as long as they did not wish to change the
terms and conditions for both public sector debt and sold debt, the
same ones would be maintained through that

						</i> I will address the point now rather than
later on, although I will doubtless address it later on, as well. I
have debated it at length with officials. When we were drawing up the
Bill, I asked why we did not enforce the provision, instead of putting
it as a discretion. Let me state for the record that clause 3(6) sets
out different possible ways in which the Government could ensure that
they are able to maintain protection for borrowers in the case of
onward sales of loans. Under the current classification rules, it is
not likely that we would include in the initial contract a prohibition
of transfer without the Secretary of State&#146;s consent. That level
of control would probably not be consistent with making a proper sale
and transferring the asset from the public to the private sector, but
we want it in there as an option because those rules may alter over
time, so it is worth having the power to do so in the
future.</div>
					<a name="071204107000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">Rather, in
terms of enforcement, we expect to use one or other of the alternative
methods set out in clauses 3(6)(b) or (c) to ensure that the Secretary
of State is a party to any future contract. That will enable the
Government to ensure, for example, that a new purchaser continues to
use the SLC, as I said previously, and to make the same complaints
mechanism
available.</div>
					<a name="071204107000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">The terms
and conditions of the loans are protected because they are contained
within the regulations that would come before the House. I am happy to
put on the record that we will ensure that any onward sale contract
continues to protect the borrower fully. If we come to debate the
starred amendment, I would argue that we should resist it, as we cannot
be bound to use all the methods in the Bill. Indeed, I would argue that
it makes no sense to say that we must use two alternative ways of
achieving the end of ensuring that the Secretary of State is party to
the

						</i> The underlying reason for the sale is to
manage a public asset well. This is a large public asset as it stands;
we have mentioned that it is worth &#163;17 billion now and will grow
to &#163;25 billion in two years. The issue is how to manage that
asset in the best way. The argument is that two things can be done:
first, you can reduce the risk on the Government&#146;s balance sheet
by selling the loans; and, secondly, you can at the same time helpfully
raise some income, which can be used for the Government&#146;s other
spending
purposes.</div>

						</b> Therefore, it is about both realising the value of
the asset and transferring the risk. The Minister, however, has made it
clear that the risk is very low, which makes the sale attractive. We
were told that the sale is attractive because we know where people are,
they have a good record of repayment and the actuarial issues that the
Minister talked about&#151;death, disease and disability&#151;are
entirely predictable. Therefore, this is a low-risk product for the
private purchaser, but we are selling it because it is a high-risk
product for the Government? Is that
correct?</div>

have had some experience since 1998, this is still a relatively new
area for the Government. Although the

that this level of risk, whatever it may be, is more appropriately
dealt with in the private sector than on the Government&#146;s books.

that may also be true, but from the Government&#146;s perspective, as
a matter of public policy. It seems to me that you will have a

						</i> Again, I made this point on Second Reading.
We are committing ourselves to a process that will not start until
April next year. Nevertheless, these are important and serious issues.
At the top of our priorities is the importance of maintaining the
security of personal information. In the context that no breaches of
the protocols have taken place, and we are certain that no data have
gone missing in respect of student loan administration, there was
nevertheless a Government-wide review initiated by the Chancellor. My
noble Friend, Lord Triesman, as the Minister responsible for the
Student Loans Company, immediately initiated a review of all our
procedures. That review is ongoing and I hope that within a reasonable
period of time we will reach conclusions&#151;certainly well in
advance of any sales taking place next
year.</div>

							<a name="071204107000460"></a>Mr.
Marsden:
						</b> That is understood, but you will also understand
that the Committee, in scrutinising the Bill, wants to probe a little
further into what the hypothetical situation for robustness might be
when the Bill is finally enacted.</div>
					<a name="071204107000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am going
to press you further on the issue of encryption. I do not need to go
over this, but encryption was a key issue in the problems that took
place with the missing personal data on child benefit. I want,
therefore, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column24" />Column number: 24</div>to ask you two specific questions, although I do not want to bamboozle
those of us who might not be as technically literate in such matters as
others. First, is the level of encryption envisaged for data protection
in respect of student loans similar to that which should have applied
in the case of Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs and the missing
personal data relating to child benefit? Secondly, at what level within
your Department&#151;or the Department that will eventually supervise
data protection and its potential transferral&#151;will that
encryption be supervised? I appreciate that you may not be able to be
specific on those matters today; I do not know whether Mr.

								Bill
Rammell:
							</b>
						</i> Let me try to give some reassurance. Before
the Committee met, I thought about areas that Members would have
concerns about and anticipated that this would be one such area. Let me
be clear and explicit: personal data is currently exchanged between the
SLC and owners of the old mortgage-style loans electronically, using a
secure virtual private network. That VPN is facilitated using an
internet protocol secure encrypted tunnel and that method of data
sharing is considered very robust by industry standards. Most people
who have passed comment on recent events would accept that to be the
case.</div>
					<a name="071204107000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">In respect of
the Bill, as we plan to require purchasers of income-contingent
repayment loans to use the SLC to administer and enforce the sold
loans, loan account data would not need to be transferred to the
purchasers for day-to-day purposes. In the event, however, that the
purchasers require access to data&#151;for example, for audit
purposes&#151;the method of data transfer would be secure and
encrypted. That should provide reassurance to hon. Members on that
account. As part of the Government-wide review, even though we are
certain that there have been no breaches of protocol at the SLC and no
data have gone missing, all processes are being
reviewed.</div>

I am sure that those who are more technically literate than I am will
peruse some of those details carefully. I am sorry to have to refer
back to the HMRC case but, of course, it is the case on which the
questions are now being focused. You will recall that one of the
problems&#151;I do not want to prejudge the outcome of any
inquiry&#151;was that it was alleged that the material was sent
unencrypted by a junior official. Of course, that raises the question
of the level at which encryption will be authorised and supervised.

individualised information to make an assessment of the price they were
prepared to pay. That would be undertaken on an anonymised basis, so
there would be no personal details. We are also making it clear in the
Bill that the enforcement of repayments would be undertaken through the
Student Loans Company in the name of the private investor. Therefore,
for any of those mechanisms there would not be a need for the
individual&#146;s information to be passed on to private investors.
The only circumstances in which there may be a need for individualised,
identified information would be in respect of audit and due process,
and that would be in a handful of cases, relatively speaking. Again,
the data protection framework would be in place. We are also increasing
the criminal penalties associated with the unwarranted releasing of
detailed personal data to third parties.</div>

						</i> It is probably worth while restating what I
set out on Second Reading with respect to value for money. The Bill is
about enabling a long-term programme of student loan sales, so we need
to think about market conditions over the longer term, not just the
short term. As far as any continuation of the current market turbulence
translating into poor value for money of any sales of student loans, if
those circumstances prevailed, we would not go ahead with the sale at
that time. I also said that part of the value for money assessment will
involve gathering full and clear market information and, crucially,
assessing the value of keeping the loans in the public sector on our 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column31" />Column number: 31</div>balance sheet. We need to do that in order to be able to compare bids
for selling the loans against the value of holding them. Assessing
those values requires a number of projections that estimate the level
of repayments that would be made by borrowers stretching far into the
future. We will estimate the rate at which graduates will repay and the
number of loans that will be written off because, for example, the
borrower has become permanently disabled. Those projections have to be
based on assumptions and estimates, so there is a degree of risk built
into them.</div>
					<a name="071204107000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
assessing value for money, we also need to take into account the value
of transferring that risk from the public sector to the person or the
organisation who buys the loan&#151;that is not something that lends
itself to easy quantification. As a result, the assessment will need to
consider a range of values based on differing assumptions and estimates
of risk. That is only one part of the value for money test; the others
include ensuring that the sale is competitive and that it takes place
under normal market conditions. It also entails ensuring that potential
bidders have enough information to make good bids&#151;that is an
important requirement, so we will make a judgment about what type of
loans in general are initially being sold&#151;and ensuring that
there is a genuine transference of risk from Government to the
purchasers. That is the framework within which we will make judgments.
It is also the framework against which the NAO, the PAC and others will
be able to judge us in the longer-term, once the sales have taken
place.</div>

						</i> One of the issues is about whether a loan
purchaser can make a good judgment about the value of a loan, which
will be based mainly on the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column32" />Column number: 32</div>track record. Those loans could be valued more precisely. There is no
intention to allow purchasers to say, &#147;I would like loans from
graduates from such and such a university or from graduates doing such
and such a subject&#148;. In that respect, we expect a random draw
from the loan book. Having said that, there might be circumstances in
which you would want to exclude loans. That might be the case if the
loan balance is rather small&#151;say less than
&#163;100&#151;and typically would be paid off in the normal way
rather quickly. It might be sensible to exclude those loans. However,
the general principle is that the loans should be able to be valued by
the purchaser on the basis of a track record. That might mean loans a
year or two into repayment, which would result in a rolling programme
whereby, each year, when the next batch of sales comes in, you bring in
an extra set of
loans.</div>

						</i> Both of those sorts of loan would be in the
sales process. A point I made earlier in the sitting is that we want
the potential purchasers of loans to understand the sort of asset that
will underpin the bonds that they will buy. Part of that is
understanding how undergraduates&#146; salaries change over time and
what the range of graduates&#146; salaries are. We have some track
record for the portfolio overall. The intention is not to distinguish
between loans that are low risk and high risk and to sell one category
and not the other. The intention is to sell all of the loans. In order
to get a good price for the loans, the purchasers have to understand
them. We are talking about the process of

that they can put the right price on

						</b> Rather more prosaically I want to return to clause
4(3) and the loan regulations which, as I understand, say that a

that what it is designed to say? I am not sure why it is in the
Bill.</div>

					<a name="071204107000297"></a><div class="hs_Para">The reason I raise the matter
now, rather than during the course of the Bill, is because I thought
that we might have a debate to clarify it a little. If it says what I
think it does, then I have reservations about it. I wanted an
explanation on it, but I may have misinterpreted its import.<i class="I"> </i>I
see the Minister scratching his head, so I will carry on. It seems to
say that the Secretary of State can reimburse the successful bidder for
their bidding costs because of the high cost of bidding, for example on
PFI contracts, although we are not going to rehearse that discussion
again. However, in recent years it has happened that the Government
will, on occasion, reimburse the bidding costs for a PFI contract for
those bidders who are not successful. Clause 4(3) does not say
that.</div>

						</i> The measure is meant to reproduce what
happens now with the Secretary of State. If an individual borrower
defaults and causes the Secretary of State to spend money in order to
pursue that default&#151;that would be through the Student Loans
Company&#151;that additional expense can be reclaimed from the
borrower. That is what happens now with Government-owned debt. Clause
4(3) extends that to privately owned debt. If an expense is caused by
an individual borrower defaulting, that expense can also be reclaimed
by the private debt owner. It simply puts the Secretary of State and
the private debt owner on the same footing.</div>

a borrower defaults and causes the Secretary of State expense in
reclaiming the defaulted payment, that additional expense can be
claimed from the borrower. The clause extends that facility to the debt
owner if the debt is sold. It puts the debt owner on the same footing
as the Secretary of State is now, in the event that an individual goes
into default and causes costs in the recovery of that debt. It is not
to do with the cost of making a bid.</div>
