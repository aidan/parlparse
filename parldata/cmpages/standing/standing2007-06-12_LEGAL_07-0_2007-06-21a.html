					<a name="07062150000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07062150000268"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Justice (Bridget
Prentice):
						</b> I beg to move Government amendment No. 7, in
clause 83, page 48, line 24, leave
out paragraph (e).</div>
					<a name="07062150000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that we can deal with the amendment reasonably swiftly. It will
reverse an amendment that was made in the Lords, which would require
licensing authorities to pay particular attention to access to justice
when considering alternative business structure licences. I have no
quarrel with the spirit of that amendment; we take seriously access to
justice, as Baroness Ashton explained in the other place. It has been
one of the regulatory objectives since the Bill was drafted.</div>
					<a name="07062150000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 82 requires the
authority to issue policy statements on how it will consider the
regulatory objectives, including access to justice, when carrying out
its licensing functions. That will include the consideration of
applications for ABS licences. We do not want the reforms in the Bill
to make access to justice more difficult. Indeed, I would not have
introduced such measures if that were their effect. I am confident that
the forms of service provision enabled through part 5 will actually
improve access and encourage new methods of service delivery. Providers
will have to try harder to reach consumers and to provide for their
needs.</div>
					<a name="07062150000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">The measure
will deliver more joined-up provision, because different kinds of
professionals will be able to work together on integrated services in a
one stop shop setting. It will also stimulate competition, which 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column282" />Column number: 282</div>consumers will welcome, as it should bring prices down. I am confident
that licensing authorities will be mindful of the need to improve
access to justice and will do whatever is necessary to avoid harmful
effects. They will be able to refuse licences if they think that the
effect of granting a licence would be damaging, and they will be able
to impose conditions on licences. I differ from the Bill as amended on
whether access to justice needs to be singled out to ensure that
licensing authorities take it into account. I am confident that it does
not; clause 28 already ensures that they will take account of the
regulatory objectives, which include access to justice.</div>
					<a name="07062150000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I acknowledge
that alternative business structures are new and therefore carry new
risks. There was argument in the other place over whether the firms
that might be likely to go into legal services under part 5 would
cherry-pick profitable services and leave solicitors to survive on the
less profitable work. The purpose of the amendment that was made in the
other place was to require licensing authorities to give sufficient
weight to access to justice when considering licensing.</div>
					<a name="07062150000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">The problem with that provision
is that it inevitably puts access to justice ahead of all the other
objectives. It does not mention the other objectives, nor does it
require licensing authorities to balance access against them, which
naturally means that access would be interpreted as carrying greater
weight than the other objectives. The licensing authorities would
therefore inevitably treat access as more important, if only to protect
themselves from legal challenges for not having taken it properly into
account. That might not sound too bad, but the problem is that it risks
putting the other objectives second.</div>
					<a name="07062150000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">It may be that an ABS licence
will benefit the consumer because of the other objectives. For example,
the objective of increasing competition might promote consumers&#146;
interests. Those considerations make it acceptable to make a small
reduction in the extent to which access to justice is a nose ahead of
everything else. Effectively, the Bill could turn a condition that no
decision could ever adversely affect access to justice in any way, no
matter how beneficial that might be, into the reality. I do not think
that that is what we want.</div>
					<a name="07062150000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another issue that has been
brought to my attention is that the measure may be an attempt by some
in the legal world to protect their own interests, rather than a
consideration of consumers&#146; interests as
paramount.</div>
					
					<a name="07062150000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07062150000269"></a>
							<b class="B">Simon
Hughes</b> (North Southwark and Bermondsey) (LD): How on earth
could that be the case? How can the extra requirement for access to
justice in the licensing regime be considered as a measure that gives a
defence to lawyers but does not give advantage to
consumers?</div>
					
					<a name="07062150000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07062150000270"></a>Bridget
Prentice:
						</b> Inefficient and poor-quality solicitors firms
in, say, Lewisham high street, may be protected by the fact that they
put access to justice above the other objectives, rather than upping
their game to consider all the objectives. Consumer groups have told me
that that is one of their fears, and it is why we tabled the amendment.
It is important to consumer organisations that access to justice is one
of the regulatory objectives, but they feel that it should not be put
above the others.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07062150000271"></a>Simon
Hughes:
						</b> The Minister has not answered the question. If the
solicitors firm in Lewisham high street provides a good service and
good access to justice, paragraph (e) of subsection (5) would not
defend its interests any more than it would defend consumers&#146;
interests. A bad firm would not, by definition, provide access to
justice because it would not provide a just service for finding just
solutions. Please will the Minister think again? Her argument does not
stack up. It may have been put to her, but that does not mean that she
must buy it.</div>
					
					<a name="07062150000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07062150000272"></a>Bridget
Prentice:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman is right in respect of the
discussion on access to justice. Many of us are aware&#151;some of my
hon. Friends could no doubt give examples&#151;of situations in which
an individual goes to a solicitors firm and thinks that they are
getting access to justice because the solicitor takes their case, but
they subsequently find that, frankly, the standard of work is pretty
appalling. That is not access to justice. The consumer groups say that
if we put access to justice in the Bill as in paragraph (e) and
therefore give it more weight than the other regulatory objectives,
such as competition, we could be allowing firms to continue as they are
when they ought to be thinking hard about improving their standards and
working with others to learn from best
practice.</div>
					<a name="07062150000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Finally,
I am not in any way condemning any solicitors firm in Lewisham high
street. I used that location as a general example of a place where
consumers might have a problem unless the amendment, which I commend to
the Committee, is
made.</div>
					
					<a name="07062150000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07062150000273"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Jonathan Djanogly</b> (Huntingdon) (Con): We are now
discussing clause 83, which concerns the ABS licensing rules for the
licensing authority. I am afraid that this will be another set-piece
debate from the other place, but it will deal with the important issue
of the proposed reversal of amendments made in the other place by my
noble Friends, the Liberal Democrats and Cross-Bench peers to ensure
that licensing rules contain provisions requiring the consideration of
the impact on access to justice.</div>
					<a name="07062150000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall start by noting the
words on Third Reading in the other place of my noble Friend Lord
Kingsland. Outlining the importance of his amendment, which the
Government are now seeking to reverse, he
said:</div>
					<a name="07062150000222"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;First,
all the amendment obliges the licensing authority to do is to conduct a
thorough investigation into the access to justice implications of the
proposal. The obligation is for the licensor to put itself in the
picture as thoroughly as possible before testing the proposal against
all eight objectives. Within the scope of the amendment, the licensor
is perfectly entitled to investigate in as much detail as it thinks
appropriate any of the other seven objectives. Secondly...there
is, in my submission, nothing wrong or unprecedented in Governments
requiring decision-makers to give particular or significant weight to a
relevant consideration, and, in this case, there is a
powerful...reason for doing so.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official
Report, House of Lords,</i> 15 May 2007; Vol. 692, c.
136.]</div>
					<a name="07062150000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						As
the Minister indicated, on Report in the Lords, a Government amendment
was accepted requiring licensing authorities for alternative business
structures to issue policy statements with the approval of the board,
setting out how they would comply with the duty to promote the
regulatory objectives when exercising their functions. Baroness Ashton
said that rather than impose a duty 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column284" />Column number: 284</div>specific to access to justice the Government had sought to consider the
interaction between access to justice and the other regulatory
objectives. However, we do not agree that the Lords Government
amendment deals with the issue, as it fails to direct licensing
authorities&#146; attention to the particular risks posed to access
to justice by alternative business
structures.</div>
					<a name="07062150000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us
consider the view of others who have reviewed the Bill. Lord Woolf
expressed his concern in a report earlier this year,
stating:</div>
					<a name="07062150000223"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;There
is no doubt that large businesses could provide legal services in a
novel and interesting way. But that could&#151;unintentionally,
perhaps&#151;have a devastating effect on those who have
traditionally provided services in rural areas in particular. Great
care has to be exercised to see that damage does not
occur.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07062150000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Master of the
Rolls said that it
was</div>
					<a name="07062150000224"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;very difficult to
see how this suggestion is going to improve access to justice for those
who cannot really afford it because...anybody who is going to
invest money into it is going to be looking for a return, quite
unsurprisingly.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07062150000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
Minister referred to so-called cherry picking and implied that the Bill
will deal with it adequately without the Lords amendment that she
wishes to reverse. The Law Society was worried about that,
stating:</div>
					<a name="07062150000225"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;New
entrants into the market may bring about some benefits. However, there
is a risk that there may be long-term structural effects that destroy
service provision and the fabric of small communities. Put bluntly, new
entrants might cherry pick more profitable and less complex areas of
work, driving down the profitability of established local firms who
offer a full range of services at the heart of their communities. If
that happened, where would consumers go for advice on complex
matters?</div>
					<a name="07062150000226"></a><div class="hs_brev">The Law
Society's conclusion is that whilst the regulatory issues concerning
new service providers can be dealt with...there are very serious
risks to access to justice from the uncontrolled admission of new
entrants. Existing practitioners report that in many areas, a number of
existing firms serving small localities would be in jeopardy if large
institutions entered the market for legal
services.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07062150000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">Richard
Miller, the director of the Legal Aid Practitioners Group,
said:</div>
					<a name="07062150000227"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;As a
representative body for legal aid firms and agencies, we are
particularly concerned about the likely impact on the current range of
services provided by high street solicitors. Commercial providers will
be attracted by the areas that can be commoditised, computerised and
provide a reliable margin of profit. These services often subsidise
legal aid work, and without them high street firms may not be
financially viable. ABSs will cherry-pick only the profitable work,
such as conveyancing, wills and telephone
helplines.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07062150000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Joint Committee on the Draft Legal Services Bill under the chairmanship
of Lord Hunt also highlighted the issue, stating that it
was</div>
					<a name="07062150000228"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;persuaded by some of
the evidence suggesting that the reforms may reduce geographical
availability. We consider that ABSs may reduce the number of access
points for legal services and we see this as a potential problem. There
is clearly an issue here and the only conclusion we are able to draw is
that no-one can be sure how it will work out. We recognise that there
may be a trade-off between the quality and accessibility of
advice&#151;for example a small, high-street solicitor in a rural
area may not be able to provide the specialist advice a client
requires. We recommend that the Government amends the draft Bill to
ensure that the impact of ABSs on access to justice, particularly in
rural areas, informs the decision-making process for licensing an ABS
firm.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07062150000239"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.15
am</div>
					<a name="07062150000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Joint
Committee recommended that the Government should amend the draft Bill
to ensure that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column285" />Column number: 285</div>the impact of ABSs on access to justice, particularly in rural areas,
would inform the decision-making process for licensing an ABS firm.
Accordingly, it is now provided in the Bill that licensing authorities
would be required to consider the likely impact of a proposed
application on access to justice when considering an application. A
licensing authority would be either an approved regulator, which is
designated as such, or the Legal Services Board.</div>
					<a name="07062150000045"></a><div class="hs_Para" style="text-align: justify;">The Conservative
party strongly supports retaining this provision, not least because
there are important considerations in terms of geographic and sectoral
legal work which we will need to think about carefully. Lord Kingsland
explained the danger that might arise on Second
Reading:</div>
					<a name="07062150000229"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;You
might get a very powerful ABS deciding to try to drive a legal firm out
of a particular market by predatory pricing; by subsidising from
profitable legal activities in the other part of a firm a particular
section of a firm that would sell its legal services below cost to gain
a competitive advantage and probably drive several of its competitors
out of the market.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of

						The
Government need to rethink. The problems mentioned will need very
careful handling by the LSB if we are not to have a range of
competition problems, which so far seem to have been unforeseen. We are
seriously concerned that without the access to justice requirement, the
Government may have made a serious misjudgment. I remind the Minister
that this would not create access to justice as the overarching
objective, which was the fear expressed by the Minister in her earlier
remarks and by Baroness Ashton in the other
place.</div>

						</b> The direct answer to the question is to look at
what has happened. The OFT produced a report on competition in the
legal market in 2001. Here we are, half way through 2007, debating its
conclusions. We want a system that is rather more adaptable than that.
Indeed, the Bill essentially provides that, but access to justice
should be included in the Bill as an important point for
consideration.</div>
					<a name="07062150000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
Minister mentioned the view of the consumer organisations but we
believe that it is a short-term point of view. With no effective
control on cherry-picking, competition and choice could be reduced by
the growth of so-called advice deserts across the country. The
provision is intended to ensure that the licensing authorities 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column286" />Column number: 286</div>consider the possible effect on access to justice and give the issue
full weight when determining applications. On that basis, I shall
recommend that my hon. Friends vote against the
amendment.</div>

							<b class="B">John
Mann</b> (Bassetlaw) (Lab): We have heard quite a bit about
access to justice in rural areas. Conveniently, of all the members of
the Committee I probably represent the largest rural area with 550
square miles. My experience of access to justice in a highly rural area
is of some relevance. My question is: where is the factual basis? We
hear many assertions. I have carried out my own quantified
survey&#151;I have a small sample of it with me&#151; asking people
in a rural area about access to justice. My finding is that they are
not very happy with the current situation; they feel that they do not
have proper access to justice. However, they are looking at matters
from a different angle. They mean that they are not happy with the
service provided by existing solicitors. It seems, therefore, that
access to justice needs to be properly defined. I am not against small
businesses&#151;quite the contrary; I once owned a family
business&#151;and I would support the small business against the big
enterprise any day. However, access to justice needs to be defined in
the context of how people get to the service and what is
provided.</div>
					<a name="07062150000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The problem
with this debate and with the background to debates in another place
and on the Joint Committee is that people are looking at the wrong
paradigm. They are looking at the people who currently use such
services, rather than those in the expanded market that should exist. I
offer any decent firm of solicitors, small or large, that wishes to get
into new areas a plethora of possibilities for work with people who
have not accessed justice before. There are many paths&#151;let me
give some examples.</div>
					<a name="07062150000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">Hundreds of people might well
be inspired to take action in relation to the recent health and safety
abuses of graveyards and memorials in my area and others, at a cost to
them of some &#163;350 a head. They clearly have a legal case. Tens
of thousands of people have never challenged the abuse of the car
parking system by major operators. They, too, clearly have a legal
basis for a challenge, but have never found anybody willing to take on
the work, not least because those separate individuals have not
considered going to the legal profession for advice in support of their
consumer rights.</div>
					<a name="07062150000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
their brave attempts to expand the concept of justice, the Opposition
are considering the old paradigm&#151;the system as it was&#151;and
missing the key point that the market should expand. A lot of demand is
not being properly met, and that is what an expanded legal profession
should be looking at. It should root out those who have never dared to
presume that they can use the services of the legal profession. As my
survey proves, that means the vast majority of people in a big rural
area like mine.</div>

							<a name="07062150000279"></a>Simon
Hughes:
						</b> It is true that my constituency does not cover 550
square miles. In fact, it is about one hundredth of that
size&#151;perhaps a bit more. However, the hon. Gentleman makes a
point about the need for access to justice that does not contradict
those who support the amendment that the Minister is now trying to
undo. Let me start where he ended. Of course, in communities such as
his, as in all rural areas in Britain, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column287" />Column number: 287</div>there is a need to ensure that there is proper access to services that
have the confidence of the community. That might not be provided in his
area&#151;he knows his towns, small towns and large villages better
than anybody else in the room&#151;but that is not an argument
against retaining the provision in the Bill.</div>
					<a name="07062150000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister started by
referring to the fact that the Government made some concessions on
Report about the duties of licensing authorities. Indeed they did. The
matter was carefully considered by colleagues in the House of Lords,
and when they returned to it on Third Reading, and there was a
significant majority in favour of amending the Bill to read as it does
now. The vote was 213 to 145, and the majority comprised a coalition,
as the hon. Member for Huntingdon said. All of them thought that it was
important that we include a reminder of the importance of access to
justice not in the statute that governs the LSB, but in the documents
that govern each of the authorities addressing such issues.</div>
					<a name="07062150000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">It could be argued&#151;I
thought that the Minister might argue this&#151;that if the Lords
were going to move in that direction, they should have gone further in
clause 83(5)(e), which the Minister is trying to remove. Logically,
they should have included objective 1, which relates to protecting and
promoting the public interest, as well as objective 3, which relates to
&#147;access to justice&#148;. I could understand that argument
because the public interest must be uppermost.</div>
					<a name="07062150000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me turn, however, to the
argument that the hon. Member for Huntingdon and I are making, which
was strongly made outside and which is absolutely not in the interests
of existing lawyers who do the existing work&#151;that is, the status
quo. The clause is about the licensing rules that will be written by
the licensing authorities that the Bill sets up. Those rules will set
out the qualifications that people will need to be
able to practise, which is of course appropriate. Subsection
(5)(b) sets out</div>
					<a name="07062150000060"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;arrangements...conduct
rules, discipline rules and practice
rules&#148;</div>
					<a name="07062150000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">and what happens
where there is an internal difficulty. There are also provisions
dealing with indemnification, so that people have a chance to get
compensation if things go wrong.</div>
					<a name="07062150000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">At this stage in the process,
however, there must also be a pause for reflection about whether what
is being done increases rather than decreases people&#146;s ability
to access services. By that, I mean good services, not inadequate ones
or ones that do not do the job that people want them to, as clearly
happened to people in Nottinghamshire and elsewhere in the country. We
all know about the issue of complaints, which we shall discuss later in
the Bill, and there has been a history of unsatisfactory practice and
remedies in many cases. That is why I intervened on the
Minister.</div>
					<a name="07062150000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">I cannot
understand the argument that says that considering the access to
justice criterion at this stage in the process would not benefit the
people walking up and down Lewisham high street, Macclesfield high
street&#151;I do not know whether that is what the main street in
Macclesfield is called&#151;or Borough high street in my
constituency. It must be in the interests of such people for an
assessment to be carried out when a big insurance company or a college
of occupational 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column288" />Column number: 288</div>therapists, for example, is given a licence to do a piece of work or
offer a service. Such a college might see a potential benefit to having
a legal service and might think it convenient to be able to offer legal
advice to people who come in for back pain relief following an
industrial injury. One could contemplate all sorts of organisations
taking up the opportunity offered by the alternative business structure
model if it were available. If they do, the question then is whether
that will advance access to justice. I agree that the other relevant
consideration would be protecting and promoting the public interest,
which is one of the objectives, and that is the other side of access to
justice.</div>
					<a name="07062150000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to
make two other points now, in addition to underlining the strong point
made by the pre-legislative Committee in paragraph 3.24 of its report
on the draft Bill, to which the hon. Member for Huntingdon referred.
The Committee clearly recommended in the terms that the hon. Gentleman
set out that the Bill should be amended. Elsewhere in its
recommendations, it said that the Government or Parliament should think
about things, but in this case it recommended</div>
					<a name="07062150000230"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;that the Government amends the
draft Bill to ensure that the impact of&#148;</div>
					<a name="07062150000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">alternative business
structures</div>
					<a name="07062150000231"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;on access to
justice...informs the decision-making process for
licensing&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07062150000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">It dealt
specifically with rural issues and expressed concern about
them.</div>
					<a name="07062150000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">The issue is
important, and I put it to the Minister to keep it before us, because
it is one of those on which there will be firmness on the Opposition
Benches and elsewhere for a considerable time to come&#151;it will
not go away. As the Minister knows, the legal aid service is also being
reorganised in her Department, as the hon. Gentleman mentioned. That is
causing considerable anxiety and disquiet. That is exactly where the
linkage is between those who might provide the service and the
financial arrangements allowing people to gain access to the service.
That, self-evidently, is because there are two parts to gaining access
to justice. The first is to know where the front door is; the second is
whether one has the resources to take the advised action, or, indeed,
the action that one is entitled to
take.</div>

						There
is serious concern, particularly in rural areas but not only there. The
hon. Member for North-West Norfolk knows&#151;he and I have shared
platforms&#151;that many rational, non-militant people who do that
sort of work in counties such as Norfolk and cities such as London are
extremely exercised that the reforms will make it much more difficult
for the poor, the disadvantaged, the mentally ill, those with learning
difficulties, those who do not have English as a first language, and
those who simply are not experienced in dealing with the law, to be
able to gain access to the

								Mr.

						</b> The hon. Gentleman makes an important point. He
will appreciate that, under the Carter proposals, the Government
propose a significant reduction in the number of law firms. The extent
of that reduction is the subject of debate, but no one is saying that
it will not happen. Does the hon. Gentleman not agree that adding to
that reduction the cherry-picking proposals for access to justice could
create a crunch that no one has foreseen?</div>

							<a name="07062150000281"></a>Simon
Hughes:
						</b> That leads me conveniently on to the link with
which I want to finish.</div>
					<a name="07062150000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is clear from the way in
which the Carter review was set up, and from the Government&#146;s
response, that what is effectively being set up is a new franchising
arrangement. I have attended meetings with the Under-Secretary of State
for Justice, the hon. and learned Member for Redcar (Vera Baird), who
leads on such matters, and I have heard her say directly, face to face,
that she expects the closure of certain places so that other legal
outlets can be enlarged, and that it is no good firms being able to
carry on with the specialist character of their work, looking after
certain types of cases, without taking on a raft of other services. She
made that point absolutely clear.</div>
					<a name="07062150000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment would prevent
consideration of that matter not in the generality but in the
particular. Subsection (5)
states:</div>
					<a name="07062150000232"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Licensing
rules of a licensing authority must contain ...appropriate
provision requiring the licensing authority to consider the likely
impact of a proposed application on access to justice when determining
the application&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07062150000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">At the
moment that the case comes before the court the licensing authority
must consider access to justice.</div>
					<a name="07062150000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						It is rather
like the questions that come up in all our constituencies when planning
applications are decided. The clause makes a parallel provision, saying
that when individual applications come up, those who decide them are
duty bound to think about access to justice. Officers must advise them,
as it were, that the authority must consider the issue and decide
whether it passes the test. It is not sufficient to say that it is one
of the regulatory objectives or, further away, that it is to be found
in guidance or is the equivalent of the law of the land. It means that,
on every individual application, the licensing authority has to ask the
question. Depending on decisions made yesterday, last week or last
month&#151;depending on what has happened in Lewisham high street,
Borough high street, or Macclesfield high street&#151;the answer
could be different.</div>
					<a name="07062150000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
understand the arguments put by the Minister, and by Ministers in the
other place, but none of them are at all persuasive. The Government
lose nothing by keeping the Bill as it is. Whether or not the Minister
concedes the point today, I hope that she will reflect on the matter so
as to ensure that we do not have to have a long battle over the issue.
She may concede nothing but still give some encouragement to legal aid
practitioners by keeping the provision in the Bill. That would also
give some encouragement to those who are worried about the
Government&#146;s undermining of services to the less advantaged. I
hope, in the end, that she will understand that the Lords was very firm
on the matter, and that Opposition Members, too, will be very
firm.</div>

Bailey:
						</b> I had not intended to speak on this matter, but
having heard hon. Members&#146; remarks, I feel that I need to do so.
First, however, I draw colleagues&#146; attention to the declaration
that I made on Second Reading. I am a Labour and Co-operative Member of
Parliament. The Co-op, Tesco and other retail organisations have been
quoted at length in some debates as potential beneficiaries of the
change. I am told that I do not have to declare that interest, but I
feel it appropriate to do so.</div>

						I must make a
philosophical point. I am astounded to hear Opposition Members, who
belong to parties that historically are wedded to the philosophy of
free market competition, defending one of the most long-standing and
outrageous closed shops that can possibly be imagined, and praying in
aid of that defence a number of assumptions that do not stand up to the
test. The first assumption rests on the question of the nature of the
barriers to access to justice. Implicit in the arguments presented by
Opposition Members is the idea that law firms are a bit like legal
supermarkets or community stores&#151;they exist in all communities
and are used regularly, if not daily, by a large proportion of the
public, and anything done to undermine them will deal a devastating
blow to services in the area. I do not think that that is the case. It
is likely that law firms in sparsely populated rural areas, for
example, already specialise in a particular aspect of law. The chances
of finding a law firm covering a range of services effectively and
expertly are, quite frankly, slim. What are the real barriers to people
using law firms? Is geographical proximity a
factor?</div>

								Robert
Neill</b> (Bromley and Chislehurst) (Con): I am listening to
the hon. Gentleman with interest, but I urge him, if he has not done
so, to read the evidence taken by the Constitutional Affairs Committee
on Carter and access to justice. He will find that concerns about a
possible dearth of access to justice and the risk of legal aid deserts
were expressed not just by lawyers&#151;not just by the closed shop,
so to speak&#151;but by the voluntary sector, citizens advice bureaux
and a raft of other organisations. It is not a lawyers&#146; thing at
all.</div>
					
					<a name="07062150000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07062150000284"></a>Mr.
Bailey:
						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>I have heard the argument about legal
deserts for four or five years, and to a certain extent, from
Opposition Members&#146; point of view, it is a self-defeating one.
If the possibility exists as a result of the changes arising from the
Carter proposals, it is important to create a new legal service
provision that will operate at lower cost so that more companies can
provide services
profitably.</div>
					<a name="07062150000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I
was about to ask what the real barriers to access to justice are. Is it
a geographical issue? When a person wants a particular legal service, I
do not believe that the geographical proximity of the legal service
provider is uppermost in their mind when they make their choice. The
last time that I needed conveyancing on my house, I went on the
internet. In fact, I never had a face-to-face meeting with the people
who conducted it, and that is an increasing trend. If we polled people
about the reasons why they do not use solicitors, geographical
proximity would be low on their list of criteria. The main criterion
would be perceived cost. There is a belief abroad that going to a
solicitor is a very expensive process beyond the purse of an ordinary
person, and that people are enmeshed in a process over which they have
no control and that the ultimate cost can be formidable. There is a
belief, too that if things go wrong, there are very few means of
redress. There are provisions in the Bill to deal
with that, so one could say that in totality it deals with the
fundamental obstacles to access to
justice.</div>
					<a name="07062150000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						In
addition, arising from the perceived exclusivity of the legal
profession, there is a profound psychological barrier for a great
majority of people who want to use the existing structure of legal
services. Alternative business 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column291" />Column number: 291</div>structures, which in most cases will be far more firmly embedded in
urban and rural communities than the current legal services, will
provide a range of services to a far greater number of people without
generating historical antipathy or concern. Such structures will be
perceived as far more consumer
friendly.</div>
					<a name="07062150000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
there is a regulatory regime designed to stop undercutting, and I am
sure that if that practice took place, lawyers, being lawyers, would
quite rightly be adept at exploiting that regime. The argument that
alternative business providers will just cherry-pick the most
profitable parts of legal services and neglect others is based on
perception. The fact is that a range of alternative business providers
might provide services that historically have not been well provided
for by solicitors&#151;that is one of the benefits of the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="07062150000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill will
lead to an opening of the market and, as always, adjustments will have
to be made. I appreciate the fact that, for the legal profession, some
adjustments might be quite difficult and painful, but if they benefit
consumers, or change consumers&#146; perception of the legal services
industry and make more people ready to use legal services, that will
benefit not only alternative business providers but the traditional
legal
profession.</div>

								Mr.
Burrowes:
						</b> If the hon. Gentleman is patient, he will hear
the point that I am making. I hope that he will take up my invitation
to visit Enfield. Rather than considering conveyancing, which is a
world away from welfare law, we should consider education. If a problem
arose as a result of a family member being excluded from school, or
suffering bullying, harassment or discrimination, it would not be
possible to find a lawyer to deal with education law. That would be a
serious problem; despite searching high and low for the access to
justice that we all want, people would not be able to find it. They
would be told, if they found someone who 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column292" />Column number: 292</div>could give them some direction, that they would have to go out of town
to Essex, to find an advice centre where they could be given
advice.</div>

am</div>
					<a name="07062150000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">Such an
education law desert exists now. It is possible to get advice out of
town, away from any medium-sized firm that might want to develop in the
relevant area. However, people would not do it. In Enfield many of my
constituents with such concerns do not go anywhere for help; they do
not receive justice. They often require the help to be in the right
geographical location. That does not apply to everyone, but many people
are concerned that advice should be available in the high street of
their rural community. It cannot therefore be left just to the market
to develop the provision or not, as suggested in evidence.</div>
					<a name="07062150000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">Evidence was given to the Joint
Committee by Jonathan Lindley of the Legal Services Commission that for
social justice advice it is not necessary for a solicitor to be
provided all the time and that advice need not be given face to face.
He envisaged that if a large supermarket were to come into the market,
the Legal Services Commission would contract with it to provide the
range of services for individuals that was necessary in any location.
That might be the case in some circumstances, but it might not in
others. The point of the clause that was quite properly introduced by
the Lords was to make it possible to take account of issues of access
to justice. The hon. Members who support the amendment want to exclude
that provision from the Bill. That is a matter of great
concern.</div>

argument, because by his own admission there are effectively deserts,

to make a very short point. Please do not let us think that issues of
access to justice affect only rural areas. In a suburban part of London
like my constituency, a single parent with a family law issue, living,
for example, on the Mottingham estate, where there is significant
deprivation, will have enormous trouble in getting access, as things
are now, to a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column293" />Column number: 293</div>solicitor who will handle an application for an ouster injunction
against a violent partner or former partner.</div>
					<a name="07062150000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						To make light
of the impact of the current legal aid changes in relation to the
present proposal is to miss the point and the compelling evidence given
from all sides to the Constitutional Affairs Committee. I very much
regret&#151;and I feel strongly about this&#151;that the Government
are so dogmatic on the issue, and needlessly so, in the light of all
the evidence, in particular from legal aid practitioners. It is wrong
that the debate should always be structured on the basis that
solicitors do conveyancing and get money for old rope. That is not the
experience of my constituents, who often depend on legal aid. I should
have thought that that would apply to Labour Members&#146;
constituents as well.</div>

Hughes:
						</b> I just want to make two short points in response
to points from the hon. Member for West Bromwich, West and the
Minister. There are many legal firms in small towns that, despite
principally dealing with one type of matter, either have another branch
elsewhere that deals with other matters, and to which there is local
access, or are in an arrangement with other firms doing other business.
So the local access issues do not mean that people are limited to the
service that is provided in that building by the people working there.
Often, that building is the doorway to a much better service.</div>
					<a name="07062150000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would like to ask the
Minister a question. She said that she had been lobbied by consumer
organisations. I think I am right in saying that the National Consumer
Council and the National Consumer Federation support the amendment that
was made in the Lords. I would be grateful if she would just confirm
that she also understands that to be the
case.</div>
					
					<a name="07062150000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07062150000294"></a>Bridget
Prentice:
						</b> We have listened to the concerns that have been
expressed about ABS licensing and the new risks that may exist
alongside the potential benefits. That is why we tabled those two
amendments in the other place. The first amendment was to clause 82,
saying that all licensing authorities must issue policy statements
about how they will comply with all the regulatory objectives,
including access to justice. Those policy statements must be approved
by the board, and the licensing authorities will be monitored to see
how they adhere to them.</div>
					<a name="07062150000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Secondly, in
clause 110 there is now a requirement on the board itself, to report
annually on the way that the activities of licensing authorities and
licensing bodies have affected the regulatory objectives. That
requirement will ensure that the development of ABS and its effects on
legal service provision are kept under permanent review.</div>
					<a name="07062150000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">The advantage of our amendments
is that they require all the regulatory objectives to be taken into
account and to be monitored at all times. They do not single out any
one objective for particular attention.</div>
					<a name="07062150000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would like to look at clause
82 briefly. Having to make policy statements will mean that the
licensing authorities and licensing bodies must say how they will
consider access to justice along with the other regulatory objectives
when they make their licensing decisions. Those policy statements will
have to deal with access to justice properly in order to gain the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column294" />Column number: 294</div>approval of the board, which will then inform the activity of the
licensing authority through rules and individual decisions; that
activity will, in turn, be overseen by the board, to ensure that it
gives effect to the policy statements.</div>
					<a name="07062150000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was asked about
cherry-picking and how we prevent large commercial operations from
damaging access to justice. First, clause 28 says that the licensing
authorities have a duty to promote the regulatory objectives, including
access to justice, and clause 82 reinforces that by ensuring that the
licensing authorities must take the extra step of formulating policies
to fulfil that duty. Furthermore, the details of the policy statements
that must be made might be shaped by the type of service that the
authority intends to license, as well as the potential providers, the
consumers and the geographical area that might be affected. So the
licensing authority will be able to take into account the effects that
that particular provider might cause.</div>
					<a name="07062150000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						That is why
the cherry-picking argument does not hold up. Several hon. Members made
that argument, in particular the hon. Member for Huntingdon. The
argument assumes, for example, that some types of work are always
profitable and must always cross-subsidise other types of work that are
always unprofitable. There is no proof of that. On the contrary, the
legal aid experience is that it is possible for a company to be
profitable by specialising in certain types of work that are sometimes
assumed to be unprofitable.</div>

							<a name="07062150000295"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:
						</b> Has the Minister received any evidence, or is
she seriously suggesting, that, say, Tesco or another large provider

Djanogly:
						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>The Minister seemed to be making the
point that it is not necessarily the case that firms will have loss
leaders, and that an activity that is now seen to be unprofitable
could, in the future, become profitable. I am putting it to her that
there is no evidence to suggest that certain areas of law&#151;I
mentioned a few examples before&#151;will be areas that any large
provider would want to offer.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07062150000298"></a>Bridget
Prentice:
						</b> I do not think that there is any evidence to the
contrary; that is the point. There are people who are saying that
certain areas of the law are profitable and that they are used to
cross-subsidise those areas that are unprofitable, as if that is set in
stone. I am not convinced of that, and I have seen no evidence to
convince me that that is the case. On the contrary, with more
opportunity to access commercial expertise on capital, it is more than
likely that an ABS will act as a driver for new means of delivering
services, either through the law firms themselves taking advantage of
the reforms, or through new providers to the market. We should not
assume that the way that traditional law firms provide services is the
only way to do so or that consumers do not want different types of
services from different types of providers.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column295" />Column number: 295</div>
					<a name="07062150000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon. Friend the Member for
West Bromwich, West made a point about geography and where people
access services, which made me think about the number of my
constituents who come into the advice surgery with immigration cases.
They use law firms from all over London, not just those based in
Lewisham. Despite the problems that people may have commuting from
Enfield, people do go across London to find the service that is
appropriate for them.</div>
					<a name="07062150000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for North
Southwark and Bermondsey asked about the NCC and the National Consumer
Federation. The NCC felt that the Lords amendment was appropriate, but
on the other hand, the National Consumer Federation thought that the
Bill provided safeguards to protect consumers and was happy with it as
it stood. Which? advocates that the Lords amendment should be
overturned.</div>
					<a name="07062150000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">It has
been an interesting debate, but I have not been convinced by the
Opposition&#146;s arguments. We should not be in the business of
protectionism; we should be in the business of access to justice and
upholding the rule of law and all other regulatory objectives. With the
amendments that we have made in the other place, the Bill gives us the
right balance for that to happen. The risk of leaving clause 83 as it
stands is too great. All regulatory objectives should be considered at
all stages, and access to justice is integral to that. On that basis, I
commend the amendment to the
Committee.</div>

						</b> I beg to move amendment No. 211, in
schedule 11, page 183, line 8, at
end insert&#151;</div>
					<div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;( ) Licensing
rules may provide for fees to cover the whole cost to the licensing
authority of dealing with the application, whether the application is
granted or
not.&#146;.</div>
					<a name="07062150000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment was suggested by the Law Society. It is required to make it
clear that licensing rules can put the whole cost of dealing with an
application on the individual applicant, rather than leaving part to be
borne by the licensing authority itself and thereby by other firms
regulated by that authority.</div>

am</div>
					<a name="07062150000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						It
is an important general principle of the bill that the costs of
regulation should, as far as possible, be borne by those whose
activities give rise to the cost, rather than by the regulated sector
as a whole. That is particularly important in respect of ABSs, where
some applications could give rise to complex issues. It would be quite
unsatisfactory for there to be a single flat fee applied to all
applications, whether from a comparatively small applicant filling a
gap in legal services or from a megastore supermarket seeking to set up
the sort of service that might give rise to particular concerns about
the possible impact on access to justice. We have just debated
that.</div>
					<a name="07062150000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">If a single fee
were set to meet all the costs of dealing with ABS applications, the
result could be grossly unfair to the small applicant. However, a
single fee at the level appropriate for the small applicant would
involve an unacceptable cross-subsidy from the rest of the regulated
sector&#151;in this case, non-ABS firms&#151;towards the cost of
ABS regulation. The solution is to enable different fees to be fixed
for different categories of applicants. That is dealt with to some
extent in the provisions concerning not-for-profit bodies in clause
106, but it is also important to be able to vary fees, even among
commercial applicants for ABS licences. There is no reason why an
applicant whose application gives rise to no significant concerns about
access to justice should pay the same fee as one that
does.</div>
					<a name="07062150000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						If
licensing authorities were unable to match the fee to the cost of
dealing with the application, they might be inhibited from
investigating applications as thoroughly as they should, particularly
where access to justice considerations arise. The amendment is designed
to stop that problem and ensure that the costs of dealing with
applications can be placed on the applicants
concerned.</div>

							<a name="07062150000315"></a>
								Simon
Hughes:
						</b> We have subscribed to the amendment, which is
entirely reasonable, and if agreed to it would not mean a mandatory
requirement. It does not say, &#147;licensing rules must
provide&#148;, it says &#147;may&#148;. It does not oblige the
outcome advanced by the hon. Member for Huntingdon but gives the clear
indication that people should pay for the application that they are
making, which must be the right process. If people are making a much
bigger application, the processing and consideration will take longer,
more time will be needed and the fees will be bigger. The amendment
does all the things that one would expect. I hope that the consumerists
on the other side of the room will join those on this side, thinking
that this is a reasonable way
forward.</div>
					
					<a name="07062150000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07062150000316"></a>Bridget
Prentice:
						</b> It is a very tempting thought that consumerists
across the divide should get together. I do not know whether this is
meant to be just a probing amendment, but I am rather surprised by it,
because this matter was fully dealt with in the other place. I thought
that the position was understood and that it had been accepted that the
Bill&#151;particularly schedule 11&#151;gives the flexibility that
the amendment is designed to achieve.</div>
					<a name="07062150000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						
						It
is reasonable to expect a licensing authority to charge for the full
cost of processing applications, whether or not the application is
successful. As the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey said,
some applications will generate a great deal more work than 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column297" />Column number: 297</div>others, and that will depend on the nature of the body making the
application. The megastore mentioned by the hon. Member for Huntingdon
that wants to operate in various locations will clearly need more
consideration than a single firm operating in one
place.</div>
					<a name="07062150000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
also mentions the fee being payable whether or not the application
succeeds. It is important that the fee is payable regardless of the
success of the application, otherwise there may be a temptation on the
authority to grant an application where it really ought not do so.
Non-refundable application fees are pretty common in many walks of life
and I see no reason why it should be any different
here.</div>
					<a name="07062150000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the full
costs were not charged in each case, one firm could end up subsidising
another. That could create some problems. For example, it might make
the authority unattractive to firms if their fees were
disproportionately high, and in that event they might seek licences
from another authority. There is nothing particularly wrong with that
in principle&#151;the reforms are in part about regulatory
choice&#151;but it might well have a knock-on effect on the authority
itself if there were fewer applicants, each of whom would effectively
be paying a discounted rate. The licensing authority could lose money
as a result, and I am not sure that that is what we
want.</div>
					<a name="07062150000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill already
addresses the issues that the hon. Gentlemen have raised. It gives
flexibility to the licensing authorities in how fees are set. The fee
levels and their effects on legal services mark-up will obviously be
monitored by the board. Fee levels form part of the licensing rules,
which for example could set individual fees based on the amount of work
that individual applications were estimated to need. All those would
have to be acceptable to the board before it would put forward a
regulator for designation as a licensing authority. If the board is
concerned about the effects on smaller firms or on competition, it can
require changes or decline to recommend designation.</div>
					<a name="07062150000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given that what he is seeking
is already achieved by schedule 11 paragraph (1) and by a number of
other safeguards and flexible provisions in the Bill, I ask the hon.
Member for Huntingdon to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

Djanogly:

end insert</div>
					<a name="07062150000352"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#145;Licensing rules must
provide that, in determining whether the requirements of sub-paragraph
1 are met, the burden of proof rests on the person who wishes to hold
the restricted
interest.&#146;.</div>
					<a name="07062150000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment is designed to make it clear that the onus of demonstrating
fitness to own rests on the applicant, rather than it being for the
licensing authority to demonstrate that a person was not fit and proper
before it could withhold approval. The effectiveness of fitness-to-own
provisions is a crucial element of the public protections that need to
be in place before external ownership of ABS firms can safely be
permitted. It is essential to avoid the spectre of law firms being
owned by criminal elements.</div>
					
					<a name="07062150000243"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.15
am</div>
					<a name="07062150000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill
already allows licensing authorities specifically to consider whether
or not those who hold more than a small interest in a prospective ABS
firm are fit and proper persons. The intention appears to be that it
should be for the applicant to demonstrate fitness to own, rather than
the applicant being entitled to be approved unless the licensing
authority can demonstrate that they are not fit to own. The intention
of the provision in paragraph 14 under which licensing authorities may
require non-authorised persons to provide it with such documents and
information as it may require appears to be designed to achieve
that.</div>
					<a name="07062150000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, it is
important that there should be no doubt about the matter. Merely
demonstrating an absence of criminal convictions might not be
sufficient to entitle an applicant to become an approved person. For
example, the possession of unexplained wealth could give rise to
reasonable suspicions about the integrity of an applicant. It is
important that the licensing authority should be able to refuse
approval in those circumstances unless it received a convincing
explanation of the source of the wealth. The onus should not be on the
licensing authority to prove that the unexplained wealth was ill-gotten
before it could refuse to approve the applicant. The amendment is
intended to put beyond doubt the fact that the onus of proof should
rest with the
applicant.</div>

								Simon
Hughes:
						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>I strongly support the amendment, which is
why I have put my name to it. I give as my reason an example from a
slightly different context. When Labour came to office, the London
borough of Southwark was still run by the Labour party. At that stage,
the education service was not fit for purpose. The Labour Government
intervened and directed the borough to contract out its education
service. The borough 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column301" />Column number: 301</div>contracted it out to an engineering firm called WS Atkins, although, to
my knowledge, the firm had no previous experience of running anything
to do with education. The Government said that that would be better for
the borough. Arguably, the service could not have become any worse,
but, in fact, it turned out to be no better, if not worse, because WS
Atkins did not have the competence to run the service.</div>
					<a name="07062150000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">When my colleagues won a large
number of seats on the council five years ago, they formed the first
ever non-Labour administration. In four years the authority did so well
on education that even the Government had to concede that it was fit to
run the service again. The service was handed back to it and WS Atkins
was shown the door. The services in the borough are now run by the
borough, as they should
be.</div>
					<a name="07062150000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that the
parallel is obvious. An application was made to do a job, but no one
assessed whether the applicant was fit for purpose. The amendment would
require that someone who was seeking the ability to be licensed to own
a business in the context of these business structures should have to
give reasons why they were fit to do that job. It should not be
sufficient for the authority to have to look around for reasons why a
person was not fit. Such a person should argue why they have a credible
reputation and financial probity and why they are suitable, and outline
their experience of that part of the country and the likely issues that
will come up.</div>
					<a name="07062150000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
absolutely right that the burden should shift. There would be a huge
work load on the licensing authority if it had to go through the
process of monitoring all the checks and balances and ensuring that it
won the argument. The amendment is right for both practical reasons and
reasons of principle. I hope that the Minister will be persuaded to
encourage her colleagues to support
it.</div>
					
					<a name="07062150000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07062150000338"></a>
								Bridget
Prentice:
						</b> In all respects, I agree absolutely with the
principle behind the amendment. The hon. Gentlemen are absolutely right
about the operation of the approval requirements for investors. A key
touchstone of part 5 of the Bill is the principle that non-lawyers
should be permitted to invest in law firms only if they can demonstrate
that they meet the standards set by schedule 13 and licensing
authorities. The alternative would be to require licensing authorities
to assume that all prospective investors were fit and proper unless
they found evidence to indicate otherwise. I do not think that that is
satisfactory and I get the impression that members of the Committee
agree with me because that is not a reliable enough safeguard. However,
we differ about whether further provision is needed to achieve
that. The proposal as drafted ensures that that is already in
the Bill.</div>
					<a name="07062150000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">The test for
approval means that when an investor wishes to acquire a restricted
interest of whatever kind, the licensing authority must be satisfied
that the proposed acquisition will not compromise the regulatory
objectives or the ability of ABS firms and the individuals in them to
comply with the regulatory arrangements. That is the first
test.</div>
					<a name="07062150000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">In addition, the
licensing authority must be satisfied that the individual or firm in
question is fit and proper to hold that interest by having regard,
among other 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column302" />Column number: 302</div>things, to that person&#146;s associates, his or her probity and
financial position, and any record of previous disqualification from an
ABS firm. All that must be taken into account. If those requirements
are not fulfilled, the authority may refuse to approve the proposed
interest, or attach conditions to it. If it is in any doubt about
whether a person meets the approval requirements, it can require
further information from that
person.</div>
					<a name="07062150000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is for the
applicant to prove to the licensing authority that all those standards
are met. If the authority is not certain that that is the case, it is
under no obligation whatever to approve the interest. Indeed, I would
go so far as to say that the authority would not be fulfilling its
statutory duty if it granted its approval in a case where a
person&#146;s fitness was in doubt.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07062150000339"></a>Mr.
Burrowes:
						</b> In response to the Joint Committee, the Minister
indicated that the Government could deal with concerns about putting
provisions on fitness to own in the Bill by way of secondary
legislation, or by leaving it to the Legal Services Board. Is it
possible that this could be addressed through secondary
legislation?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07062150000340"></a>Bridget
Prentice:
						</b> I am certainly happy to look at whether that
should be an aspect of the secondary legislation. Paragraph 6 of the
schedule probably covers everything that Opposition Members are rightly
concerned about. On that basis, I ask the hon. Member for Huntingdon to
withdraw the amendment, but I will take on board what hon. Members have
said.</div>

								Simon
Hughes:
						</b> The Minister said very assertively that it was
absolutely clear that the burden was on the applicant. She
cited in general terms paragraph 6 of the schedule. However, my copy of
paragraph 6 of the schedule does not appear to be nearly as clear as
the Minister implies. Seriously, can she point to the
measure&#151;either in the clauses or the schedule&#151;that says
what she is claiming? I have read the paragraph again, and I do not see
that it makes clear the point that we are trying to
clarify.</div>

issues that have been raised. That makes it clear that those issues

who has the job of providing the information and making the case. I am
sure that the Minister follows me. Paragraph 6(3) says simply that an
authority has to look at those issues, but does not say that the burden
is unequivocally on the applicant to satisfy the authority about those
issues. That is my concern, which the hon. Member for Huntingdon might
wish to pick
