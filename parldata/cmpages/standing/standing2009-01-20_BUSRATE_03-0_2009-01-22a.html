<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012252000183"></a>The
Chairman:</b><b class="B"> </b>Good morning, everyone. I remind members
of the Committee and witnesses that the evidence session this morning
must end at 10.25 at the latest. I hope that I do not have to interrupt
hon. Members or witnesses in the middle of their sentences, but I shall
do so, if need be.</div>
<a name="09012252000008"></a><div class="hs_Para">I welcome
Mr. Healey and Mr. Khan as witnesses this
morning. I understand that Mr. Healey would like to say a
few words at the beginning of our
sitting.</div><a name="09012252000009"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Healey:</b></i> Thank you, Mrs. Dean. I wished
principally to welcome you to the Chair of what I believe is your first
Public Bill Committee. I have found the evidence sessions very useful
generally. They help all Committee members, as well as Ministers, to
find their range on the issues and concerns relevant to a
Bill.</div>
<a name="09012252000010"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are
legislating in the Bill for a revenue-raising power. Doing so is never
easy, particularly at the time of an economic downturn; I recognise
that. However, the Bill is part of the Government&#146;s programme to
look beyond the short-term concerns that people understandably have
about the economy at present, and on to the long-term policies,
measures, projects and powers that need to be put in place to secure
future economic growth and prosperity&#151;long-term interests and
projects such as Crossrail, and the long-term policies and powers that
are needed in all areas of the country to secure growth for the longer
term and to strengthen the economy. The legislation is for the whole of
England and Wales. What is good enough for London is good enough for
the rest of the country. I have no truck with arguments that the
provision should be available only to
London.</div><a name="09012252000011"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am glad to say that the Confederation of British Industry, British BIDs
and the all-party Local Government Association accept business rate
supplements in principle, as we heard in a previous evidence-taking
session. I am also glad that both Opposition parties accept the
principle&#151;they did not vote against the Bill on Second Reading.
Some witnesses and members of the Committee have detailed concerns and
objections, and Sadiq and I will do our best to deal with those, not
only today, but throughout the Bill&#146;s passage through
Parliament.</div><a name="09012252000012"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012252000184"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Thank you for your welcome, Mr.
Healey. I can tell you that I have chaired one short Bill Committee
before, but not an evidence-taking
session.</div><a name="09012252000013"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
288</b><a name="09012252000185"></a><b class="B">Robert
Neill</b> (Bromley and Chislehurst) (Con): Welcome to the
Chair, Mrs. Dean.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column80" />Column number: 80</div><a name="09012252000014"></a><div class="hs_Para">I preface my
first question by telling the Minister that I am sure he recalls that
my party did not vote against the Bill on Second Reading clearly
because of the inclusion of Crossrail and an extension of the measure
to the rest of the country. If there is a desire elsewhere in the
country&#151;the Mayor of London wishes to use the measure for
Crossrail only&#151;why were officials of the LGA, when they gave
evidence, unable to name a single local authority that desired to take
up the BRS power at this time?</div>
<a name="09012252000015"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Healey:</b></i> The point of the legislation is to put in a
framework for the powers that may be appropriate, in some areas, at
some time, to help to strengthen the local economy. London is a special
case to the extent&#151;in my view, only to this extent&#151;that
in Crossrail we have a further advanced project with further advanced
plans and discussions on its funding package, and a very clear view
that a BRS is an essential element of that.</div>
<a name="09012252000016"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
original point was that in the 1980s and 1990s, policy making
generally, but particularly economic policy making, was heavily skewed
towards the preoccupations, concerns and principal position of Greater
London; the problems and potential of the economy in other parts of the
country were largely overlooked. We are not prepared to accept that
situation and we have not done so in the past 10 years. A framework of
new powers that is available to London&#151;to the Mayor and the
Greater London authority&#151;should, in principle be available to
other top-level councils and local authorities in England and Wales,
should they, in detailed discussion and consultation and, in some
circumstances, with a ballot of businesses, take the view that using
the powers could help to strengthen their economy for the long
term.</div><a name="09012252000017"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
289</b><b class="B"><a name="09012252000186"></a>Robert
Neill:</b> In such circumstances, is it not desirable to
achieve, if possible, consensus between the taxor and the taxed? Does
not the evidence that we have heard suggest that although in London
there is a broad consensus with the business representative
organisations, which accept the BRS as a mechanism for Crossrail,
outside London there is strong opposition from business organisations,
first because of the present circumstances and, secondly, because a
ballot is not to be compulsory?</div>
<a name="09012252000018"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Healey:</b></i> To be honest, I find the logic of some of the
evidence that we have heard from business organisations inconsistent
and mixed up. We have heard, for instance, that the British Chambers of
Commerce is concerned about a BRS without a ballot, yet the director
general confirmed to this Committee that it accepted the 30 per cent.
threshold. He acknowledged
that</div><a name="09012252000158"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;in
a number of parts of the country...there is a need for more local
determination and...for the ability to raise additional revenue
from the business community&#148;.<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official
Report, Business Rate Supplements Public Bill Committee, </i>20 January
2009; c. 20,
Q85.]</div><a name="09012252000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">The BRS
will put in place the potential for local authorities&#151;through
discussion and required consultation, and in some cases ballots, of
their business community&#151;to use that power for the interests and
the economic long-term benefit of their area, which seems entirely
right to me.</div>
<a name="09012252000020"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
290</b><b class="B"><a name="09012252000187"></a>Robert
Neill:</b> I have one final point I should like to raise. I
feel that I am about to suffer the same senior moment that one of our
colleagues had in the statutory instrument Committee yesterday. It is
about to come back to me as I waffle my way through it. With luck,
perhaps you could just help me on this last point, Minister.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column81" />Column number: 81</div><a name="09012252000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">Is there not a
danger that, in the current circumstances, what the measure really
represents is a shift in the burden of funding infrastructure
improvements from the Treasury to local businesses, when you look at
this power being coupled with the mainstreaming or the reduction in the
amount of monies available under the local authorities business growth
incentive scheme? If we are being generally localist, should we not
also give local authorities a power to place a discount on the business
rates as well as raise a
supplement?</div><a name="09012252000022"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Healey:</b></i> There are two different questions there.
</div><a name="09012252000023"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012252000188"></a>Robert
Neill:</b> That is because I thought of the other one half way
through.</div>
<a name="09012252000024"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Healey:</b></i> Let me deal with the latter one
first.</div>
<a name="09012252000025"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012252000189"></a>Robert
Neill:</b> That was the real question.</div>
<a name="09012252000026"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Healey:</b></i> Post-Lyons report and in the detailed
discussions leading up to and after the White Paper, there was very
little appetite in any quarter for a power to downward-flex the
business rate at a local level. The reasons for this were threefold.
First, there was a concern about its potential impact on local
services, because business rates are a source of revenue to support
local services. Secondly, there was an associated concern to protect
the council tax payer in such circumstances, mirroring the way that
this Committee is concerned about the interest of business rate payers
with the prospect of a BRS. Thirdly, there was concern about the
additional complexity in the tax system&#151;something on which you
and your colleagues, quite rightly, have been effective in pressing
Ministers over the past decade. For a combination of reasons,
principally adding up to a lack of appetite from any quarter for that
downward shift, which may have been part of the original discussion on
the BRS, we have not included that in the Bill.</div>
<a name="09012252000027"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Khan:</b></i> On your first point, the picture you paint in
your generalisation about businesses is just not true. We know that the
relationships that councils and businesses have are far more productive
and constructive than they were when you were first elected to a local
authority, all those years ago. Also, it is simply a statement of fact
that the proportion of revenue raised locally by business rates over a
period of time, has gone down, whereas the revenue rates via other
streams&#151;council tax being one, grants from a generous central
Government being another&#151;have gone up. What we heard from the
LGA and the evidence from other people was that there is now a healthy
relationship with businesses&#151;one of partnership with local
authorities&#151;and we want to engender that and make the
relationship continue. This is one mechanism, one tool in the toolkit,
for doing so.</div>
<a name="09012252000028"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
291</b><b class="B"><a name="09012252000190"></a>Robert
Neill:</b> Against that background, is the Minister going to
bring forward proposals to enable local authorities to have an
incentive to grow their business tax
base?</div><a name="09012252000029"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Healey:</b></i> Yes. Such an incentive&#151;local authority
business growth incentive&#151;has been in place for the past three
years, including this current financial year. As you will know, there
are plans from next year to reintroduce that, not as a one-off grant
scheme over three years, which is what the first LABGI scheme was, but
to build that in as an integral part of the design of the business rate
system. It seems right to us to provide 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column82" />Column number: 82</div>both an incentive and some sort of reward to local authorities that take
steps to foster their business base and promote business growth in
their
area.</div><a name="09012252000030"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
292</b><a name="09012252000191"></a><b class="B">Dan
Rogerson</b> (North Cornwall) (LD): I echo the hon. Member for
Bromley and Chislehurst and the Minister, Mrs. Dean, in
welcoming you to the Chair. I look forward to your chairmanship as we
go through consideration of the
Bill.</div><a name="09012252000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having listened
carefully to what the Minister has had to say, I will start by asking
the key purpose of the Bill: Crossrail or a wider power for local
authorities?</div><a name="09012252000032"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Healey:</b></i> The key purpose is the latest in a series of
measures reflecting the analysis and conclusions drawn by Sir Michael
Lyons that local authorities could benefit from greater scope to raise
revenue at the margins in their local area, particularly to support
business, economic development and the general long-term economic
future of their area. That is the policy purpose.</div>
<a name="09012252000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I said
earlier, Crossrail happens to be a large project and the project most
fully developed for which a BRS can form an essential element of the
funding package. The Bill therefore both provides a framework for a
BRS, which the Mayor has made clear will be used in London to support
the Crossrail funding package, and rightly gives that same power and
opportunity to local authorities across the country. As I said earlier,
what is good enough for London is good enough for the rest of the
country.</div><a name="09012252000034"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
293</b><b class="B"><a name="09012252000192"></a>Dan
Rogerson:</b> You talked about various parties&#146; support
for the principle behind the Bill. I should take this opportunity to
clarify the position of my own party: we are not opposed to the
principle of a BRS where the business community has agreed to it
through a ballot. We have been keen to point out that principle and
will no doubt want to explore it further as we go through Committee. On
that issue, why is there no provision for a ballot in all cases and why
has a threshold&#151;a cut-off point&#151;been inserted in the
Bill?</div>
<a name="09012252000035"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Healey:</b></i> For these reasons, I think. The BRS is unlike
business improvement districts, for which there is a ballot in all
cases; we can explore that in a moment. Unlike a BID, a BRS is designed
to apply across a wider area, bringing wider benefit, often for
longer-term projects, which may be beyond the immediate self-interest
of the businesses that contribute towards BID-style funding. As with
Crossrail, in any potential BRS-supported project we can expect to see
different funding elements reflecting the wider interests that may
benefit; therefore council tax payers may play a part, as may the
national taxpayer through Government grant&#151;just as in
Crossrail&#151;because of those wider
benefits.</div><a name="09012252000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
the case is to be made for a ballot in all circumstances, the principal
question must be, is it right that business should have a vote and a
veto in all cases, when the funding comes from other sources as well as
a BRS, the benefits are much wider and there is a will to see that
funding and development go ahead? Is it right to enable business to
block projects to which its funding contribution may account for a
quarter, a tenth, or even a negligible proportion of the total? Through
the conduct of a ballot, business potentially has the vote and the veto
over such projects going ahead.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column83" />Column number: 83</div><a name="09012252000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have taken the view that that is not right. The all-party
Conservative-led LGA, as you will know, takes the view that there
should be no requirement to ballot&#151;that it should be left to the
discretion of local authorities. We have taken the concerns of business
very seriously and believe there should be some safeguards, which is
why we are proposing in the Bill that where the BRS forms more than a
third of the funding of any project, and in those circumstances alone,
business should have a vote and should, therefore, potentially be in a
position to block not just the introduction of a BRS, but the whole
project.</div><a name="09012252000038"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
296</b><a name="09012252000195"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Mark Field</b> (Cities of London and Westminster) (Con): In a
moment or two, I may come back to the subject of Crossrail. However, my
fundamental question is: has consideration been given to a de
minimis-type provision to ensure that the additionality issue can
successfully be countered? We heard mixed views in the evidence on
Tuesday. Some groups were firmly against the Bill, while others were
broadly positive and could see where the Government were coming
from.</div><a name="09012252000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">Crossrail
slightly clouds the whole issue, in that it is a practical proposition,
on the table, for a &#163;16 billion or &#163;17 billion project,
and everyone can see that benefits are to be gained from such a
large-scale project, which could not be funded from the normal
day-to-day business rates in London. Obviously, the question is: how
far does the benefit go? Certain London boroughs&#151;the Barnets and
the Bromleys of this world in particular&#151;feel that they will get
little direct benefit, because of the artificial way in which the
boundaries in London are
created.</div><a name="09012252000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">Looking
at future projects, one of the things that could be most corrosive to
the case for the measure would be if relatively small-scale
infrastructure improvements, which one would generally think should be
paid for out of normal rates, were subject to a BRS surcharge. Has
thought therefore been given to precisely what sort of projects it
should cover, and indeed in what sort of area? London is a city of 7
million souls. Are we looking to give the power to relatively small
areas, where there might be only a couple of hundred thousand 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column84" />Column number: 84</div>residents? What is the thinking on how to counter the idea that, in many
ways, this is another stealth tax against
business?</div><a name="09012252000045"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Khan:</b></i> The concern that you articulate is one that we
recognise. If you look at the history&#151;the consultation that
Lyons undertook and the Select Committee&#146;s investigation and our
response&#151;you will see that we recognise the need for
additionality. By definition, this is supplementary&#151;it is a
business rate supplement. If you look at the Bill, you will see that we
try to make it clear we envisage the BRS helping to finance projects
that would otherwise not take place. That is crucial, and there are
safeguards. For that reason it is upper-tier authorities, such as the
GLA, that are tasked with using the
power.</div><a name="09012252000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is one of the reasons why Tuesday was so frustrating. There seems to be
a lack of understanding of the difference between purposes envisaged
for BIDs and for BRS. They are tools at the disposal of local
communities, one more local and designed for micro-level than the
other; one more long-term than the other, which is for a finite period
of five years; one that will benefit short-term occupants and one that
will benefit long-term occupants plus property owners; one that will,
by definition, benefit a small community, and one that will benefit
wider communities. Barnet and Bromley may not directly see the benefits
of Crossrail, but all the expert advice is that there will be 110,000
jobs, and many people in Bromley and Barnet may get some of those
jobs.</div><a name="09012252000047"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012252000196"></a>Robert
Neill:</b> Bromley benefits hugely from
Crossrail.</div><a name="09012252000048"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Khan:</b></i> Because they have a great MP, who will, I am
sure, support the Bill on Report and Third Reading, as well as in this
Committee. That is one of the differences. One of the frustrations,
Mark, is that it seems to us that people have not understood what BRS
is planned for. I know that one of your questions will be about the
borrowing part of Crossrail and whether that could happen without
guarantees of an income stream coming in. That is the frustrating
thing. When you have a long-term project with different funding
streams, you need certainty. If there was a potential veto, which is
what this sword of Damocles wielded by businesses would be, do we
honestly think that the other income streams would come in? That is one
of the real questions that you and other Opposition Members will need
to grapple with in Committee, on Report and at Third
Reading.</div><a name="09012252000049"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Healey:</b></i> If I may say so, Mr. Field, you
are right to have this concern and you are right that it has been
reflected to us by witnesses who have given evidence. However, I think
that you are wrong to say that Crossrail clouds the issue. I think it
helps to clarify the approach. It is a developed project. It shows us
the principles on which we would expect a business rate supplement to
work elsewhere. In other words, the business rate supplement that will
form part of Crossrail&#146;s funding is not substitute funding for
other things that are already being undertaken. That is in the Bill and
is part of the prohibition. It will be fleshed out in guidance.
Secondly, the BRS provides an additional source of funding without
which Crossrail will not go ahead.</div>
<a name="09012252000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">In relation
to any project in any other part of the country where the BRS may form
part of the funding package, we will look for that to be spelt out very

<div class="Column"><a name="Column85" />Column number: 85</div>clearly. As in Crossrail, it must form an additional element of the
funding package without which the project would either be in jeopardy,
or definitely held in the starting gates. Crossrail helps us to see how
a business rate supplement should
operate.</div><a name="09012252000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me say, Mrs. Dean, that to help the Committee, before we sit
next week, I intend to produce the draft of guidance for consultation
and for the Committee&#146;s comments on how to deal with matters
like additionality, economic development, definitions and some of the
other aspects that are central to the proposition of a business rate
supplement.</div><a name="09012252000052"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
297</b><b class="B"><a name="09012252000197"></a>Mr.
Field:</b> I appreciate that you do not necessarily want to
have a totally inflexible arrangement, but could you give at least an
indication of the size of the projects you have in mind? Crossrail is
probably going to be one of the very biggest and most expensive
projects in the foreseeable future and in the first 20 years in which
this Bill will operate. Some &#163;3.25 billion will be raised from a
large net of businesses that happen to be in the capital for a project
that will cost &#163;17 billion&#151;obviously, we will only see in
the outturn just how much it does cost. No one would dispute what you
said: the mechanism of a BRS works for a project of that magnitude.
Clearly some businesses and business organisations will be against the
idea of a BRS as a matter of principle, but those who are open minded
about the prospect will think that Crossrail clearly falls into the box
and that this is
appropriate.</div><a name="09012252000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
concern is this. Take a higher-tier authority such as a unitary
authority in Luton or Swindon where  there was a rail or
metro-type project costing perhaps &#163;200 million, with a business
contribution of &#163;50 million. You are then in the grey area with
people saying, &#147;Hang on a second, this is what we pay our
general rates for. This is an ongoing project. To get a BRS is a slap
in the face and another stealth tax.&#148; Could such a project be
the subject of a BRS, or is it too small? Are you comfortable with the
idea that if a local authority and other stakeholders proposed it, it
could be subject to a BRS-type scheme?</div>
<a name="09012252000054"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Healey:</b></i> It is a question of relative scale. Crossrail
is a special project by dint of its large scale. The BRS element is
significant, largely because the capacity across the 32 boroughs of
Greater London means that they could raise &#163;178 million a
year&#151;that is what the latest figures suggest. Compare that with
an area closer to home: in Northamptonshire, the potential total from a
BRS is &#163;9 million and in Shropshire it is &#163;1.8 million.
Such sums could be equally essential elements of funding a large-scale,
long-term investment project in those counties, which would be unlikely
to go ahead without that contribution, but would clearly be far smaller
than Crossrail because of the nature of London and of the project
itself. In principle, it is a difference of scale and relative figures
rather then character that makes Crossrail unique and, therefore, a
special case warranting special treatment within the provisions of the
Bill.</div>

<a name="09012252000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">On a serious
level, with Crossrail we are talking about relatively small chunks of
money&#151;a fifth of the overall funding package. We have gone
through the long rigmarole of getting the hybrid Bill through
Parliament and the Standing Committee. Crossrail is now one of those
big infrastructure projects that we should obviously move on with
fairly quickly if we are going to pump-prime in a Keynesian way,
particularly given the difficulties in the London and south-east
economy. There are already parcels of money&#151;over 80 per cent. of
the total budget&#151;so are you saying that we could not go ahead
and find a way of squirreling out a further 18 or 19 per cent. without
the
Bill?</div><a name="09012252000059"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John

taxpayer pays more&#151;they are already going to contribute a bigger

local taxpayers of London do more of the heavy lifting. If you are
proposing that alternative, I, and the taxpayers in London, will be
interested to hear about it.</div>

Wharf Group, but has also said that it will try to squirrel out a
further &#163;150 million from various City connections.
That will be a rather harder exercise today than it might have been a
couple of years ago, but obviously we do not know how things will pan
out. It is not as if all elements of the package are entirely robust
and in place.</div>
<a name="09012252000063"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John

said:</div><a name="09012252000159"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Crossrail
is absolutely crucial in keeping London and the UK globally competitive
and for this reason we are delighted to support the funding of this

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
302</b><b class="B"><a name="09012252000202"></a>Mr.
Field:</b> I do not disagree, but I am trying to get to the
bottom of it and it is important that it not be used simply as a
political football. All sides want to get Crossrail moving. By
questioning elements of it, we are doing our bit to try to scrutinise
it on behalf of business, which is concerned about additionally. In
fairness, there is less concern in London about how the project will
work, although I cannot speak for all the suburban areas. A lot of
businesses will regard the additionally as another stealth
tax&#151;little parcels with bids.</div>
<a name="09012252000065"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Khan:</b></i> Under the terms of the statutory consultation
required, a local authority would need to persuade businesses that it
had exhausted all other avenues of funding and state what other income
streams there are 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column87" />Column number: 87</div>and what its plans are, and it would have to persuade businesses to
join. Some almost pejorative comments were made about consultation by
witnesses on Tuesday, but let us be clear that there is a statutory
requirement to consult. Forget the ballot, which is stage 2 of
consultation if it is more than one third. Consultation would iron out
some of the problems you have identified. If businesses felt that they
were being made to pay a stealth tax, that would come out during the
process, and if a local authority still steamrolled ahead, it could be
challenged. As John has just said, we will be publishing the full first
session, which should hopefully assure you that this is not a backroom
way of turning business into a cash
cow.</div><a name="09012252000066"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
303</b><a name="09012252000203"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Neil Turner</b> (Wigan) (Lab): I wonder whether we could take
a more national look at things and remember that we are a national
Parliament, rather than an extension of the LGA. One of the witnesses
from the LGA&#151;I think that it was the independent
representative&#151;suggested that the lower-tier authority should
decide that, rather than the upper-tier authority. Would you give us
your comments on that, with regard to two-tier authority areas,
obviously?</div><a name="09012252000067"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Healey:</b></i> There are two things to consider. First, with
regard to business rate supplements, we are doing something that is
different in several respects from business improvement districts. BIDs
are a power for billing authorities&#151;in two-tier areas, districts
rather than counties have the capacity to introduce them if they
wish.</div>
<a name="09012252000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
because the projects to which we will restrict the potential use of
business rate supplements are generally larger scale and longer term,
it will be the larger authorities that are likely to be in a position
to develop and see delivered projects of that scale, for which the BRS
may form a part. That is why we have taken the view that it should be
available to upper-tier authorities only. Also, we resisted the view of
the LGA, which, after all, represents authorities of all levels, that
all authorities should have the power to raise their business rate
supplement. We took the view that it would be complicated, uncertain
and to a degree unfair on businesses if they were open to a potential
business rate supplement levied by both their district and county
councils.</div><a name="09012252000069"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.

do so under the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">

be.</div><a name="09012252000072"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
305</b><b class="B"><a name="09012252000205"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> Can I give you a couple of examples of areas in
which a BRS might be considered by the authorities? The first example
is the second Mersey crossing, in the constituency of my hon. Friend
the Member for Halton. I have no idea whether they are thinking of
using the BRS. Greater Manchester had a bid that was recently voted
down, and there was a meeting this week to decide how we go forward to
address the transport problems in Manchester. In London, there is an
overall authority, the Greater London authority, which is the upper
tier. In Manchester, we have 10 district authorities. If we
were to put in a bid for a transport project in Manchester that was
similar to Crossrail, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column88" />Column number: 88</div>would the Greater Manchester authority or the passenger transport
authority be considered the upper-tier authority, or would it be the 10
district
authorities?</div><a name="09012252000073"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Healey:</b></i> It would be each of the 10 district
authorities, all of which have the scope to consider a business rate
supplement either on their own or in combination with other
authorities, which is perfectly possible. I pay tribute to the way
those 10 authorities in Manchester have worked so closely together for
a long time. They could combine to propose a business rate supplement
as part of a project that was Manchester-wide, bringing those wide and
long-term benefits to the wider city area. Latest figures suggest that,
if they chose to do so, they could raise up to &#163;29 million from
the business rate supplement each year.</div>
<a name="09012252000074"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
306</b><b class="B"><a name="09012252000206"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> But do you appreciate that it would be difficult
to persuade some of the outer local authorities? Wigan is the only one
that does not have a border with the city of Manchester, but there are
others on the outer fringes that may not see an immediate benefit from
the package, which would mainly affect the centre of the sub-regional
area. It would make it difficult for them to get approval for a BRS
bid.</div>
<a name="09012252000075"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Healey:</b></i> Well, Mr. Turner, you know
Manchester and the dynamics between the 10 authorities much better than
I do. That may or may not be the case. If it is the case, it is part of
the challenge within Manchester of considering to what extent support
should be given for a project that can carry the case for a business
rate supplement in Manchester.</div>
<a name="09012252000076"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
307</b><b class="B"><a name="09012252000207"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> Let me return to something that Mr.
Rogerson said. He seemed to indicate that if a ballot by businesses
went against the BRS, it would not result in a veto although it would
be a major part of the consultation process. Can you confirm whether
that is true, and whether you envisage a BRS ballot taking place and
businesses turning it down and voting against the proposal? Under those
circumstances, can you see the BRS going forward?</div>
<a name="09012252000077"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Healey:</b></i> No. If a ballot is required and the
businesses that are eligible to vote do so against the proposition, it
would stop the proposal for a business rates supplement dead in the
tracks. Members of the Committee must be clear about that. In the end,
that is the nature of a vote. A vote gives the potential for a veto and
would potentially allow businesses to block the use of a BRS, and
therefore the development of any project that depends on that
funding.</div>
<a name="09012252000078"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
308</b><b class="B"><a name="09012252000208"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> Thank you for clarifying that. That was my
understanding, but Mr. Rogerson&#146;s questions seemed to
indicate that there was some doubt about it. I am very unhappy, or
uncomfortable, with the idea of a double vote. People who work in or
own businesses have a vote as citizens. I am not comfortable with them
having a second vote as part of a business. I am certainly not happy
with the idea that they could veto a project. That is just a
comment.</div>
<a name="09012252000079"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Healey:</b></i> I accept that. That argument has been put to
us by some parts of the local government field. In the end, when
framing this legislation we took the view that business has
understandable concerns about the prospect of a business rate
supplement. That is why 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column89" />Column number: 89</div>there is a series of safeguards in the Bill, including the 2p limit on
how much can be raised through a BRS. In our view, where there is a
case for doing so, a ballot should be held. Other safeguards attempt to
strike a balance between what are inevitably different views about the
proposition, and different interests regarding how it might operate if
it goes ahead.</div>
<a name="09012252000080"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Khan:</b></i> On that point, on Tuesday Derek asked some
questions that reminded us what life was like in the &#146;70s and
&#146;80s regarding the relationship between local authorities and
businesses. We are trying to walk a tightrope while ensuring that the
productive and good partnership&#151;this
discipline&#151;continues. It is about listening to the two extremes
that we heard on Tuesday and trying to find a
compromise.</div>

309</b><b class="B"><a name="09012252000209"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> I do understand that. However, a scheme that needs
to go ahead and is seen as important by most citizens could be voted
for by them through the normal electoral process and then vetoed by
somebody who has a second vote. I am uncomfortable with that, but I
understand the point that was made.</div>
<a name="09012252000082"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.

catch.</div><a name="09012252000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
was interested to learn that business men in a given area have a vote,
although they might not live in the area. That seems an odd concept. In
Manchester, many business men live in Cheshire and have no input into
the local government decision making in Manchester. We must bear that
in mind. I wish to question the use of money. Mr. Khan said
that people have not understood what BRS is for. That is partly because
the Bill is unclear about its purpose. It is not sure whether it is to
finance Crossrail or whether the local government element for the rest
of the country has been added on as a way in which to raise extra
revenue.</div><a name="09012252000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am particularly concerned about what seems to be a lack of clarity with
regard to a period for which a BRS runs for longer than one year. My
first question, therefore, is could a BRS be used to supplement private
finance initiative
schemes?</div><a name="09012252000087"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John

312</b><b class="B"><a name="09012252000213"></a>Mr.
Binley:</b> It could. That is as I thought from reading
schedule 1. There is nothing to say that it could not be a PFI scheme.
How does that impact on the length of time, when a PFI scheme could be
committing a business for 15 or 20 years?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column90" />Column number: 90</div><a name="09012252000091"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Healey:</b></i> Quite comfortably, if that were the decision.
There is no time limit in the legislation on the length of time that a
BRS might run, but in any plans set out in a formal prospectus for the
project for which a BRS may be a proposed part of the funding, the
period for which a BRS is proposed to run would have to be spelt out.
The flexibility under the Bill would allow, if other sources of funding
from whatever source were perhaps designed to support the development
and cost of a project over 20 years, the BRS to run for 20 years. The
Mayor made it clear in his evidence to us that he expects the BRS in
London for Crossrail to run for 24 years. He and the GLA
have the flexibility to propose a BRS for London in order to support
Crossrail throughout that 24-year
period.</div><a name="09012252000092"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
313</b><b class="B"><a name="09012252000214"></a>Mr.
Binley:</b> So a business in a given area might find itself
committed to an extra taxation of that kind for 20 years. What
assessment have you done of the impact on fair trade in relation to
that? How does it impact on a business man with one particular business
in Manchester that has a 20-year commitment to a PFI scheme and a
business in Yorkshire that does not? How does it impact on fair trade?
You are increasing costs for one business, and not for the
other.</div><a name="09012252000093"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Healey:</b></i> I accept that general proposition. Part of
the assessment of the impact, the potential costs and the potential
benefits of the project with a BRS component that may be proposed in an
area will have to be prepared and set out publicly in the prospectus
and formally consulted upon. That will be the economic analysis and
assessment that a local authority, with others, will need to undertake
as part of the preparation of the case for a BRS. They would take such
a factor into account for their

314</b><b class="B"><a name="09012252000215"></a>Mr.
Binley:</b> Let me pursue that a little further. Transport
clearly falls within the remit of a
BRS.</div><a name="09012252000095"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John

transport infrastructure investment may well be the type of project
that an area considers could be a good use of a
BRS.</div><a name="09012252000096"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
315</b><b class="B"><a name="09012252000216"></a>Mr.
Binley:</b> So the benefit&#151;the return to a
business&#151;could be quite dubious, depending on the type of
infrastructure, and bearing it in mind that the PFI
contribution might only be 10 per cent. of the whole, but still a
sizeable
commitment.</div><a name="09012252000097"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Healey:</b></i> Let us put it this way and use Crossrail as
the example to clarify rather than cloud the situation. The business
benefit to many of the businesses in London may be long
term&#151;that is generally regarded as well established&#151;but
may not be immediately apparent on their bottom line in 2010: for
instance, when the introduction of BRS in London is proposed. That is
one of the principal differences with business improvement districts.
To that extent, with the immediate levy on the business rates for a
BID&#151;to produce trees in the street, extra street cleaning, CCTVs
or some community police constables in the area&#151;the immediate
benefit and potential impact on the business bottom line is arguably
more direct.</div>
<a name="09012252000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">What marks
out the BIDs from the business rate supplement is the sort of activity
or project that they are likely to support and the time scales over
which they are likely to run. That is the reason, to come back to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column91" />Column number: 91</div>your original starting point, why there is no time limit on BRS in the
Bill&#151;that will need to be set out in the
prospectus&#151;whereas for business improvement districts there is a
time limit of five years, although some are shorter, after which, if
the project wants to continue, there has to be a fresh consultation and
a fresh mandate to do
so.</div><a name="09012252000099"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012252000217"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Mr. Turner, did you indicate that you
have a short, follow-on
question?</div><a name="09012252000100"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012252000218"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> I just have a short point to make. Mr.
Binley raised the issue of people in Cheshire with businesses in
Greater Manchester who would not have had the vote. I make the point
that it is the people of Greater Manchester who would have been paying
the Greater Manchester Passenger Transport Executive precept, so it is
a question of no representation without
taxation.</div><a name="09012252000101"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
316</b><a name="09012252000219"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Nick Raynsford</b> (Greenwich and Woolwich) (Lab): May I
change the focus of the questioning slightly&#151;to the issue that
came up once or twice during our evidence sessions on Tuesday? The
issue is freeloading and the position of landowners as against tenants,
and it has been around since the introduction of BIDs, when concern was
expressed that landowners would get the benefit without having to make
a contribution. That applies even more so in the case of BRS, because
the benefits, as you have been rightly emphasising, are likely to be
longer term, whereas the payments, as with Crossrail, begin long before
the benefits will be perceived. The tenants will, essentially, be
paying the levy, while the landowners will get a benefit further down
the line without having to make a contribution, unless they do so
voluntarily.</div><a name="09012252000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
problem is not new, but it is a real one, which will lead to a certain
amount of resentment on the part of some elements in the business
community if a solution is not found at some stage. I am not suggesting
that it is required immediately, but the issue has to be addressed. I
would very much welcome your
views.</div><a name="09012252000103"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Healey:</b></i> There are perhaps two aspects here, and no
one sitting in Committee understands or knows them better than you,
Mr. Raynsford. On property owners, the issue was confronted
by you and the House with the introduction of legislation for BIDs.
There is a practical difficulty in identifying, levying and enforcing
any compulsory levy on property owners, many of whom may well not be
based in this country anyway. By and large, as we heard from the
representative of British BIDs on Tuesday, with the BIDs that have been
put in place, there is a problem&#151;she was very clear about
that&#151;but, generally, they have found workarounds that are
satisfactory in those local areas.</div>
<a name="09012252000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">You made the
point that, because of the long time scales of BRS-related projects,
the problem is likely to be greater. In fact, the economic modelling
that has been done suggests the opposite. In other words, if the time
scale is 20 or 25 years instead of three or five years, as with BIDs,
work done by Cambridge Econometrics suggests that, where the costs of a
business occupier rise due to a business rate supplement, its capacity
to pay certain levels of rent will be reduced, and the likelihood 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column92" />Column number: 92</div>that those costs will be passed to the property owner or the landlord is
increased by the long time span. You might say that that is a question
of economic modelling and that it depends on the assumptions
made&#151;we all know that economics assume everything except
responsibility. It does not get away from the practical problems that
you raise, or the perceptions that inevitably are created where it is
the occupier or the tenant, rather than the owner and the landlord, who
may be liable for a BRS. Having looked at the matter closely, however,
it is not apparent that there is an easier or more obvious way of
dealing with it than there was when you and the House looked at this
same problem, with the introduction of business improvement
districts.</div>
<a name="09012252000105"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
317</b><b class="B"><a name="09012252000220"></a>Mr.
Raynsford:</b> I entirely understand that, which is why I did
not press for an instant solution, but I do believe that the issue will
not go away. It will return, partly because the approach adopted in the
case of Crossrail has broadly mirrored that of BIDs. There have been
voluntary contributions from some business elements, which will get
large immediate benefits because stations adjoining their premises will
give them a considerable additional market. A similar pattern is
emerging with BRS as with BIDs&#151;of voluntary contributions from
some, and the levy paid by all those who are liable&#151;but that
still leaves scope for some beneficiaries to choose not to make a
voluntary contribution, while benefiting enormously, which will lead to
resentment within the business community.</div>
<a name="09012252000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">While I
accept entirely your long-term economic argument, I am reminded of John
Maynard Keynes&#146; famous phrase:</div>
<a name="09012252000160"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
the long run we are all
dead.&#148;</div><a name="09012252000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
business that is facing financial difficulty and might go out of
business in the next five years would not be terribly impressed by the
argument that its long-term ability to negotiate a lower rent with its
landlord might be helped by paying the business rate supplement. May I
ask you to respond to that? Might there be scope to explore ways in
which that particular problem might be addressed in the longer
term?</div>
<a name="09012252000108"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Healey:</b></i> In general terms, in framing the BRS
legislation we have been keen to draw what we can from the BIDs model.
In our discussion and examination already we have been keen to draw
what we can from Crossrail, as a forerunner project in this field. It
may well be that we should encourage such an approach, through
guidance, for any BRS-related projects that may be developed in other
areas. I shall certainly look at that.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
318</b><b class="B"><a name="09012252000221"></a>Mr.
Raynsford:</b> May I move to the interrelation between the BRS
and BIDs? There is a nervousness on the part of some BID companies that
the arrival of a BRS may prejudice their prospects of securing a
renewal of the BID mandate. We heard that in evidence from British BIDs
on Tuesday. I fully understand the steps that the Government have
taken, particularly the options for mitigating the impact of a BRS.
However, I would be grateful for your thoughts on whether anything else
might be done to overcome that problem, particularly if it appears that
the number of new BIDs falls off after the introduction of a BRS, or a
number of existing BIDs cease to operate because they failed to get a
mandate.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column93" />Column number: 93</div><a name="09012252000110"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Healey:</b></i> As you say, within the Bill there is
provision for BIDs payers to be exempted from any BRS. There is
obviously scope for local authorities to offer discounts, as well, in
relation to any BIDs payers. No doubt we will consider that closely in
Committee.</div><a name="09012252000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
difficulty at the heart of the matter is one of principle. But
if we consider the situation in London, where the Mayor has been clear
that he does not propose to exempt BIDs payers from the BRS, we would
have to say to those who would propose that, &#147;What is the basis
for exempting a business in the Angel, Islington, or in the town centre
of Kingston?&#148; Both of those areas have small, localised BIDs
areas designed to improve, say, the street signs, the trees or the
police community support officers who patrol that area. What is the
principled case for such businesses, which contribute to the local,
immediate and practical upgrades of their areas, to be exempted somehow
from making the same contribution towards Crossrail as other companies,
despite the fact that they, like businesses generally in London, stand
to gain from it in the long term? The benefits of Crossrail are
entirely different from those arising from their BIDs contributions. At
the heart of the matter there is a principled case, as well as a
practical concern, that needs to be
established.</div><a name="09012252000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
our view, rather than trying to legislate for that, we have given the
local areas the proper discretion and flexibility to be able to take
local circumstances into account and, if it is appropriate, have given
them powers in the Bill to exempt or vary the levy for those already
paying the
BID.</div><a name="09012252000113"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Khan:</b></i> The interesting thing about your question is
that we know that, across the country, approximately 80 per cent. of
mandates are successful regarding BIDs. There is an interesting piece
of work that would answer your question about whether there is any
evidence. In respect of 2015, for argument&#146;s sake, we could look
at an analysis of the Crossrail-affected area of London and see what
percentage of the BIDs&#151;in 2010, to start off with&#151;had a
positive mandate. Then we might look forward five years to 2015 and see
whether there is a curve going downwards or whether it has stayed the
same. That would answer your question about whether your fear is real
or is a
theory.</div><a name="09012252000114"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Healey:</b></i> Just to reassure you, Mr.
Raynsford, we highly prize business improvement districts, as do the
67 areas that have introduced them. We do not want to see
them damaged. Where there is a case and a will to see them continue, or
to be established, we want to encourage that. So we take seriously the
concerns coming from some BIDs areas and from Dr. Grail, who gave
evidence to the Committee on Tuesday, but at present we think that
probably the best approach is the one set out in the Bill as a
flexibility to be able to deal with those circumstances through local
decisions and through the consultation that will, inevitably, have to
play a part in the
process.</div><a name="09012252000115"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
319</b><a name="09012252000222"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Lee Scott</b> (Ilford, North) (Con): I am a great fan of BIDs.
One of the great successes of the scheme is that the businesses feel
directly involved and they vote on it. We launched a new BID proposal
in my area only two weeks ago, and it is a much harder sell now than it
was last year and it will, perhaps, be harder still in a few
years&#146; time. Because the businesses had the ultimate say about a
BID, they were able to buy into it. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column94" />Column number: 94</div>Are you concerned that, because people will not have the ultimate say,
they will not be brought into the process in the same way? Are you
concerned, or
not?</div><a name="09012252000116"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Khan:</b></i> The beauty of BIDs is that you see the fruits
within a short period of time. You can see a tangible benefit within
months. That is short period of time&#151;five years
maximum&#151;so you can see what has happened locally. I can see that
there will be an issue in respect of persuading businesses to look
slightly beyond the horizon with regard to the fruits further down the
road. But that is why, without being complacent, we do not think that
there is a conflict between BIDs and BRS: they are for different
purposes. Mark has touched on some of the history with Crossrail,
including some of the steps that we have gone through and some of the
benefits that will lie just outside his
constituency.</div><a name="09012252000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">BIDs
and BRS are different things. But the problem with your argument is
that it only works if you assume that statutory consultation is
meaningless. We do not think that it is. We think that businesses will
be involved at an early stage. If an authority has got animus from all
the businesses, forget about the authority not going through with it;
other sources of income will say, &#147;Sod this, it is just not
worth having it.&#148; You have seen the ambition from outside London
articulated this morning, and we share
that.</div><a name="09012252000118"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
320</b><b class="B"><a name="09012252000223"></a>Mr.
Scott:</b> Okay. I take on board the fact that you are saying
that businesses will be involved and that they will be consulted in the
same way for BIDs, but that they will not have an ultimate decision in
the same way for
BIDs.</div><a name="09012252000119"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Khan:</b></i> Well, they would if more than a third of the
funding comes from business rates as well. They will be involved in
statutory consultation. The prospectus will go out. If more than a
third of the funding comes from business rates, there will be a ballot
as well. You should make sure that the prospectus is transparent, clear
and lucid about the plans.</div>
<a name="09012252000120"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
321</b><b class="B"><a name="09012252000224"></a>Mr.
Scott:</b> But you do, I am sure, share some of my concerns
that the business community might be somewhat sceptical about
consultation in that, in the past, businesses have been consulted on
things and not necessarily agreed with them, but they have still gone
ahead. There would be that level of scepticism. Do you agree that it
will be vitally important how the deal is sold, and how they can be
convinced not be sceptical about
it?</div><a name="09012252000121"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Khan:</b></i> That is really important. That is why we are
pleased that it is not controlled from Whitehall. We are devolving down
a power to local authorities to work with the communities they know
best to carry it through. That is why it is for local
authorities&#151;upper-tier ones&#151;that know their businesses
better than us to decide what is best for their communities. I am sure
that the businesses will have a good relationship because it will
affect those businesses with a rateable value of more than
&#163;50,000 a year. We would therefore expect those businesses to
have a dialogue or relationship with local authorities, and we hope
that that dialogue would take place long before plans were materialised
for a massive infrastructure
project.</div><a name="09012252000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">You
will know about the discussions that have taken place during the past
two decades between large businesses, those responsible in London and
the Government. That has 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column95" />Column number: 95</div>meant that no one can say that they did not know about Crossrail. We
would not expect a 20-year lead-in with regard to the next major
project, but we would expect conversations and discussions to take
place. Is that not consultation? We think that it is. It is a two-way
process. Do you need a ballot at every stage of the process? We do not
think so. We think that that would be a bureaucratic nightmare. We,
like you, are in favour of reducing bureaucracy and red
tape.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
322</b><a name="09012252000225"></a><b class="B">Derek
Twigg</b> (Halton) (Lab): I just want to pursue two points.
First, I do not want to labour the London-centric view. I was the
Minister when the Crossrail Bill was drafted. I therefore understand
the strong arguments for it, and I remember the many months of hard
work to get it into a state to go forward. Relatively speaking, it is
not as though there are not equally important projects. I understand
that we are not talking about a &#163;16 billion or &#163;17
billion project, but relatively speaking such projects are essential
for certain areas of the country. I was interested that the CBI
evidence said that, in one sense, the principal view was that there
must be a vote, but that that will be overlooked for Crossrail. It had
no view about what the balance of funding should be in terms of local
government and central Government for what is happening in local
authority areas, although it is opposed to localisation. That is a
bizarre
view.</div><a name="09012252000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall give a good example. My hon. Friend the Member for Wigan made the
point that, in my constituency, the second Mersey crossing&#151;a
project of about &#163;600 million&#151;will be part
paid for by the Government and tolls. It is just about to go to a
public inquiry. By the way, the previous Government refused to approve
it. This Government have approved it. It might have been an ideal
candidate for the measure if that was in place then. The project would
not just benefit Halton, but the whole of Merseyside and Cheshire,
which is why all the local authorities support it. A lot of the drive
to get it off the ground was from local business because it was so
important. Do you have any comments on that before I go on to the next
point?</div><a name="09012252000125"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Healey:</b></i> You are absolutely right. For me, there is no
difference in principle or in practice between Crossrail and other big
projects that may be appropriate for a BRS. Some of the transport
projects that you will know about very well, Mr. Twigg,
having served as a Transport Minister, also require private or hybrid
Bills in this Parliament, so they may well have legislation behind
them. They may be smaller in gross terms, but their relative importance
and relative investment for an area outside London may be similar to
Crossrail.</div><a name="09012252000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
for the second Mersey crossing, if a legislative requirement were in
place and if the will and other sources of funding are available, the
BRS in future may play a part in allowing it to go ahead. It may well
be that your council&#146;s capacity to raise over &#163;1 million
through a BRS in your area alone, or Cheshire&#146;s capacity to
raise &#163;8 million each year from a BRS, could form, as it does
across London, an important element of making that go
ahead.</div><a name="09012252000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
such circumstances, to come back to the ballot side of things, if
Parliament has considered and approved any necessary legislation, if
there is a will to go ahead, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column96" />Column number: 96</div>certainly from local authorities, but also from local business, and if
the potential BRS element forms a relatively small part&#151;let us
say less than a third; perhaps a quarter, a fifth or a tenth&#151;it
seems to me wrong rather than right that business should have a vote
and a potential veto that could halt what would otherwise have quite
widespread support and what people would like to see go ahead. However,
it is right that any businesses that may be liable to pay a BRS be
properly involved in the development of the project&#151;the
prospectus&#151;and formally consulted on that, whether or not there
should be a ballot if they contribute more than a third of the total
project
cost.</div><a name="09012252000128"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
323</b><b class="B"><a name="09012252000226"></a>Derek
Twigg:</b> The second issue, which I have been asked to pursue
by a couple of people from the business sector, is local authorities
and the change in how they deliver economic development and take a
lead. It is clear that some things would just not happen in a number of
areas unless the local authority showed the initiative in making them
happen; would the Minister agree? As he knows, the former chief
executive of my local council of Halton, who is now chief executive of
the Minister&#146;s local authority, was employed specifically by
Halton to lead on economic development, because of his background in
that. That is a reasoned decision, to have someone like that in such a
position. I have not heard as much from the Opposition, but is it not
the case that the position of local authorities today in leading
economic development&#151;making sure that it happens in many
cases&#151;has changed completely over the past 10 or 15 years? That
is what we are doing in the Bill: recognising that and complementing
what councils are already doing. I know that my own area has an
excellent relationship between local business and the local authority,
but Halton has done some amazing work in economic
development.</div><a name="09012252000129"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Healey:</b></i> Indeed, and the chief executive you are
talking about, Michael Cuff, has brought a similar strength to the role
of my borough council, Rotherham council, in trying to support
developments in the local economy. He, like me, serves as a director of
our local chamber of commerce. The local authority now has relations
with the local business community and business organisations that are
light years away from the situation that typified local
authority-business relations 15 or 20 years ago. Thinking of
the situation in my own area, were there to be discussions about a
potentially big, long-term investment in which BRS may play a part,
that would be likely to be initiated around the local authority.
However, I have to say that the first place where it would be discussed
would be at the local strategic partnership, and that would be dealt
with by a board there that is chaired by one of our local business
figures. It would be discussed at a very early stage&#151;certainly
well before any of the preliminary work to produce a
prospectus&#151;with the chamber of commerce and others in business
in the
area.</div><a name="09012252000130"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
324</b><a name="09012252000227"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Philip Dunne</b> (Ludlow) (Con): I was struck by the evidence
of the Local Government Association into the proportion of BRSs that
might fall on publicly owned occupiers. I noted in your opening
remarks, Minister, that you very properly said that you were going to
listen to evidence and take account of it in the remaining proceedings
of the Committee. Have you 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column97" />Column number: 97</div>managed to give any thought to the comments of the LGA about the
potential for exempting buildings such as schools or hospitals from
such a
charge?</div><a name="09012252000131"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Healey:</b></i> We have considered that. The BRS legislation
here is built on the business rate system, which, you will know,
creates a liability for businesses of all types, with no exemption for
public sector operations from that liability. We have taken the same
approach to the business rate supplement.</div>
<a name="09012252000132"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
325</b><b class="B"><a name="09012252000228"></a>Mr.

326</b><b class="B"><a name="09012252000229"></a>Mr.
Dunne:</b><b class="B"> </b>I was also struck by the comment from the
representative of British BIDs that the reason why BIDs have been
widely taken up and regarded as successful by many of the businesses
participating is that business people who pay the tax are also involved
in the delivery of the project. What notice did you take of that
evidence and what have you done to consider some form of accountability
to business, which will be paying the
supplement?</div><a name="09012252000135"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Healey:</b></i> I was interested by that remark and, given
the sorts of activities that BIDs generally support, I can see that
that is sensible. It has a benefit and is easy to set up. I find it a
little more difficult to see how you would legislate to structure in
that sort of approach for, say, the development of the Crossrail
project, but we are open to suggestions. As I said, perhaps before you
were able to join us, before the scrutiny stages of our
Committee&#146;s work, I intend to produce draft guidance that will
deal with some of these problems. We may get views on that point as a
result of that
consultation.</div><a name="09012252000136"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
327</b><b class="B"><a name="09012252000230"></a>Mr.
Dunne:</b> I am pleased to hear that. I was present when you
made that announcement, which is
encouraging.</div><a name="09012252000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">My third
question relates to the interaction between the BRS and BIDs. The Bill
makes provision for voluntary offset on a case-by-case basis. Will you
clarify why you think that should be voluntary and not
mandatory?</div><a name="09012252000138"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Khan:</b></i> Mark gave some very good examples on Tuesday of
how one could envisage local authorities around London&#151;I will
put this as generously as I can&#151;deciding to come up with BIDs as
a way of not having to contribute towards the BRS. There is clearly an
question of mischief there, but it is also a way of not having funds
diverted to the BRS, which is the Mayor&#146;s plan. The Mayor has
told us quite forcefully that if he is going to guarantee the loans
that he wants via the BRS, he cannot have an opt-out for those
businesses that are involved in BIDs.</div>
<a name="09012252000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
third point to make is that BRS would apply only to those businesses
with a rateable value over &#163;50,000. The vast majority of
businesses involved with BIDs tend to be the smaller businesses which
can see the benefits immediately on their doorstep and on their street.
We hope that the overlap will be minimal, but also we are alive to the
fact that the Mayor has a serious point about being able to guarantee
moneys coming in each year via BRS.</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column98" />Column number: 98</div><a name="09012252000140"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Healey:</b></i> That is correct. I think in the end that they
are different. BIDs and BRS bring different benefits; they serve
different purposes; they raise different types of funding; and they
last over different terms. That is the view we have taken. It is the
view that we heard from the CBI and from British BIDs. It was
acknowledged by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors and it is
the view the Mayor takes, too. BIDs and BRS are
different.</div><a name="09012252000141"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
328</b><b class="B"><a name="09012252000231"></a>Mr.
Dunne:</b> I note that the annexe to the impact assessment
states:</div><a name="09012252000161"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;BRS
could be used to fund smaller, less expensive initiatives, such as
promoting an area to tourists, or for investment, or using the
supplement to provide skills
training.&#148;</div><a name="09012252000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those
are very much the sort of things that BIDs are currently used
for.</div><a name="09012252000143"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Healey:</b></i> I am not aware of BIDs being used for skills
training. The examples you quote from the associated documentation to
the Bill are simply illustrative of areas in which there may be
projects or investments related to economic development that could
therefore fall within the permissible parameters of the Bill for a
contribution from BRS. It would be for the local authority to make the
case for that type of investment if they wanted to base it on some form
of funding from a business rates
supplement.</div>
<a name="09012252000144"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
329</b><b class="B"><a name="09012252000232"></a>Mr.
Dunne:</b> I know that we are running out of time, so this is
my final question. The impact assessment&#151;which I must say is a
very thin document&#151;estimates that the types of businesses that
will be most affected by the Bill are those with high rateable values
such as retail businesses. We heard evidence from the British Retail
Consortium on Tuesday. With a 2p levying rate, the impact will be an
increase of around 5 per cent. in business rates. What assessment has
been done by your Department into the proportion of net margins and
retailers that would be absorbed by such an increase?</div>
<a name="09012252000145"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Healey:</b></i> The preparatory analysis and assessment that
we have done is consolidated and published in the impact assessment. I
found the evidence from the British Retail Consortium less convincing
and persuasive than that given by some of our other witnesses on
Tuesday. It is not necessarily the case that retail is somehow likely
to bear the greater part of the burden of any BRS. In the argument
about BIDs versus BRS, it is the case that many of those making a
contribution in BIDs areas will fall well below the proposed
&#163;50,000 threshold and will not be eligible to pay a business
rates supplement if it is introduced.</div>
<a name="09012252000146"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
330</b><b class="B"><a name="09012252000233"></a>Mr.
Dunne:</b> Well, your own impact assessment acknowledges that
retail premises are likely to be disproportionately affected by the
BRS&#151;I have a quote from it. You admit that retail will be
disproportionately affected, and you have just contradicted
yourself.</div>
<a name="09012252000147"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Healey:</b></i> If you look at the analysis regarding
premises that tend to be rated over the &#163;50,000 threshold, large
retail outlets do figure. However, businesses that tend to be in that
bracket sit alongside other employers and businesses from other
sectors. Although they are big in numerical terms, they make up a
minority of even those in the retail sector. We tried as a Committee to
get something on that from the British Retail Consortium on Tuesday,
but were not able to very clearly.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column99" />Column number: 99</div><a name="09012252000148"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
331</b><b class="B"><a name="09012252000234"></a>Mr.
Dunne:</b> Minister, do you know what the typical net margins
of retail businesses are in good times, let alone poor times?</div>
<a name="09012252000149"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Healey:</b></i><i class="I"><b class="B"> </b></i>I have no background in retail
directly. The short answer to that is no&#151;it is not something
that I have taken a specialist interest in.</div>
<a name="09012252000150"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
332</b><b class="B"><a name="09012252000235"></a>Mr.
Dunne:</b> And when preparing the Bill, you did not think to
ask your officials what the impact would be on the net margins of the
different categories of businesses that might end up paying
this?</div>
<a name="09012252000151"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Healey:</b></i> Mr. Dunne, the Bill sets out a
framework in which local areas, led by local authorities, can consider
whether they want to see long-term investment projects in their area,
of which BRS may form a part. If they do, that sort of assessment and
analysis, both of the benefits that it could bring to their area and
the potential impact on business, will make up part of what they pull
together for their case. It will be confirmed in the prospectus and
then formally consulted on. Surely you would accept that such work
should properly be done area by area as part of the consideration and
consultation before any proposition goes ahead? Any aggregate analysis
that could be done at a national level at this time is probably not a
good indication&#151;</div>

333</b><b class="B"><a name="09012252000236"></a>Mr.
Dunne:</b> I am sorry to interrupt, but we are about to
finish. When introducing legislation, you as the Minister responsible
are obliged to undertake an impact assessment. The work that has been
done on page 13 of your assessment is one of the thinnest and weakest
pieces of work that I have seen in an impact assessment for a Bill on
which I have served.</div>

Binley:</b> On a point of order, Mrs. Dean, you
will note that we are clearly not going to get on to the area of
consultations, ballots, exemptions and reliefs. I wonder if you could
just take that into account when it comes to the debate itself. I would
be most grateful.</div>

point into account.</div>
