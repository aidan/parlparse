<H4><center>[Mr. Peter Atkinson in the Chair]</center></H4>
<H3><center><a href="/pa/cm199798/cmbills/090/1997090.htm">National Minimum Wage Bill</a></center></H3>
<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before we begin, I should remind hon. Members that adequate notice should be given of amendments. As a general rule, my co-Chairman and I do not intend to call starred amendments, including any that we may reach during an afternoon sitting.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Boswell </B>(Daventry): On a point of order, Mr. Atkinson. It will have been drawn to the attention of members of the Committee that since our previous sitting, when you were not with us, the Government have tabled 26 amendments without giving notice. I am staggered by that because it comes so early in our proceedings on a Bill of which the Government are so proud and which they considered so carefully. My only explanation for that figure is that the Government presumably ran out of letters of the alphabet.
<P>
Ministers will no doubt want to speak to their amendments in due course but, in view of the situation, would it not be appropriate for the Minister to consider at least providing us with explanatory and supplementary notes on amendments before we consider them? It might be for the convenience of the Committee to adjourn for an appropriate period to consider the amendments before meeting formally to dispatch them.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am informed that the Government's amendments were tabled on Tuesday and, therefore, in adequate time. It is up to the Government how many amendments they table. If the Minister wants to give background information on them, that is a matter for him. He has clearly heard what the hon. Gentleman has said.
<H4><center>Clause 1</center></H4>
<H4><center>Workers to be paid at least the national minimum wage</center></H4>
<P>
Amendment proposed [13 January]: No. 6, in page 1, line 7, leave out ``by his employer''.--[Mr. Boswell.]
<P>
Question again proposed, That the amendment be made.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Bercow </B>(Buckingham): On Tuesday we all tried very hard to stay in order under the firm but enlightened authority of the hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich (Mrs. Dunwoody). We feel sure that you will apply similar qualities to today's proceedings, Mr. Atkinson. On that happy note, I am keen to rejoin debate on the matter that we were discussing on Tuesday.
<P>
The Government have sought to justify the inclusion of the words ``by his employer'' in clause 1, not least on the grounds that it is necessary to ensure a level playing field. They believe specifically that there is a prospect of bad employers driving out good ones unless those words are contained in the Bill. That is what motivates them. The Government are mistaken in their insistence on the retention of those words and I want briefly to focus on some of the reasons why.
<P>
First, in so far as an employer who pays low wages is operating inefficiently, it logically follows that he or she gains no commercial advantage from paying low wages. It has been part of the Government's argument all along that it is not only socially just to pay good wages--by which they presumably mean at least the minimum wage--but that it is economically efficient to do so. The President of the Board of Trade has consistently regaled us with that argument, although with deplorably little evidence to support it. If the Government believe that, they should not be bothered about an employer who pays low wages; he is behaving inefficiently and gains no advantage over efficient employers who pay higher wages. So the argument about the level playing field manifestly does not apply. If it applies at all, it goes against the bad employer who behaves inefficiently and pays excessively low wages. Who should mind if a bad employer, by his own behaviour, suffers an uneven playing field which is against his interests? That is the first argument which I invite Labour Members to consider. [Interruption.] The hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne (Ms Atherton) is becoming a little excited. I am happy to give way if she has a serious and intelligible point to make but, as she has suddenly converted to the status of a mute, I suspect that she has nothing significant to say. I feel sure, Mr. Atkinson, that I am about to be subjected to your disciplinary authority, and I therefore move to the second point.
<P>
Let us suppose that an employer paying relatively low wages is behaving as a rational, economic actor--sensibly, in terms of his commercial interest. In so far as he is doing so, it follows that the President of the Board of Trade cannot argue that that person is an inefficient employer. The existing playing field is the result of the natural state of the market. In such circumstances, there is no justification for the interference of public authority.
<P>
The truth is that the only respect in which the argument about a level playing field applies is the one to which my hon. Friend the Member for Ashford (Mr. Green) alluded towards the end of Tuesday's proceedings. Market entry, or prevention of entry to the market, is the real point at stake. If wages are raised artificially by Government fiat rather than by market necessity, the consequence is that some people are kept out of the market--not because they do not have a contribution to make, not because they could not run a business and not because they could not successfully employ and retain people, but because the Government have decided that they shall not be allowed access to the market. That is a prevention of entry and an anti-competitive measure by the Government.
<P>
If that is what the Government intend, they should say so. If the Minister believes that he is a better judge of the way in which the market should operate than a would-be business man who cannot afford to pay minimum wage which the Minister intends to require to be paid, let him argue his corner. Though I am developing a modest respect for the Minister's conviction--I must not overstate it because that would embarrass him--I do not think that he is likely to be a good judge of the level of wages that should be paid. I wager that the average employer--I am being fair minded about this--including those in the constituency of the hon. Member for Stockton, South (Ms Taylor), is a better judge of market wage rates and appropriate pay than is the Minister.
<P>
At the heart of the argument on the clause and the amendment is a debate between those of us who believe that what matters is remuneration and those who contend that what matters is a contract between an employer and an employee. The Government believe, wrongly in our judgment, in the latter. We say this to them: ``Are you in the business of raising the remuneration of employees or of settling scores with employers? Do you have an interest in punishing those who take on workers or in bolstering the living standards of the work force?''
<P>
The remuneration of employees is what matters to Conservative Members. My hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond) made that point succinctly and forcefully on Tuesday in the context of tipping. He knows that in the catering industry tips account for a substantial part of the remuneration of workers. The Minister believes that the minimum wage should have to be paid by the employer and that what matters is the level of income that the employee derives from the employer. What matters to my hon. Friends and me is what remuneration the employee is able to secure. The tips, of course, do not come from the employer, but from a satisfied customer. However, in many circumstances, waiters or waitresses are able to secure a greater share of their income from tips than from their wage.
<P>
We want to establish why the Minister has a hang-up about the retention of the words ``by his employer'', why he is obsessed with the burden that the employer has to bear and why it is so important to him that the contractual relationship between the employer and the employee should be the criterion on which the level of the minimum wage is assessed. Why not instead consider the overall earnings of the employee--the remuneration that he is able to secure? That is the basis of our position. The argument is not between those who want people to be well paid or well rewarded and those who do not; it is about how fair pay is to be achieved.
<P>
<B>Ms Dari Taylor </B>(Stockton, South): Your use of language is telling. Sometimes we must listen to what we are saying, rather than simply saying what sounds good to us. You have used language--
<P>
<B>The Chairman Order. I am not using language.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Ms Taylor:</B> I am sorry, Mr. Atkinson. I am hopeless when it comes to the language of the House. I will attempt to get it right.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman is using language that is more pleasing to him than sensible to the debate. He used phrases such as ``artificially raised'', ``anti-competitive measures'' and ``measures that are appropriate''. He speaks of wages as though he has a mechanism that identifies absolute value that transcends all. It is important for the Committee to realise how wages are put together. There is no absolute mechanism.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I apologise for interrupting the hon. Lady again, but interventions are meant to be short. If she wishes to catch my eye, I am sure she will be able to do so.
<P>
<B>Ms Taylor:</B> Thank you, Mr. Atkinson. The hon. Gentleman was discussing tipping as a part of wages. Is it not the case that tipping is chancy and personal, a statement of thanks between two people?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. This is not an intervention; it is a speech, so I ask the hon. Lady either to put her question or resume her seat.
<P>
<B>Ms Taylor:</B> Certainly, Mr. Atkinson. Is not tipping chancy? It is not a major part of a person's wage and cannot be constructed in such a way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I have to disappoint the hon. Lady. I do not object to her use of language, only to the content of her arguments. Listening to her intervention, I felt that we were in a Kafka novel with the character who was trying to reach the castle but never got there.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for giving way for a somewhat less extensive intervention than that we have just heard. Does he agree, in considering the remarks of the hon. Member for Stockton, South, that if tipping were to be disregarded as part of the employee's remuneration, it would be grossly inequitable to those employees who are paid only an hourly rate and who would receive much less than those who receive a lower hourly rate plus tips as part of their normal remuneration?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> My hon. Friend is correct. Such people would be the losers. If the hon. Lady is in doubt about the value of tips to those who work as waiters or waitresses in the catering industry, why does she not ask them for their opinions in the same way that she asked employers in her constituency for their opinions about the Bill? She is interested in plebiscitary democracy--I invite her to accompany me on a tour of central London restaurants.
<P>
<B>Mr. Philip Hammond </B>(Runnymede and Weybridge): Does my hon. Friend agree that it would be anomalous to exclude tips from calculation of the minimum wage, but include them in calculation of income tax liability?
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> My hon. Friend is correct. However the Government address the matter, tips are paid, and tax is paid on tips. That will continue. The reality is simple--tips are not a chancy aspect of remunerating people who work in the catering industry. If the hon. Member for Stockton, South meant that the level of tips varies over time, obviously I agree. If she doubts that tips are received, she is wrong. Everyone who works in catering receives a proportion of tips and is obliged to pay tax upon that money. I would wager that for many people who work in catering, tips are an important and sizeable share of remuneration. For many people they form a larger share of remuneration than the hourly rate with which she seems so preoccupied in her pursuit of political correctness. That is the difference. If the hon. Lady has been as attentive to the Bill as I hope, she will be aware of the right of the President of the Board of Trade to specify the pay reference period under the Bill. The level of tips can be assessed and determined over a period.
<P>
I wish that the Government, who have made many moves in recent years to modernise their appeal and outlook, would modernise their attitude to tipping. They are obsessed with wages; the Opposition are preoccupied with remuneration. We are not concerned with an abstract idea of how people should be rewarded, but with how people are rewarded in practice.
<P>
<B>Mr. Damian Green </B>(Ashford): Before my hon. Friend moves away from the subject ot tipping, which I agree is important, and which relates to an increasingly important economic sector, will he say whether he has considered the possible effect on employers of the imposition of a minimum wage? Some employers may seek to claw back far more of the tips given to their employees so that remuneration would not be altered. Accordingly, the minimum wage's effect would be not to make relatively poor workers better off, but to damage industrial relations in important small businesses.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> My hon. Friend is right. Anyone who knows anything about the operation of tipping knows that it is regulated voluntarily by employers as they see fit in individual companies, including restaurants. An employee has no automatic entitlement to keep a whole tip. Many restaurants and hairdressers operate a system to distribute tips. They may have boxes for people to contribute to, whose contents are shared out. In principle, there is nothing to stop an employer deciding to seize a larger share of the tips.
<P>
In all seriousness, the Government have a responsibility to consider how employers will behave before the Bill is enacted. Frankly, it is mindless, and worse still, irresponsible, for the Government to fail to consider the possible reactions and preparations of employers before the Bill becomes law. That is the danger of the Government's approach. I cannot understand why Labour Members have not considered that point.
<P>
The other day, I refused the request of the hon. Member for Stockton, South to name bad employers. I thought that to do so would be imprudent, and that it would be unnecessary for my argument. Everyone knows that there are bad employers. The Minister has often made that point, and has probably been a victim of bad employers. The point is so obvious that it does not need making. Other employers are not bad, but careful and seek to maximise what they keep rather than what their employees earn. We have to take account of that. If the hon. Member for Stockton, South is so reconstructed as a representative of new Labour that she is unwilling to concede that there are some bad employers, that is a commentary upon her judgment, but it cannot be expected to influence Opposition Members. I rest my case.
<P>
<B>Mr. Phil Woolas </B>(Oldham, East and Saddleworth): Thank you for calling me to speak, Mr. Atkinson.
<P>
When I was elected to the House, I did not expect to have to carry on what has been a 15-year debate with the hon. Member for Buckingham (Mr. Bercow). In case there are any doubts as to the motive behind the amendment, let us consider the hon. Gentleman's background. After debating on behalf of the Federation of Conservative Students--an organisation so intent on ensuring the accuracy of legislation that its slogan related to what should be done to Nelson Mandela--he enjoyed a long and distinguished period in politics and took a helicopter trip when he worked for the former Minister, Jonathan Aitken, but we are now led to believe that 15 years of opposition to the national minimum wage has been converted into a wholly philanthropic desire to help the Minister of State draft accurate legislation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The hon. Gentleman knows that the amendment stands in my name. For the record, as he mentioned Nelson Mandela, perhaps he would like to know that when I was a student leader, some 30 years ago, I specifically gave permission for representations about the then recently imprisoned Nelson Mandela to appear on my college notice board.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. As much as members of the Committee are enjoying the diversion, I remind them that we are debating amendment No. 6. I should be grateful if hon. Members would keep to the point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woolas:</B> Thank you, Mr. Atkinson. The idea that there was a difference of opinion in the Conservative ranks--or among Conservative students at that time--never occured to me.
<P>
The amendment is either ill intentioned or daft. If one did not specify who was responsible for remuneration--that is, an employer--then in the real world, rather than in the small circle of west end restaurants in which the hon. Member for Buckingham has probably formed his views on employment and industrial policy over the past few years, that remuneration would not be paid. To remove the words ``by his employer'' would, in effect, remove the word ``wage''. Rather than having a National Minimum Wage Bill, we would be left with a National Minimum Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I feel that the hon. Gentleman is confused. Does he accept that there is a distinction between the responsibility to ensure that the minimum remuneration is paid--which clearly should rest with the employer; I do not think that anyone would argue with that--and the definition of what is to be counted in the scope of remuneration? It is with regard to the latter point that the subject of tips has been raised.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woolas:</B> All I can say in response to that is that if the hon. Gentleman were to come with me to Betty's bacon butty shop in Milnrow and suggest to her that her staff should be paid by tips rather than relying on the income that she provides, he would be looked at rather askance. To take away the responsibility from the employer and make it more general would leave the remuneration of employees to the whim of other factors.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Woolas:</B> The hon. Gentleman can jump up and down, but that is why Winston Churchill argued so strongly for a national minimum wage.
<P>
<B>Several hon. Members</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Woolas:</B> I want to develop my second point--perhaps hon. Members could then intervene on both points, and we will get through the debate much more quickly.
<P>
Opposition Members' policy is based on the idea that labour should be subject to the whims of supply and demand and to no other factors. The hon. Member for Buckingham said that the measure was anti-competitive. Does that mean that we should discard health and safety regulations as they intervene in the labour market?
<P>
The Bill proposes that the Government or the state should by fiat--to use the words of the hon. Member for Buckingham--intervene in the labour market. To remove the words ``by his employer'' from the Bill would take the guts out of it. The need to provide a minimum wage--a level below which employers cannot fall--is precisely why we are having this debate. I remind the Committee of the words of Winston Churchill: without a safety net, a bad employer is undercut by a worse employer, and he is undercut by the worst. There would be a vicious circle--we have already seen that in this country--of lower and lower wages. That would not benefit the employee nor, in the long run, the employer.
<P>
I question the motive behind the amendment. We should take the amendment at face value--what is being argued is that the National Minimum Wage Bill should not be about wages. That is nonsensical, and for that reason we should oppose the amendment.
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Department of Trade and Industry (Mr. Ian McCartney):</B> On behalf of the Committee, I welcome you, Mr. Atkinson, to the debate. Once in this Session I have had the pleasure of your chairmanship. I hope that your experience in Committee will be as enjoyable as mine. However, I suspect that, even with co-operation, proceedings will last rather longer than the hour and a half taken to debate the Copyright and Rights in Databases Regulations 1997.
<P>
The hon. Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) almost convinced me that he is the new face of the Conservative party. He said that he was going to be reasonable about the proposition that the Bill protects the lowest paid in society and sat down with a smile on his face, thinking that he had convinced me. If he had been the only Opposition Member to speak, I may have had to think for a few moments, but then the heavy squad was introduced.
<P>
We can see what will happen during Committee proceedings: the hon. Gentleman will come up with the soft voice and tell us why he is such a good guy and why the Conservatives are not opposed to doing something about low pay. Then, the heavy men will take the boot to anyone with a consensus view about the need to get rid of poverty pay in the United Kingdom. The hon. Member for Buckingham said that the clause is the national minimum tip clause rather than one dealing with the national minimum wage. As a former seaman, I say that the amendment is about holing the Bill below the waterline--an attempt to destroy the consequences of the Bill.
<P>
The debate is being used as a smokescreen. Opposition Members have raised the spectre of the informal economy, almost encouraging law breaking and bogus self-employment. Instead of doing something about competitiveness in this country, they have apologised for the fact that we have to compete on third-world wages. They suggested that small and medium-sized businesses do not understand or realise their employment obligations. Such enterprises are sick and tired of being used as examples of poor employment practice. The overwhelming majority want to be and are good employers who want to improve on good practice. What undermines them consistently in the labour market is anti-competitive activity such as low pay and competing on the basis of paying &#163;1.20 an hour instead of on quality of goods and services. We have heard from the former secretary of the Monday club and his colleagues an apology for those in the economy who are waiting to pick over the entrails of the Bill to find some way out of meeting their pay obligations.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
My hon. Friends have clearly shown that the low pay culture costs jobs. The labour market strategy of the previous Government over 18 years was to deregulate to drive down wages and to make minimum standards possible. They left office with unemployment double what it was when they came in--their strategy was a total failure.

<br>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Does the Minister therefore disagree with the Deputy Prime Minister, who said that a minimum wage would cost jobs and that any silly fool knew that?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> The hon. Gentleman misinterprets what my right hon. Friend said. No one in this Room or outside it who supports the minimum wage would suggest for a minute that it should not be set sensibly and take account of the modern labour market. Why should it not be set sensibly? That is the purpose of the Low Pay Commission and of partnership. No doubt we will have further discussions about that on clause 5.
<P>
I ask my hon. Friends to resist the amendment. It could damage the principle behind the Bill. The main question of the hon. Member for Daventry was what the definition of an employer was. The definition is in clause 51(4). An employer is anyone for whom a worker as defined in clause 51(3) works. Before the hon. Gentleman says that it is difficult for employers to understand that concept, I should say that the wording was taken from the previous Government's Employment Rights Act 1996. The Government have been consistent. We are not being novel. We are not attempting to confuse employers by introducing a new legislative framework with new drafting and wording. We are not trying to bounce them with new forms of bureaucracy. The wording in the Bill was used by the previous Government to define the relationship between employers, employees and the worker. The Opposition Whip, the hon. Member for Solihull (Mr. Taylor), was a Minister for some time and dealt with such matters. He knows that what I said is true. He was probably involved with the 1996 Act and may have used his legal abilities to ensure that employers accepted and understood the wording. He would have ensured that it was technically proficient in setting out the relationship and clarifying who was responsible for pay and other issues in the work place. The definition is well known to Conservative Members. The amendment is bogus and attempts to undermine the concept of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Lansley (South Cambridgeshire):</B> The Minister said that the intention behind the Bill was not to take the definition of employer beyond the provisions of the Employment Rights Act 1996. Why is clause 16 specifically designed to do so in relation to special classes of worker? Why do clauses 31 and 32 do exactly the same in relation to agency workers and home workers?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> The point of the clauses on agency workers and special classes of worker is to ensure that every worker in Britain is entitled to a minimum wage. For 18 years, Conservative Members tried to use bogus self-employment to ensure that people in legitimate employment did not gain access to the minimum standard rates in the work place. In our previous sitting and again today, the hon. Gentleman outlined parrot fashion certain classes of worker and pretended that the Government opposed employers. This enabling Bill will ensure that employers do not try to get round the 1996 definition by excluding those workers who clearly should be entitled to a national minimum wage. Conservative Members should make it clear whether they believe that it is right for home workers to be excluded from a minimum wage and to continue to be paid as little as 25p or 30p an hour in some instances. If they do, let them table amendments and oppose those special categories being covered by the national minimum wage.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> The intention behind the amendment and my earlier point is not to debate the merits of clauses 31, 32 and 16. The Government clearly intend to introduce a minimum wage for all workers. The point of the amendment is to ask why we should construe the employment contract as the basis for the minimum wage and then go through the Bill trying to include as employees people who are not. Why not go straight to the heart of the matter and say that the basis for the minimum wage is remuneration rather than the employment contract? The Minister must answer that point rather than going off into discussion of clauses 31 or 32.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> With all due respect, it was the hon. Gentleman who raised clauses 31 and 32 and as I am a helpful person, I tried to explain them to him. He is trying to change his ground. He is trying, in the amendment, to get round the question of identifying who will be responsible for paying the minimum wage. That will leave workers in a ludicrous position.
<P>
If the hon. Member for Buckingham takes his argument to its logical conclusion--if I can call it that--every individual who walks into a restaurant is a potential employer of a staff member of that restaurant. That staff member, between the hors d'oeuvres and the main course, must negotiate the best possible deal. That is the logic of the hon. Gentleman's argument. If I give way to him perhaps he will tell us how good a tipper he is.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Has the Minister given way?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I apologise, Mr. Atkinson. In my enthusiasm I forgot to say that I will give way to the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I am grateful to the Minister. I am happy to respond to his question. He does not know me well and probably does not want to do so, but many people who do know me well will happily testify that I am generous in tipping. I do not claim great credit for that. I happen to believe that if one gets good service, one should tip generously, and I do so regularly. I probably tip rather more generously--it is always the case--than people who could afford to tip a lot more than I can. That is right and proper. I have no personal financial interest in this matter, though I employ a cleaner--I referred to cleaners in the previous sitting--whom I pay &#163;7 an hour, which is fair, as well as a Christmas tip.
<P>
If employees at the bottom of the scale in Britain are suffering by being underpaid by cheese-paring employers, why, over the past 10 years, have the poorest 10 per cent. of the work force increased their take-home pay by 13&#183;4 per cent., while workers in France--where there is a minimum wage--in a similar position have improved their earnings by only 4 per cent?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> It is not a question of like or dislike. When I was a waiter we had a system based on whether we liked the clients. If they were snotty, pompous people of the kind that one occasionally meets, we were always polite and professional but we made sure that the plates were extra warm. Perhaps when the hon. Gentleman goes to the Dining Room during the next few months, if he wants to sit with me he should make sure that it is not me who gives him his plate.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman raised a smokescreen about wages and conditions. Why does he not compare like with like? A century on, the difference between the lowest and the highest paid in Britain is greater than it was in the 1800s. We are coming to the end of this century and the divide between people in work, from the lower to the top end of the scale, is higher than ever. The Government have inherited a sea of poverty. We have a range of measures, of which the minimum wage is one, to tackle those issues.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I am sorry to take the Minister back to tipping, but I have here a summary of evidence by the British Hospitality Association, which represents 25,000 establishments in the catering sector. One of its submissions to the Low Pay Commission is that the way in which tips will be taken into account in assessing employers' compliance will be important for that industry, given that for many employees, tips represent a significant source of income. Can the Minister clarify, so that that important sector can understand it at this early stage, whether he is saying that tips will not in any way be taken into account and that the Low Pay Commission and the Secretary of State will not be able to include them?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> The hon. Gentleman is one of those who will get a specific answer because he raised the matter. I will come to that; I am not avoiding the issue. He may not find my answer helpful, but I hope that it will move the debate on.
<P>
I have lost count of my discussions and meetings with the British Hospitality Association in the past few years. The association, in its evidence and publicly, has stated its support for the principle of the minimum wage. That is a major step forward. The organisation represents huge numbers of employers in the hospitality industry. It recognises the necessity of the industry's involvement in the Low Pay Commission, and of membership of it. I have the British Hospitality Association's assurance that it will co-operate not only with the Low Pay Commission but with the Government in full implementation of the national minimum wage.
<P>
I used to work in parts of the industry which should be taken into account in the calculation of wages. The industry recently congratulated me on my suggestions, made both in private and in public in opposition, that the Low Pay Commission should have the capacity to consider the relevant matters. That commitment has been made clear, and the Low Pay Commission is considering those matters and will make proposals. I shall deal with that point in more detail as the discussion progresses.
<P>
The hon. Member for Daventry has tried to undermine the Bill's purpose by tabling the amendment. That purpose is to require employers to pay their employees at least a national minimum wage. How could a worker or an enforcement officer press a claim if it was not clear who was responsible for paying the minimum wage? The amendment would remove the possibility of considering such a claim.
<P>
It is interesting that the hon. Member for Daventry and other Opposition Members are trying to suggest that the minimum wage is a distortion of the labour market. That argument is astonishing, coming from free-marketeers. It is astonishing that, in a contract culture, they do not see the minimum wage as a mechanism to ensure fair and effective markets, and to ensure that employers can compete fairly for the initiation or continuation of contractual arrangements. The minimum wage will ensure that applications to establish or retain a contract are made on the basis of the skills, knowledge, adaptability and commitment of the work force, and of the quality of goods and services that are offered, not simply on the basis of driving down wages.
<P>
How can the labour market be effective if, in the middle of Manchester, a contract cleaning company, offering &#163;1.30 per hour, tries to undercut another company in the same locality because the other company is paying a reasonable wage? The matter is not one of international competitiveness. Workers are not being brought to Manchester airport every day from Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, or from other parts of the third world to provide labour. The matter concerns local labour, competing in a local labour market and in a local economy. At present, the labour market and the capacity for small and medium-sized enterprises to compete according to the quality of their goods and services is being dragged down.
<P>
That, above all else, is why employers in their thousands have turned to the Labour party and said that they want a minimum standard--a floor for wages in the labour market--so that they can compete on a level playing field. By tabling the amendment, the hon. Member for Daventry seeks to remove the capacity for fairness from the labour market, for employers as well as employees. The Opposition will be condemned for that.

<P>

<B>Mr. Green:</B> Will the Minister assure the Committee that if and when the minimum wage is introduced, there will be no effect on differentials further up the wage scale? If there were to be such an effect, I am sure that he would admit that it would distort the wider labour market and that it would lead to a loss of international competitiveness, which he says would not happen in the specific example that he has given. Is the Minister saying that the introduction of a minimum wage will have no effect on pay higher up the pay scale? The Government have not made their position clear on that.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> That is another hoary argument. Would the hon. Member for Tunbridge Wells (Mr. Norman), the chairman of Asda, consider what a part-time cleaner was getting, before deciding on the differential for increasing his &#163;1 million a year pay?
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
It is ludicrous to suggest that people look down the pay scale when they want pay rises, rather than looking across the economy at what workers in similar jobs in similar sectors are getting. There is no evidence, in European, Japanese or American models of minimum wages, that workers per se try to use the minimum wage to extract additional resources from their employers. The argument is therefore bogus.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I am not going to assist the hon. Gentleman in his filibustering. I will respond to interventions as fairly as I can, but I have given way at least three times to the hon. Member for Buckingham. No doubt between now and the end of my speech, I shall have given way 300 times.
<P>
Even if the concept of minimum income versus minimum wages was a fair one, and even if we legislated for minimum income rather than minimum wages, as the hon. Member for Daventry would like, we would still need similar legislation. Unless we have a definition of the relationship between employers and employees, there is no possibility of employers, employees or the taxpayer understanding who is responsible for labour costs.
<P>
The intellectual argument of the hon. Member for Daventry is that labour costs should be the preserve of the taxpayer and good business men--that is to say, they should subsidise the labour costs of employers who pay poorly. That is precisely what the previous Government did, increasingly using the benefits system. There was not only burgeoning of the benefits bill but the taxpayer in general, and the small employer in particular, were having to meet not only their own labour costs but, through general taxation, the labour costs of their competitors.
<P>
Conservative Members call their party the party of business and competitiveness, and yet they introduced a system that led to many employers having to pay an additional taxation burden to meet the labour costs of those with whom they compete in the national and international labour markets.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I shall give way in a moment.
<P>
If the hon. Member for Daventry is serious about introducing an alternative to the minimum wage, and he already accepts the argument that he and his colleagues made on Second Reading that the minimum income must be underpinned by benefits, surely the taxpayer must understand who else is part of the deal. If one removes from the Bill our capacity to determine who the employer is, the taxpayer will be left to meet the whole bill. According to the logic of Conservative Members, the taxpayer will meet the labour costs of any employer who decides to pay only tips or no wages at all. That is a recipe for industrial chaos and for thousands of small businesses to lose their capacity to operate effectively in the labour market. Even by the Opposition's own argument, the amendment fails dramatically.
<P>
I said to the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge that I would try to be helpful. I want to make available to members of the Committee a paper on remuneration which has been produced by Department officials. I think that it will help them. There has been a narrow focus on tips, which is one issue, but there are a range of others. The paper may help hon. Members when we debate other clauses where this issue is more salient to the debate. If you, Mr. Atkinson, are happy for me to do so, I shall distribute the paper to hon. Members. It has no political spin--it simply sets out aspects of remuneration and their impact.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Is the Minister saying that his officials have prepared the definition of remuneration before the Low Pay Commission has given the Secretary of State its recommendations?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> No. I almost despair. I offer hon. Members, in a non-political way, access to the resources that I have as a Minister and the hon. Gentleman makes a crack like that. It is obvious that the paper does not prepare the ground for the Low Pay Commission. Out there--as the hon. Gentleman should know, because he keeps saying that he is an employer, or that he is related to employers--there is a myriad of remuneration arrangements. I merely wanted to assist hon. Members by combining them in a document that says how they determine wages. It is a reasonable offer.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Is the Minister conscious that the public sector is itself an employer? Does he not recognise that in introducing a national minimum wage, he obliges the taxpayer to tax himself more heavily?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> The hon. Gentleman tries to present himself as an intellectual. He should be in a circus. He goes round in circles, through hoops and eventually he contradicts himself. His point was nonsense. Of course the Government is an employer--that is why we will give evidence to the Low Pay Commission. But the point of the Bill, as we see from clause 1, is that whether employees are employed in the public sector or the private sector, they will be covered by the national minimum wage. It will not exclude public-sector workers--it will include all workers over school-leaving age. Thus, he has made another bogus point.
<P>
Of course the public sector will consider the minimum wage. In the same way, the previous Government regularly sat down with representatives of local government and other public sector bodies to determine levels of pay. The only difference under the Bill will be that whether people work directly for a public-sector employer or under a contractual arrangement for a private-sector employer who provides public services, they will be paid the national minimum wage.
<P>
I ask hon. Members to resist the amendment, as it is designed to destroy the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> May I, in my first substantive contribution, echo the comments of the Minister in relation to your chairmanship, Mr. Atkinson, to which we look forward. Indeed, I look forward to it rather more than I did the Minister's speech. I realise that he might have had a little dialogue about whether to try to respond to the points that we made. In the end, he decided to make ad hominem responses--he created a series of Aunt Sallies which he inevitably sought to knock down.
<P>
I shall come to the substance of the amendment in a moment, but first I want to respond to one or two of the more general political points that the Minister made. On the examples that he cited, which included people working for contract in Manchester at &#163;1.30 an hour--I am sure that that seemed as disagreeable to most Opposition Members as it did to Labour Members--I often ponder why such bargains are struck. Why do people, who may or may not be able to receive higher levels of remuneration, choose to settle for such rates? Jobs are advertised at substantially more than that in city centres, where there is employment--as there is in large parts of the country. Perhaps the Government will have some insights to share with the Low Pay Commission and, indeed, with the Committee later on.
<P>
The main beneficiary of the proposed change to current arrangements will, of course, be the Chancellor of the Exchequer. There will be a substantial clawback from people who are currently in receipt of family credit as the minimum rates are raised. On the other hand--perhaps the Minister could have commented on this--there will be knock-on effects on costs to the public sector. It already faces substantial additional costs because of the Government's action on advance corporation tax and pension funds. Those costs are not being met by an increase in the financial envelope, which the Chancellor has tightly drawn. Costs will substantially increase if minimum wages are increased in the public sector, and approximately 10 per cent. of those people affected will be in the public sector.
<P>
I want the Minister to pay particular attention to my next point. He made a remarkable assertion when he said that the Government would put evidence to the Low Pay Commission. I am delighted to hear that. Had he not mentioned it, I would have told him later--not least because one of my hon. Friends had a question on the Order Paper for answer yesterday--that our proceedings were beginning to look like ``Hamlet'' without the prince. We have had no comment from the Government on their evidence. It would inform the debate if it could be made available as soon as possible.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> I assure the hon. Gentleman that the evidence will be put in the public domain when it is sent to the Low Pay Commission. I will arrange for members of the Committee to receive it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am grateful for that assurance, as I am for the Minister's offer, which I should have acknowledged, to make available his tactical notes on remuneration--they will inform us even if they do not finally decide the issue for the commission. It is extraordinary that the Government can go so far as to produce the Bill and to table 26 amendments to it without putting their evidence to the commission. I should think that the commission is licking its lips and wants to have the information. As I mentioned, one of my hon. Friends has a question on the Order Paper and he may not want us to anticipate it, but I feel strongly that the evidence should have been made available to the commission earlier and should be put in at the earliest possible moment. If it does not appear shortly, I am sure that we will want to return to the issue.
<P>
On the amendment, the hon. Member for Oldham, East and Saddleworth (Mr. Woolas) suggested that I was being either malicious or daft. If push comes to shove and I have to chose, I will happily join the daft category. It is the Opposition's function to raise such issues and get responses from the Government. Actually, one of the jobs of Government Back Benchers is to cast the odd fly across the Government when, from time to time, their Whips--ever so gently, entirely supportively and in accordance with their paged instructions--allow them to do so. To quote Oliver Cromwell,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``I beseech you, in the bowels of Christ, think it possible you may be mistaken.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Something might be wrong. I shall go on asking questions, as I am sure my hon. Friends will, so that we get an answer. That is the sole purpose of the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that Labour Members are not prepared to offer even the mildest criticism possibly because they are afraid of upsetting a very bad employer called ``the Labour party''?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I leave my hon. Friend to speculate on that. The nature of the contractual arrangement between members of the Government and the Labour party is perhaps not one on which I should dilate. I take Labour Members at face value; they are hon. Members and members of the Committee and I am sure that they will want to make their contribution when we discuss the merits of the case. I am sure that any failure on their part to make an appropriate and lively contribution will be drawn to the attention of their constituents. We shall see.
<P>
Conservative Members are bent on asking a series of simple questions. We are asking about employers. In the middle of a bit of a tirade about refighting the issue of the Bill's principle, the Minister did not precisely answer my point, let alone some of my hon. Friends' more precise points. We are talking about real issues: who is my employer? Who is my employer at any one time? Have I more than one employer? Is the nature of my remuneration one of one employment?
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> It occurs to me that the question, ``Who is my employer?'' might be apposite to Church of England clergy. Apparently, in law, their employer is God.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am not sure whether I should declare an interest as my late father-in-law was a clergyman in the Church in Wales, although that is not the established church. I should not want to decide today who was his employer, but he was a welcome member of the family.
<P>
The matter is complex. In trying to draw together the points made in an interesting debate, never more than during the first exchange in this Committee has the need for probing the Government's intentions been clearer, not because the walls of Jericho will fall overnight, or because we have been rude or have asked a couple of questions, but because the Government must think about what they are doing. To make a brief aside, that exchange was the first skirmish in a series of what I hope will be constructive exchanges.
<P>
I give Ministers a warning. On 22 August 1914, the British Army fired its first shot at a village called Casteaux on the retreat from Mons. Just over four years later, on 11 November 1918, its last shot was also fired at Casteaux, during the advance. I do not know whether Committee proceedings will take just over four years--I hope that they do not have the ghastly and sanguinary consequences of that warfare--but we shall have to fire a few warning shots and we must get better answers than we have obtained so far.
<P>
To summarise, although the matter is presented in terms of defining the employer, we look at it very much in terms of the employees and the remuneration that they are to receive. We want employees to receive that remuneration, but for the purposes of consideration by the Committee, the Government and the commission, we must record the fact that the employment profile in this country is complex. There are--the hon. Member for Stockton, South made the point most eloquently--many straighforward employer-employee relationships. Many Labour Members will be familiar with them through trade union negotiations. That is helpful, but the difficulties arise when those relationships become complex.
<P>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge and others have said, that is the case in relation to remuneration which is not paid by an employer. We are not suggesting that, because of his tipping, my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham will be subjected to the minimum wage as if he employed labour, but clearly tips are part of remuneration.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> Can the hon. Gentleman clarify for the record whether the figure of &#163;7 an hour is the Conservatives' submission to the Low Pay Commission?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I advise the Minister that, just as I await with anticipation any submission that he might make to the Low Pay Commission, he should wait for any official submission that we might make. He must not anticipate.
<P>
Tips are one of the complexities of the matter. As my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley) eloquently said, there are many complex contract relationships. The Government are straining the law of employment contract to bring people under the provisions. When considering home workers or the overall responsibility issue--the hon. Member for Lincoln (Gillian Merron) put the point to us on Tuesday, as did--the Minister perhaps we should turn our approach around. Should not the Bill contain, as do the tax laws, an anti-avoidance measure? If one is not included, the Minister may run into difficulties--I notice him cocking his head with interest.
<P>
The difficulty with the Bill is not only that it is complex across a range of employment arrangements which arise from the natural course of business and are not all improper or designed to frustrate workers or to avoid tax, but that employers, when faced with such a situation, will respond to it. I almost intervened on the Minister when he said that the formal view of the Opposition, whether or not we give evidence to the commission, is less important than the response of employers. There is a legal and technical danger, which I probed in my remarks and which the Minister did not fully answer, concerning the question of who is an employer at any one time. It would be open to employers--there may be constraints but there are none in clause 51--to create a series of employment contracts for an hour a day or an hour a week with different people for 50 employments as a way of frustrating the Bill's intention. More substantially, there may be a move towards self-employment. The Minister talked about bogus employment, as if that could be defined, but there may well be a genuine move towards self-employment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> My hon. Friend touches on clause 51, which illustrates the point entirely. The Minister drew on clause 51 to show that the Government are doing nothing more than using the Employment Rights Act 1996, as previous Governments have done, but clause 51 raises the possibility that the structure of the Bill could be based not on employment contracts, but on contracts of service. Clause 51 defines a contract of employment not in the legal terms used in the past but as a broader contract of service. Why not base remuneration on that contract of service?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> My hon. Friend raises an interesting point. The current arrangements are complex and there is a need to make sure that the intentions of the Government are properly fufilled. I concede to the Minister that clearly someone must be responsible and suable and penalties may then be imposed on them in the event of their failure to comply with tribunal determinations. Before anyone on the Government Benches said that this was a wrecking amendment, I anticipated that that was the line that they would take.
<P>
I concede that there has to be an element of responsibility, but the prime interest of the employee is that remuneration--not income--is secure. There will be complexities of employment and quasi-employment that may make remuneration difficult to secure. There may also be perverse responses by employers who wish to avoid making it secure, whether or not we encourage them to make such responses, and we do not. The Government might need to think again more thoroughly about whether they are successfully delivering a national minimum wage. As I said a few moments ago, I have seen no anti-avoidance provisions in the Bill. Somebody who is determined to frustrate the Government's intentions would find it possible to do so. That is another case in which the Government's aspirations, intentions and claims for the Bill may be unfulfilled.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> My hon. Friend made an interesting point about anti-avoidance measures. Has he considered the further point that one of the incentives towards possible avoidance will be the complications and effects on the tax status of individuals caused by the increased importance of their status as either an employer or an employee? There might be a financial incentive for people to try to avoid such a particular definition of themselves, so general anti-avoidance clauses may well be worth considering because of that extra tax implication.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> My hon. Friend is entirely right. He will be aware that amendments concerning tax treatments have been tabled. We will come to those and the structure of hourly remuneration in our consideration of the next clause. Even if a national minimum wage were to have no other effect--for reasons given by my hon. Friend the Member for Ashford in an earlier intervention on differentials, it may well have other effects--my worry is that inserting an element of imposition is likely to alter the structure of remuneration and make it less transparent and less efficient. It may be altered because of the national minimum wage or it may be altered with a view to the minimisation of tax. Those aims may or may not coincide, but we must consider that. Once one begins to intervene, it is difficult to control the effects of that intervention and the response of individuals in making private arrangements either to comply with or frustrate it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that precisely because the Government have not specified a rate for the minimum wage in the Bill, they are encouraging employers, albeit inadvertently, to try to escape the national minimum wage? As employers do not know the size of the burden they will encounter, they may decide to avoid it altogether. If they do so, the Government will be responsible.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> That is very much a consideration. As I said in Committee the other day, it would have been better for the Committee to have proceeded in a different and more logical order. The Committee would then have known what was proposed, and could then have enacted it. My hon. Friend makes a valid point. While uncertainty exists, the natural reaction of many small employers would be to say ``let's get out of this''. The best way of doing that would be to create a contract of self employment, which may be perfectly genuine, or to give up employment altogether, and to become family labour.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that by referring to Manchester cleaners, the Minister carefully chose for his example a service company in a service industry? As the hon. Gentleman rightly said, employers do not have the option of bringing in planeloads of foreign workers.
<P>
In the manufacturing sector, is it not equally likely that employers' intentional or unavoidable response to the legislation will be to move the manufacturing business overseas, and that imports will be sucked into Britain in response to rising wages?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Indeed, that is a very real issue.
<P>
Government intervention in matters of the economy and private contracts, even if well conceived and well intentioned, may have unforeseen consequences. The amendment is based on the anxiety that those consequences are not now foreseeable, because the nature of the definition is so imprecise. Having been involved in the first skirmish of the contest, I am not over-impressed with the Minister's response. In the absence of any further comment, I advise my hon. Friends to press the matter to a Division.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I do not wish to prolong the debate unduly, but I wish to add three points.
<P>
In an often carefully argued debate, I was very disappointed that the Minister did not deal in detail with the possibility of constructing the Bill differently, and of resting the question of the national minimum wage on remuneration as a whole, and defining employment within remuneration rather than defining remuneration as employment. That would just be a different way of doing things. Littered throughout the Bill, in clause 51 and the other cluases to which I referred--clauses 16, 31 and 32--are many instances of straining to define many different classes of financial relationship as a contract of employment.
<P>
It would be simpler, or rather perhaps equally possible, to construct the Bill by reference to remuneration, defining remuneration as substantially including employment contracts and other circumstances. The technical note that the Minister has kindly offered the Committee may elucidate the matter, and be of assistance. I take the point made by Labour Members, that there has to be responsibility. It would be possible to provide that, if remuneration does not reach the national minimum wage level, responsibility would fall upon an employer--if an employer exists--to make up remuneration to the minimum wage level or higher.
<P>
That is an alternative way forward, which is why the amendment is constructive, not destructive. Not least for reasons put forward by my hon. Friends, it is designed to relate the interpretations in the Bill more closely to practices in industry, rather than to go through a tortuous process of defining everything in the legal terms of an employment contract in order to satisfy the demands of the national minimum wage.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Minister referred to two issues that should not be allowed to pass without comment. First, he talked about the impact of the national minimum wage on poverty. I was reminded of a report prepared for the Institute for Fiscal Studies, which, as the Minister and members of the Committee will know, is an independent and well-respected body. The report said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Because most of the poor are not in work, a minimum wage is not a good way to redistribute income from the rich to the poor. Most of those who gain will be couples where both partners work or young single people living with their parents. These people are richer than the unemployed or many pensioners.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> That is precisely why we introduced the &#163;3.5 billion new deal, which the hon. Gentleman has vociferously opposed both during and since the election.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> The Minister tempts me, but I am sure that you, Mr. Atkinson, would rule me out of order if I tried to respond. Perhaps the Minister and I could enjoy that debate on another occasion, when I will demonstrate that that policy, too, will do no more than the previous Conservative Government were able to do.
<P>
The second of the Minister's points to which I want to respond is perhaps the most germane to the amendment, because it concerned differentials. The Minister virtually dismissed them. I shall not dwell on the issue, but I read the evidence to the Low Pay Commission of the Confederation of British Industry on differentials. I would be very interested to know--perhaps the CBI would, too, when it reads the report of our proceedings--whether the Minister entirely dismisses pages 11-13 of its evidence to the Low Pay Commission.
<P>
The British Chambers of Commerce, of which I was once privileged to be the deputy director-general, would be interested to read the Minister's dismissal of its recent survey which noted that 62 per cent. of companies surveyed stated that the national minimum wage would have a knock-on effect on pay differentials. The academic community would be interested to hear him dismiss a report by Fernie and Metcalf.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree with the following statement by the Confederation of British Industry:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The impact of differential restoration could enormously inflate the direct cost of a minimum wage and hence its economic damage.''?<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> My hon. Friend helps me to complete the point and thus not to prolong the debate.
<P>
The Minister covered the issues and we shall return to them, so I shall not answer them in detail. However, I think that people outside the Committee would be astonished at the proposition that the Bill will have no impact on pay differentials. The Minister's reference to my hon. Friend the Member for Tunbridge Wells demonstrates simply that he has not thought about the matter. All the academic evidence suggest that there is a strong impact on pay differentials that it is greatest where there is a substantial concentration of low-paid workers in any given company or sector, and that it diminishes as one goes up the pay scale to the point where one arrives at my hon. Friend the Member for Tunbridge Wells, on whom there would be no impact.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> Has my hon. Friend also considered the fact that one way of minimising the transmission of a rise at the bottom of the pay scale through the pay scale is to have locally based, flexible bargaining? Everything that the Government are trying to do favours national strict bargaining, which reduces that flexibility and will make the impact of differentials stronger than it would have been under a more flexible system?
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> My hon. Friend is correct--he makes a good point. Earlier in the debate, the hon. Member for Stockton, South talked about the engineering industry. I remember exactly the circumstances in the engineering industry which led the Engineering Employers Federation to move away from nationally determined wage rates for reasons of international competitiveness.
<P>
The Minister talks about the measure not being a distortion of the labour market, but he is confused. Of course it is a distortion, although it may be justified in his view. It may increase fairness, but he cannot say that it increases the labour market's effectiveness in creating jobs--it does the opposite. Labour Members admit that they intend to remove excessively low-paid jobs from the labour market. That is their intention. He cannot say that that is not a distortion of the labour market.
<P>
<B>Mr Bercow:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that if the Government are competent to submit evidence to the Low Pay Commission on the minimum wage, they ought also to be competent to submit evidence to it on the likely impact on differentials of a minimum wage?
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend. It will be interesting to see whether the Minister and the Government can get away with supplying evidence to the Low Pay Commission that is as bold as the Minister's statement and which dismisses that impact of differentials. They would presumably--the Minister may help us on this point, too--make such a statement regardless of the rate at which the national minimum was set.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> If possible, the national minimum wage will be set at a level consistent with economic circumstances. I made it absolutely clear that the Opposition were over-egging the pudding as regards differentials. All the organisations in the low pay sector that are now committed to establishing a minimum wage will have taken differentials into account in coming to their conclusions. Employers in low-paying sectors must have taken that into account. The hon. Gentleman tries to assert that the impact on differentials is a reason for not having a minimum wage, but that is well wide of the mark. The Business Services Association and all the bodies in the low-paying sector that are committed to the concept and the principle of a minimum wage must have taken the impact on differentials into account and decided that it would not be sufficient, where it existed, to argue against introducing a minimum wage. That was the point that I was making.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> The Minister makes his point better the second time. Even then, however, it is not sufficiently strong. Differentials are not necessarily the principal argument against a national minimum wage, but they are a powerful issue when it comes to the rate at which it should be set. Industry would generally acknowledge that a national minimum wage set at &#163;2.50 or &#163;2.80 would have no significant impact on differentials because it would fall below many established pay rates in companies and sectors in industry. The moment we take the national minimum wage into the establishment pay rate system--at &#163;3 or more--we necessarily impact on differentials because we begin to distort companies' existing pay scales. The Committee should recognise that point, rather than dismiss it in the way that the Minister did.
<P>
I am concerned about the Minister's comments about the Government providing evidence to the Low Pay Commission. I hope that I am not being churlish about this kind offer to distribute a note on remuneration to the Committee. But the Minister's comments and the tabling of 35 Government amendments further demonstrate that the Government have proceeded with the Bill before informing the Committee accurately and comprehensively about their intentions or about what a national minimum wage will look like in practice. They proceeded before they were even ready to legislate in the present form. Once again, the cart is before the horse. It would be better if we saw the Government's note about remuneration and considered the matter in a technical, practical way. We supported the Bill's principle on Second Reading and we do not want to frustrate the Government's intention to introduce a national minimum wage, nor do we have any prospect of doing so. The question is whether we can proceed in a better way.

<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 7, in page 1, line 14, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `; and (d) is not working only as part of a recognised training programme.'<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This is a first canter at a matter--training--to which we might return on clause 3. The amendment would exclude from the national minimum wage only those trainees on a recognised programme. As with many aspects of employment, training is hugely complex and a variety of arrangements may apply. Usually, trainees work in broken time, go on day release to a training programme or receive instruction at their place of work. The amendment does not provide for a lower rate for trainees, which several others recommended.
<P>
I am sure that the Government are seized of the need to address the wider circumstances and considerations of training, which are reflected in submissions to the Low Pay Commission. I reiterate my remark on Tuesday--it is a strong personal commitment--that I am particularly interested in professional vocational development: the acquisition and enhancement of skills. In functional terms, such training programmes would do far more to raise the pay, conditions and well-being of persons on relatively low pay than all the Minister's rhetoric. Ideally, they would obtain a recognised qualification within the national vocational qualifications framework.
<P>
To allow myself a personal anecdote, I remember a gentleman who worked as a porter at the Department for Education when I was a Minister there. There was a restructuring; he retained his employment and was able to do NVQ level 1 in administrative skills. He went on to receive, I think, the British Empire Medal and went on to level 2. This is a man in his 50s who had never received formal education or training after his school days. I have never met anyone more motivated or responsible, or anyone who reacted more favourably to such an opportunity. We all know such stories and I shall not indulge myself by quoting others.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
There is and should be a strong commitment to training on the part of any decent employer, union or employee with aspirations. We may return to such aspirations in other contexts. We must encourage that commitment, not frustrate it. That takes us to the complex matter of what to do about that in the Bill--the precise outcome may not necessarily be what we seek or what those who have made submissions to the Low Pay Commission want.
<P>
The arguments for different arrangements for trainees, whether by rate or by the exclusion of training activities, are as follows. The first is a point of equity. The difference between a craftsperson with a recognised qualification and someone receiving instruction to obtain that qualification is that that person is better at the job in commercial terms than the trainee. In that sense, it is inequitable to impose the same minimum rate on both people.
<P>
A second point, which is perhaps more salient, is whether an incentive should be built into the system to train collectively. Employers should be encouraged to provide training programmes. They should be encouraged to take people on board and should be given every opportunity to do that. If someone goes in at a minimum rate appropriate to a trainee, it is possible that that training will not take place. Some of the more balanced and reasonable contributions that have been made by submission to the Low Pay Commission have reflected that.
<P>
It troubles me that there is a degree of incoherence in the Government's approach to the matter in comparison with welfare to work, to which the Minister referred and which clearly chimes in with the Bill. The Government are setting great store by offering employers subsidy towards taking on trainees, which may or may not be a good idea and may or may not be at the right levels--we are not debating that here. In this Bill, they are requiring employers to pay over the rate that they would naturally pay by contract and therefore making it likely to be more expensive to take on trainees.
<P>
I am sure that the Minister will tell us that the commission can consider that matter--I hope that it does so--with all the evidence and submissions being put to it, but there is an inherent tension between the two measures. Whatever the good intentions of the welfare-to-work programme in terms of getting unemployed people, particularly young people, back to work, the Bill may act against that programme.
<P>
There is another point concerning training. If it is properly conceived and structured, training can be a good personal incentive towards achieving qualifications and going on to the next stage. That point is set out in the CBI's evidence to the commission, where it says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Companies often link training rates of pay to the achievement of qualifications. For example, a major retailer employs new staff on three hourly rates, depending on skill levels and qualifications. A starter rate of &#163;3.15 is initially paid, then when a qualification equivalent to NVQ level 1 is attained the rate rises to &#163;3.37. &#163;3.65 is reached when NVQ 2 is achieved. Without a training sub-minimum, this type of progressive approach, offering incentives to acquire skills, may become untenable.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It then goes on to some of the points that I have already made. I emphasise that there is a strong interest in giving people the chance to progress through as part of a proper scheme.
<P>
The other argument in favour of a training-based approach, however it is defined in detail, is that there is a great deal of support for it across industry. Having quoted the CBI first--as a matter of structure rather than priority--it would perhaps be no accident if I was also to quote the GMB, which says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``There is . . . a case for a lower training rate''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
for workers of any age, provided that they are on recognised training schemes. That phrase is not very different from the amendment, although the two were formed independently. The Trades Union Congress states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``There is a case for trainees of any age to be entitled to a percentage of the full minimum wage while they acquire the competencies required to undertake their full range of duties. However, this partial exemption must be properly regulated to prevent abuse.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I could not agree more. Nobody seeks, in the amendment or anywhere else, to put forward a training rate as an excuse for a fiction by which people avoid the intention of the minimum wage, for which the Minister has a mandate.
<P>
The Opposition have expressed objectively and without malice reasons for reservation about the principle of a single rate for a national minimum wage. We do not think that the matter is as easy as the Government do. We believe that there is a need to look long and carefully at what should be done, especially in relation to training schemes. One way forward would be an exclusion such as that proposed by the amendment. Another way would be to consider specific types of employees for whom a rate could be rebated. I shall come to that point in a moment.
<P>
I am convinced that the matter should be addressed by Ministers. I shall pray in aid the Minister. In responding to my predecessor in my task, my hon. Friend the Member for Sevenoaks (Mr. Fallon), as long ago as 28 July--[Interruption.] The Minister should not be quite as derogatory to the Treasury and to the Treasury Front Bench as he appears to be. He is toughening up on tax matters--some of us have had experience of that. I shall return to the substance of the question that the Minister answered helpfully. My hon. Friend asked whether people who are trained as child carers as part of the welfare-to-work scheme for lone mothers will be eligible for the new national minimum wage. The Minister of State replied:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The national minimum wage will be introduced sensibly and will take account of the needs of young trainees and not penalise occupational training activity, including that which provides training as child-carers as part of the Government's welfare-to-work scheme.''--[Official Report, 28.07.97; Vol. 229, c. 64.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I shall make two further comments before concluding. First, apart from the philosophy of welfare to work, and the way in which it tends to work in the wrong direction by increasing rather than subsidising the costs of employment, the minimum wage proposals, whether or not they are part of a training programme, could have a direct impact on welfare to work. If that means that child carers are to receive higher rates, and if welfare to work and other Government measures--including those on lone parents and those that they may yet take on disabled people--are likely to mean that people have to make arrangements for care to go out to work--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am sorry to interrupt the hon. Gentleman in full flow, but I should point that the Committee is discussing training. The Bill covers many areas, but welfare to work is outside the amendment's scope.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am most grateful for your advice, Mr. Atkinson. That is exactly my point.
<P>
The purpose of welfare to work is to encourage people to go out and get employment, and, by inference, for them to be trained to a high level to do so. I am seeking only to ensure that the Government do not make it more expensive for people to enter welfare to work because of the costs of care and so make it more difficult for them to obtain training. That is the relevance of my comments to training, and such effects could occur because of an uncovenanted and unintended side wind in the Government's legislation.
<P>
My final point concerns older trainees. I am mindful of your strictures, Mr. Atkinson, so I shall be brief. Members of the Committee will be familiar with the rapid and welcome decline in the number of young people under 24 who are unemployed. The chances of the Government reaching their initial target of 250,000 young people with the welfare-to-work scheme are therefore becoming increasingly unrealistic. With some difficulty, they are now making older people their priority. I have no problem with that. The important thing is to get people into work, whatever their age.
<P>
There is, however, a difficulty with the Bill, even if we want to consider a particular regime for the older trainee. Unless I have totally misconceived it, the Bill's structure is such that it is not possible to cater for the needs of trainees over the age of 26 because that is specifically barred by statute. No doubt the Government will consider amending the Bill later on--we shall certainly ask them to do so--to prevent that artificiality.
<P>
Clearly, it is not just a matter of young people and a qualifying age for training. There will be a growing emphasis on training older people. I am delighted about that. Over the years, I have spent much time and enthusiasm on adult education. However, the Bill makes that difficult. It is currently impossible to prescribe an older person's training rate. This is not meant to be a partisan point. Embedded in the TUC's comment is a reference to trainees of any age, not to young trainees. I hope that the Government will reflect on those points in the spirit in which they have been made.
<P>
I am sure, given the industrial background of hon. Members, that there is a strong interest across the Committee in training, personal improvement and raising standards at work. That is in the national economic interest and a matter of individual equity and development. I have no problem with that. It is important that the arrangements for a national minimum wage should not frustrate that and should, if possible, facilitate it. They should provide a ladder of incentive to young persons and an opportunity for older people, which are not provided by the Bill as it stands. I table my amendment in that spirit.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. David Chidgey </B>(Eastleigh): The amendment exposes a fundamental problem or confusion in the Bill. Clause 1 states that those over 16--over compulsory school age--should be entitled to a national minimum wage, yet clause 3 gives the Secretary of State powers to exclude any person under 26 from the national minimum wage. That is a dilemma. We know the history of how it arose, but I do not want to dwell on that because I am trying to be constructive.
<P>
I was pleased to read that the Minister was on record as saying--I hope that he will correct me if I am wrong--that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Young people aged between 16 and 18 will be entitled to high quality training and will earn a trainee rate during this time.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I thoroughly endorse that view and I am pleased that the Minister shares that conviction.
<P>
Amendment No. 7 exposes two key issues--how to treat people above the compulsory school-leaving age and how to treat people in training. Young people who have not yet reached adulthood--for this purpose, 18 is recognised as being adulthood--and older people with very low or redundant skills who are unable to gain employment--even at the level of a national minimum wage, which is likely to be pretty low--are two separate categories.
<P>
We believe that young people under 18 should be entitled to two days a week of high quality vocational training or further education, which is in line with the Minister's thinking. In this case, where training is being provided, there should not be an automatic entitlement to the national minimum wage--a trainee rate would be applicable. It follows that those 16 to 18-year-olds who are benefiting from the two days' training would, on completion, be likely to command a rate of pay significantly in excess of the national minimum wage. That fundamental objective would have been met.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The second issue is over-18s with low, redundant or obsolete skills. Far too many are in that unfortunate position. The key is how to make them more employable and more productive, giving them added value to an employer who could then pay the national minimum wage or more.
<P>
The third factor is social justice. Any adult should be entitled to equal pay work, regardless of age. We have longe argued that adults with low skills who have been led into long-term unemployment because of that deficit should be able to enter work through a benefit transfer programme. We want the Government to make long-term unemployed people more attractive to employers by using the benefits paid when they were out of work to subsidise the training that they would need if they were taken on and paid the going rate for a job. An essential feature of the benefit transfer programme is providing training through moneys previously paid by the taxpayer to support the benefit programme. That can happen at no additional cost to the taxpayer.
<P>
The amendment probes how the minimum wage will be applied in relation to training and age. I look forward to hearing the Minister's response--the matter will be developed as we proceed.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Healey </B>(Wentworth): The amendment raises the first serious point of discussion, pointing to the place of trainees in the world of work and the nature of their work. We must be clear about the amendment's aim and impact. The aim is to remove the right to the national minimum wage of any worker of any age who is working only as part of a recognised training programme.
<P>
The hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire quoted CBI evidence on differentials to the Low Pay Commission. I suspect that the amendment recycles some of that evidence. The CBI exemplified the argument embodied in the amendment by referring to youth training, modern apprentices and training for work.
<P>
The hon. Member for Daventry declared his long-standing interest in the acquisition of skills and talked knowledgeably about that. His track record in trying to make improvements in this area is widely known, and he recognised that people learn at work by combining work and training. The schemes that the CBI wants to be exempt from the national minimum wage--youth training, training for work and modern apprentices--embody that combination.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The hon. Gentleman is making a constructive speech and I am grateful for his remarks. Does he agree that the so-called dual system is seen in Germany, which I know well, as the jewel in the crown? People engage simultaneously in formal education and training in the workplace. They have often said, rightly or not, that that is the secret of their industrial success.
<P>
<B>Mr. Healey:</B> Would that we had inherited after 18 years a system like that in Germany, rather than the one we have at present.
<P>
The combination of work and training as people continually learn in the workplace enables companies to remain competitive. That combination is best for the employer because during that period he gets a greater productive return from the employee, but it also brings out the best in the employees because they are learning skills, which gives them a greater sense of value and of performing a worthwhile activity, and earning a wage, which is vital for reinforcing that sense.
<P>
Last week, I visited a new scheme at Kilnhurst in my constituency which employs 10 environmental apprentices, drawn from the long-term unemployed, who have a wide range of experiences. The programme will last two years and is underpinned to start with by the training for work programme. It will lead to an NVQ 3 qualification in amenity and horticulture, but will allow those young people to draw a wage during those two years. They look forward to gaining the qualification in two years, but the fact that they are drawing a wage makes them believe that they are doing something worthwhile, makes them take themselves seriously and in turn means that the people in the community in which they are working take them seriously.
<P>
That sense of value is utterly crucial, particularly to those people who have been unemployed for long periods; an experience that systematically undermines their sense of personal value and esteem. The strongest possible signal that we can give to the unemployed and those in work is the fact that they will have the right to the minimum wage, like everyone else. That will have the impact that I mentioned earlier. We should encourage that approach, as the Bill does. The amendment would ruin that approach.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the principle that he has set out with some eloquence could be secured, although not by the amendment, if there were a lower rate that acknowledged the point that he made about self-esteem without necessarily leading to particular economic consequences or precluding the possibility of further progression later on?
<P>
<B>Mr. Healey:</B> The hon. Gentleman anticipated the remarks I was about to make. There is an argument concerning trainees and the national minimum wage. One can argue, of course, that trainees are not fully productive and that they should be a special case. There may therefore be an argument for prescribing a partial rate or a partial exemption for trainees under the national minimum wage. But there is no argument for excluding trainees altogether from the right to the national minimum wage. To do so would devalue and discourage the people who we want to encourage to develop skills and productive capacity. That would, I concede, be in line with the message that trainees have had for the past two decades from previous Governments but now is the time to change the approach. The amendment would make that change of approach much more difficult.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> My hon. Friend the Member for Daventry made it clear that the purpose of the amendment was to improve the working conditions and long-term prospects, particularly of trainees. I am particularly pleased to be able to draw attention to the canard that the Minister started when he said that my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry represented sweet reason and tabled amendments in a spirit of helpfulness, but that behind him was arrayed a group of hard men who took a completely different tack. I am happy to assure the Minister that, although I will be hard on the many inadequacies in the Bill, I am a fully paid-up member of the reasonable and conciliatory wing of my party. If he does not believe me, he can ask some of my hon. Friends, who will say the same, possibly using different language.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> For the purpose of clarity, will the hon. Gentleman describe what the other wing of his party exists for?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> For the purpose of order, the hon. Gentleman will not.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> Sadly, under instructions from the Chairman and always obedient to him, I will refrain from pursuing the topic that the Minister invites me to pursue.
<P>
Members on both sides of the Committee have prayed in aid their experience as students in their early years in politics. I am delighted that the Minister for Small Firms, Trade and Industry has returned to her seat. In support of my case for moderation, I should pray in aid the fact that I voted for her when she stood for the presidency of the Oxford Union. I mean that as a compliment, but I may be embarrassing her. I should also say that I campaigned for her, although under the rules, campaigning was not allowed in those days. Perhaps I should say that I made my support for her very clear. It is, therefore, possible to support the amendment and, indeed, many other amendments to the Bill without being a registered hard man.
<P>
Our common concern in Committee should be the long-term interests of individuals who need to get into and stay in the work force and earn a decent wage throughout their working lives through their own efforts and skills. We should also bear in mind the wider health of the economy. An economy that is largely made up of people with a high skill level is likely to be more productive and, therefore, more competitive. The concept that the Chancellor of the Exchequer has grabbed and that he constantly goes on about is employability, meaning that those with skills will be more employable. The Labour party has got to that concept by an interesting route. It was forced to admit some decades after everyone else that post-war Keynesian interventionism had failed.

<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend whom I recognise as one of the hard men of the Opposition. Will he acknowledge for the record that I introduced employability into the debate two or three years ago during my ministerial career and that I used it regularly?
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> Indeed so. My hon. Friend's ministerial career was an object lesson in the use of sensible economic concepts and extracting their practical value, thereby benefiting the community.
<P>
The fact that the Labour party was forced, kicking and screaming, to reject the post-war economic settlement left it with no great coherent economic theory to underpin its prejudices. Part of the reason for the Bill is that the Government are scrabbling around, trying to avoid having to admit that this country's recent economic success is due to the introduction of deregulation, a more flexible economy and a flexible labour market, which is particularly relevant to the present point. For those reasons, our unemployment levels are lower than those of many countries that have outperformed us economically for most of the past 50 years.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I remind the Committee that we are talking about training and training programmes. I would be grateful if hon. Members restricted their comments approximately to training.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I am grateful. I was about to disuss how relevant the issue of training is to deregulated and flexible labour markets. We need a labour market in which trainees can find work. If, with the best of intentions, we tie our labour market up too tightly by, for instance, paying trainees inappropriately high wages, we will destroy much of the flexibility which has given opportunities to such people.
<P>
My constituency, like many places in this country, has benefited from the economic improvements of recent years, and unemployment there is below 4 per cent. Nevertheless, one area--an estate in south Ashford--unfortunately scores very highly on the social deprivation indices and is one of the worst in Kent. Training schemes are extremely important in such areas. The people are not isolated from jobs--it is relatively easy to find work in my constituency--but those with inappropriate skills will not be able to do so.
<P>
It is a matter of concern across the Committee that we get training schemes right and provide not just young people but people at all stages of their working lives with the skills which will allow them to enter the work force. However, if we insist that people may be paid inappropriately high wages while they are on training schemes, it does not matter how much they are trained--there will not be jobs available for them.
<P>
Employers cannot trust trainees as much as they can experienced workers. The amendment would solve a recurring problem. At every turn, the Bill seeks to reduce the flexibility of the labour market. I accept that the clause has been drafted with the best of intentions, but the people who will suffer from the tightness--the decreasing flexibility--of the labour market will be the unskilled and the low paid on estates, even in the middle of relatively prosperous areas, who do not have the skills appropriate to finding jobs even though unemployment has been falling for several years.
<P>
The Government's insistence on training is a half truth which they are trying to work up into a general economic theory. I have not heard the phrase ``post classical endogenous growth theory'' pass the lips of the Chancellor recently--[Interruption.] Yes, perhaps that is because the man who wrote it is on honeymoon--we wish him well.
<P>
Many economic theories turn common sense into jargon. This theory is that the more skilled people are, the more likely they are to find jobs. Yes, indeed, but that is only half the story. If the other half--a flexible labour market--is not in place, it will not matter how much training is done.
<P>
The amendment would stop the Bill moving in precisely the wrong direction and making it more difficult for employers to take on trainees. We have discussed the submission made to the Low Pay Commission by the CBI, which tried to be reasonable and recognised that, barring an earthquake, a minimum wage will come. Clearly, it does not want to get offside with a new Government. However, the CBI is explicit: a minimum wage may prevent employers from taking on low-skilled workers who may need considerable training before they are able to perform the requirements of the job. That may be particularly true in small companies which cannot afford to make the initial investment before the worker's marginal product is equal to the national minimum wage.
<P>
Various points can be made in response to that--many were elegantly put by the hon. Member for Wentworth (Mr. Healey)--but every attempt to alleviate those problems, either by reducing the restrictions on certain ages or suggesting a lower rate, adds to the complications and lack of flexibility. Amendment No. 7 would cut through all that by recognising that people on a training course are, as the CBI says, likely to be less valuable to their employer. They are more likely, therefore, to be taken on as trainees if the employer does not have the added problem of trying to work out at which rate they should be paid or their precise age.
<P>
I am sure that no hon. Member would want to see problems at the margins. For example, an employer might consider people to be desirable trainees at 17 but perhaps not when they reach their 18th birthday, or he may find them desirable at one level of training but undesirable as soon as they reach a higher level. That would not only produce inefficiencies within the firm but, more importantly, would help to destroy the confidence of those workers on the margins of the labour market, because they would feel that they were constantly in danger--as they were trained up and their employer had to pay them a higher level of the minimum wage, they could well be sacked.
<P>
We can be sure that in close-knit communities such as those in some of our inner cities, the word would get around that if someone did a certain training course, employer X would sack him or her. The fear that that would generate would do immense harm to those trying to get people who have been previously unconnected with the labour market--in many cases, the so-called underclass--into that market by getting them on training schemes. The Bill will thus pose a serious danger if the amendment is not accepted.
<P>
The CBI says that there are three great problems when employing trainees: first, the obvious fact that young people should not be priced out of jobs; and secondly, employers should not be discouraged from offering publicly funded training, including for those on the welfare-to-work scheme. The Government should give that serious consideration, too, because it cuts both ways--if employers think that by offering publicly funded training schemes, they will enter into some peculiar morass which makes life more difficult for them, they will not do it. It does not matter how much rhetoric Ministers use to prove that welfare to work is helping people; if employers find it difficult, then despite the alleged initial enthusiasm, which Ministers have been trumpeting, interest in welfare to work will drop off over time. If we take at face value Ministers' claim that this is one of the Government's central economic programmes, they will be embarrassed in two years. I am always willing to try to save them unnecessary embarrassment.
<P>
The CBI's third point is that it wants employers to be able to continue to provide structured training programmes linked to competency pay. The old-fashioned notion that one develops a certain level of skills and one is then employable for life is now out of date--I suspect that hon. Members on both sides of the Committee recognise that and accept the concept of lifelong learning and lifelong training. If, however, the rate for a job changes according to the level of officially noticed competence of the employee, employers will be discouraged, rather than encouraged, from giving training to people who are already in employment.
<P>
I urge the Government to consider the amendment seriously. To some extent, they have already sold the intellectual pass. Other clauses acknowledge that it is possible to damage employment prospects by the introduction of a minimum wage--the Minister came close to admitting that this morning when he said that if the minimum wage was set at too high a level, it could, in certain circumstances, be damaging. He does not need to say so explicitly, however, because it is already implicit in the Bill. Clause 3, which gives the Secretary of State powers not to apply, or vary the minimum wage in respect of certain groups of workers on an age basis, is an admission that it can be damaging for employment prospects.
<P>
If one wants exemptions, trainees are a better group to choose than people of a certain age. We all want people to be connected to the world of work and we want people within that world to extend their skills as much as possible. It is a moral imperative that nothing should be put in the way of those people getting in touch with the work force. That is not only an economic point but a moral one. If the House is to pass legislation that makes it difficult for people to get into the work force, it is not only being economically inefficient, it is also destroying the life chances of people of all age groups.
<P>
Various other suggestions about training rates have been made in the submissions to the Low Pay Commission. Several people recommend a time-limited training rate. One of the advantages of the amendment is that it avoids such unnecessary complications. It may be that people who enter a firm progress through their training at different rates. If the training rate stopped after six months, some of them would then be valuable enough to their employer not to require him to think of getting rid of them, but others would not. That would be discrimination between people on the fairly arbitrary basis of how quickly they progress through their training. I would therefore reject that time-limiting aspect that some people have adopted.
<P>
We should recognise that there is a danger in this debate of thinking of training as a lump--one gets some training. When we think about it, training is much more complex than that, even in activities that are not regarded as being at the high-tech or difficult end of the employability spectrum. The training courses offered by companies to bar staff are complex. Anyone who has ever worked behind a bar knows that it is extremely hard work and to that extent, it can be difficult, but it is not brain surgery or computer science. Nevertheless, there are 20 different training elements offered by companies in the hospitality industry. Those are recognised types of training, including, apart from basic induction courses, training in customer service, health and safety, communication skills, food hygiene, sales and marketing, bar management, cellar management, stock control, management of a catering operation, drugs awareness, security and handling violent situations.
<P>
Even in that relatively small corner of the industrial jungle it is an extremely complex matter to say that there should be a single or time-limited training rate. When people in that industry train for national qualifications offered by the Government, there are five different levels of NVQ or Scottish Vocational Qualification within that small sector of the economy. There are three different NVQs on serving food and drink. There is an off-licence premises supervisory management qualification.

<B>Mr. Alasdair Morgan </B>(Galloway and Upper Nithsdale): Is the hon. Gentleman saying that there is no limit to how long a person could be paid less than the minimum wage? Could he envisage someone training for the whole of his or her life? That seems to be what he is suggesting.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I am suggesting that it would be better for those people to stay in work for long periods than to be told by an employer who had to implement a Government programme, ``Sorry, you have been training for too long. I now have to pay you the full rate for the job. I am afraid that you are not profitable enough for me to do that, so I am going to get rid of you.'' I think that it is better for people to stay in work rather than be forced out of work in that way.
<P>
The Government admit that an inappropriate minimum wage can cost jobs. We all agree that training is vital. It is widely agreed, even by trade unions, that trainees should be paid less than full-time workers, whether or not there is a minimum wage. One must then add into the equation the fact that training is so complex that trying to find a single level will be extremely inappropriate. The clause would be immeasurably improved by the amendment, which I am happy to support.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I also want to support the amendment. My hon. Friends the Members for Daventry and for Ashford and, indeed, the hon. Member for Wentworth have made good and sensible contributions to the debate, so I shall not unduly prolong it.
<P>
I thought carefully about the amendment before rising to speak because it poses something of a dilemma. If the national minimum wage applied to all workers, regardless of whether they were in training, the incentive to train at the lowest levels of pay in industry would be diminished. An employee or worker would find that undertaking training would not necessarily result in increased pay. That will certainly be true if the Minister is right and differentials are compressed. If, however, training was excluded in the way that the amendment proposes, the incentive to employers to train would be maximised. There we have two good arguments for the amendment.
<P>
On the other hand, if trainees--or, I should say, those undertaking a nationally recognised qualification--were paid a lower rate than the national minimum wage, we would have a contrary indication. The loss of the national minimum wage as a floor on the wages of those individuals would act as a disincentive to enter training.
<P>
We therefore have something of a dilemma and I wanted to share with the Committee how I thought my way through it. I suspect that the Government recognise the contradiction and I will not spare their embarrassment as my hon. Friend the Member for Ashford is wont to do.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> My hon. Friend said, ``as I am wont to do'', but I did so only on this occasion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I apologise to my hon. Friend. He has spared the Government's embarrassment on this occasion. They are much given to making embarrassing pronouncements and he does extraordinarily well at exposing them.
<P>
In this instance, the Government are trying to reduce the price of labour through the job subsidy that is to be provided to the long-term unemployed, on the basis that that will bring people into work. At the same time, however, they are increasing the price of labour through the national minimum wage. We have a perversity.
<P>
When one faces such dilemmas, a good starting point, which we have already discussed, is to work with the grain of industrial practice. Many pay systems in companies and industries work on the basis of a training rate. That is true for new employees, particularly young ones, although we shall deal with the question of age on clause 3.
<P>
It is a good idea to work with the grain and the hon. Member for Wentworth was quite right to say that the CBI's evidence is telling on this point. The CBI made the matter perfectly clear in its evidence to the Low Pay Commission. It said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``New employees who are in receipt of training whilst they develop the necessary skills for the job will be less productive for the duration of that training. This fact has traditionally been recognised through lower `training' rates of pay until the worker is fully productive; an approach which is endorsed by trade unions in collective agreements.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Working with the grain is a good starting point. The second step is to find a theoretical way out of the dilemma. That points us towards the exemption of those who work towards nationally recognised training qualifications. In practice, the national minimum wage will mean that employers employ only those whose productivity exceeds the value of that wage--it would be irrational for them to do otherwise. There is a danger that those employees who will be excluded--Opposition Members are perhaps more alive to this danger than Ministers and Labour Members tend to think--will be those with no skills, who are not trained or sufficiently productive to justify the payment of a national minimum wage by an employer. Those people are most at risk of losing their jobs. Untrained and unskilled workers may find it more difficult to obtain jobs at a national minimum wage rate than they do now.
<P>
To escape that, such workers have to be priced back into jobs. There are two ways of doing that. The first is to enhance their skills, so that their productivity is higher. The second is to lower the price of their labour until they are both skilled and more productive, and therefore able to justify a national minimum wage. Those means by which the potentially negative effects of the national minimum wage can be alleviated, both of which are enhanced by unskilled or untrained employees entering training, are a way out of the dilemma. The answer is therefore to support an exemption for those people. It may be a time-limited exemption, or the rate may be different. We may examine that later. On that basis, there is a good theoretical argument for taking trainees out of the scope of the national minimum wage, to mitigate what may otherwise be adverse effects of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Alasdair Morgan:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I was concluding. If the hon. Gentleman wants to make a speech--
<P>
<B>Mr. Morgan:</B> I wished to speak on that last point. If the hon. Gentleman's theory holds good, it would be expected that over the past few years, when there was no minimum wage, the nation would have been stowed out with people on training schemes. Employers would have taken on trainees by the thousand. That did not happen.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I think that a speech was being made, because the hon. Gentleman did not take an intervention.
<P>
<B>Mr. Morgan:</B> Yes, that was a brief speech, and I hope that hon. Members take note of that example.
