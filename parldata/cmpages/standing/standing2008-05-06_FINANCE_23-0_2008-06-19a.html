Jeremy Browne</b> (Taunton) (LD): Good morning, Sir Nicholas.
I would like to go straight to new clause 5, which is in my name and
that of my hon. Friends. The purpose of the new clause is to introduce
a statutory definition of residence into the Bill and into British law
as a whole. The explanatory notes concede that the concept of
residence, which is central to determining the liability of an
individual to UK tax, is</div>
<a name="08061963000025"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;only dealt with
in a limited way in statute.&#148;</div>
<a name="08061963000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">The approach
of Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs to residence is a mixture
of legislation, case law and guidance dating back to the 1950s, so it
is drawing on a range of sources to try to establish what constitutes
residence in any given case. A number of professional bodies and
others, including PricewaterhouseCoopers, have drawn attention to that
situation and expressed their concerns that a hotchpotch of
legislation, case law, guidance and established practice, some of which
has a firm legal basis and some of which is for the purposes of
guidance only, constitutes an unsatisfactory basis on which to
determine these matters.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column799" />Column number: 799</div><a name="08061963000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is the
background, and my understanding is that the Government are sympathetic
to that case, as is the Conservative party and others. Therefore, I
hope that I am introducing a brief conversation which will find a lot
of sympathy in all parts of the Committee. New clause 5 would introduce
the test, and I will briefly take the Committee through it. It is based
on the American residence test. There is also an Irish test that is
regarded by many as a good basis on which to draw up a test for our
country, but the new clause is based on the American test, and the
tests are all variants on a theme in any case.</div>
<a name="08061963000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">The test
would establish who is liable for income tax on their UK income and
capital gains, and on any foreign income and capital gains remitted in
the United Kingdom. There is a list in the new clause, which draws up a
basis on which these matters could be measured. I concede that it is a
slightly complicated list, but it is necessary to have a degree of
complication in order to try to make the system as fair as possible.
However, it is not beyond the wit of members of the Committee or, for
that matter, employees of HMRC, to use that as a basis on which to
determine one way or the other whether somebody is a resident for tax
purposes or
otherwise.</div><a name="08061963000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have added to the American test a few other features that are unique to
these proposals. One of those features, which I touched on during our
discussions on Tuesday, is an exemption for those enrolling in
full-time higher education in the UK&#151;students would be a better
way of describing them. I know that the Committee rejected that
proposal on Tuesday, which might be a barrier to some Members
supporting it now, but that was to be consistent with my previous
amendments.</div>
<a name="08061963000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is also
a provision that would allow the Treasury to define by regulation what
&#147;an exempt individual&#148; means. In the United States,
exempt individuals include foreign Government workers, professional
athletes and students and teachers on certain categories of visas. We
might wish to introduce some exemptions of that sort in the UK to
ensure that no one falls foul of the regulations in a way that would be
difficult for the Committee to envisage. That is the basis of what I am
trying to achieve in the new clause.</div>
<a name="08061963000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">I say without
immodesty that there appears to be considerable support for the
proposal outside the House. John Barnett, the chairman of the Chartered
Institute of Taxation&#146;s capital gains tax and investment income
sub-committee,
said:</div><a name="08061963000166"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
welcome the Liberal Democrats&#146; contribution to this debate as it
is a very important issue that needs to be discussed. While the
Government has stated that it does not wish to make any more changes to
the non-domicile rules, the CIOT feels that a statutory residence test
would bring certainty to this complex area. If done with sufficient
consultation it need not result in unexpected or adverse consequences.
And it will be popular with the business community because it will
avoid the current ambiguities that are not helpful either to HM Revenue
&amp; Customs or to
taxpayers.&#148;</div><a name="08061963000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">John
Whiting, the distinguished employee at PricewaterhouseCoopers,
said:</div><a name="08061963000167"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Including
a wider statutory framework for deciding residence, in this or a later
Finance Bill would give greater certainty to taxpayers and
employers.&#148;</div><a name="08061963000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is what I am seeking to achieve. I have been told that the professional
bodies believe that the Government are open to creating such a
definition. After other 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column800" />Column number: 800</div>Members have contributed to the debate, it would be extremely helpful to
hear whether the Financial Secretary might accommodate the new clause
or give an undertaking that the Government will consider bringing
forward a similar clause in a future Finance
Bill.</div><a name="08061963000034"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061963000226"></a>The
Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Jane Kennedy):</b>
Welcome, Sir Nicholas. I fully appreciate the sacrifice that you have
made to be present. We value your chairmanship and are grateful to see
that you are here, rather than somewhere else that might have appeared
more attractive on the
surface.</div><a name="08061963000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
has been explained, the UK does not have a statutory residence test.
Rather, our system operates through a mixture of statute, case law and
guidance. I am aware that a number of representative bodies have argued
the case for a statutory residence test for tax purposes. I have met a
number of those organisations, and having listened to their
representations, it is clear that there is currently no agreement on
what form a statutory residence test should take. I have asked
officials to consider the representations that have been made and to
work with those groups to see whether consensus can be reached on what
the best test would be for the UK environment, bearing in mind that our
circumstances are different from those of other economies in which
those tests already exist. However, I am not prepared to allow the
whole debate about residence, non-domiciles and the remittance basis to
be opened up, because that is not in the UK&#146;s
interests.</div>
<a name="08061963000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of the
criticisms that I accept as fair is that the current debate has caused
a degree of uncertainty. I have some sympathy for the case that a
statutory residence test would enable taxpayers to decide whether to
use the remittance basis or another basis on which to pay tax. Ours is
a complicated system, so having a simpler rule applied would be a
benefit. However, I would like to see a lot of work done before we
commit to a particular style of test. Therefore, I am encouraging the
very good and productive work that the four main organisations making
the point are undertaking. I am hopeful that that will bear fruit. At
this stage, I cannot set a time for that, but I am sure that, with good
will, those organisations can agree on what might be best, and we can
take that forward to a proper consultation. I am prepared to do that
only if it will not change the policy that we are discussing this
morning fundamentally; it remains the settled view of the Government in
terms of the detail of how the system will
impact.</div>
<a name="08061963000037"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08061963000227"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Mark Hoban</b> (Fareham) (Con): The Financial Secretary is
making important points about the debate. I understand that the
representative bodies could work quickly towards reaching a view among
themselves about what an appropriate test might be. If the consultation
were to be part of the 2008 pre-Budget report, by when should the
representative bodies come together and produce a workable definition,
which they could pass to the Treasury and
HMRC?</div><a name="08061963000038"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061963000228"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> Those bodies would need to be very swift indeed.
We would want to research a suggested model carefully, so that the
Treasury and HMRC could thoroughly understand what the economic impact
of any such model might be before we brought it forward through the PBR
for consultation. There is no point of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column801" />Column number: 801</div>party principle or difference here. We are interested in setting the
debate for the future so that non-domiciled UK residents, who seek to
use the remittance basis for tax purposes, can be assured that we not
only appreciate the value that they bring to the economy, but want them
to continue to make the UK their home and to continue contributing to
the British economy in the significant way that we know they do
already.</div><a name="08061963000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Fareham asked me to elaborate on how the Treasury
arrived at its figures. The figures that he drew upon came from the
document that we published in December, &#147;Paying a fairer share:
a consultation on residence and domicile&#148;. I could elaborate at
length, but I do not think that it would be of great value to the
Committee. There is not a lot more that I can add to the figures. They
were based upon estimates of people who were considered as needing to
use the day-counting rules&#151;air crew and others who would have to
count the number of days that they were resident in the UK. It is true
that to some degree they were estimates, but they were the best
estimates based on the figures that we had. It would not necessarily be
helpful to the Committee to enter into a vague debate about those
figures.</div>
<a name="08061963000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">Based upon
the representations that I have heard this morning, and on Tuesday
evening, the principle being pressed is that we should consider a
statutory residence test. I have said that I am open to those
representations and I think that it would be best to leave it at that
for now. I hope that the hon. Members for Taunton and for Fareham will
accept that the specific example of a residence test, which the hon.
Member for Taunton has put forward, is a little premature for us to
accept. Equally, it is not necessary for us to be required to lay a
report in the way that the hon. Member for Fareham has suggested. I
have made it clear that I will use my good offices to do so when we
have arrived at consensus. I know that the Chancellor does not like
issues such as this to remain unsettled, so it would be better if we
could see what consensus can be arrived at quickly, and move forward on
that basis.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061963000229"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> That was a helpful speech from the Financial
Secretary. I have some sympathy with her Treasury Ministers, and
Ministers in any Department for that matter: if they consult widely,
they are criticised for not moving with sufficient haste, and if they
fail to consult widely, they are told that they are not listening
sufficiently to representations. I hope that the Treasury can strike a
balance between those two positions and, as the Financial Secretary
says, take on board a lot of the comments that have been made by
outside bodies. Such comments are made with the good intention of
having a system that is easier for them and all citizens to understand,
whether they be UK residents or those who come here only
periodically.</div><a name="08061963000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
did not anticipate the Financial Secretary accepting the new clause,
and I acknowledge that a new clause drawn up by me and my hon. Friends,
albeit with the assistance of people in professional bodies, is
unlikely to be introduced off the peg by the Government. However, I
hope that it will at least provide a kick-start to a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column802" />Column number: 802</div>helpful process. I do not know what the procedure is for new clauses,
but I would not wish the Committee to be detained any
longer.</div><a name="08061963000043"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061963000230"></a>The

case.</div><a name="08061963000044"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061963000231"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I want to make two comments. I welcome the
Financial Secretary&#146;s remarks. She has indicated an openness to
the debate on the need for a statutory residence test, and has sent a
clear signal to the representative bodies that we need to work quickly.
I am sure that they will take note and respond to that signal, so that
the debate can be moved forward as quickly as possible. That is in
everybody&#146;s interest. The Financial Secretary has dealt with the
statutory residence test, but not with the questions I raised on
Tuesday evening about when we will see a revised IR20, and what
guidance will be produced on in-transit rules. She did deal with the
issue of cost. I would be grateful if she could respond
now.</div><a name="08061963000045"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061963000232"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> If the hon. Gentleman will forgive me, I had an
answer for him on Tuesday afternoon but I have now mislaid that. I have
found it. I beg the Committee&#146;s
pardon.</div><a name="08061963000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">Once
the Bill is passed, HMRC will publish a revised IR20. That will,
however, be temporary, as HMRC is rewriting all the guidance covering
residence and domicile, which will include the 2008 Budget changes. It
will be appropriate to wait until those changes have been made before
the guidance is completely rewritten. The new guidance will be subject
to consultation, following Royal
Assent.</div><a name="08061963000047"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061963000233"></a>Mr.

there will be consultation. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061963000236"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> I will speak briefly, as has been my habit, but I
will seek to answer any detailed questions on Government amendments
Nos. 339 to 343. I draw attention to Government amendments Nos. 339 and
342, which will introduce changes in the Bill to ensure that the
&#163;30,000 charge should be creditable under the UK-US double
taxation agreement. I was keen to address that concern. I commend the
group of amendments to the Committee and am happy to respond in detail
to any
questions.</div><a name="08061963000056"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061963000237"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> Amendment No. 52 is in my name and those of my
hon. Friends so I will explain the purpose of it. Before I start, I
remember being criticised by Committee members for my absence of
drafting skills on Tuesday afternoon. Given the number of Government
amendments to the schedule, there are others who need to do their
homework in that regard. This part of the Bill is a cautionary tale for
the Government about the perils of aping Conservative policy. All kinds
of lessons can be learned from looking at these proposals in more
detail.</div><a name="08061963000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Institute of Chartered Accountants, among others, was concerned about
this proposal. It may not have much of an impact on the so-called
super-rich, who will feel that the levy is not too much of a financial
burden, but it may have a detrimental impact on other categories of
people, particularly those with less money. There may be damaging
consequences for some individuals, for certain sections of the economy
and for the UK economy as a
whole.</div><a name="08061963000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 52 would delay the implementation of new section 809G(4), which
sets the &#163;30,000 charge for claiming the remittance basis, until
the Treasury has produced a report to assess the impact of the charge
on three categories. The first is foreign nationals in low-paid 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column804" />Column number: 804</div>employment, a number of whom make contributions in our constituencies in
areas with shortages of UK and EU residents willing to undertake
certain tasks. The second is small businesses employing foreign
nationals. The third is higher education institutions, on which I
touched on Tuesday when the Financial Secretary conceded, following an
intervention from the hon. Member for Wirral, South, that the
Government had not undertaken any appraisal of the impact of these
proposals on the UK higher education sector. She anticipated that it
would not be a profound impact, but that was not based on a detailed
assessment undertaken by the Department. The purpose of amendment No.
52 is to delay the &#163;30,000
charge.</div><a name="08061963000059"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08061963000238"></a><b class="B">Ben
Chapman</b> (Wirral, South) (Lab): May I make the point that
my question related to the case made by the Liberal Democrats on the
proposal under discussion? It did not relate to the case that had or
had not been made by the
Government.</div><a name="08061963000060"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061963000239"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> I have the highest regard for the hon. Gentleman
so I do not wish to imply that he had been disloyal or troublesome as a
member of the Committee. He has wisely shown no inclination to do
that.</div><a name="08061963000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
conclusion, the purpose of amendment No. 52 is to allow greater
reflection on the impact of the &#163;30,000 charge on the groups
that I
mentioned.</div><a name="08061963000062"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061963000240"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I should like to raise a couple of questions on the
Government amendments. In moving the amendment, the Financial Secretary
made a point about ensuring that the &#163;30,000 charge is
creditable under the UK-US double taxation treaty. I wonder what
happened in the period between the Budget and the Government tabling
these amendments. The Treasury commissioned Skadden, a respected US law
firm, to comment on the creditability of the charge as set out in the
Budget. The conclusion it reached was that in the absence of current
guidance by the US treasury or the IRS, the charge would be creditable
against United States federal income tax. To be fair to them and to the
Minister, there followed various caveats, as lawyers are very good at,
but will the Minister set out more clearly, for the benefit of those
who pay close interest in these proceedings, who are concerned about
creditability, what aspects of the amendment improve the chance of the
IRS and the US treasury seeing it as a creditable tax
charge?</div><a name="08061963000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the specific amendments, amendment No. 339 puts a cap on the remittance
charge at &#163;30,000. The Institute of Chartered Accountants asks
what happens if the amount nominated exceeds &#163;30,000, either by
error&#151;if an individual has nominated higher gains or income by
mistake&#151;or if, when looking at the amounts to be nominated,
having originally reached a point of having &#163;30,000, later on
perhaps a relief has been changed or amended which means that, because
of those tax changes, the gains exceed
&#163;30,000.</div><a name="08061963000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 342 sets out what happens when an individual nominates less than
&#163;30,000 upon income or gains. The amendment treats that
individual as if they had nominated &#163;30,000. Would it not have
been easier for taxpayers simply to elect to use a remittance basis
without having to nominate the gains? The amendment seems to create a
situation where, if someone only nominated, say, &#163;1, they would
be deemed to have 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column805" />Column number: 805</div>nominated &#163;30,000. I am not sure why the Government have gone
down the route of that complicated nomination process when it appears
from their amendment that, if someone fails to nominate, it can be
deemed that they had nominated
&#163;30,000.</div><a name="08061963000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 346 makes it clear that only those gains or income that have not
been nominated are taken into account when capital, income or gains
have been remitted. Would the Minister outline what the consequence
will be if the taxpayer remits nominated foreign income or
gains?</div><a name="08061963000066"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061963000241"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> I invite the hon. Member for Taunton to be a
little cautious in representing his party, bearing in mind the comments
of his hon. Friend the Member for Twickenham who, as recently as their
party&#146;s spring conference in my home city of Liverpool, divided
the UK into taxpayers and tax dodgers. I think that their policy is to
abolish the remittance basis altogether after a certain period of
residence in the UK. Inviting resident non-domiciles to pay up or pack
up is not in the interests of UK competitiveness and fails to recognise
the major contribution that resident non-domicile individuals make to
the UK economy. We have made it clear that we will retain the
remittance basis, and the changes we are making are precisely to ensure
that the remittance basis remains sustainable in the long run. By
making it a more fair and transparent system, we believe that that
sustainability is very much
improved.</div><a name="08061963000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Taunton also criticises the number of Government
amendments that have been tabled. It is clearly a large number, but he
did, in the earlier debate, indicate that often we cannot win when we
seek to make changes to an original proposal. Draft clauses having been
published in January, we then received representations on the detail of
the draft, made changes to the draft, and made further changes after
further representations. We sought throughout the whole of that process
to ensure that we arrive at the right outcome. I believe that we have
now done
that.</div><a name="08061963000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
12 Government amendments arise from discussions with representative
bodies and interested parties since the publication of the Bill. I can
assure the Committee that the issues raised by the British-American
Business Council will be fed into discussions with the US on the double
taxation treaty.</div>
<a name="08061963000176"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.30
am</div><a name="08061963000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
quick response to the early questions about what has happened since the
publication of the legal advice that we had earlier this year, there
has been a number of informal discussions between HMRC and the IRS, the
American tax authorities, to ensure that what we sought to achieve and
the legal advice we had received and published was accurate. Legal
advice is often open to interpretation. We did not want to go forward
with a set of proposals that might have been interpreted differently by
the American authorities. That is why the changes we have made have
been brought forward. We will continue to keep an open ear to the
concerns that the British-American Business Council may
have.</div><a name="08061963000070"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061963000242"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> We should all be grateful that the Government have
had that dialogue with the IRS, and the amendments reflect that. Was
there much dialogue 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column806" />Column number: 806</div>between the Treasury and the IRS before the publication of the Finance
Bill? These matters could have been raised and discussed at that point,
rather than the Government having to come back to table
amendments.</div><a name="08061963000071"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061963000243"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> There is always informal dialogue between the tax
authorities at various levels, particularly when treaties are in
operation, as is the case with the United States. There is regular
contact to ensure that the treaty is working properly, and to keep the
situation under review.</div>
<a name="08061963000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">I cannot say
what detailed discussions took place between the Treasury and the IRS
in the United States before we published the discussion document, but
we certainly had discussions to bring us to the point at which we
believed our proposals would work for American citizens. It became
clear that further work needed to be done to make sure that our
understanding was as accurate as possible and did not impact in a
negative way on American citizens living and working in the
UK.</div>
<a name="08061963000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Fareham asked a number of questions. Regarding the top-up
provision, I have said before that that is a matter of personal choice.
The provision applies only if an individual chooses not to nominate
sufficient income or gains to give rise to a &#163;30,000 tax charge.
If they are concerned about the top-up provision applying to them they
can nominate gains in their return.</div>
<a name="08061963000074"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061963000244"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> What would be the consequence if they did not
nominate sufficient
gains?</div><a name="08061963000075"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061963000245"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> If they have already remitted all their taxed
income and gains they will not be taxed if they remit the nominated
income or gains. If they still have unremitted untaxed income and
gains, the rules treat them as having remitted the untaxed income and
gains before the nominated income and gains.</div>
<a name="08061963000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">That may not
be the clearest explanation the hon. Gentleman has ever heard, but this
is a complex area and I want to be sure that I give the clearest answer
possible, rather than cause confusion for those who are listening with
interest to our deliberations.</div>
<a name="08061963000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">Changing the top-up
charge with a deemed nomination as we propose is a direct response to
the informal discussions that took place. Nominating income is
important to secure creditability and it is important that that is a
tax on an actual amount of money, which is why the legislation was
drafted to make a nomination of &#163;1, rather than no nomination,
and provide a base under which the &#163;30,000 remittance basis
charge could be credited.</div>
<a name="08061963000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I said,
the amendments replace the current top-up charge with a deemed
nomination. I recognise that the changes are complicated, but the
Committee will agree that it is important to ensure that the
&#163;30,000 amount is creditable. The main Opposition party and the
Government agreed that it was reasonable to introduce such a charge,
and if the party of the hon. Member for Fareham had dealt with the
details, it, too, would have had to consider those issues. Stakeholders
made it clear to us that this was a key issue and we have responded.
Government amendments Nos. 349 and 348 make the necessary changes to
clarify the fact that the normal time limits and procedures apply both
to claims with a remittance 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column807" />Column number: 807</div>basis and to claims of capital gains tax losses by remittance basis
users. Finally, the remaining Government amendments make a number of
consequential and minor changes in response to the comments that we
received. They ensure that the legislation works as intended, and makes
things clearer for taxpayers and their advisers. It is likely that we
will table further amendments on Report, so we will have an opportunity
to look in greater detail at some of these issues. The deeming
provision always applies to make the charge &#163;30,000, even if
someone does not nominate enough income or gains. If an individual
really does not have enough, they should opt out of the remittance
basis altogether. As I have repeatedly said, that is a choice that
individuals have to make, depending on the details of their personal
circumstances.</div>
<a name="08061963000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
52 seeks to delay the implementation of the &#163;30,000 charge.
Delaying the implementation would simply prolong the uncertainty in the
intervening period, and there would be a cost to the Exchequer of
doings so in the region of &#163;300 million. The hon. Member for
Taunton did not say anything about how he would find that cost. In
introducing this package of changes, I believe we have found the right
balance based on the evidence available to us. I urge hon. Members to
support the 12 Government amendments, and I hope that the hon. Member
for Taunton will withdraw amendment No. 52.</div>

<a name="08061963000168"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;it remains too
low to exclude many non-doms who, realistically, are not the target of
these
provisions.&#148;</div><a name="08061963000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 49 and 50 have the combined effect of altering the &#163;2,000
level so that it reads &#147;&#163;5,435&#148;. That is on the
recommendation of the Institute of Chartered Accountants, which
suggested a more appropriate de minimis level would be in line with the
personal allowance for income tax. That is how we arrived at that
rather unrounded figure, which would further ease the compliance burden
as well as setting the level at a rate that would be less likely to
penalise unfairly workers who have made a contribution to the United
Kingdom economy.</div>
<a name="08061963000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">In an ideal
world, the de minimis level should not be fixed but should be amended,
subject to changes in need. That is the intention of amendment No. 51,
which would require the Chancellor to undertake an annual review of the
level that has been set. I would be interested to know if the Minister
would consider such a review, and also if she will engage with the
argument to increase the level from the rather limited figure of
&#163;2,000 to a figure of &#163;5,435.</div>
<a name="08061963000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">I conclude my
contribution on this schedule with a quote from PricewaterhouseCoopers
on this matter, which goes to the nub of the problem. It said that the
amount of the de minimis
level</div><a name="08061963000169"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;is
unlikely to cover everyday situations such as the rent on the let-out
flat back home, or earnings from helping with the family farm in the
summer, or a student&#146;s summer vacation job at home. It is the
lower paid who will be hit hardest by this and HMRC is not in a
position to deal with the practicalities of educating and coping with
this
community.&#148;</div><a name="08061963000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
nub of the problem is that the measure is regarded by observers of
politics as one that was introduced to recoup money from extremely rich
people who choose to earn large amounts of money in this country. The
stereotypical picture that is painted is of an extremely rich banker in
the City who is not making a large contribution to our tax base.
However, many more people are affected by the measure. The intention of
the amendments is to try to ensure that those people are not unfairly
snared in the system and
penalised.</div><a name="08061963000094"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08061963000250"></a><b class="B">Stewart
Hosie</b> (Dundee, East) (SNP): Can the hon. Gentleman confirm
that the measure applies to people who have chosen not to use the
remittance basis, rather than to those who have chosen to use it, and
that the numbers involved are not just the 120,000 or 130,000 wealthy
non-doms who are normally spoken about but perhaps up to 5 million
other people who fall into that category, one way or
another?</div><a name="08061963000095"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061963000251"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> Yes is the short answer to that question. We could
have a debate about the figure of 5 million that the hon. Gentleman
mentioned, because I understand that that is an estimate or a
prediction of the maximum number of people involved. However, his
comment was helpful, because he expanded on the point that I was 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column809" />Column number: 809</div>seeking to make, which is that these measures are often regarded by the
wider commentating classes and the population as a whole as being
mainly concerned with the tax affairs of people who are relatively
wealthy, but there are large numbers of people working in the United
Kingdom and remitting money who are not very wealthy. Indeed, they are
on the lower end of the income scale, and they contribute to our
economy by doing work that people in this country do not have the
skills or, more likely still, the inclination to do
themselves.</div>
<a name="08061963000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are therefore talking about a category of people to whom we would not
wish to do anything other than encourage regarding the contribution
that they make to our economy. The proposal in amendments Nos. 49 and
50 seeks to ease the burden on those people in a way that is more
equitable than the arrangements envisaged by the Government in the
Bill.</div>
<a name="08061963000097"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061963000252"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I want to talk principally to amendments Nos. 402
and 361, which are in my name and those of my hon. Friends. I would
also like to use this debate as an opportunity to discuss further the
issue that the hon. Member for Taunton has mentioned, which is the
treatment of large numbers of people who are going to be subject to
these rules. He is right to say that much of the debate has focused on
relatively wealthy individuals, but a large number of people have
raised concerns about people on much lower incomes who will fall within
the remit of the
changes.</div><a name="08061963000177"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.45
am</div><a name="08061963000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I understand it, the de minimis limit that the Government have
introduced is designed to take people at low levels of foreign income
and gains out of the tax system, and to help lift the burden of
compliance on taxpayers and HMRC. The Minister said in the previous
debate that people will have to make a choice, and that they will need
to make a decision and do some calculations as to whether the rules
apply. We are asking taxpayers to make a decision: should they claim
the remittance basis and lose the personal allowances, or should they
be taxed on an arising basis, then seek to offset foreign tax against
UK
tax?</div><a name="08061963000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those
calculations will be made not just by high net worth individuals who
have access to expensive accountants and lawyers. They will have to be
made by migrant workers, seasonal workers who come into the UK to pick
fruit and help in the agriculture industry, people from overseas
working in the NHS, skilled migrants entering through Home Office
programmes, international students&#151;we spoke about them
earlier&#151;and even Commonwealth citizens serving in the armed
forces. The Low Incomes Tax Reform Group has highlighted the range of
people who may be caught by the
measure.</div><a name="08061963000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is worth bearing in mind some of the comments that have been made about
the issue. John Whiting, who was cited earlier, said in evidence to the
House of Lords Economic Affairs
Committee:</div><a name="08061963000170"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It
is of great concern that we have here a provision that will affect a
considerable number of the vast majority of non-domiciles who are not
only unaware of the term &#145;non-domicile&#146; in many
cases...but because of the situation back home...because of
the work they do back home, or their summer job back home, or the rent
on their flat, are suddenly losing their personal allowances...It
seems unfair, at best, and, actually, totally
impractical&#148;.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column810" />Column number: 810</div><a name="08061963000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall raise some
questions about that later. That view is shared by several people who
gave evidence and made representations to
us.</div><a name="08061963000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Low Incomes Tax Reform Group suggested that HMRC needs to make sure,
before people set foot in this country, that they understand
remittances and how the relevant double tax treaty works. It will be
necessary for them to consult agreements in the years of arrival and
departure&#151;every year for seasonal workers who have a pattern of
being in two countries on a regular basis&#151;to establish, for the
purposes of the double tax treaty, in which country they are resident.
Once they have established that, they will be able to determine which
country has the primary right to
tax.</div><a name="08061963000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">People
also need to think about how tax credit relief claims can be made;
about withholding taxes that may have been levied on earnings and bank
interest; and about how those taxes will be credited under the UK
system. There are quite a few complex issues that migrant workers need
to understand to make the choice that the Minister mentioned earlier.
There are other issues, too. What about income that arises in the tax
year of arrival, before the individual becomes resident? There are some
issues concerning split years. In the past, extra-statutory concession
A11 looked at how income could be treated in a split year, and whether
it was feasible for income earned before someone became resident in the
UK should be disregarded for UK tax. Can the Minister indicate whether
she has given any thought to the situation of someone who becomes
resident in the middle of the year? Is the foreign income that they
earned before they arrived in the UK disregarded? That would certainly
make the regime easier to use, but, as a consequence of the Wilkinson
judgment&#151;we had a debate about it on Tuesday&#151;I am not
sure whether A11 will still apply. Clearly, that is important in trying
to ensure that there is a workable regime for
migrants.</div><a name="08061963000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
of the examples deals with capital gains tax and the position for
temporary visitors who keep their home abroad, and how that applies to
migrant workers. There are some significant issues and if there are
issues for migrant workers themselves, there will be issues for the
administration of the system by HMRC. Malcolm Gammie from the Institute
for Fiscal Studies put it this way:</div>
<a name="08061963000171"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Precisely
how it will be possible actually to administer that exemption and how
Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs will actually be able to check
whether people are doing this correctly is, I think, one of the more
significant questions which arises from an administrative perspective
in relation to these arrangements&#148;.</div>
<a name="08061963000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">Francesca Lagerberg
from the Institute of Chartered Accountants wondered how</div>
<a name="08061963000172"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;from a resource
perspective, HMRC are going to police whether that &#163;2,000 de
minimis is being properly operated and that is a big ask ... do they
have the resources to do that, the training to do it and the
understanding of the issues around it? It is a massive undertaking. We
were very concerned about the compliance, the admin work placed upon
HMRC and upon the taxpayer that that particular de minimis will
bring&#148;.</div>
<a name="08061963000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">HMRC is very
confident that it will be able to deal with this. David Richardson from
HMRC said:</div>
<a name="08061963000173"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
reality it is quite simple for most people... Although some choose to
present it as
complicated&#148;.</div><a name="08061963000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">Indeed,
the Minister&#146;s response might be that those people who are
raising issues about de minimis are making it far more complicated than
it is, but that slightly complacent answer underplays the full extent
of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column811" />Column number: 811</div>the problem. The Minister last week referred to a bank balance of about
&#163;1.6 million. We are talking about people who are earning some
money while they are back home in the country where they are domiciled.
They are migrant workers who will perhaps spend time in the UK working
and will then return home.</div>
<a name="08061963000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
some issues about the cost of compliance both for HMRC and for the
people who are subject to this regime&#151;individuals who are
non-domiciled in the UK, but are resident here. That is where amendment
No. 402 comes into play. The objective is to understand the point at
which it is worth introducing this regime, and where the de minimis
limit should be set by reference to the cost of compliance to the
taxpayer and HMRC. There is no point trying to collect revenue if the
cost of collection exceeds the revenue that will be collected. That is
a better approach to looking at the impact of the de minimis limit than
setting an arbitrary figure in the Bill. We need to understand exactly
what the Government expect the costs of compliance will be for both the
tax payer and
HMRC.</div><a name="08061963000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 361 would amend a change that the Government have made: where there
is a spouse or a child under the age of 18 they are not required to pay
the &#163;30,000 charge. Under amendment No. 361, rather than having
no income, the income that they would earn would be below the de
minimis limit. A spouse may have a bank account that earns some
interest. Rather than catching relatively small amounts, the de minimis
limit would apply in that case.</div>
<a name="08061963000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should like
to make one further comment about the interaction of these arrangements
with the tax treaties. I touched on this briefly on Tuesday when I
intervened on the Minister to ask which took precedence: double tax
treaty rules or these rules. There are some issues around the number of
years that might be treated as resident. The question arises as to what
years should be counted for the purpose of the test, where a taxpayer
may be resident in the UK under UK law but is also resident in another
country. If, under the double tax treaty, the taxpayer is treated as
not being resident in the UK for a particular year, does that mean that
they are not resident in the UK for the purpose of the
seven-out-of-nine-years
rule?</div><a name="08061963000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is usual for
a double tax treaty to contain clauses to determine residency. Often,
there is a tie-breaker clause where the general tax laws would result
in an individual&#146;s being a dual resident. In cases of
difficulty, it is usual for the two countries to decide the question by
mutual agreement. For example, the US-UK tax treaty has that facility
at the moment. It would be helpful if the Minister expanded a little
bit&#151;certainly in respect of migrant workers&#151;on how the
double tax treaties will work, how applicable they are and the extent
to which they override the existing rules. I understand that some
double tax treaties deal with split-year arrival or departure, but in
other situations that may not apply. That refers back to the point
about extra-statutory concession
A11.</div><a name="08061963000112"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08061963000253"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Mark Field</b> (Cities of London and Westminster) (Con): I
shall be brief, as it is not an appropriate time to have a full debate
on all aspects of the proposal for non-domicile tax. I have always been
sympathetic towards elements of such a tax, but there is grave concern
about the lack of certainty in this area.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column812" />Column number: 812</div><a name="08061963000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">I accept that,
as the Minister said, these are often quite complicated matters. The
concern is not necessarily whether that lack of certainty is
justified&#151;professionally qualified people probably can work
their way through a mesh of different regulations. However, such a
perception could do grave damage to this country as an open and
welcoming one in a global world. I accept that that is by no means the
single most important consideration. None the less, in the City of
London there is a worry that we could run the risk of losing some
talented people, who will go to Singapore, Dubai or other parts of the
world rather than settling on these
shores.</div><a name="08061963000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">With
reference to the amendments, I have a lot of sympathy with the idea of
having a larger de minimis provision. Otherwise, we run the risk, as my
hon. Friend the Member for Fareham said, of encountering two problems.
First, there is the sheer cost of compliance, which will be every bit
as much a cost to HMRC as it will be to the taxpayers concerned.
Secondly, above all, that makes this a potentially inefficient tax,
which should not go unremarked on by Opposition Members. I am
interested to hear the Minister&#146;s
response.</div><a name="08061963000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">Recalling
elements of an earlier debate, a particular problem that we are facing
is not so much that relatively low-paid people are coming to work in
this country as immigrants and taking the jobs of our indigenous
population, but that the disincentive to work is often so great,
particularly because of social housing and the tenure that comes with
it&#151;and all the housing benefit that goes with that&#151;that
we run a real risk of unintended consequences arising from what is
emerging in a lot of
legislation.</div><a name="08061963000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that the Minister will reassure us that she is giving some thought
to these matters. Without a reasonable de minimis provision, we run the
risk of pulling many more people into the provisions covering these
remittances, in a way that the Government probably do not
intend.</div><a name="08061963000178"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061963000254"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> We must consider what de minimis should be
applied to the remittance basis, alongside our decision that it is not
fair that a taxpayer should have access to both their personal
allowances, if they pay tax on the arising basis, and an allowance when
they are using the remittance
basis.</div><a name="08061963000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 50 and 51 together seek to raise the limit on the unremitted
overseas income beyond which individuals lose access to their UK
personal allowances and instead face the &#163;30,000
remittance-basis charge. The Opposition amendments are unnecessary. We
have increased the limit beyond which a remittance-basis user pays the
charge. Our original proposal was &#163;1,000. In direct response to
the representations that we received, we felt it was reasonable to
double that, in effect, to &#163;2,000.</div>
<a name="08061963000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Members for Taunton and for Fareham are concerned about whether that is
in the interest of low-income migrant workers. I reassure the Committee
that low-income migrant workers who have more than &#163;2,000 of
unremitted foreign income and gains for the year are unlikely to pay
more tax as a result of the new rules on the remittance basis. It is
worth remembering that to earn &#163;2,000 of interest on a foreign
bank account would require about &#163;40,000 of capital invested in
that income 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column813" />Column number: 813</div>at an interest rate of about 5 per cent. I think hon. Members will agree
that that is a substantial sum of
money.</div><a name="08061963000120"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08061963000255"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Greg Hands</b> (Hammersmith and Fulham) (Con): It strikes me
that a migrant worker could well have &#163;40,000 in a bank account.
About 6 per cent. of my constituency is Polish, and many of those
people are saving back home to build a house or some other kind of
property. It seems to me not impossible that &#163;40,000 could be a
realistic sum to have in a bank
account.</div><a name="08061963000121"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061963000256"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> We need to keep clearly in mind that the de
minimis limit we are discussing does not refer to income in the UK. It
refers to the income that the worker leaves offshore. I know the hon.
Gentleman understands that, but I do not think it is always fully
understood.</div>
<a name="08061963000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall deal
in more detail about the work being undertaken to ensure that the
greatest possible clarity and assistance is given to those who may be
concerned about the impact of the proposal. It is important to remember
that individuals have a choice about paying tax using the arising
basis. There are a number of decision points, depending upon individual
circumstances, when it may be in the individual&#146;s interest to be
in one place or the other.</div>
<a name="08061963000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">All the
advice I have received leads me to conclude that the majority of
migrant workers with modest earnings will be better off using the
arising basis, as they will be able to claim relief from foreign tax
paid. HMRC will provide additional targeted help and guidance for this
group of taxpayers. A limit set at the level of the personal allowance
as proposed by the amendments would cost us around &#163;40 million a
year.</div><a name="08061963000124"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061963000257"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> The Minister suggested that it may be beneficial
for migrant workers to be taxed on an arising basis, and talked about
the work that HMRC will do to ensure that they are aware of these
issues. Does that mean, for example, that HMRC is going to produce
easily comprehensible guides to double tax
treaties?</div><a name="08061963000125"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061963000258"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> I will come to that in a moment, but I want to
address one or two other points that have been raised. The hon. Member
for Dundee, East, who is temporarily not in his seat, asked whether
people not claiming the remittance basis would be affected by the de
minimis limit. This is an example of the misunderstandings that exist,
which it is helpful for me to
clarify.</div><a name="08061963000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">Such
individuals would not be affected by the de minimis. They would be
opting for the arising basis of tax, and therefore would not be
affected. Following from that, there are many decisions for people to
make. The legislation works by applying the arising basis
automatically. Resident non-domiciles, and migrant workers in
particular, would have to claim the remittance basis. If people do not
claim, there is no complexity and they are on the same tax basis as the
vast majority of UK citizens. The vast majority of low-income migrant
workers are either under the &#163;2,000 limit, or better off on an
arising basis.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column814" />Column number: 814</div><a name="08061963000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Hammersmith and Fulham talked about the Polish workers
living and working in his constituency. I, too, have significant
numbers in my constituency, and they make a great contribution to
Liverpool. Is it not fairer that someone with that much offshore income
back in their home country should make a contribution, when other UK
residents are taxed on income well below that level?</div>
<a name="08061963000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">Questions
have been asked about HMRC&#146;s ability to cope. Although the new
rules will apply from 6 April this year, it is important to remember
that individuals will not need to make a claim to the remittance basis
for this tax year until after April 2009 at the earliest, and the first
filing date for paper returns will not be until 31 October
2009. There is time, therefore, to put in place new procedures and
resource, as needed, to ensure that HMRC administers the new rules
effectively.</div>
<a name="08061963000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">HMRC is
updating all the guidance on residence and domicile, and there will be
several layers of guidance including material aimed at providing
simple, non-technical explanations of the concepts and rules. HMRC will
consult stakeholders on the guidance&#151;my officials met the Low
Incomes Tax Reform Group yesterday to take forward work on the
guidance. We are aware of the concerns, and are working hard to address
them.</div><a name="08061963000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Fareham asked whether the extra-statutory concession
A11 would apply. In our brief discussion of extra-statutory concessions
yesterday, I indicated that a great deal of work going on. The
concession will continue to apply, but if we are to consider a
statutory residence test, it would be appropriate that such discussions
take account of the extra-statutory concession A11, as we will want to
consider any split-year treatment as part of that
dialogue.</div><a name="08061963000131"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061963000259"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> Will the Minister confirm, therefore, that for
somebody who comes to the UK part-way through the tax year, their
earnings in their normal place of domicile will not be counted towards
the &#163;2,000 de minimis limit, as the extra-statutory concession
A11 will continue to apply until the statutory residence
test?</div><a name="08061963000132"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061963000260"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> I can confirm that if the extra-statutory
concession applies to such an individual now, it will continue to
apply.</div>
<a name="08061963000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">HMRC
will rely on a range of approaches to avoid the problems of compliance
described this morning. Its guidance will help people to make the right
choices, and it would not be sensible for HMRC to seek to enforce the
collection of small amounts of tax. That would not be
economical&#151;for example, it will not spend &#163;500 to collect
&#163;100.</div>
<a name="08061963000134"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061963000261"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> As I understand it, the default position will be
that people will be taxed on an arising basis. How will HMRC work out
whether that basis is appropriate and that people are complying with
the rules? Somebody might be taxed on their earnings in the UK on an
arising basis and claims for personal allowances, but might not have
declared, for example, that they are earning &#163;3,000 in rent on
their flat in Warsaw. How will HMRC identify those facts and ensure
proper
compliance?</div><a name="08061963000135"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061963000262"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> With regard to amendment No. 402, HMRC is
required to administer all taxes efficiently and in the least
burdensome way possible, and that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column815" />Column number: 815</div>already includes the sort of cost-to-yield ratio calculation that we
have just been discussing. I do not see a case for separating out, as
proposed in the amendment, as part of the tax system for those already
being reported on, and we do not believe that there will be an increase
in the administrative cost of the remittance basis as a result of
implementing the reforms. As I said, HMRC will provide support and
guidance for migrant workers and other low-income groups, and we are
working with key stakeholders to ensure that that is targeted
appropriately.</div><a name="08061963000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman will know that individuals will be required to
self-assess. HMRC will not increase its surveillance or policing of
resident non-domiciled communities. The system will be based on the
normal procedures of individuals being required to self-assess their
liability to pay tax.</div>
<a name="08061963000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
49 would mean that the level of the limit was reviewed annually. Again,
that is unnecessary. The Committee will recognise that any future
increase in the level of the limit would be enacted in a Finance Bill
and would be subject to discussion and debate at that time.</div>
<a name="08061963000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
361 would exempt someone from having to make a claim for the remittance
basis if they have less than &#163;2,000 income or gains arising in
the
UK.</div><a name="08061963000139"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061963000263"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> Would not it be helpful if, between Budgets, the
Chancellor had come to the House to raise the personal allowance owing
to an error in a previous Budget? Should not there be some scope in the
legislation to allow adjustments to be made in such
circumstances?</div><a name="08061963000140"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061963000264"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> The short answer is
no.</div><a name="08061963000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
amendment No. 361, people with no income or gains are permitted to
access the remittance basis without a claim, as I said. Introducing an
exemption for &#163;2,000 could create tax avoidance possibilities.
Individuals have a choice between keeping their personal allowance or
claiming the remittance basis. The amendment would give people a
&#163;2,000 personal allowance with the remittance basis, which would
disturb the balance of fairness that we have sought to
achieve.</div> <a name="08061963000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">On double
taxation treaties, it depends on the individual&#146;s circumstances,
their home country and the nature of the tax treaty with that country.
Unless there is a specific example that might illuminate that and to
which I could respond on Report, having considered it, I cannot give
much more than that general response. It will depend on the
circumstances of a particular individual and the terms of the relevant
tax treaty. I have answered most of the points that have been raised,
but I am sure that we will return to some of these
issues.</div><a name="08061963000143"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061963000265"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> The number of amendments to the schedule that have
been tabled indicates the confusion in the Government&#146;s mind
about this whole area of taxation. I agree with the view that has been
expressed by others, including the hon. Member for Cities of London and
Westminster, that there are practical issues relating to implementation
and information to employers and employees about the consequences of
the arrangements and the potential revenue implications. Different
people have different ideas about what is &#147;fair&#148;, but
several members of the Committee have expressed concerns 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column816" />Column number: 816</div>about the impact of the proposals on people with low and low-to-middling
incomes who are making a contribution to our economy.</div>
<a name="08061963000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is only
so much that we can do in Committee to save the Government from
themselves, and I am content to have made those opinions available to
the Minister. She is, of course, within her rights to ignore them and
suffer the consequences later. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="08061963000145"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

there are 10 minutes before we break, and when we reassemble at 1
o&#146;clock we have three hours. We have a further 10 major debates

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061963000269"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I said
&#147;mindful&#148;.</div><a name="08061963000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is a point of disagreement between us and the Government. The
Government decided that, as part of their rules for the taxation of
resident non-domiciles, they would no longer benefit from personal
allowances. That cropped up in the previous debate. Our point is that
people with relatively modest overseas income could end up paying tax
on all their income, without the benefit of any personal allowances.
Furthermore, because of the way in which the provision is structured,
they might also lose their annual exempt amount under capital gains
tax. That could lead to them being taxed on relatively small gains if
they have already used their de minimis limit of
&#163;2,000.</div><a name="08061963000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
will also be an issue for companies. The Minister said that people
will, by default, be taxed on an arising basis and will be able make
their claim for remittance basis when the tax year has ended, but
clearly employers will assume that people qualify for personal
allowances and will tax them on that basis, so either the individual
will have to repay the benefit from that tax allowance, or part of the
way through the yea they will elect the remittance basis and advise
their employer
appropriately.</div><a name="08061963000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
compliance cost for business will arise from the loss of personal
allowance and people&#146;s decision about that. That will add to the
burden on companies. The Association of Labour Providers, a body that
has not previously been cited during our proceedings, has highlighted
some of the challenges that will arise when people move between the UK
and other territories. It pointed out that 52 per cent. of registrants
under the Department for Work and Pensions scheme were in temporary
employment, and 57 per cent. said that they 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column817" />Column number: 817</div>intended to stay for less than three months, while only 12 per cent.
said that they intended to stay for more than a
year.</div><a name="08061963000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
demonstrates some of the challenges for migrant workers in complying
and for employers in, for example, providing advice on whether workers
should be taxed on a remittance basis or retain their personal
allowances and be taxed on an arising basis. We discussed those points
during previous debates, and I shall not reiterate them. To make it
easier for those individuals, it may be better to reinstate the
personal allowances and to lift the burden rather than changing the de
minimise limit, as was proposed in the previous group of
amendments.</div><a name="08061963000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
issue goes back to double taxation treaties. John Whiting suggested
that although these rules withdraw personal allowances, they may have
to be reinstated under some double taxation treaties, which again adds
to the confusion and complexity that taxpayers will have to navigate.
It would be helpful if the Minister would indicate whether taxation
treaties will be able to override the withdrawal of personal
allowances. If so, it might be easier for the Government to return to
personal
allowances.</div><a name="08061963000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
final point is about capital gains tax. The Government&#146;s
proposals not only exclude the personal allowance, but take away the
annual exempt allowance. In terms of the compliance burden on HMRC, the
current reporting requirements for CGT are linked to the annual exempt
allowance. If the annual exempt allowance for resident non-domiciles is
removed, they will need to report any gains that they make. That will
lead to a disproportionate increase in the administrative burden on
both HMRC and the taxpayer.</div>
<a name="08061963000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">I note the
Minister&#146;s comments in the last debate about HMRC not pursuing
relatively small amounts of tax, but in theory a taxpayer would be
required to report a relatively small gain&#151;a gain as small as
&#163;5&#151;on overseas property, for example. They would need to
complete all the CGT pages of the tax return and would potentially pay
CGT of 90p on a &#163;5 gain. By wiping away the annual exempt
allowance, we are in danger of increasing the burden on the taxpayer,
requiring them to submit more forms than strictly necessary to comply
with the rules. That is the impact of the abolition of personal
allowances, and I am grateful for the Minister&#146;s comments on
both the personal allowance and the withdrawal of the annual exempt
allowance.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061963000270"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> We have been clear from the outset that it is
unfair for a remittance basis user to continue to have the double
benefit of the remittance basis and UK personal allowances. We have
responded to concerns that remittance basis users with small amounts of
overseas income or gains would be adversely affected by the loss of the
personal allowances, by raising the limit above which a remittance
basis user would lose that personal allowance from &#163;1,000 to
&#163;2,000 of unremitted overseas income and gains. Above that
level, people who do not want to lose their personal allowances can
choose to be taxed on the arising basis like the majority of UK
taxpayers. We believe that that strikes the right balance. We do not
believe that it will be an extra burden on employers, because it will
all be done through self-assessment.</div>
<a name="08061963000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">I note the
hon. Gentleman&#146;s point that some employers may have concerns for
their employees, and I will give the matter some thought. However, I do
not believe that it will be a burden for employers. It is technically
possible for a small number of our double taxation treaties to prevent
the removal of the personal allowances when an individual claims the
remittance basis. In practice, however, the circumstances would be very
unusual. The individual would have to be treated as resident in both
the UK and another country during the year, the double taxation
agreement would have to treat them as treaty resident in the other
country, and they would have to have certain sorts of investments in
order to make it worth their while to claim the remittance basis. As a
result, we anticipate that the number of people to whom this applies
will be tiny. Those who do benefit will still be liable for the
&#163;30,000
charge.</div><a name="08061963000161"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061963000272"></a>Jane

would be helpful to the Committee, I will establish which countries
those 16 apply to and return with that information after our

<a name="08061963000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">Individuals
have a choice. If they want to claim the remittance basis, they will
lose their personal allowances and the annual exempt amount. No one
will be forced to claim the remittance basis. Individuals need to make
a decision on whether or not to claim, based on their own
circumstances.</div>
