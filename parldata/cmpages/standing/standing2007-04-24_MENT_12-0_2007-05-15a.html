							<b class="B">Angela
Browning</b> (Tiverton and Honiton) (Con): I beg to move
amendment No. 11, in schedule 6, page 79, line 9, at end
insert&#151;</div>
					<div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(3) Where the
managing authority deprives P of his liberty by detaining him as
mentioned in paragraph 1(2), the appropriate NHS body or local
authority which has authorised the detention shall make arrangements
for the provision of the accommodation with care or treatment, and it
shall be free of
charge.&#146;.</div>
					<a name="07051610000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
come now to the question of charges and the Government&#146;s
provision to amend the Mental Capacity Act 2005. The issue was debated
in another place, but the Government rejected its proposals, so I make
no apology for reintroducing it in Committee.</div>
					<a name="07051610000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are clear differences in
the treatment of patients deprived of their liberty under the Mental
Capacity Act and that applied to those deprived of their liberty under
the Mental Health Act 1983. In the previous sitting, I alluded to the
fact that I hope that the Minister will give some clarification
regarding those patients who drift, as it were, between one piece of
legislation and the other&#151;we have not as yet had such
clarification.</div>
					<a name="07051610000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are costs associated with the treatment of patients whose liberty has
been withdrawn under the Mental Capacity Act. Accommodation is free for
a person who is sectioned under the Mental Health Act&#151;their
liberty has been taken from them so that they can be treated&#151;but
the Government propose to charge for the accommodation and care
received by those who have their liberty deprived them under the Mental
Capacity Act. A person detained under section 3 of the Mental Health
Act would find, on discharge, that their after care was free, whereas
the Government propose that under the Mental Capacity Act, after care
will be subject to a charge.</div>
					<a name="07051610000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">Equally, the appeals process
will treat differently two groups of people who have been deprived of
their liberty. For those detained under the Mental Health Act, the
appeals process will be free, whereas there will be a charge connected
to the appeals process to the Court of Protection under the Mental
Capacity Act. We are seeing the development not only of an unequal
footing, but of a clear disadvantage, particularly on charging, for
those patients whose liberty is removed under the Mental Capacity
Act.</div>

							<b class="B">Chris
Bryant</b> (Rhondda) (Lab): This is obviously an important
issue. Will the hon. Lady comment on the situation of foreign
nationals? I have friends who are consultant psychiatrists in London.
They have told me that they regularly face foreign nationals with
personality disorders whom they have to detain&#151;they could not
possibly allow such people to go free on the streets. They are not,
however, British nationals. The consultants suspect that, sometimes,
the relatives of foreign nationals with mental health problems come to
London to dump them. That happens particularly in the case of people
from African countries that do not have suitable mental health
services. What does the hon. Lady think about charging in such a
situation?</div>

							<a name="07051610000384"></a>
								Angela
Browning:
						</b> We have clear rules about charging foreign
nationals. It is a matter for the Government to determine health
service policy, whether it is to do with physical or mental health. I
have a lot of sympathy for people who are mentally ill. They often come
to the attention of the appropriate authorities only after ending up on
the streets. Anybody who is identified as having a serious illness is
entitled to treatment&#151;charging is a matter for the Government to
decide. I would not preclude foreign nationals from receiving
appropriate treatment whether they had come here of their own volition
or been hoodwinked into coming here.</div>
					<a name="07051610000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">The legislation begins to
identify and treat people differently, and to apply different sets of
rules to people who, for their own good, have had their liberty
removed. If people are sectioned under the existing Mental Health Act,
everything is paid for, whereas those dealt with under the Mental
Capacity Act are charged for their care. The danger for the Minister is
that once the measures are operational and such things become apparent,
relatives, carers and others might try to encourage patients down the
Mental Health Act route because of the financial consequences for them
and possibly even for those associated with
them.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
Tim Boswell</b> (Daventry) (Con): Does my hon. Friend agree
that if the circumstances are broadly similar and patients are
receiving the same regime, whether formally in a hospital or otherwise,
and if the essential difference between them is that some are detained
under the Mental Health Act and some under the rather more
comprehensive provisions of the Mental Capacity Act&#151;if there is
no other difference except their in statutory detention&#151;it is a
prima facie case of discrimination under the European convention,
because the public authorities will be delivering a service partially
between one case and
another?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07051610000386"></a>
								Angela
Browning:
						</b> My hon. Friend is right. The purpose of the
amendment tabled by my hon. Friends on both ends of the Bench is to
establish what happens to a person deprived of liberty, particularly in
a care home. It is a slightly different dimension from the Mental
Health Act, because we are now considering not just hospitalisation but
another kind of accommodation&#151;care homes of one sort and
another.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column403" />Column number: 403</div>
					<a name="07051610000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">In all other cases where a
person is detained, the charges are paid, but if someone is detained in
a care home or nursing home, suddenly they are compared not to people
detained under the Mental Health Act but to other people resident in
care homes and nursing homes, who may well be there as a result of
their decision, or that of their carers or relatives, that it is in
their best interests. They might be self-funded, paid for by the local
authority or a combination of the two. I suggest to the Minister that
that is not a comparison for her to make, because such people are a
separate group from those whose liberty is denied them for their own
good but under the auspices of the Mental Capacity Act.</div>
					<a name="07051610000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Although we
agree with the proposal, we think that it is unfair to expect people to
pay once an authorisation to deprive them of their liberty has been
granted. It will put them at a disadvantage relative to all others
detained elsewhere, usually in hospitals. I think that the Minister has
been looking through the wrong end of the telescope in opposing the
amendment. I realise that it has big resource implications; of course
it does.</div>

						<b class="B"> </b>The Minister is nodding. I hope to come
to resources later in a little more detail, because she has flagged up
her concern, but the fact that she is concerned about resources is no
reason for her not to do the right and just thing. It is clearly right
and just to the group of people described in the amendment for her to
reconsider the issue. Otherwise, the consequence, perhaps unexpected,
will be that over time, the Mental Capacity Act will be used only in
certain circumstances, and that it will not be as effective, because
people will opt for the Mental Health Act. That would be quite the
wrong effect, and contrary to what she is trying to do in identifying
how she will deal with the Bournewood determination in the European
Court.</div>
					
					<a name="07051610000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07051610000389"></a>
								Ms
Winterton:
						</b> As the hon. Lady said, the amendment seeks to
provide free accommodation, care and treatment for all people deprived
of liberty under the Mental Capacity Act 2005. I would like to
challenge what she said about people choosing between the Mental Health
Act 1983 and the Mental Capacity Act because there are obvious
differences between the two. The criteria under the Mental Health Act
are that an individual has a mental disorder of a degree or nature that
they need to be in hospital, that they are a risk either to themselves
or others and that appropriate medical treatment is available for their
mental disorder. That is a very clear set of criteria. For people to be
detained under the Mental Health Act, there must be a clinical judgment
that all those criteria are met. One cannot go along and say, &#147;I
fancy being detained under the Mental Health Act.&#148; One has to
meet the strict criteria.</div>
					<a name="07051610000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the Mental Capacity Act, we
are talking about an individual with a mental disorder who does not
have the capacity to consent, and it is in their own best interests to
be deprived of liberty; they are not a danger to others. We mentioned a
number of such incidents this morning. Therefore, it is not a question
of choosing between one of the two in a pick-and-mix approach. It is
about meeting the criteria.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column404" />Column number: 404</div>
					<a name="07051610000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Let us take
the situation of a person who is being deprived of their liberty and is
in a hospital setting. That person might have advanced dementia. Their
relatives might be asked not to take that individual outside the ward
because they could become disorientated and distressed. If that was
felt to be a deprivation of liberty, that person would be assessed. Of
course, they are in a hospital setting in which the care and stay is
free. Therefore, what we are talking about is the cost of personal care
in care homes. The people to whom the new safeguards will apply in
terms of an authorisation for the deprivation of liberty will largely
be those with severe dementia or similar problems. Many of them will be
living in a residential care setting. Any financial contribution that
they may make towards the cost of their care is determined by the
national policy on means testing. Since 1948, health care has been
provided free in England and Wales and social care is mean-tested.
Nothing in those new safeguards calls into question those fundamental
principles.</div>
					<a name="07051610000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">Obviously, safeguards will add
new protections for the human rights of those people and independent
checks will ensure that it is in their best interest to be deprived of
their liberty. There will be new rights of challenge for them and their
family if they disagree with decisions. Giving people new rights and
protections is not a reason to change the arrangements that apply to
funding, health and social care.</div>
					<a name="07051610000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again, I must stress that if a
person was in a care home and subject to a standard authorisation to
deprive them of liberty, it could only be because an independent
assessment had concluded that it was necessary and in their own best
interests to keep them safe. We do not think that that should lead to
changes in the way that their care is commissioned and funded. In many
ways, the care regime for such a person is likely to be the same as
that for others in the care home with a similar condition. There will
be restrictions for the person&#146;s own protection, but that does
not mean that their whole care package should suddenly be free of
charge.</div>
					<a name="07051610000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall give
an example of an individual called Mary, who has been living in a care
home for a number of years. She has considerable means and is paying
for her care. She chose the home herself. She was able to go out
regularly and enjoyed using all the shared facilities of the home and
garden. Mary suffers from dementia and, over time, her behaviour has
become extremely disturbed in a way that puts her safety at risk, both
when she goes out and when she is in the home. Her family want her to
remain in the familiar environment of the care home as long as
possible, but it has become necessary to increase restrictions to keep
her safe. Eventually, the care home decides that all of the
restrictions may add up to a deprivation of liberty and seeks
authorisation, which is granted. However, given that those restrictions
have been granted in Mary&#146;s best interests, there is no reason
for there to be a change in how her care is
funded.</div>
				
					
					<a name="07051610000349"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.45
pm</div>
					<a name="07051610000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">We must
consider the views of residents in circumstances when care for another
resident suddenly becomes free because restrictions have been put in
place for that person&#146;s best interests, but their care does not.
Under the amendment, Mary would immediately 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column405" />Column number: 405</div>cease to pay for her care. That does not seem logical or fair to other
residents. It would create unacceptable inequities between those care
home residents who are deprived of liberty and those who are
not.</div>
					
					<a name="07051610000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Let
us consider Ruth and Jean, two ladies in their 80s who are both living
alone. Ruth develops dementia and, after a time, can no longer look
after herself. Carers are arranged, but she refuses to have them in the
house. Things come to a head when she is found in the road, late on a
winter&#146;s night, unwell and in her nightclothes&#151;something
that we know can occur. An ambulance is called. When she has recovered
enough, a placement is arranged in a care home. That move is supported
by her daughter, but disputed by her son who wants her to go back home.
Initially, Ruth is extremely unsettled in the care home and her
behaviour is very disturbed. Taking account of all the circumstances,
including the restrictions needed to keep her safe, the care home
applies for authorisation to deprive her of her liberty, and that is
granted.</div>
					<a name="07051610000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">Jean,
meanwhile, suffers a major stroke. After a period of rehabilitation,
she is not well enough to manage at home on her own. She is not able to
make the decision herself and her family, with great regret, agree that
it would be best to move her to a care home. If the amendment were
accepted, Ruth&#146;s care would be free, but Jean would have to pay
for her care. That would be
unfair.</div>
					<a name="07051610000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
decisions in such difficult cases are about whether it is necessary for
a person to be deprived of liberty and whether that should be based
purely on the genuine care and treatment needs of the person concerned.
The amendment would risk introducing financial considerations into the
equation. If we are talking about opting for different scenarios, it
would almost be better for the person to reach a situation in which
they were being deprived of their liberty because, under the amendment,
their care would then become free. That perverse incentive would arise
from the
amendment.</div>
					<a name="07051610000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
amendment would also place a duty on the NHS body or local authority
that had authorised deprivation of liberty to make arrangements for the
provision of the relevant accommodation. The supervisory body might
also be involved in commissioning care arrangements, but that would not
always be so&#151;for example, it would not be involved if a private
arrangement had been made between a family and the care
home.</div>
					<a name="07051610000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are some
genuine problems with the approach that is being proposed. We need to
ensure that there are safeguards in provision of care that requires
restrictions. Treatment is not covered. The hon. Lady&#146;s
proposals would introduce what is tantamount to an incentive for people
to be deprived of their liberty, because that would be the cheaper
option. They could also create distinctions between, for example, two
care home residents, both of whom are receiving good care and
attention, by allowing only one to receive free care. For that reason I
ask the hon. Lady to withdraw her
amendment.</div>

					<a name="07051610000295"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a small group of people who need

liberty under the Mental Capacity Act are subject to article 5 of the
European convention on human rights. Contravention of that article led
to the Bournewood determination in the first place. Article 14 of the
convention prohibits unjustified discrimination in the application of
any of the other articles, including&#151;of course&#151;article 5,
so there is not necessarily any difference between people detained
under the Bournewood provisions and others in the same accommodation
who are being looked after under, say, section 117 of the Mental Health
Act. Both might lack capacity, be compliant, have a mental disorder or
disability, need residential care, require high levels of care and be
subject in their own interests to legislation, yet one would be charged
and the other would
not.</div>
					<a name="07051610000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">That point was
made to the Government by the Joint Committee on Human Rights. In
paragraph 91 of its communication to the Minister, it
said:</div>
					<a name="07051610000296"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In our
opinion, to charge someone for accommodation in which they are deprived
of their liberty potentially engages civil rights and obligations and
therefore the right to access to a court to determine those rights
under Article 6 of the Convention. There is potential for
discrimination for the purposes ofArticles 5 and 6 and Article
14, in that a person deprived of their liberty in their own best
interests in a hospital will not be charged for the detention whereas a
person deprived of their liberty in their own best interests in a care
home will&#148;.</div>

that it is very important that the relevant person, when they are

independent mental capacity advocate during the assessment process. The
relevant person should have that access if they need it. Not all will
need it, but the Bill should provide a facility for an independent
advocate to be part of the decision making right at the beginning. I am
not saying that it is needed exclusively at the beginning; there are
other points at which independent advocacy is needed throughout the
process of implementing that part of the 2005 Act, as
amended.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column408" />Column number: 408</div>
					<a name="07051610000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">Advocacy is important&#151;it
is the key to promoting the rights and needs of patients deprived of
their liberty. When the Mental Capacity Bill was before the House we
had a lot of detailed discussion about advocacy being important, not
least for some patients in communicating their views. It is sometimes
important also for the person who is trying to assist the patient,
whether they are a professional, a carer or someone who has the right
under the 2005 Act to represent the patient&#146;s views. They would
all benefit from the help of an independent advocate. A person lacking
the capacity to consent to their care and treatment is likely to need
support to express their views, and there could be other communication
complications that require
expertise.</div>
					<a name="07051610000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of our
worries when the 2005 Act went through was that if there was
insufficient advocacy&#151;if it was not provided in a timely fashion
and the advocate was not able to assist and intervene&#151;decisions
would be made without the person&#146;s view being properly
understood. That is important, as is the right to support during the

					<a name="07051610000297"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Without
rights to independent advocacy access to such a vital service will
remain a postcode lottery and at the discretion of mental health

particularly important here because we believe that a person&#146;s
treatment will benefit from access to independent advocacy. It could
prevent much misunderstanding during their treatment and management.

intervention and early access to independent advocacy, it could in the
long run save money and prevent wrong decisions from being

						The
safeguards that we are adding to the Mental Capacity Act 2005 will

recommend what is in the best interests of the person concerned. That
will be the role of the best interests assessor, who will be
independent of everyone else in the process and who will act in the
best interests of the individual. It will be the job and statutory duty
of the best interests assessor to involve the person as far as possible
and to take account of their past and present wishes, feelings, beliefs
and values. The independent best interests assessor will need to do all
they can to involve the person and find out what their views and wishes
are, and the assessor 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column409" />Column number: 409</div>should have the competence and skills to do that. Of course, that is a
challenge and if the best interests assessor feels that an advocate
would help with the process, they can ask for one to be appointed.
However, it is the job of the best interests assessor to ensure that
they know the views of the individual so that they can make the
assessment in an independent
way.</div>

this paragon&#151;the best interests assessor&#151;should have a
duty not only to consider the wishes and previously expressed views and
values of the patient, but to make their own judgment? That might be
contrary to previously expressed wishes if they were felt not to be in
the best interests of the person. If that is the case, can the Minister
assure the Committee that the paragons, as I call them, will be
sufficiently trained and have the robustness to make the right
decision? Of course, they will not always get it right, but we would
like to feel that they will address the matter in a well informed way.
My hon. Friend the Member for Tiverton and Honiton made the point, to
which the Minister has partially replied, that it might well be
sensible for them to take a second opinion from an independent
assessor, if that is helpful to the
process.</div>

								Ms
Winterton:
						</b> The best interests assessor is an independent
assessor; that is the point of having them. If necessary, they could
say that it would be helpful to appoint an advocate&#151;although
they would not do the appointing as that would be done by the PCT or
local authority. It is the job of the best interests assessor to try to
ascertain the wishes of the individual. The Mental Capacity Act code of
guidance gives extensive guidance on the practical issue of
communicating with people who may lack capacity. It is important that,
in many cases, the assessor involves others who are perhaps used to
communicating with the person. That might be the family or carers who
have established a relationship of trust; or they may need to involve
specialist interpreters, signers or, if relevant, advocates. We are
making it clear that the independent assessor should follow that route.
The support of an independent mental health advocate as well would not
be necessary in all circumstances, except for the real circumstances of
there being no one appropriate among friends or family to consult,
which we all refer back to in the Mental Capacity
Act.</div>
					<a name="07051610000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Our
problem with the amendment is the possibility of the IMHA and the best
interests assessor both seeking the input of the person concerned and
both speaking to family, friends and carers, which would not only be
cumbersome but also quite confusing for the person and the family.
Frankly, it might also be quite intrusive and heavy-handed and, because
of the possible confusion, could cause unnecessary distress and
anxiety, which I know the hon. Lady would not want to see. I am sure
that the amendment is probing and designed to explore the role of the
independent assessor.</div>

						There
is a practical problem. Not all social workers in the role of
independent assessor would, for example, be specialists in non-verbal
communications. An IMHA would then be needed, because hopefully they
would have that sort of specialism. Specialists are needed to assist
people with non-verbal communication&#151;not just those without
speech because of a physical disability, but particularly those who are
poor at communicating because they have a communication disorder, for
example.</div>

Browning:
						</b> Indeed, and although I hope that that would not
be the norm, one can envisage an advocate not being employed to support
the person to communicate. In practice, the best interests assessor
might rely quite heavily on information from family members or carers,
who may be experts in communicating with the person. That often happens
and would not be a problem. However, there are occasionally other
cases. I recall service users giving evidence to the Mental Capacity
Bill scrutiny Committee almost making a unilateral declaration of
independence of mum and dad and highlighting the possibility of
circumstances in which mum and dad are not advocating or proposing what
the person concerned would like to be known. I suggest that those are a
minority of cases rather than the norm, but the legislation needs to
safeguard against such unintended consequences. However, I beg to ask

						The
amendment would ensure that the person concerned was informed if a
request was made to assess whether they were being unlawfully deprived
of their liberty. We expect such situations to arise only very rarely.
If a person such as a family member believed that their
relative&#146;s liberty was being removed unlawfully, they should
draw that to the attention of the hospital or care home managers and
ask them either to apply for an authorisation or end the deprivation of
liberty. If the managers did not take action, the third party could
apply to the supervisory body to commission an assessment of whether
there was deprivation. If the outcome was that the deprivation was
unauthorised, the full assessment procedure was immediately triggered

authorisation.</div>

to the person concerned. If that person had others acting for them,
such as an attorney under the Mental Capacity Act, would the
notification to that person be available to the others who were acting

was looking after the care of the individual and taking decisions, I
suspect it would be right for them to be informed. If, however, the
individual merely had a financial authorisation from the Court of
Protection, notification might not be appropriate. I suspect that it
might be good practice, but individuals should make sure that they were

Browning:
						</b> I am grateful. The amendment is about the
provision for a second medical opinion on the treatment of serious
medical conditions. I think it would be helpful if I began by
clarifying what we mean by serious medical treatment. In the context of
the relevant group of patients, we obviously think of electroconvulsive
therapy. We discussed ECT earlier in the Committee, and it is a subject
that immediately alerts people to the need for safeguards, but the term
also includes major surgery, such as open heart surgery; certain types
of chemotherapy or cancer surgery; major amputations; treatments that
will result in permanent loss of hearing or sight; the withholding 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column413" />Column number: 413</div>or withdrawing of certain types of treatment, and abortion or caesarean
section, although not termination of
pregnancy.</div>
					<a name="07051610000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those are
all serious procedures, and one would hope that anybody detained under
the Mental Capacity Act would also be provided with the right to a
second opinion when any such procedure was being considered. Within the
context of that Act there is very small group of people who are
befriended and have support in decision making on those matters. That
responsibility often rests with relatives or carers, but I believe that
the vast majority of those patients will find that they are severely
disadvantaged because they come within the scope of the Mental Capacity
Act and that Act lacks the safeguard of a right to second opinion. I
believe that they should have a right to a second medical opinion on
such serious medical
treatments.</div>
					<a name="07051610000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those
treatments, including medication and ECT, should be approved by an
independent clinician through a second-opinion procedure. Under the
Mental Health Act 1983 there is a statutory second medical opinion
procedure for medication beyond three months and for ECT, and it seems
iniquitous that the same safeguards should not be given to people
treated under the Bournewood provisions. I find it hard to believe that
the Minister can justify that group of people not receiving the same
protections.</div>
					<a name="07051610000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
second-opinion doctor should be a specialist in the field of medicine
proposed. I know that the Government believe that that is unnecessary,
as the person&#146;s representative or an IMHA advocate will be able
to request a second opinion on serious medical treatment if they
consider it necessary, but I do not think that that gives the surety
that such people will be knowledgeable enough in that area of medicine
to know when a second opinion should be sought. Whether they go out of
their way to seek that second opinion will be pretty hit and miss if it
is not in the Bill. They might not have the skills to recognise when a
second opinion is needed.</div>
					<a name="07051610000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are considering some serious
inequalities between a group of people treated under the Bournewood
rules and the Mental Capacity Act and those subject both to the Mental
Health Act and to what is sometimes normal medical practice in a
serious situation. I hope that the Government will be amenable to
considering those groups of people again. Before the Minister jumps up
or the hon. Member for Rhondda asks me if I have costed my proposal,
let me say that I do not think that there will be huge resource
implications, but in the interests of the patient without the right to
a second opinion&#151;and of the medical staff taking responsibility
for them in complex and serious situations&#151;I ask the Minister
seriously to consider accepting the
amendment.</div>
					
					<a name="07051610000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07051610000413"></a>Mr.
Boswell:
						</b> I echo my hon. Friend&#146;s remarks. These are
serious matters in substance, and there are concerns about anomalies
between the treatment of Mental Capacity Act or Bournewood patients and
those detained under the Mental Health Act. I understand that it may
not be possible to produce an identity of treatment, but I am sure that
we all want safeguards in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column414" />Column number: 414</div>order to get as near to that as we can. I should like to add two points
to the mix for the Minister to
consider.</div>
					<a name="07051610000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
first&#151;I am not sure whether something was said about it while I
was detained outside the Committee this morning&#151;is the question
of the status under the Human Rights Act 1998 of any resident of an
independent care home. It is a matter of some concern in the wider
context whether the protections of that Act are available as they would
be to a resident of a public
hospital.</div>
					<a name="07051610000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
second point, which has only recently come to my attention&#151;I am
worried that another interpretation may even be possible&#151;arises
from the fact that the Government are considering corporate
manslaughter legislation. One would like to feel that the safeguards of
such legislation will be available to patients equally, whether they
are detained under the Mental Health Act or the Mental Capacity
Act&#151;that is one test&#151;and whether they are resident in a
private sector care home or hospital, or in public provision.</div>
					<a name="07051610000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">Nobody is saying that we can
produce an ideal and perfect solution, but it is important to reduce
the anomalies to a bare minimum. It is also important to remember that
such matters involve extremely serious decisions&#151;by definition,
life-or-death and related important decisions&#151;and we owe it to
those vulnerable people to ensure that they are treated properly and
given all the rights available to their counterparts under the
law.</div>
					
					<a name="07051610000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07051610000414"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> I hope that I shall be able to give some
reassurance. I understand the desire to ensure that all the proper
safeguards are in place, but a deprivation of liberty authorisation
deals only with the deprivation of liberty. It does not authorise any
course of treatment. The provision of treatment to a person who lacks
capacity to consent must be in accordance with the arrangements and
safeguards in the Mental Capacity Act. The authorisation is entirely
different; it is simply about the deprivation of
liberty.</div>
					<a name="07051610000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">Where the
primary reason for the deprivation of liberty is to allow treatment to
take place, the benefits of treatment would be considered as part of
the best interests assessment. That does not replace but is in addition
to the requirement to comply with the Mental Capacity Act. We are
talking about two entirely different things: deprivation of liberty and
the provision of medical treatment, which reverts back to the Mental
Capacity Act. For that reason, I urge the hon. Lady to withdraw the
amendment.</div>
					
					<a name="07051610000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07051610000415"></a>Angela

a second medical opinion being sought when serious medical treatment is
being considered?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07051610000416"></a>
								Ms
Winterton:
						</b> If a second medical opinion is required under
the Mental Capacity Act, the requirement would come into effect at that
time. However, that is to do with treatment issues under the Mental
Capacity Act. Under the Mental Health Act, which is entirely different,
a second medical opinion is sought, first, before admission to hospital
and, secondly, if there is a compulsory treatment order concerning,
say, medication. Treatment under the Mental Health Act is an entirely
different 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column415" />Column number: 415</div>issue. The Mental Capacity Act kicks in, as it were, in relation to
treatment, but the schedule is about the deprivation of liberty that
arises from Bournewood. The authorisation for such a deprivation is
different&#151;it does not bring about
treatment.</div>
					
					<a name="07051610000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07051610000417"></a>Mr.
Boswell:
						</b> I think that the Minister is helping us. As I see
it, the measure will effectively establish a defence for a clinician
against an accusation of depriving a person of their liberty under
Bournewood terms; it is about determining whether they have committed
an offence by detaining somebody against their will, which is
important.</div>
					<a name="07051610000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister then said that all of the safeguards available under the
Mental Capacity Act will continue in relation to treatment, which I
understand. However, if the distinction that she is making is
complicated and only just intelligible to the Committee, it is
important that clinicians are properly trained on the interaction of
the two provisions and that their clinical decisions are carefully
recorded in terms of what powers they are using and when. In a real
world situation, the decision to detain and the decision to treat are
not quite as discrete as they appear in the tidy minds of the
draftsmen; they might be consecutive or contemporaneous.</div>
					<a name="07051610000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having spent some time briefing
people on how the Mental Capacity Act works, I can see that there will
be serious difficulties in explaining even to sophisticated clinicians
exactly what the critical path of decision making would be. That is not
to disagree with the Minister, because she has made a fair distinction.
The distinction, however, needs to be conveyed in simple but
sufficiently comprehensive terms to those who will be making the
clinical decisions.</div>
					
					<a name="07051610000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07051610000418"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> I certainly take on board the fact that we need
to communicate simply and clearly. The hon. Gentleman referred to
clinicians, but they might not be the people who decide on the
deprivation of liberty. The measure is most likely to be used in
respect of someone in a care home; it is not about medical treatment.
We need to be clear that we are not necessarily talking about decisions
that would be made by clinicians. With that, I hope that the hon. Lady
withdraws the amendment.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07051610000419"></a>Angela
Browning:
						</b> I have to say to the Minister that I would like
to go away and study the matter and to come back on Thursday, but I do
not have such an opportunity. I will go away and study and come back on
Report because I am not totally convinced about the Minister praying in
aid the Mental Capacity Act and the best interests provisions. I am not
clear whether she is relying on the best interests measure in that Act
to determine the issue. If that is the case, I have ongoing
reservations. I think that the principle of a right to a second opinion
should apply, whether or not best interests determine the decision on
serious treatment. However, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

Browning:
						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>I want to speak to schedule 6 because it
is the principal part of the Bill that involves the Bournewood
determination and the way in which the Minister intends to put it into
legislation. In the debate on the amendments, I flagged up a very clear
differentiation in treatment between people who are detained under the
Mental Health Act and those detained under the Mental Capacity Act.
That is not to say that I withdraw my support for the Minister in
enshrining the Bournewood outcomes into the Mental Capacity Act rather
than the Mental Health Act. We are all agreed on that, but as I said at
the beginning, we need to get this right. The Minister&#146;s
rejection of some of the amendments tabled in this Committee and in the
other place was clearly based on resource implications. We all
understand that for the Government, those implications are material and
have to be taken into account.</div>
					<a name="07051610000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						However, when
the Minister considers how to implement the schedule I should like her
to look again at the advice that she herself issued when the Bournewood
judgment was published. The Department immediately sent out interim
guidelines to PCTs, social services departments and so on. In that
advice, the Minister flagged up something that I have been alluding to
in our discussions of the amendments to schedule 6. We can see the
differentiation very clearly. In the guidelines, the Minister alluded
to the fact that there was a choice between detaining people under the
Mental Health Act, which was all that the Government had at the time,
or detaining people but not under the Mental Health Act. She alerted
professionals in the field to the fact that</div>
					<a name="07051610000298"></a><div class="hs_brev">a significant increase in the use of the
Mental Health Act will inevitably put considerable further pressure on
local authority approved social workers, the availability of second
opinion appointed doctors
(SOADs)&#148;&#151;</div>

					<a name="07051610000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">I must say to
the Minister that, when it comes to getting the response to the
Bournewood judgment right and enshrining it in statute, I still have
reservations that her concerns about resources and funding are
influencing her to reject amendments that have been tabled not only in
this Committee but in another place. I have no doubt that we will
return to those on Report and in another
place.</div>

						</b> I usually try to put something into the last
clause of a Bill. The Government have just taken out something without
explaining why, but we shall pass that by. There is already a Mental
Health Act 1983 and a Mental Health Act 1959, and my
experience of dealing with legislation on children during the past few
years is that a lot of Acts either have the title &#147;Children
Act&#148; or have the word &#147;children&#148; somewhere in the
title. I wonder why the Bill cannot be called the Mental Health
(Amendment) Bill, given that it is a Bill to amend the 1983 Act rather
than a Bill in its own right. That would at least distinguish it when
people are referring to different parts of the mental health
legislation.</div>

							<b class="B">Sandra
Gidley</b> (Romsey) (LD): I beg to move, That the clause be
read a Second time.</div>
					<a name="07051610000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause is a straightforward
attempt to introduce a duty on health and local authorities to assess
the needs of people with mental health problems, when appropriate, and
to respond to written requests for assessment by certain key people
within a fixed period. It provides also that clear reasons should be
given for refusal.</div>
					<a name="07051610000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Scottish legislation has
been referred to many times, and this will be another such occasion. In
Scotland, a provision has been introduced whereby health and social
services must respond to a reasonable request for assessment within 14
days. The response must take the form either of arrangement of an
actual assessment or of written reasons for refusal.</div>
					<a name="07051610000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">Throughout our sittings, the
Minister has admitted from time to time that past mental health
provision in many areas was not good enough. I concede that things have
to a certain extent improved, but there is a long way to go before they
are good enough, and there are many parts of the country in which
people do not have access to services. The patchy nature of access to
mental health services means that in many respects it would be in the
Government&#146;s wider interests to have a mechanism whereby they
could collect data indirectly on service availability. There are
precedents in other Bills for providing such assessments. The Minister
worked on the Adoption and Children Act 2002, which introduced a duty
on local authorities to assess the needs of children who are being
adopted.</div>
					
					<a name="07051610000353"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.45
pm</div>
					<a name="07051610000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">In other areas
of legislation, the Government have accepted the principle that there
are occasions when there is a need for an assessment. The argument has
been advanced that that somehow gives people with mental health
problems greater rights than those with a physical health problem. That
is not a robust argument because, for far too long, people with mental
health problems and service users have felt that they do not have
access to services and that they are the underdog when it comes to
provision. The new clause would go some way to reassuring service
users, who are quite worried by some of the compulsion aspects of the
Bill, that if they come forward, their needs would be looked at in a
wider context.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column422" />Column number: 422</div>
					<a name="07051610000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall quote a case story that
does not involve a made-up Lily, Ruth or Mary. Lesley Savage is the
mother of Daniel Gonzalez, who was convicted of killing four people in
September 2004. She said that the family had made a hundred attempts to
get help at various times and
that</div>
					<a name="07051610000331"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We cannot list
every phone call that went unanswered, every letter that went astray,
every contact with a professional who told us they could not help or
who passed us on to someone else. We cannot list here the ever-changing
diagnoses that were offered, the ever-changing advice we were given,
the lost and wrongly recorded notes that misled us and the
professionals.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07051610000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the
Government are serious about preventing that sort of situation,
providing an assessment would go a long way to allaying the fears of
that mother, and the realistic fears of others who are in the
system.</div>
					<a name="07051610000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">Section 47 of
the National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990 already
provides for a right to assessment for vulnerable people. The key
mechanisms for enforcing that are the Commission for Social Care
Inspection and the Healthcare Commission. In practice, section 47
assessments are severely limited. They are led by social services and
focus on the need for community care services. In some authorities,
assessments are carried out by a separate &#147;adults with
disabilities&#148; team, which does not specialise in mental health
care. Existing service users reported to the joint scrutiny Committee
in 2004-05 that unless social workers are involved in their care, they
are denied access to a community care assessment. The existing system
provides a stop-gap, but does not address the problems and needs of
service users.</div>
					<a name="07051610000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">By
placing a duty on NHS organisations and social services departments to
respond to requests for an assessment, the new clause would bring the
1990 Act up to date and reflect the more joined-up nature of services.
It would also offer the same rights regardless of at what point an
individual gets into contact with the system. Although the Government
are considering many different people for being the approved person in
charge, the new clause would ensure a holistic approach to
assessments.</div>
				
					<a name="07051610000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is support for the new clause elsewhere. In 1999, the
Government&#146;s expert committee said
that</div>
					<a name="07051610000332"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;there should be a
duty on the NHS and Social Services jointly to assess and meet the
needs of people with mental health problems, with reasons if their
needs could not be
met.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07051610000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">The joint
parliamentary scrutiny Committee accepted that there was a compelling
argument for balancing the draft Bill by including a duty to provide an
appropriate and adequate mental health service. The Committee
recommended that the Bill should include a duty on public services to
assess and meet the mental health needs of people with mental health
problems. The Disability Rights Commission has also stated that the
Bill should include a right of assessment and
treatment.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07051610000425"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> As I am sure the hon. Lady knows, the new
clause was debated at length in the other place, and I am afraid that I
wish to reiterate a number of the points that were made there. There
are existing duties, such as those in the National Health Service Act
2006 on the Secretary of State and in the National Health Service
(Wales) Act 2006 on Welsh Ministers, to secure improvement in the
physical and mental health of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column423" />Column number: 423</div>
						people in the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of
illness. There are also duties that provide for joint assessments
between providers of health and community care
services.</div>
					<a name="07051610000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">We believe
strongly that the new clause would impose an additional duty in
relation to mental health services that is not replicated for other
patient groups such as cancer sufferers. Unfortunately, it would skew
the priorities of the NHS in favour of one service at the expense of
others. I am sure that were we to say that there should be specific
assessments for mental health services, we would quickly find that
other groups of patients such as those with coronary heart disease felt
that they had been discriminated
against.</div>
					<a name="07051610000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, if
somebody requires an assessment to be detained under the 1983 Act, the
assessment happens. That is the difference; because those circumstances
involve detention, an assessment is required. The new clause suggests
that there should be an assessment on every single occasion. I tell the
hon. Member for Romsey that it will be up to clinicians to decide what
further action should be taken if somebody presents with a particular
problem, as they would with any other
condition.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07051610000426"></a>Sandra
Gidley:
						</b> Does the Minister accept that cancer services are
much more widely accessed and much easier to access than mental health
services? I suspect that there have not been similar cases in the
cancer service or any other physical health service whereby people have
had to make a hundred phone calls or write a hundred letters and
received no help at
all.</div>
					
					<a name="07051610000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07051610000427"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> The point of principle is whether to take one
particular condition and create a difference from all other conditions
in how an individual is assessed. Assessments will involve a small
number of people deciding whether someone needs compulsory treatment,
and I hope that it will be of some help if I say that when approved
mental health professionals decide not to apply for detention, they
should as a result of their assessment identify any further action
required and do whatever is necessary to implement
it.</div>
					
					<a name="07051610000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07051610000428"></a>Mr.
Boswell:
						</b> This is a small point, but it may be important.
The Minister said that that situation arose in cases of detention under
the 1983 Act. We have just debated schedule 6 to this Bill, which will
make changes to the 2005 Act on compulsory detention and the
deprivation of liberty. Does she envisage that persons detained under
the 2005 Act following the Bournewood case will be able to avail
themselves of the services of an
assessment?</div>
					
					<a name="07051610000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07051610000429"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> As we discussed, there will be an independent
assessor on the deprivation of liberty. The provision discussed relates
to that, not to
treatment.</div>
					<a name="07051610000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
role of the approved mental health professional, when considering
whether further treatment is necessary having made an assessment, will
include referring on for a community care assessment and/or a health

							<b class="B">Dr.
John Pugh</b> (Southport) (LD): I beg to move, That the clause
be read a Second
time.</div>
					<a name="07051610000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new clause
should prompt a brief but useful debate about physical restraint and
its use within the mental health service. It is about the use of
seclusion, other forms of behaviour management, mechanical restraint
and other interventions managing disturbed behaviour and the removal of
a patient from normal levels of association and freedom&#151;in other
words, locking them away or keeping them in some very controlled
environment. The new clause endeavours to specify certain purposes for
which that may be done, suggesting that there should be regulations
defining the circumstances in which any form of intervention might be
used; reporting requirements for the use of such interventions, which
obviously at times involve quite fraught methods of physical restraint;
a review of such interventions, to find out how common they are;
scrutiny of their use; and also a record of the circumstances under
which patients subject to interventions are
visited.</div>
					<a name="07051610000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is
really the most troublesome of all ends of mental health care. More
than 35 years ago, I think, I had my only experience of showing
somebody into what was then a padded cell, in an old-fashioned, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column425" />Column number: 425</div>locked refractory ward. Even today I remember the episode very vividly.
The individual was terribly distressed, standing out from all the other
patients in many ways, and many of the patients were in a very severe
state indeed. He was routinely excluded. He seemed to have some sort of
immunity to drugs like Stelazine, the psychoactive then available.
Therefore, he lived in a deeply troubled world, tortured by
hallucinations. To this day I wonder what on earth could have happened
to him.</div>
					<a name="07051610000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">My point is
about what was done to him, however, which was not by and large
therapy, but an act of therapeutic desperation. The only alternative
was to over-sedate him, which is equally undesirable. Given that that
is what happens in such extreme&#151;I accept that it is quite
rare&#151;circumstances, it is entirely appropriate for us to have
reports, reviews, scrutiny and a visit in order to minimise such
episodes, because more sophisticated interventions might be able to
prevent some cases happening. I accept that in modern medicine this
procedure is rarely used and that there are alternatives. The more
normal form would not be physical restraint, but some
injection&#151;forcibly delivered into the backside in all
probability. Insofar as this happens at all, we need to record and
regulate it as a precursor to minimising
it.</div>
					
					<a name="07051610000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07051610000432"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> The new clause certainly raises an important
issue. I appreciate the concerns that exist around the use of
interventions such as seclusion and mechanical restraint in managing
disturbed behaviour. I know that the subject concerns my hon. Friend
the Member for Norwich, North as well, obviously because of the very
distressing case of Rocky Bennett and the following
inquiry.</div>
				
					
					<a name="07051610000354"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6
pm</div>
					<a name="07051610000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">Many issues
have come to the Government&#146;s attention in the past few years. I
can assure the Committee that we share the common objective of ensuring
that there is no inappropriate use of seclusion, restraint or similar
interventions. We want to see such measures taken only when they are
essential and used properly, and that patients have adequate
safeguards.</div>
					<a name="07051610000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
I must tell the hon. Member for Southport that new clause 5 is not the
best way in which to address those concerns. It would not be practical
to define in regulations all the situations in which disturbed
behaviour may need to be managed and the range of techniques that may
be used and it would limit the ability of staff to respond flexibly to
the wide range of situations that they may face. There are
circumstances in which restraint will be the only action available to
make a dangerous situation safe. Also, regulations run the risk of
inhibiting the development of new and improved techniques for managing
difficult behaviour. We have to be careful not to do that.</div>
					<a name="07051610000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">The management of disturbed
behaviour and the techniques involved are not regulated specifically by
the Mental Health Act, but they are subject to general criminal and
public law, including the Human Rights Act 1998. They are also subject
to the professional duties and obligations of the practitioners
involved. We have reflected the 2004 guidance from the National 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column426" />Column number: 426</div>Institute for Mental Health in England in the code of practice, which
also advises adherence to the National Institute for Health and
Clinical Excellence guidelines, which were issued in 2005. That
guidance addresses the issue of the management of aggression and
violence, including restraint.</div>
					<a name="07051610000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Healthcare Commission and
the Health Inspectorate Wales will be mindful of the guidance when they
visit hospital units&#151;they would wish to be satisfied that it is
being followed.</div>
					
					<a name="07051610000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07051610000433"></a>Mr.
Boswell:
						</b> I am following the Minister&#146;s argument
with quite a lot of sympathy. I understand the case for flexibility and
the difficulty of covering everything in regulations. There was a
trainee in a secure training centre in my constituency who sadly died.
A restraint lock was used on him, in accordance with Home Office
guidelines, but he collapsed and died. We need not expand on that now.
Does the Minister agree that it is terribly important that less
invasive and aggressive techniques are developed and brought forward
and communicated as best practice as soon as possible? The fact that we
have set guidance in the past, perhaps because a practice was
acceptable at the time, does not mean that we so much as tacitly accept
that it is the way forward. As soon as we know a better way, we should
avoid old practices.</div>
					
					<a name="07051610000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07051610000434"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. One of
the reasons why we do not want to accept the new clause is that the
spreading of best practice in the way in which he described might be
hampered. Hospital managers also have responsibilities for best
practice. They should regularly review the use of seclusion. Providers
should have clear written policies on the use of restraint, which
should include provision for review and for the application of
restraint to be audited and reported to hospital managers.</div>
					<a name="07051610000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">The &#147;Count Me In&#148;
census collects and publishes information about periods of seclusion
during an in-patient&#146;s stay in hospital. It also records
incidents of hands-on restraint, which it defines as the physical
restraint of an in-patient by one or more members of staff in response
to aggressive behaviour or resistance to treatment.</div>
					<a name="07051610000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">We will, however, consider how
information on the use of seclusion and restraint may be reported to
the new regulator for England. That will also be a matter for Welsh
Ministers, and it will be an important step forward. The guidance on
seclusion and restraint has been revised and updated during preparation
of the draft illustrative code of practice for England to accompany the
Bill, and it will be further developed in the new code, on which
consultation will take place.</div>
					<a name="07051610000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government completely
understand the concerns that underlie the new clause, but we oppose it
for the reasons that I have stated. I can give a commitment to hon.
Members that we shall continue to work to ensure that restraint and
seclusion are used only when they are
essential.</div>

							<a name="07051610000438"></a>Ann
Coffey:
						</b> New clause 18 seeks to substitute, for section 140
in the 1983 Act, a new section that would give duties to primary care
trusts and others in relation to the assessment, conveyance and
admission of urgent cases. New clause 19 seeks to amend section 6(1) of
the 1983 Act to move responsibility for finding a bed from the approved
social worker or the new approved mental health practitioner to the
hospital trust.</div>
					<a name="07051610000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
thank the Minister for meeting me to discuss the proposed new clauses,
and I thank the approved social worker leads&#146;
network&#151;particularly Claire Barcham of that
organisation&#151;for her excellent written submission 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column428" />Column number: 428</div>which very clearly outlined, with examples, the practical difficulties
that ASWs face in implementing their present duties in relation to
emergency admissions from the community. Claire Barcham gave many
examples of those difficulties, and I am sure that that has convinced
members of the Committee of the strength of their
arguments.</div>
					<a name="07051610000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">ASWs are
involved in approximately 47,000 admissions each year, of which 27,000
are admissions from the community, so they know what they are talking
about. The procedures for admitting people to hospital in an emergency
are vital in achieving the principles outlined in clause 10 of the
Bill, about which there has been much discussion in the Committee and
in the Lords, so it is important that we get them right. The principles
set a standard, and we must ensure that those who will have the
responsibility for implementing the Bill are not faced with the
practical barriers that ASWs face at the
moment.</div>
					<a name="07051610000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">The current
sections 6 and 140 of the 1983 Act place a responsibility on health
authorities to provide a bed, but because of the drafting of the
provisions and the lack of local protocols, the task of finding a bed
and of making arrangements for conveying people to hospital has in
practice fallen to the approved social workers. The code of practice
accompanying the 1983 Act has guidance that mentions local procedures,
but it is clear from the written submission and from the examples that
the code does not always work in practice.</div>
					<a name="07051610000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">Part of the problem, which is
also the reason why the examples are anecdotal, is that there is no
monitoring to check whether such protocols are in place locally and
whether local health, police and social services authorities are
co-operating with the protocols. Furthermore, protocols do not form
part of any mental health services inspection. The result is that since
introduction of the 1983 Act there has not been any pressure or lever
to ensure that good local protocols are developed. We should not make
the same mistake again.</div>
					<a name="07051610000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">Examples have been provided in
the written submission by the approved social workers. I spent a day
with a mental health assessment team in London to see for myself the
practical difficulties that approved social workers face. It was
interesting. While I was there, a request was made by the police for a
mental health assessment on a man who had been arrested that morning
after a neighbour had complained. He had already been in the cells for
three hours. He had not yet been interviewed by the police because the
police doctor did not feel able to say that he was fit for interview.
For that reason, a request for a mental health assessment had been
made.</div>
					<a name="07051610000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before the
approved social worker could carry out the assessment, she had to find
two doctors who could be present at the same time. She also had to
arrange for a bed. By the time that we had arrived at the custody
suite, the man had been in the cells for six hours. It was decided that
he did not need to be admitted to hospital as an emergency, and I
expect that he spent several more hours in the cells while being
interviewed with his solicitor. Such an event showed me how practical
things on the ground must work if the high-level objectives set out in
the Bill are to be
achieved.</div>
					<a name="07051610000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">I take the
point that police cells are not necessarily safe places, but the man
had waited for three hours in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column429" />Column number: 429</div>what was a safe place for him. If that man had been in his flat and had
not been arrested by the police at 8.30 that morning and a
request had been made for a mental health assessment because of his
bizarre behaviour, the approved social worker could well have had to
arrange for doctors to go the flat to assess him. The ASW could not
have applied for him to be admitted to hospital because there was no
bed. She would then have had to delay the assessment and rearrange the
time for the doctors. She might have gone on the visit even though the
doctors perhaps could not have come for several hours. She might have
thought that, on balance, it was better to go out to the flat to do the
assessment. She would have had to wait with a very distressed man or
his carers, while arranging for a bed so that she could make the
application. Alternatively, she could have taken him to a place of
safety, which could have been a police cell or an accident and
emergency unit at a hospital, neither of which are good places for
someone in an unstable condition.</div>
					<a name="07051610000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">Additionally, when I left in
the evening there were a further five requests on the approved social
worker&#146;s desk for a mental health assessment of people living in
the community. They were judged to be a risk to others. They had a
history of violent or abusive behaviour, so the approved social worker
rightly was not prepared to see them without police support. The
requests were on the desk because the approved social worker was
waiting for the police to say when they could undertake a risk
assessment.</div>
					<a name="07051610000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
police carry out an assessment of how much of a risk they feel the
person is to them. If they think that the risk is high, ironically the
waiting time for police support might be longer because resources have
to be provided, such as six policemen instead of one. It is not very
easy to collate details to know how many such instances result from the
community and 999 calls, arrests, assaults on the public, carers,
neighbours or self-harm. However, the time between someone becoming
concerned about a person&#146;s behaviour and assessment of their
condition must be the time of maximum
risk.</div>
					<a name="07051610000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
new clauses would put in place a duty to set up local protocols so that
responsibility for making arrangements does not fall solely on the
approved social worker or, in future, the approved mental health
professional. They would ensure that, in future, admissions and
conveyance to hospital took place according to a local protocol, with
agreed time limits for responses, and that requests for assessments
were not delayed unacceptably by inability to obtain police
support.</div>
					<a name="07051610000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
other issues in relation to admission, such as accessing transport and
ambulances. In new clause 19, the reason for moving the responsibility
from the approved social worker to the hospital trust is to put
pressure on PCTs to have in place proper commissioning arrangements for
their beds. It is also an issue for age-appropriate treatment. Proper
commissioning plans are needed to achieve
that.</div>
					
					<a name="07051610000355"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.15
pm</div>
					<a name="07051610000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">I knew that the
Minister would have concerns about the new clauses, but I hope that she
can reassure us that when the new code of practice is drawn up, there
will be much stronger guidance about the local protocols 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column430" />Column number: 430</div>that should be in place, including time limits for assessment and
admissions.</div>
					<a name="07051610000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those
protocols and any complaints by local bodies or authorities should be
regarded as part of a local inspection of mental health services. That
is the only way we can provide a lever to ensure that local protocols
are drawn up. I hope that the Minister will also consider how the
police can be involved in that, either through discussions with the
Association of Chief Police Officers or as part of their
responsibilities under local crime and disorder partnerships to ensure
community safety. In discussions with officials about drawing up a
stronger code of practice, I would request the Minister to involve the
ASW leads
network.</div>

							<a name="07051610000439"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>I was extremely grateful to my hon.
Friend for giving such a vivid account of some of the problems that
approved social workers face in the field, which she clearly
experienced during her day on the front line. She explained clearly the
issues that underlie the new clauses and responded to the problems that
some approved social workers have experienced in getting ambulance,
police and trust bed managers to co-operate in conveying and admitting
patients to hospital. I sympathise with her concerns and thank her for
bringing them to the attention of the Committee.</div>
					<a name="07051610000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is essential that local
services are co-ordinated to ensure that patients are conveyed safely,
efficiently and in the least distressing way for them and their family.
That goes back to the discussions that we had this morning about places
of safety. However, I have to tell my hon. Friend that we may not be
able to solve such difficulties in primary legislation. She was right
when she said that the arrangements for co-ordinating local services
must be a matter for local decision. As a result of our meeting, I have
had discussions with officials about what else we can do in that
regard. We are considering issuing a circular to relevant bodies, such
as local authorities, trusts and police authorities, stressing that it
is their responsibility to ensure that local protocols are working. We
are also considering how to amend the Mental Health Act codes of
practice to make that responsibility clear.</div>
					<a name="07051610000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">As a result of my hon.
Friend&#146;s suggestion, I have asked for the ASW leads network to
be represented on the steering group of an existing Government project
that is co-ordinating health trusts, local authorities and emergency
services, including police and ambulance services, to develop guidance
on working together to manage people experiencing mental disorder. That
guidance will cover the safe and efficient conveyance of patients to
hospital.</div>
					<a name="07051610000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">Something
else that I recall from the meeting and should like to consider further
is the issue that my hon. Friend has just touched on, which is the
extent to which we can encourage regulators and inspectors to examine
local protocols and see whether they are working effectively. I wish to
do some further work on that, although I cannot guarantee anything
because regulators have a certain independence. It is certainly

Duddridge</b> (Rochford and Southend, East) (Con): I beg to
move, That the clause be read a Second
time.</div>
					<a name="07051610000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I
thank my hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham for the
opportunity to move the motion on the new clause, which would
essentially give mental health patients the right to move hospital. It
breaks down into three parts: a duty to inform the patient or their
nearest relative of that right, a requirement to record when it is
exercised and a request is made and a requirement of authorities to
provide written reasons if a reasonable request is turned down. I wish
to make three broad points: the first on choice, the second on why
there is a need of a little additional bureaucracy and a little
evidence, and the third considering the black and minority ethnic
communities, who have inspired the new clause although it does not
apply exclusively to
them.</div>
					<a name="07051610000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">Choice is a buzz
word in the NHS generally. For instance, non-mental health patients
will have a choice of four hospitals by 2007 or 2008, which will be a
much wider choice. In fact the NHS website
states:</div>
					<a name="07051610000333"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;You
now have the right to
choose.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07051610000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">Well, that is
not the case at the moment in mental health. The Institute for Public
Policy Research, an organisation whose work I do not read in its
entirety, has a paper called &#147;Mental Health in the
Mainstream&#148;, which is very insightful. I quote from the
IPPR&#146;s &#147;A Good Choice for Mental Health&#148;, which
states that</div>
					<a name="07051610000334"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;despite
different policy initiatives to promote greater user involvement in
mental health, the choice agenda is yet to have a significant impact on
people&#146;s lives or experience of
services&#148;</div>
					<a name="07051610000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">in mental
health. The Sainsbury Centre for Mental Health is similarly critical of
the Government and states that choices should be offered
to</div>
					<a name="07051610000335"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;reflect the
individual&#146;s beliefs, values and preferences as well as clinical
need&#148;.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column432" />Column number: 432</div>
					<a name="07051610000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">Indeed, it
states:</div>
					<a name="07051610000336"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Appropriate
information and advice should be available to empower people to make
informed choices.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07051610000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
believe that that should be in the Bill, not in a code of practice.
That would fit with Government policy, and I shall come to that point
later when talking about the Bennett case. The Minister is looking
confused, but I shall explain my rationale as to why I feel that that
fits with the Government commitments made following the inquiry into
the tragic death of David Bennett in
1998.</div>
					<a name="07051610000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">I turn to the
point about extra bureaucracy, because I recognise that in another
place there were criticisms of a similar amendment because of that.
From my own experience, I know that going into a hospital is a
frightening experience. It is difficult to listen to what a doctor or
professional is saying, process the information and recall it. Somebody
with a mental health problem has a lot more issues to deal with than
someone with a simply physical disability. I feel that recording a
request that has been made, and writing the reasons why it has been
turned down if there is not good reason for a transfer, are worth that
extra bureaucratic
time.</div>
					<a name="07051610000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">The third point
that I wish to make concerns the black and minority ethnic population.
Lord Patel of Bradford raised this issue in another place. He
said:</div>
					<a name="07051610000337"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It is
not uncommon for a patient or relative to express a wish for a transfer
between hospitals, whether this is to be nearer home or because of a
preference for one hospital&#146;s regime over another. We should be
mindful that it is current government policy that prospective patients
across the rest of the NHS should be encouraged to express choices in
hospital care and that they should be acted on. If we cannot extend
this agenda around choice to psychiatric patients, even in this limited
way, we risk further excluding them and increasing the stigma of
psychiatric treatment.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of
Lords,</i> 17 January 2007; Vol. 688, c.
751.]</div>
					<a name="07051610000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is particularly true
for people in the black and ethnic minority communities.</div>
					<a name="07051610000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government&#146;s own
Department of Health report &#147;Race equality impact
assessment&#148; states
that</div>
					<a name="07051610000338"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the effects of
mental health legislation apply disproportionately to some BME
groups.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07051610000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						To pick four examples,
in BME groups, more people are likely to be diagnosed as schizophrenic;
to be sectioned under the 1983 Act; to be moved from open wards to
closed wards; and to be given higher doses of medication. Given that
the Commission for Racial Equality said that we should avoid all
unlawful discrimination, it is important that the Government include a
provision in the Bill. Although it is not certain that racism forms the
totality of the difference, a reasonable person would believe, as I
certainly do, that absolute racism forms part of the problem. Black
Mental Health UK, which focuses on African and Caribbean communities,
feels that this Bill is &#147;unethical&#148; and
&#147;unworkable&#148;, and a missed opportunity for reforming the
1983 Act.</div>
					<a name="07051610000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
the Minister will accept the new clause. I see that she is looking
positive. This is the first time I have moved such a motion on a new
clause, and it would be gratefully appreciated if the right hon. Lady,
not because of that, but because of the power of the argument,
supported it.</div>
					<a name="07051610000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">Black
Mental Health UK highlights a number of other problems, such as
linguistic problems. More than 300 languages are spoken in London.
There are 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column433" />Column number: 433</div>problems of racial differences. If people are moved from urban
centres&#151;the evidence across the board is that ethnic and
particularly black populations are largely in conurbations&#151;to
facilities in the countryside, not only is that a big change for them,
as it would be for anyone, but the practitioners in the institutions
are likely to have less cultural sensitivity and less personal
experience of those various communities. There could be a very good
reason why people in black and minority ethnic communities would much
prefer to be transferred to areas of their
preference.</div>
					<a name="07051610000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I said
I would, I turn now to the David Bennett inquiry, following that
gentleman&#146;s tragic death. The independent inquest into David
Bennett&#146;s death
said:</div>
					<a name="07051610000339"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;All
psychiatric patients and their families should be made aware that
patients can apply to move from one hospital to another for good
reason&#148;&#151;</div>
					<a name="07051610000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">these are
almost exactly the same words as appear in the new
clause&#151;</div>
					<a name="07051610000340"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;which
would include such matters as easier access by their family, a greater
ethnic mix, or a reasoned application to be treated by other
doctors.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07051610000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
will note that we have not gone into this long list of detail; I think
that she would prefer that it went into a code of practice, so that the
provisions are flexible. I hope that not including the full list in the
Bill while nevertheless referring to these matters would give that
degree of flexibility. The inquest went on to say
that</div>
					<a name="07051610000341"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;all such
applications should be
recorded&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07051610000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again, the
words are similar to those in the new clause. The inquest
continued:</div>
					<a name="07051610000342"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;They
should not be refused without providing the applicant and their family
with written
reasons&#148;,</div>
					<a name="07051610000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">Which is the
third part of the new
clause.</div>
					<a name="07051610000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">The reason why
I think that Minister is likely to support the thrust of the new clause
is that in delivering their report &#147;Race equality and mental
health care&#148;, following the death of David Bennett, the
Government
said:</div>
					<a name="07051610000343"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
accept this in
principle.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07051610000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">All the
points that I have gone through that have been mirrored in the new
clause. They went on to
say:</div>
					<a name="07051610000344"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Every
such request should be considered carefully and receive a reasoned
response that takes into account the needs of the service user and
their assessed best interests. A BME patient&#146;s wish to be closer
to their family, or to be cared for in a more ethnically mixed
environment, should be listened to, recorded and met unless there is a
good reason not to meet it. It is good practice for refusal to be
explained in
writing.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07051610000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is the
Government saying exactly what is in the new clause, which is why I
hope that the Minister will be minded to support
it.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
Charles Walker</b> (Broxbourne) (Con): Thank you,
Mr. Cook, for calling me to make a brief contribution. I am
in a difficult position in following such an excellent speech by my
hon. Friend, who made some important points about people&#146;s right
to apply to move to different hospitals. I am aware that the Government
are looking to replace beds with greater 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column434" />Column number: 434</div>
						community services, which may mean that the distance
between areas or hospitals with beds will
grow.</div>
					<a name="07051610000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">In a place with
fewer beds, most might be occupied, creating a greater need to move
people to a more far-flung location to give them the emergency
treatment that they need. It is important, as with all illness, to have
emotional and family support. If we must move people far from their
homes to receive treatment in an emergency because a hospital more
convenient to them and their family is full, we should consider at the
earliest opportunity whether they wish to move back to a bed nearer to
their family and friends, if that is in their interests, so that they
can derive support from
them.</div>
					<a name="07051610000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is also
important that the convenience of clinicians should take second place
to the patient&#146;s interests. It might be more convenient for a
clinician to put someone in a bed in a certain location, but if it is
in the patient&#146;s interests to be moved, we should be sensitive
to their wishes. It therefore gives me great pleasure to support made
by my hon. Friend the Member for Rochford and Southend,
East.</div>
					
					<a name="07051610000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07051610000443"></a>
								Ms
Winterton:
						</b> The hon. Member for Rochford and Southend, East
is very tempting&#151;<i class="I">[Laughter.] </i>He is particularly so as the
virgin mover of a new clause. However, I am afraid that I might have to
disappoint him, although I want to say straight away that I certainly
understand his reasons for tabling the new clause. It would require the
appropriate authority&#151;I presume that the hon. Gentleman means
the hospital managers&#151;to establish a formal procedure to advise
patients and their nearest relatives that a transfer to another
hospital can be requested if there is good reason.</div>
					<a name="07051610000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new clause is similar to an
amendment tabled in the other place, and it raises important issues of
good practice. As the hon. Gentleman and the hon. Member for Broxbourne
pointed out, it reflects one of the recommendations of the David
Bennett inquiry. I accept the principle behind the recommendations, but
I must again refer the Committee to the fact that it would be better to
put them into the code of
practice.</div>
					
					<a name="07051610000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07051610000444"></a>
							<b class="B">Dr.
Ian Gibson</b> (Norwich, North) (Lab): As the Minister pointed
out, I was fairly involved in the Rocky Bennett case, as it was in my
constituency, and I met his sister, who had fought hard on the issues
for some time. I seem to remember that the reason why racism reared its
ugly head was that people took Rocky aside and sat on him and not the
other person involved in the altercation, who happened to have a
different skin colour. That was where people picked up on the idea that
a racist element was
involved.</div>
					
					<a name="07051610000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07051610000445"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> My hon. Friend is quite right to say that that
inflamed the situation. In our action plan, &#147;Delivering race
equality in mental health care&#148;, which accompanied our response
to the David Bennett inquiry, we certainly reinforced the message that
all requests to transfer to another hospital should be carefully
considered and receive a reasoned response. That should include such
factors as a patient&#146;s wish to be closer to his family or to be
cared for in a more ethnically mixed environment.</div>
					<a name="07051610000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I said, it is not right for
us to introduce the sort of prescribed process for transfer requests
that would 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column435" />Column number: 435</div>result from the new clause. Information is important, as the hon. Member
for Rochford and Southend, East rightly said. However, we should look
again at the code of practice; there should certainly be no objection
to giving guidance in the new version of the code about the need to
inform patients and their nearest relatives of the possibility of
transferring to another hospital. We could look at whether all transfer
requests should be recorded, and at whether written decisions should
normally be recorded in response to all such requests.</div>
					<a name="07051610000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would also be possible to go
a bit further than the new clause seeks to do. We could look at listing
the sort of factors that hospital managers should take into account
when deciding whether a transfer is appropriate. Particularly, in
response to concerns raised by hon. Members regarding BME issues, we
could emphasise more issues of cultural needs, for example. I would
like to look at whether that can be done in the code of practice more
effectively than it is at present, and I would certainly welcome any
views that members of the Committee have on what we could say there. By
doing that, we will be able to get across to hospital managers, perhaps
more effectively than we could in legislation, the wide range of
factors that might be relevant in deciding whether a patient should
transfer to a different
hospital.</div>
					
					<a name="07051610000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07051610000446"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Walker</b>: Given the mental state of a patient and the
possible lack of awareness of their family, will the Minister actually
introduce measures to empower managers to say to families,
&#145;There could be a better solution than the one that we are
currently offering you&#151;a hospital nearer your home&#148;?
Under such an arrangement, instead of waiting to be asked, the managers
would go and initiate a hospital move.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07051610000447"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman makes a valid point about
the need to talk to carers or family members, as appropriate. In
particular, that is why it is good that we have enshrined in clause 10
the idea that that should certainly happen.</div>
					<a name="07051610000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although I accept that the new
clause is well intentioned, I hope that my response to the hon. Member
for Rochford and Southend, East gives him some reassurance that we take
this matter seriously and will be looking at it in the code of
practice.</div>

Winterton:
						</b> I am sorry, Mr. Cook; you look a bit
disappointed at my rising. I want to give you immense thanks for the
marvellous way in which you have controlled our proceedings. All
Committee members would like to thank you, Lady
Winterton&#151;and Miss Begg, who chaired our proceedings on
one occasion. The Committee has been very lively and generally good
tempered.</div>

						</b> Mostly good tempered. I am upset that the hon.
Member for Daventry is not here because I was reminiscing about his
remarks on sex addiction. However, not only sex addiction, but the
difference between chinchillas and scintillas was raised at some point
in the proceedings, and this afternoon we have had the virgin
amendments.</div>
					<a name="07051610000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">Seriously,
I thank all members of the Committee for good, well-informed debates
that have demonstrated the real interest of all parties in the
issue.</div>
					
					<a name="07051610000275"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07051610000455"></a>Dr.
Gibson:
						</b> I, too, congratulate all three Chairs of the
Committee. I am sure that there will be a further debate on the issue;
it has not gone away for ever and the arguments will return. Any
meetings that people have heard about next week remain a mystery to me.
Obviously, all sorts of things go on in the ether while we are
incarcerated in this room, but people should not believe what they see
on their phones and text messages, as the illustrious Chairman pointed
out.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07051610000456"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> I suspect that my hon. Friend might be
referring to a meeting that has apparently been organised in his name
for next week. I suggest that he takes up such things with the House
authorities or the Speaker.</div>
					<a name="07051610000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">I put on record my appreciation
of the large team of officials who have worked not only during
proceedings on the Bill, but for the past nine years on this issue.
Their patience is extraordinary and they have done a good job. I hope
that all hon. Members will join me in saying how professional the
officials have been. [<span class="SmallCaps">Hon. Members:</span> &#147;
Hear, hear.&#148;] They have been more than willing to talk to
Opposition and Labour Members about issues relating to the Bill. I also
thank the Clerks to the Committee and everyone else who has assisted us
in our considerations. I am sure that members of the public in the
Gallery, who have sat gallantly through the proceedings, will agree
that, although there have been disagreements, some of which remain, we
have had thoughtful debates on a wide range of
issues.</div>
					<a name="07051610000278"></a><div class="hs_Para">I particularly
thank Labour Members for their rapt attention&#151;they have been
marvellous. Of course, I also thank our Whip, who has tried to ensure
that we progressed gently through our discussions and, where necessary,
examined the Bill in detail while ensuring that we got to the end
having properly considered all hon. Members&#146; amendments. I thank
everyone who submitted memorandums to the Committee and the Opposition
spokespeople who have made some constructive comments that I hope have
been useful in clarifying public understanding of the Bill.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column438" />Column number: 438</div>
					<a name="07051610000279"></a><div class="hs_Para">It has been an honour and a
privilege to serve on the Committee, under your chairmanship,
Mr. Cook, and that of Lady Winterton and Miss Begg. I am
grateful for all the support that we have been
given.</div>

							<a name="07051610000457"></a>Tim
Loughton:
						</b> Allow me to tantalise your indifference for a
new more seconds, Mr. Cook, following the Minister&#146;s
Oscar performance. I echo her thanks to you, to Lady Winterton and to
Miss Begg for chairing this difficult and complicated Committee during
the past three and a half weeks. It is particularly important to thank
you for the additional work that you have had to undertake in vetting
no fewer than 70 submissions that will form part of the
record. Written submissions are part of the new format Committee
procedure, and this is the first such Committee of which I have been a
member. A lot of extra work is involved for hon. Members in reading the
submissions and for yourself in reviewing them beforehand. The task has
been done exceedingly effectively, and the swiftness with which you
have dealt with them so that they could be scrutinised is greatly
appreciated.</div>
					<a name="07051610000281"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I offer the
Opposition&#146;s thanks to the Clerk, who has been extremely helpful
in scrutinising some of our amendments, and who has made some helpful
suggestions as to which might be looked upon more favourably by you,
Mr. Cook. Dr. Benger has been of great assistance in that. I
thank my hon. Friends&#151;particularly the hon. Members for Tiverton
and Honiton and for Daventry, who, in the nicest possible way, are old
lags when it comes to Committee work. With their Mental Capacity Act
hats on they have brought enormous expertise to the Committee. My
thanks are also due to my hon. Friend the often highly animated Member
for Broxbourne, who has put his interest in mental health to good
effect in the Committee, and to my hon. Friend the Member for Rochford
and Southend, East, who is now no longer a new clause virgin and who
tempted the Minister but was ultimately let down, disappointed and spat
out by her. What a metaphor that is for the relationship between the
Government and the electorate at the moment.</div>
					<a name="07051610000282"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Nevertheless,
it has been good to have the engagement of the Labour members, all but
one of whom contributed to our proceedings. They have brought a great
deal of expertise and experience to our deliberations. The subject of
the Bill is one in which we all have a genuine interest, and Labour
members share many of our concerns. It was interesting to see that they
all&#151;without exception&#151;turned out to be Government
loyalists who voted for the Government, such was either the power of
persuasion of the Minister or the knowledge that the prospect of a
reshuffle under the forthcoming new regime is looming,
perhaps.</div>
					<a name="07051610000283"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also thank
the <i class="I">Hansard</i> writers, who are probably going absolutely
berserk.</div>
					<a name="07051610000284"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, we
are all greatly looking forward to the various audiences with Rosie
that have been promised. No doubt that Jean and Ruth and Mary and the
various other imaginary characters that the Minister has conjured up
during our deliberations will also be invited.</div>
					<a name="07051610000285"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have had an interesting
experience. I fear and hope that this will not be the last that we hear
of the Bill because many contentious decisions have been 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column439" />Column number: 439</div>taken that many of our colleagues both in this and in another place will
seek to overturn at the appropriate time.</div>
					
					<a name="07051610000286"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07051610000458"></a>Dr.
Pugh:
						</b> May I echo the sentiments that have been expressed?
I thank you, Mr. Cook, the Clerks and everybody who assisted
in making the Committee the rational basis for discourse that it has
been. We have achieved something. We lowered the temperature of the
debate, which has been helpful because it was about a difficult
subject. We have probed all of the key areas, which was important
because none of us wants the legislation to be decided by parliamentary
ping-pong.</div>
					<a name="07051610000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">If at the
end of the day the battle lines are a little blurred and alliances have
shifted, fundamentally, that will not be a problem for the sufferers.
They are the main aim of the legislation, not our various campaigns and
positions.</div>
					<a name="07051610000288"></a><div class="hs_Para">On a
personal note, I mentioned last Thursday a constituent of mine whose
letters &#151;he wrote to me regularly concerning all sorts of
issues&#151;reflected his mild paranoia. I said last Thursday that I
was stalked 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column440" />Column number: 440</div>by that individual, and that he would be in my weekend surgery. I could
not see him because I did not have time&#151;I was talking to an
Afghan chieftain, as one does.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07051610000460"></a>Dr.
Pugh:
						</b> Indeed so.</div>
					<a name="07051610000291"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have with me here the
contents my constituent sent to my letter box over a period of one and
a half weeks. On serious reflection, here is a person, one of a hundred
or probably thousands, who is completely bypassed by the legislation
that we have been talking about. Such people are not bad enough to be
sectioned, but they are not insightful enough to seek any help. They
are not covered by any provision or legislation. Our debate has been
constructive and forward-looking, but there is an enormous task to be
done apropos mental health that has nothing to do with the
Bill.</div>
