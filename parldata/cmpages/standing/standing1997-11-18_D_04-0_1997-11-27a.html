<B>Mr. Edward Davey </B>(Kingston and Surbiton): I beg to move amendment No. 16, in page 5, line 5, at beginning insert
<P>

</UL></FONT>
<P>
If the movers of amendments Nos. 20, 21, 13 and 22 wish to have separate divisions, they should let me know.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> My intention in moving amendment No. 16 with which amendment No. 17 is grouped, is to explore the extent and type of independence the Government intend to grant to the Bank of England, how full and proper that independence will be and how much political control they wish to keep.
<P>
There are several models of independence and they differ in many ways. In our previous debates we have heard how independence can differ in relation to a variety of factors: the appointment of members of decision-making bodies and their terms of office, the degree of contact between the Bank and the Government, and the reporting rights and responsibilities of the Bank to the Government, and vice versa. The clause and amendments Nos. 16 and 17 deal with the differences between models of independence in terms of who sets the inflation targets, how such targets are set and what their statutory objectives are.
<P>
Clause 12 would not have been necessary if the Government had opted for total target independence--the highest degree of independence that can be given to a central bank. Such independence has been given to the German Bundesbank, which, as I am sure hon. Members are aware, has a price stability objective in its statutes. However, the interpretation of that objective in relation to inflation targets--or other intermediary targets, such as money supply--is a matter for the bank and its governing body.
<P>
There are many arguments in favour of target independence. It gives the maximum degree of independence and is of great benefit for the credibility that is the rationale behind that institutional change. There would be greater benefits in terms of lower interest rates, as risk premiums for future inflation seen by the markets are reduced. Target independence gives the maximum degree of independence because the objective has been set by the Bank and need not be changed after an election; it would certainly not be changed between elections. It would be clear to the markets that the Bank's objectives would not change even if the electorate returned a different party to Parliament after an election, and that there would be a long-term, stable inflation policy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ross Cranston </B>(Dudley, North): Does the hon. Gentleman concede that under our system the lifetime of a Parliament can vary? We do not have the American system of four-year elections. The amendment does not identify a definite period; it is a flexible period, depending on when elections are called.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> The hon. Gentleman anticipates my arguments. I hope to cover that important point later. The amendment seeks to clarify how frequently the targets are changed.
<P>
As a backround, we need to understand the arguments against target independence, however. Liberal Democrats do not support target independence; indeed, we support the Government for not choosing that form of independence. The arguments against target independence relate to democratic accountability. It is right that the Government should set the objective for the Bank, to ensure that the overall economic policy framework is set by politicians, who are accountable to the people for that. Granting a central bank target independence may have other objectives. For example, a Eurofed--an independent central bank in Europe--would be designed to achieve the gains from the single currency. In such a case, granting the bank target independence might be worthwhile even though it would lead to some reduction in democratic accountability. However, the Bill does not have such aims. Therefore, we do not favour target independence for the Bank of England.
<P>
That leaves us with the Government's proposal for operational independence. However, there are alternative models for operational independence, which are based on the frequency with which the Government can change the inflation target. This clause will allow the Government to set the objectives as frequently as they like. Indeed, it is phrased in such a way as to allow them to change the target every week, or even every day. The clause will oblige them to set the target at least once a year, but they will not be prevented from setting it much more frequently. That provision will reduce the Bank's independence significantly.
<P>
The Government have said that they do not intend to change the target. However, they have said that if they change the target, they will do so only in a downward direction. Although those statements are welcome, they beg the question as to whether Government policy may change.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick Gibb </B>(Bognor Regis and Littlehampton): Does not the hon. Gentleman's proposal mean that the Government are more likely to rely on clause 19 of the Bill? If severe external shocks to the economy have to be taken account of when delivering the inflation target, the amendment will prevent the Government from changing the target. It will be left to the Bank to do something. If the Bank were forced to stick to the target set by the Government before the shock to the economy occurred, we could face severe difficulties with high unemployment resulting from the Bank not relaxing the target in a period of economic shock. Therefore, the Government are more likely to rely more frequently on the exemptions in clause 19. In effect, that will make the Bank less independent than it would otherwise have been.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for that point, but his argument does not necessarily follow. Clause 19 might be the backstop, but how the target is set and the ranges that are given to the Bank will become as important--probably far more important--than the reserve powers. I believe in granting the Bank independence, but I am not sure that the hon. Gentleman does given his earlier comments. That might be why he is trying to disrupt the amendment.
<P>
For those of us who believe in the Bank's independence, the issue is the extent of its independence. If we reduce the frequency with which the Government can set the inflation target, that will create much greater independence and, thus, provide much greater benefit to the country.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Boswell </B>(Daventry): I am following the hon. Gentleman's argument with interest, but let us consider the logic of it. If the target can be set just once during a Parliament, the Government--unless, they were to use the override clause that we shall discuss later--will be able to override it only by calling a general election? Would the hon. Gentleman welcome that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> As I shall seek to argue, the amendment would retain democratic accountability. As the hon. Gentleman points out, the Government could go to the electorate and ask them for authority to change the basis of, and the targets for, their economic policy which was based on the mandate that they received at the previous election.
<P>
The amendment is designed to help the Government. It would take further their commmitment not to change the target. I wish to impress on the Ministers the importance of that. If we were to build an anti-inflation culture in this country and to create an institutional structure that will embed an anti-inflation bias in the system, we must build a framework that will prevent future Governments from manipulating targets between elections. 
<P>
If the Paymaster Gengeral is impressed by that argument, will he consider the possibility--it may seem remote to him at the moment--of a future Conservative Government? As he will be the first to recognise, the previous Conservative Government were weak on inflation and had a poor inflation target. The targets used during their 18 years in office changed frequently. That was partly why their inflation performance was so weak. If the Government accept our amendment, they will enshrine in law a safeguard against a furture Conservative Government's mismanagement of the economy. I urge the Minister to support the amendment on that basis. It would limit the frequency with which the inflation target could be changed, while retaining accountability. It does not go as far as target independence.
<P>
The Government might say that they need freedom and flexibility, but there is a danger of abuse. If that freedom is abused, the benefits of independence will diminish or be lost. Even without abuse, the markets might anticipate the potential for abuse in the future and want to insure against it. The benefits of certainty and stability, which the Government are seeking to gain for our country, will be lost. The amendment is important and would help to ensure that the Government fulfilled their objectives. 
<P>
Several other issues are important and question the wisdom of allowing Governments frequently to change their targets. One issue is how monetary policy works in practice. There is a degree of consensus--unusual among economists on these issues--that monetary policy takes between 18 and 24 months to work. There is a lag in the effect of interest rate changes on the economy. The long time lags suggest that the Bank should be given at least a chance to hit the targets. If those targets are to be moved frequently, we are asking the Bank to achieve the impossible. If we want to hold the Bank truly accountable, we must ensure that the targets are in place for a certain period to give it a realistic chance of assessing how its monetary policy is working.
<P>
Another argument is that accountability will be more secured if the targets can be set only once during a Parliament because the profile of inflation targets will be much higher during general elections when the kernels of economic policy are debated. It would be for the political parties to state the inflation targets--2 per cent. for one party, 3 per cent. for another and 4 per cent. for another, which, in government, they would set for the Bank. The higher profile given to inflation targets during elections would ensure greater accountability, with people being given the opportunity to choose between policies. That would strengthen the Government's mandate on inflation targets.
<P>
A final argument confronts head-on the Government's desire for flexibility. Targets can be set to incorporate flexibility. The Liberal Democratic party proposes a target of between 0 and 3 per cent.--a larger span than the Government's target of 1 per cent. either side of 2.5 per cent. It is possible to set targets while retaining flexibility with respect to policy and securing all attendant benefits, but if setting the target is permitted only once in a Parliament other benefits can also be obtained--there will be increased independence.
<P>
To conclude, the amendment is constructive and in line with Government policy, but would bring about a slight shift towards greater independence for the Bank. I hope that the Government will consider it seriously, because it will make their policy more successful.

<P>

<B>Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory </B>(Wells): I shall speak to two of the amendments that I have tabled in the group, and my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) will deal with the others. Perhaps some issues that may not arise for discussion on the amendments can be dealt with on clause stand part.
<P>
Amendment No. 20 is intended to probe the Government's understanding of price stability. Students of English would have a ready answer to the question. Price stability surely means no price increases. If a shopkeeper put up a sign in his window, saying that he would keep his prices stable, and then put them up, his customers would agree that he had broken his promise. On the face of it, price stability means zero inflation; prices should not rise. Under clause 11 the Bank of England would by law have to pursue price stability. That objective would override subsidiary aims concerning growth and employment. Zero inflation is a pretty demanding objective. Clause 11 is, however, qualified in clause 12, under which the Government would tell the Bank from time to time what price stability means. It is therefore important that we should know now, roughly, the Government's aims in this respect.
<P>
When the Government took office in May one of their first actions was to loosen the inflation target. They inherited a target of 2.5 per cent. or less. The Conservatives were committed to that target and reached it during the previous Parliament. That was an achievement of my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke). It is not true that inflation was accelerating at the time of the general election. It was falling slightly. Opposition Members have in other debates criticised the Government's loosening of the inflation target. It sends the wrong message to the markets, economic agents, wage bargainers and so on, to the effect that the Government will be softer on inflation than their predecessors. They now have a target of 2.5 per cent. or less, or more. It can vary by 1 per cent. on either side. Only if inflation rose above 3.5 per cent. therefore, would the Bank of England be required to write to the Government about remedial measures and with an explanation of its intentions.
<P>
The present situation is therefore rather dangerous. We have a loosened inflation target, which is a moving target, as it may be changed again. The Governor of the Bank of England speculated earlier this week that the inflation target might have to be reduced. He thought that 2.5 per cent. might be too high if we are really to proceed to economic and monetary union in Europe. Perhaps the target will be lower.
<P>
There is also a rumour that the Government will change the definition of inflation. The current method of measurement is by RPIX, which is the retail prices index without mortgate interest. However, the Government are under pressure to adopt the European Union's harmonised index of consumer prices. That is based on other factors and items in the shopping basket, which is assessed monthly. That is probably tempting for the Government because it would show lower inflation. I hope that the Paymaster General will explain the Government's aim. We need to know the Government's intentions on the inflation measurement, and whether there will be a moving target, which the Government will alter from time to time, probably without notice. The phrase ``price stability'' is already qualified, but such action would cause prices to become erratic, and create the opposite of stability, which the Government mention so often.
<P>
In speaking to amendment No. 13, I draw attention to the danger of monetary and fiscal policy diverging. Fiscal policy has a considerable impact on monetary policy; the policies cannot be completely separated. The quantity of money in the economy and the velocity with which it circulates is affected by the Government's budgetary and other decisions. It is frequently observed that low inflation can be achieved only if monetary and fiscal policy pull in the same direction. There are worrying signs in this country that that is not happening.
<P>
<B>Jacqui Smith </B>(Redditch): The Right hon. Gentleman stresses the importance of clarity in fiscal policy. Will he therefore join me in congratulating the Chancellor on introducing a pre-Budget report, which sets out the rules for fiscal policy before the Budget and thus clarifies matters?
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I wish that I could, but we are more confused after the Chancellor's pre-Budget statement than we were before. For example, he made much of the prospective cut in the nominal rate of corporation tax. However, he did not say that British companies would have a &#163;2 billion cash flow disadvantage from 1999 until at least the end of the Parliament, and possibly even longer. Therefore, the Chancellor's projection of his ambitions and proposed tax changes were far from clear or accurate.
<P>
I cannot resist also pointing out to the hon. Lady that the previous Government moved a long way towards openness, clarity and accountability by publishing minutes of the Treasury's monthly meetings so that the outside world could see the interplay between advice and decision making, and how my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke) balanced his objectives of growth, falling unemployment and low inflation. He successfully achieved that by the end of the previous Parliament.
<P>
The hon. Lady does not challenge the importance of ensuring that all economic levers operate in the same direction, and are seen to do so. That is the key to the comparative success of German monetary policy since the war. Germans have a cultural attachment to low inflation. They suffered from two hyper-inflations this century, which destroyed their inter-war democracy. All German trade unions, firms and Governments therefore know that it is essential for the stability of the German state.
<P>
That contrasts rather interestingly with the attitudes in Latin America, which appeared to be able to live with very high inflation due to indexing prices, wages and savings without damaging living standards. That was wrong. It now realises that and it has generally brought inflation under control.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies </B>(Croydon, Central): The right hon. Gentleman refers to stability in Germany in the post-war years. Does he not agree that the fundamental reason for that is the independence of the bank of Germany? If he believes what he just said, he would have introduced those measures under his own Government, which he obviously failed to do.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> No, I am making a rather different point, if the hon. Gentleman will bear with me. Two prerequisites of successful independence by a central bank are that there is widespread attachment to the aims of price stability and that fiscal policy pulls in the same direction. I was saying that that has happened generally in Germany with an exception that I am about to describe, but that that is not the case in this country yet. I was about to point out how the July Budget was not a happy example of monetary and fiscal policy pulling in the same direction.
<P>
There have been one or two exceptions in Germany, but the most noticeable one was after reunification, where, in retrospect, the huge costs should have been paid for by increased taxes, but the German Government were very reluctant to raise taxes or cut expenditure elsewhere sufficiently. They therefore ran a comparatively loose fiscal policy for a number of years, and the strain was taken by monetary policy, which became very tight. Interest rates rose and that caused acute difficulties and embarrassment for other central banks and other economies in the European Union.
<P>
Reunification was therefore a rather unusual economic shock, which destroyed the exchange rate mechanism in 1993. We came out a year earlier because we could not match German requirements. They were quite probably and understandably setting their monetary policy to suit German conditions. Indeed, the Bundesbank has a constitutional duty to do that, but it did not suit the rest of the European Union. That is a pointer to the dangers of economic and monetary union--in its full form, a single European currency--where the final ejection of individual currencies would no longer be possible. The strains would manifest themselves in other ways, probably through very high unemployment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> The example that the right hon. Gentleman quotes of the strains that German reunification imposed on monetary policy across Europe proves the case for monetary union. It was such an unusual, once-in-a-lifetime, once-in-a-century happening. It is very unusual to get economic shocks that affect one nation and not the whole of the western European community.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> The hon. Gentleman is intervening more with hope than evidence. There have been other shocks, which, by definition, are unexpected. German reunification may have been a one-off event, but it does not mean that other similar events cannot happen. Indeed, in the past few decades several oil price shocks have had rather similar consequences. Such events are never expected and are certainly very unwelcome. It is very bold of the hon. Gentleman to say that there will never be a similar event.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> As my right hon. Friend knows, I take a certain interest in the German economy. Does he not find it remarkable that, seven years after economic union, forced essentially for political reasons, and huge transfers running in the order of &#163;25 billion sterling a year between the two halves of Germany, unemployment rates there have remained extremely high because its industry was made uncompetitive? Those rates are still rising; they are currently more than 20 per cent. Has not that example of an attempt to force convergence led to substantial and damaging divergence?
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> That was a perceptive intervention by my hon. Friend. He is unanswerably right and factually correct. When we debated the Finance Bill we had to lean heavily on my hon. Friend's mother for advice. Hon. Members who were on that Committee will remember frequent interventions that were clearly based on discussions between my hon. Friend and his mother.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We are straying a little far from the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> If knowledge about German unification comes from a relation, perhaps we could pass on our thanks to the person concerned.
<P>
The serious point is that if economic and monetary union is attempted between two very different economies, as in Germany, it is hugely disruptive and very expensive. It is becoming successful now because it is one country, with a federal Government and a large federal budget. If we attempt something similar in the Euroepan Union, where there are profound differences between the constituent economies, it will need political, monetary and budgetary union and taxation expenditure of the same magnitude if it is to have any chance of succeeding. Those are important illustrations that support the contention that there is a close link between monetary and fiscal policy. They cannot be divorced. When they pull in opposite directions there are strains and difficulties, with adverse social and political consequences.
<P>
I said that I would mention the British experience in this context. In his Budget speech in July, the Chancellor identified certain consumer expenditure pressures, I believe to try to justify the big tax increases that were subsequently imposed on the corporate and pensions sector. The Chancellor identified consumer expenditure as a possible difficulty, but he did not deal with it in the Budget. The only tax increases imposed on that sector were in indirect taxation: the Chancellor put up fuel duty, and duties on tabacco and alcohol are to rise.
<P>
The main tax increases were in the pensions sector. There was the notorious &#163;5 billion-a-year raid on that sector--a slow-burning fuse, which takes money out of the economy. It was a tax-raising measure, but the balance and timing had important monetary consequences, which, as far as I know, were not spelt out at the time. Amendment No. 13 would provide for the monetary consequences of fiscal policies to be described and reported to the Bank of England, so that when it plans interest rate decisions it can be aware of the monetary consequences of fiscal policy. If that had been done in the July Budget it would have helped the Bank of England in its assessment of future interest rate requirements.
<P>
Amendment No. 13 is a modest requirement; it should not be too difficult for the Treasury to accede to it. Several other matters are to be reported to the Bank or notice is to be given in writing, so it would not be an onerous requirement. However, in view of the interaction between monetary and fiscal policy, it is important.
<P>
With those few words, I have introduced my amendments, but I know that other hon. Members will want to speak to other amendments in the group.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> My right hon. Friend made some perceptive comments. I want to focus on amendments Nos. 21 and 22, but my remarks will not be confined to them and I want, if I may, to reverse their batting order.
<P>
I listened with interest to the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey). It is useful to put it on the record that all members of the Committee agree that what is under discussion is a proposal for the operational independence of the Bank. The hon. Gentleman drew a careful and broadly precise distinction between what is operational and what is target independence. We are not talking about the latter, although some of my right hon. and hon. Friends would probably have some sympathy with the concept. It would give the Bank wider responsibility in a broader context, as is the case with the Bundesbank in Germany.
<P>
We are faced with what Sir Alan Walters, who was mentioned earlier, once called a half-baked proposal. That was in the context of monetary union. The difficulty is that unless one precisely transfers the whole job to somebody else, there will always be transitional arguments about time and operational responsibility. Without attributing--on this occasion--any malign motives to the Government, the proposal nevertheless provides an opportunity for constructive confusion.
<P>
Some of us will remember the way in which the late and great Sir Humphrey, whom I have quoted once before in this Committee, conducted matters. Some awful problem arose when Jim Hacker was the mythical Prime Minister, which turned out to be the result of confusion as to whether the Prime Minister or the Deputy Prime Minister was in charge during the Prime Minister's absence abroad. Whatever the difficulty was, it disappeared without trace, effortlessly, elegantly--of course--and with nobody's fingerprints on it. In matters financial, which involve the sensitivity of markets, it is crucial to know where we are going. The amendments, which have been tabled by Liberal Democrat and Conservative Members, are designed to probe exactly what is going on.
<P>
The points on which I want to focus are, first, the frequency of instructions from the Chancellor to the Bank and, secondly, the nature of those instructions and the relevance of other aspects of economic policy.
<P>
With regard to frequency, it is fair to ask the Government whether it is necessary to have the same period specified for their economic policy and their objectives for price stability. I understand the point that the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton was making about setting a price stability test for a Parliament, even if I do not agree with it. Clearly it is unlikely--and, in my previous experience of Labour Governments, virtually inconceivable--that the current Government will not want to modify its economic policy within the period of a Parliament. It would be unrealistic--though perhaps welcome--to expect a general election to be held to test the point every time there was a slight change in the economic weather.
<P>
I am well aware--we have the original remit letter as a template, as well as the clause under consideration--that there is no reason why the Treasury's notice should not also specify price stability and what the Government's economic policy should be. Those are distinct matters, but they could be embraced in the same letter. It is also perfectly possible to have a letter saying, ``As to price stability--ditto the last instruction'', and ``As to economic policy, please look for the following changes of emphasis or policy.'' That is perfectly intelligible, and it could be done, so a different period for the two types of notice or instruction need not necessarily be specified--they could be embraced within the same letter.
<P>
Price stability, on which my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells has spoken, appears to be a simple concept which is at the heart and the headline of the Bank's remit in its operational independence. It is somewhat elastic; from time to time, reputable economists write that zero inflation--which is what one normally assumes price stability to mean--is a misleading concept. There are always technical changes that alter efficiency and the value added by the goods purchased, and therefore a nominal rate of inflation of 1 per cent. to 2 per cent. is not really inflation at all.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cranston:</B> I cannot understand the hon. Gentleman's argument. The amendment proposes to remove the capacity of the Treasury to set these objectives--to specify the particular price stability goal. Is the aim of that to allow the Bank to set the inflation target? That does not seem to be the purport of his remarks. The right hon. Member for Wells spoke about price stability meaning zero inflation, which is nonsense. He then praised the former Chancellor, who set an inflation range. Can the hon. Gentleman explain what the amendment aims to do, or is it a wrecking amendment?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I shall readily explain to the hon. Gentleman. He may or may not choose to accept my assurance that I am trying to be helpful. The amendments have been devised so that they are technically in and can be debated. Seeking to leave something out of the Bill, allows us to ask the Government to explain what they are doing, what it means and what is involved. The purpose of my discourse, which the hon. Gentleman implicitly accepted in what he just said--as a matter of course, as if I had merely stated the obvious--is that a zero nominal inflation rate is not necessarily what he means, and even what I mean, by price stability. We are, as I said in a previous debate, wrestling with a massive lack of definition.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> The hon. Gentleman has said that the reason for the amendment is not to propose amendments to the Bill but to discuss the issues. I presume from what he has said that we all want to leave these lines in and that the Opposition will not be voting for their amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The hon. Gentleman would do well to wait and see whether we choose to vote on any of the amendments in the group, or whether my hon. Friends and I feel inclined to consider the clause as a whole. I hope that he will accept that the intention of the amendment--like the others in the group--is to probe the concept so that we have a response from the Minister. I hope that the hon. Gentleman has sufficient confidence in his Paymaster General to assume that his massive eloquence and the roundness of his observations on these very important issues will enable us to desist.
<P>
The amendments are intended to probe very important issues. The one on which I was about to conclude deals with price stability, what it means, how much of it needs to be stated in the Treasury's remit notice to the Bank, whether the Bank understands that and how it will respond. Those are important issues.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I return to the question of the time period. I assume that there is to be a single notice which states that price stability is unchanged, or changed in certain respects, and that economic policy will be modified in relation to X. But amendment No. 22--it is brief, so I had difficulty spotting it--suggests that the maximum period should be reduced from 12 months to six. Those with experience of Standing Committees will know that debates about time, and the words ``may'' and ``shall'', can take huge lengths of time.
<P>
Before I reach the substance of my point, I should say that there is no absolute science in the matter. The Chancellor could write to the Bank every day with a new remit letter, but it would be sensible for accountability to write every six months. I shall explain why.

<P>

<B>Mr. Steve McCabe </B>(Birmingham, Hall Green): I confess that I am suffering from the same confusion that is afflicting my hon. Friends. I want to check that I am correct. Is the hon. Gentleman saying that, under amendment No. 22, he wants the Treasury to specify its economic policy not once but twice a year, and that under amendment No. 21 he wants to delete the requirement for the Treasury to specify economic policy at all?
<P>
<B>Mr. Cranston:</B> The hon. Gentleman just wants to have a debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The hon. Member for Dudley, North (Mr. Cranston) endeavours to help his hon. Friend from a sedentary position. We want a debate about Government economic policy and how often it should be reported to the Bank. Such a report should become a public document; it would be relevant to the Bank's operational activities and should be on the record for us all to see and, if appropriate, debate in Parliament. I suggested six months as a maximum period. The hon. Member for Redditch (Jacqui Smith) suggested that there had been a great innovation, but there has been an autumn economic statement for many years under Governments of both political colours. There were many mini-Budgets under Labour Governments because they had to keep putting taxes up, but I shall leave that matter to one side.
<P>
Those who were paying attention on Tuesday will have noticed that the Chancellor will now come to the House at least twice a year to make a major economic statement. He has given a pre-Budget report and will present a Budget in due course. Given that there will be two economic statements a year, it would be sensible to use those occasions to publish in conjunction a statement of the Government's economic policy. To close the point, the Chancellor would not have to alter the price stability target, but he would be able to brief the Bank.
<P>
On the subject of timing, I should draw to the Committee's attention a point that was not embraced by our amendment; indeed, it was stimulated by exchanges with the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton. I am concerned; perhaps the Paymaster General will respond. I put it to the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton that a way out would be to have a general election. There would be a fresh set of instructions from the incoming Government. If the outgoing Government were re-elected--perish the thought--they might issue unchanged instructions. As the hon. Gentleman said, there would be a political debate during a general election about what should or should not happen. His remarks prompt me to ask the Government to reflect on the fact that general elections are sensitive periods. Ministers are precluded from making decisions, other than those that are necessary to run the Government on a non-partisan basis. Controversial decisions are not made during the campaign. I am not sure whether the timings that we suggest would help. They would mean that instructions issued to the Bank would be more current than if they were 12 months old.
<P>
Governments have had to alter interest rates during a general election. That power is now the Bank's, but it is possible that an economic shock or a political shock--such as a war--could lead to a general election and have economic consequences. The Bank would then have to operate on the remit letter issued by the outgoing Chancellor, who would not know whether his Government would be returned. If the Chancellor felt it necessary to change policy, would he be able to issue a new remit letter, or would he have to use the override procedure? Issuing a new remit letter might appear a politically controversial act.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the clause specifies the minimum number of times that a letter needs to be written, not the maximum? It allows a Chancellor to write as often as he or she likes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I conceded that point some time ago, but a real difficulty would arise if the Chancellor carried out what could be regarded as a politically controversial act in a general election campaign. A decision to change policy might be in the national interest, and not politically motivated, but a Chancellor could not issue a letter in that period, because that would be regarded as politically controversial. The point is a small but sensitive one. I hope that the Paymaster General will consider it.
<P>
I come now to the more general point about the definition of economic policy. The wrecking amendment would remove the definition of that policy from consideration. Unless the Government adopt a steely extreme conservatism and a stick-in-the-mud, reactionary posture--[Interruption.] I am glad that hon. Members laugh, as some of us are tempted to criticise the Government's dangerous desire to remit responsibility. Lord Healey, the former Chancellor, coined the phrase ``sado-monetarism'', and I hope that no one on the Government Benches wishes to practice that.
<P>
Most Governments change economic policy from time to time. If they do not admit to mistakes--they tend to do so only after a period in opposition--[Interruption.] I thought to cheer the Committee with that remark, but it is sincere.
<P>
Governments nuance their policies. I assume that the Bank will be told privately about any nuances that exist. The Bill will not disconnect the Chancellor's telephone line to the Governor. Opposition Members are keen to establish openness and clarity, as is the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee. The Government should clarify the nature of any changes, and how those changes are communicated. That connects with the earlier point I made about the time period. It is likely that there will be changes, and that will feed into the mix considered by the Monetary Policy Committee. The Chancellor has sent a remit letter to the Bank setting up its committee which is now operating, although he has nominal responsibility for the setting of interest rates until the Bill is completed. There will then be a new remit letter. But in the meantime we had a pre-Budget statement on Tuesday. 
<P>
This is not a purely trivial matter and I should like to consider what would happen if I were a member of the Monetary Policy Committee. A later clause will make it quite clear that I could not be while a Member of Parliament, and I am not sure that I would want to be even if I could. I might not even be qualified, but that is another matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> Nor the hon. Gentleman's mother.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I shall leave her to speak for herself.
<P>
I am not going to be a member of the Monetary Policy Committee but if I were I would need to know how to score these things. Do I need only to read the remit letter, not the Financial Times or Government briefings? Do I need to be a lawyer or to go to judicial review and seek the advice of learned counsel? Would I simply have to take the Chancellor's letter as economic policy?
<P>
One or two Labour Members will have spotted that some changes in economic policy took place the other day although they were perhaps not as portentous as the Chancellor claimed. Do those feed into the mix? Are they part of the economic policy which the Monetary Policy Committee is seeking as a subordinate matter in clause 11 to advance or not? We should be told in a rather more precise form.
<P>
Another element in this might be the impact of international economic policies. We are members of the European Union. We are in a sense, and it is sometimes in a somewhat imprecise sense, obliged or bound by commitments we undertake thereto. They are not always in the clear justifiable form that we are used to from English practice. But, for example, moves will be under discussion in the Economic and Financial Council on Monday to look at tax harmonisation with a view to avoiding harmful tax competition. Some of those matters were discussed in a European Standing Committee only this week.
<P>
The Chancellor has now announced a lower rate of corporation tax. He made a great play of saying that this is beneficial. He did not say too much about the changes in advanced corporation tax, which have accelerated the payment of corporation tax and which are likely to be negative to the tune of &#163;2 billion by the end of the Parliament in terms of business. But as the late Iain Macleod once said, one should not shoot even a one-legged Santa Claus, so I will not do so this morning.
<P>
However, let us suppose that there was to be a discussion on harmful tax competition which put the frighteners on Government tax policies for a 30 per cent. corporation tax rate when, strikingly--it is one of their problems--the German economy has a 45 per cent. corporation tax. Is that a bit of British economic policy? It is something that the bank would have to consider? As my right hon. Friend said earlier, we also need to look at the interaction between monetary policies. We know from earlier debates that the Bank will be allowed to look not simply at interest rates but more widely across monetary policy to fiscal policy.
<P>
Our concern is that at the delivery end Government economic, fiscal and monetary policies have to be a seamless web. The whole thing has to fit together to have any coherence. We are very short on definitions. I can understand why the Government should be leery of defining the term ``economic policy'' and not too keen on giving too precise a definition on a permanent basis of what price stability might be, as opposed to the level which they will consider acceptable.
<P>
We need a clearer understanding from the Government of how the bits will fit together. We need a more frequent report from the Government and the Treasury to the Bank and to the nation about any changes of nuances to material developments in economic policy or in their interpretation of price stability. We need a clearer understanding of how they will work together.
<P>
	I close on a point that I dealt with in the narrow context of a general election campaign when Ministers are to some extent disabled from taking controversial action. We are in a period of great market sensitivities, and things may go terribly wrong if policy is mishandled. The abiding concern of Opposition Members is that the extension of operational responsibility will take us into new territory. The model is untried--certainly in the United Kingdom--and unless the provisions are clearly defined, the Government will face problems in the conduct of their policy and the nation will suffer from the consequences of that.

<P>

<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> This area of the Government's economic policy is important. I support the amendment because clause 12(1) does not cover exchange rate policy, which is a problem that has plagued British economic policy for decades.
<P>
Some economists believe in a magic formula. They believe that if we can link our exchange rate to that of the deutschmark or another supersound currency, we will somehow eliminate inflation for all time. However much I read such opinions, I can never fathom why people believe that linking one exchange rate with that of another country will mechanically translate the inflation rate in the country with the sound currency into the inflation rate in the other. I do not see the logical link.
<P>
It is like playing around with a thermometer in the hope that that will change the room temperature. Of course, it will not. One is more likely to break the thermometer. Experiments in linking our exchange rate with those of other currencies have only damaged the economy. The exchange rate mechanism was a classic example of that. During the recession, we had to raise interest rates or keep them at 10 or 11 per cent. in order to keep our currency at the level deemed appropriate by the Government. That was absurd, and the recession was prolonged as a result. Labour Members may smirk, but they supported that policy on the exchange rate mechanism. It is important to determine the Government's policy on exchange rates if monetary policy is to be conducted by a different agency. Exchange rate policy and monetary policy will be conducted separately.
<P>
The Bank of England has the power to use its foreign reserves to intervene in the financial markets, but what will happen if the policy of the Bank of England and the financial markets differs from that of the Government? The Bank of England will do one thing in the markets while the Government do another. In his autobiography, the late Nick Ridley stated that the Bank of England always has a tendency to want to intervene in foreign exchanges. He wrote:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``For what purpose would they use interest rate policy? In order to try to secure an artificial exchange rate, or to control the domestic money supply? The Bank of England is well known for its attachment to interfering with the exchange rate, and could never be trusted to operate interest rate policy for the sole purpose of domestic stability.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That leads to the crunch of my concerns. The Bill says that the Bank of England should conduct interest rate policy for domestic inflationary purposes. If the Bank decides it needs to raise interest rates to choke off inflationary pressure, what will happen if the Government's view is that the level of sterling is too high? One could argue that we face this problem at present.
<P>
The Government may decide to intervene in the exchange markets to lower the level of sterling by selling pounds, but that will boost the monetary supply at a time when the Bank is trying to reduce it by raising interest rates. The Government will, covertly or otherwise, put pressure on the Monetary Policy Committee not to raise interest rates, because that will push the pound up while the Government are trying to pursue an exchange rate policy to push it down. There will be conflict. The Bill does nothing to expose the Government's exchange rate policy to the public. It is vital for us to know what is happening, because policy measures that are almost polar opposites will be pursued. It would be helpful if the Paymaster General would explain the Government's exchange rate policy, to enable us to know how the Bank of England will be affected.
<P>
Can we be sure that the Chancellor will not send covert messages to the Monetary Policy Committee about the Government's views on how the Bank of England should approach interest rates? That question is relevant, because if the Government want a lower level of sterling they will not want the Bank to raise interest rates. An interesting paper has just been published on this matter by Goldman Sachs, who should know what is happening. The paper states that the Government published on Tuesday a ``more pessimistic'' forecast that that of the Bank of England. It continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Chancellor's implied message to the Monetary Policy Committee is to err on the side of raising interest rates.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The problem is how to be sure what is happening. While we try to create the so-called independent Bank of England, implied messages will be conveyed all the time. That is why I support the amendments in the names of my right hon. and hon. Friends. I want clarification of the Government's policy, in particular on the exchange rate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick St. Aubyn </B>(Guildford): I reinforce the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb) which gets to the heart of the matter. Three myths are current. The first is that before 1 May the Bank of England was in a sense dependent and that it is becoming independent. The truth is that before 1 May the relationship between the Treasury and the Bank of England was one of interdependence. As the debate so far has made clear, the Treasury and the Bank are still interdependent. It would confirm the Paymaster General's reputation for clarity and honesty if he would simply agree with that point, because it is as obvious to the outside world as it is to hon. Members.
<P>
The second myth, which has been repeated by Labour Members this morning, is that the German economy's success in controlling inflation is due to its independent central bank. The German central bank was modelled, after the war, on the Federal Reserve bank in America. The great apostles of the German system cannot explain why, if an independent central bank ensures low inflation, America's inflation experience has been so much more like ours than Germany's. As we all know, the rate of the pound against the deutschmark has gone down since the war from DM12 to just under DM3. However, the rate of sterling against the dollar today stands higher than it did 22 years ago under the previous Labour Government.
<P>
The conquest of post-war inflation in the United States really took effect only after the great period of Paul Volcker's governorship of the Fed. In the opinion of many people he brought about a golden chapter in the history of that institution by his determined and at times painful efforts to bring down inflation and in the process win--just as the previous Government did--credibility for an anti-inflationary policy. It may be advisable for the Paymaster General to agree; if he does not agree, he is arguing for an independent central bank, but clause 12 makes it clear that we are not dealing with an independent central bank.
<P>
When the Governor of the Bank of England recently visited Parliament, I asked him how he would score the independence of the Bank before 1 May and after the Bill's implementation, and then compare that score against the federal system in Germany and the United States. He responded that he would opt for a score of eight and a score of 15--he did not say out of what! However, he did make it clear that the scores for the central banks of Germany and the United States would be much higher. Let us assume a maximum of 50 rather than 20. The Governor also stated that he did not want the political responsibility for setting an inflation target. He welcomed the fact that that remained with the Government and he drew a distinction between the system that will obtain here and that of other countries. That reinforces my first point.
<P>
Of what does price stability consist? Setting a central inflation target of 2.5 per cent., plus or minus 1 per cent., allows a 40 per cent. variation. In other words, not reaching the target has to be outside the realms of normal probability. In other countries the central responsibility of central banks is price stability, but the Government are aiming only for inflation stability. In comparison with previous Labour Governments, that is an improvement, but it does not measure up to the challenge of achieving price stability. The Government's way of dealing with the problem will in the short term, undermine the market's confidence in the Government's proposals.
<P>
My final point goes beyond that of my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton on exchange rate policy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> Should the Government aim for price stability--zero inflation--given that the experience of Canada and elsewhere suggests that going too far down that road can destroy economic activity and cause recession?
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> There is no doubt that zero inflation has to be a long-term target and economic policy is all about timing--political as well as economic. To achieve zero inflation, the people of the country have to be carried along. The political will to achieve low and then zero inflation must be there. Without it, technocrats in central banks cannot achieve that aim.
<P>
My final point exposes the thinness of the change that the Bill will make to the management of monetary policy. We heard on Tuesday from the Economic Secretary that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a stable and competitive exchange rate is important'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and she went on to say that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the exchange rate regime is the Government's responsibility.''--[Official Report, Standing Committee D, 25 November 1997; c. 114-5.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There it is in black and white. When the Government set the Bank's economic policy, it will include the exchange rate.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Economic Secretary failed to answer my question and I hope that the Paymaster General will now do so. If the situation painted by my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton arose, in which monetary policy and counter-inflationary policy demand that interest rates should rise, but the Government's economic policy in respect of exchange rates demands that they do not, which would take precedent? Can the hon. Gentleman give us an answer for all time? If he can give an answer only for the moment, which his Government may change in future, our point will remain clear: holding over the Governor the spectre of breaking the Government's exchage rate policy, means that the Government believe that the interest rate policy must remain subservient.

<P>

<B>The Paymaster General </B>(Mr. Geoffrey Robinson): For clarification, Mr. Butterfill are we considering all the amendments to clause 12?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> We are discussing amendments Nos. 16, 20, 21, 13, 22 and 17.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> Shall I therefore move Government amendment No. 11?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> We shall come to that after this group of amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> Thank you, Mr. Butterfill.
<P>
There have been a number of contributions to our debate this morning. The Opposition have used the two wrecking amendments to open a wider debate than would usually arise in discussing such proposals, and I shall respond to that debate in a moment.
<P>
The amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton proposed that the Chancellor should not give a remit letter to the Governor more than once every five years, or once in every Parliament. I can see what the hon. Gentleman wants. It is fair to say that, largely, when the Chancellor gave the Bank operational independence he depoliticised the process. It was clear during the last election that the Conservative Chancellor had refused to put up rates precisely for political reasons. That has been the principal position of the Liberal Democrats for a long time; generally, they have fully supported our moves with regard to the Bank of England.
<P>
The amendment was a good means of airing the concerns of Liberal Democrats, but it would be unacceptable to impose the sort of restriction proposed on any Government. There must be flexibility. The present arrangements are that at least every year, usually with the Budget statement, there is a remit setting out the Government's policies and the inflation target for the Bank. That is a pragmatic and sensible way to proceed when the Government are doing everything that is conducive to sticking to their stated objectives, as we are. We emphasise long termism. We are making the necessary changes in corporation tax and moving towards transparency--that is the golden rule that we have spelled out in every area. The Government are committed to achieving long-term aims, and their policies are clearly focused on those objectives, the key to which--underpinning them all and almost a precondition for all of them--is the inflation rate. The flexibility that we have in addition to that in clause 19, is the right way to proceed.
<P>
On the other hand, the hon. Member for Daventry, told us that the remit should be every six months, a figure that seemed to have been plucked out of the air, because we can do it at any time. As the hon. Gentleman rightly said, if the Chancellor became so enamoured of correspondence with the Governor he could write to him daily, but that would be reductio ad absurdum any flexibility in the Bill. There is no need for a six-monthly statement. A statement should be made when necessary. Apart from in unforseeable circumstances, for which the Bill rightly provides, the occasion of the annual Budget statement is the right time to send the letter.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Wells spoke first. He took us far into the South American continent, where he considered hyperinflation and indexation. We had a taste of that in 1970, when a Conservative Government presided over such indexation. I was financial controller at British Leyland then. It was marvellous--prices were put up every other week. I am glad that parties in our country have discarded any temptation to follow the by-ways of South American economies. Some South American countries, notably Brazil, are trying with considerable success, to move away from indexation and hyperinflation. We wish them well.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Wells and other hon. Members made points about the natural interplay between fiscal and monetary policy. The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton came close to it, and the hon. Member for Guildford (Mr. St. Aubyn) tried hard, but there has not been a high level of intellectual exegesis of the case for an independent Bank. I mean no disrespect, but the confines of a Committee Room are not conducive to intellectual activity. Experience suggests that it is better to separate the central bank from Government. That is supported by all former Chancellors, notably Lord Lawson and the former right hon. Member for Kingston upon Thames. However, the Bank and the Government will not operate in separate, hermetically sealed spheres. The Bank considers the effects of the Government's economic policies, including Budget policies, corporate tax policies, our long-term objectives, general taxation, and what the right hon. Member for Wells described as a heavy imposition of taxation in the July Budget. The Bank takes all those factors into account when making judgments. Therefore, the Monetary Policy Committee, about which the hon. Member for Daventry has tabled an amendment, must be highly competent.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The substance of my point about the formal remit letter from the Chancellor to the Bank and the Monetary Policy Committee on the conduct of their affairs is that, given that economic policy has many aspects--the Paymaster General acknowledges that--it will be difficult for the Monetary Policy Committee, especially towards the end of the 12 months, to read the Chancellor's signals and know what relative weight to give the letter and any intervening changes or shifts in nuance, unless information, and further and better instructions are provided from time to time. In an effort to bring clarity, we wanted a shorter period and a clearer definition of economic policy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> Further and better instructions are one matter, but they are not needed more than once a year. The hon. Gentleman mentioned information, but there is no dearth of information about the economy. We now have more think tanks, more reports, more views and more analysts. The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton referred to Goldman Sachs, but for every Goldman Sachs there are 10 others. The Bank has all the information that it needs; and if more information or clarification is needed, the Governor can consult the Chancellor. There is no prohibition on that. It is not a conspiracy; it is an open society and information is readily available. There should be a flow of information about the economy to ensure that we make the best and most correct decisions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> That information may be misleading without an awareness of the Government's exchange rate policy. The exchange rate and the money supply figures can be examined, but the wrong conclusions might be drawn without the knowledge that, behind those figures, the Government are intervening in the foreign exchange markets, pumping sterling into the system and keeping the exchange rate lower than it would otherwise be.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> The Government's exchange rate policy is clear: we want a stable and competitive exchange rate. The Bank knows that. We do not want the gyrations of policy that so characterised the 1980s; that is one of the reasons for our actions regarding the Bank. Some good things happened in the 1980s, but it was an astonishing period in terms of macro-economic policy and management of the economy. The two huge recessions and inflation during that period were nothing short of disastrous.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> The Paymaster General puts his finger on the point, which disproves what he is trying to say. It was precisely by trying to pursue exchange rate stability in the late 1980s that the then Government's monetary policy was blown off course, when interest rates were made subservient to an exchange rate policy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I agree with the hon. Gentleman that it was a disaster. I am pleased that he has told us that. Many economists continue to debate the reasons for that disaster, and some of their views might differ from those of the hon. Member for Guildford. It was a disastrous period. Our policies are geared towards achieving long-term stability in the economy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The Paymaster General may have anticipated my question. He said initially that the Government's objective was to achieve stable and broadly competitive, or sustainable, exchange rates.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell</b> indicated assent.<P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The hon. Gentleman is nodding. He went on to mention long-term stability. Will he comment on the Governor's remarks the other day? It was reported that the Governor said that he felt rather uncomfortable about the current level of sterling, but that it was required for other reasons. I detected potential dissent in those remarks, but I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will wish to deny that. When there is more than one objective, is it not difficult to meet them both?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> There must be more than one objective in any economic policy, which is why we refer to growth and employment as ``other objectives''. There are inherent tensions in any situation, but the Government's job is to balance such tensions in our fiscal policy. We do not want to follow the previous Government in respect of their rollercoaster management the macro-economy during the 1980s. That was a textbook lesson in how not to run an economy. We have decided to make the Bank independent and remove monetary policy from political interference, and for thoe good reasons the Liberal Democrat party has supported us all along. That was confirmed. The Government hit the inflation target for one month just after the general election, but the incipient trends are upward and it is no good denying that. For political reasons, the former Chancellor had not put up interest rates, against the Governor's repeated advice. That was political interference, which is why, along with many other sound economic reasons, we have decided to make the Bank operationally independent.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> The Paymaster General may be about to make this point, but he cannot continue with this argument on interest rates and exchange rate policy without clarifying what he thinks his Government should do if a conflict of choices emerges, as it did for the Conservative Government in the late 1980s, between the needs of monetary policy and how they dictate interest rates, and the needs of the exchange rate and competitiveness, and what they imply. What will the Government do? Which will take priority?

<P>

<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> The hon. Gentleman keeps posing hypothetical situations, which he attempts to premise on the fact that they happened to the previous Government. Many things happened to the previous Government because they had bad, inconsistent and short-term economic policies. It is precisely because we are pursuing long-term, soundly based, principled policies that we are less likely to get into the bind in which the previous Government found themselves.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Ruffley </B>(Bury St. Edmunds): Is the Paymaster General saying that at no time in the future could such a conflict arise?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> These are idiotic attempts. If the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds (Mr. Ruffley) had something to say, he could have joined in the debate.
<P>
The case for operational independence is proving itself in practice as the Monetary Policy Committee gets working and gains experience in its role.
<P>
We heard an interesting--that is a civil service term--question from the hon. Member for Daventry, who asked what we would do if there were a general election. I know that after the results in Beckenham and Winchester--where the Conservatives' deficit of votes increased from two to 22,000--nothing is more in the forefront of his mind. Every year, in the normal course of events, we have a Budget and the Chancellor sets out his economic policies and sends a letter of remit, including the setting of the inflation target, to the Governor.
<P>
I can think of no reason in the world--unless the hon. Member for Daventry can give me one--why during a three of four-week election period there should be a new remit to the Governor. The election will be called and our economic policy will be in place. We sincerely believe that it will be working extremely well and that we will be right on target or acceptably close to the 2.5 per cent. target, or whatever the target is at the time of the next general election. I cannot see a need for a new remit letter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I put my remarks in the context of the possibility of an economic or even a political shock, which might even cause a general election. Will the Paymaster General accept that I made a potentially serious point? If a Government were faced with the necessity to give instructions to the Monetary Policy Committee, which would otherwise quite properly continue operating within its remit, they would be faced with two options: they could either issue a new remit letter saying that everything has changed because of a world event; or, under clause 19, they could override the remit. In both cases, the act would have a political element.
<P>
I am not asking the Paymaster General to reply today, but would he at least take advice from the Cabinet Office and others in those circumstances so that it would not be regarded as off-side to take that political act? Does he understand that that advice might be regarded as politically contentious and we would need to know the basis for it? It is one thing--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Interventions are supposed to be brief.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Indeed. I was about to conclude by saying that it is one thing for the Bank to raise interest rates in accordance with settled policy, but it is another for the Chancellor to embark on a major policy change in the advent of a general election. I should be grateful if the hon. Gentleman would reflect on that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I shall reflect, and I shall consult the Cabinet Office and more widely. I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for raising the issue in serious terms--the Government should deal with it likewise.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I asked a specific question about the measurement of inflation. Do the Government intend to move from the existing RPIX formula to a European harmonised base? The Committee should have a straight answer to that question. If it does not, people will suspect that the Government are contemplating a massive movement of the goalposts.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I can confirm that the Government's inflation target is 2.5 per cent. I should point out that on certain auspicious occasions, including the Mansion House speech, the Chancellor has said that if all goes well and if the Government continue to achieve our economic objectives, he may consider lowering the target. That is as clear an answer as the Committee requires, and it is the most that I can say.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> The Paymaster General may have misunderstood the question. I was not asking about altering the inflation target, but about altering the index. I asked the hon. Gentleman a specific question; he has had plenty of time for refuelling on this point. If he has not used that time, will he return to the point? It is important--it is not about reducing the percentage, but about any intention to alter the index.
<P>
I see that the hon. Gentleman's memory may have been refreshed. Will he inform the Committee of the Government's intention towards the indices in the long term as well as the short term?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman. I perceive that he was referring obliquely to monitoring the Government's inflation target and measures in the light of the practices of the European central bank, and asking whether that went out with the assessment of the five economic tests. Had he made that reference clear, his question would have been self-evident. To my knowledge, the Government do not intend to change our 2.5 per cent. target, or the RPIX formula. However, we must be aware of European practices. Europe uses a different measure, and will measure our performance in the light of its targets. That is good co-ordination of economic policy in the massive continental economy of which Britain is a part.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> Is the Paymaster General aware that if he does not answer, at a time when city commentators suggest that interest rates have to rise, he will give financial markets the impression that the Government believe that there is no conflict with exchange rate policy, and that the pound is on auto pilot? The question has been asked in different ways by my hon, Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, my hon. Friend the Member for Bury St. Edmunds and by me. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I am sure that the City will quake in its boots at that announcement from the hon. Member for Guildford. The airwaves and wires will be humming with it. I have made the point clear. If the hon. Gentleman is trying to make mischief, I am sorry that I shall not lend him a hand. The Government's inflation target is clear, and the Bank is setting monetary policy to achieve it. The Government want a stable and competitive pound. Nothing could be clearer.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that the Opposition's preoccupation with short-term potential friction between the needs of interest rates, in terms of monetary policy and inflation, and exchange rates underlines the fact that their focus is completely on short-termism and crisis management, as we have seen in the past 10 to 20 years? The Government's policy of long-term price stability is a necessary condition for long-term exchange rate stability, which is itself a necessary condition for continuing competitiveness in a world economy. That, combined with the welcome changes that the Chancellor has made not least to corporation tax, forms the more global picture of Britain's economic success. The Opposition's preoccupations, which we heard again and again, underline why they are in opposition.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> My hon. Friend is absolutely correct. The Opposition do not understand our policies. For 18 years they were concerned with short-term fixes and, at most, with looking no further than the next election. Their decisions on interest rates were a function of that. No. 10 and No. 11 would fall out over what the policy should be, which is why the past decade has been characterised by disastrous macro-economic management of the economy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> In a moment, but I shall not give way after that because we have dealt with all the points and it is not a productive use of the Committee's time to go over the same old ground.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The point about the exchange rate, which the hon. Member for Croydon, Central (Mr. Davies) made to assist the Paymaster General, would be true if the Government were pursuing a freely floating exchange rate policy. In the long term, the exchange rate will be stable if one conducts sensible economic policies. The Paymaster General has, however, just said that the Government's exchange rate policy is to have a competitive and stable level of sterling. He also said that their inflatoin target was 2.5 per cent. There will be many occasions on which those two policy objectives conflict, but we have heard nothing from the Paymaster General about how the Government intend to resolve that conflict. If he cannot tell us that, it shows that a senior member of the Treasury team does not know how to balance those two key objectives.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> We need no lessons from the Opposition on how to balance objectives.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jim Murphy </B>(Eastwood): Will my hon. Friend comment on the previous Government's record on the correlation between interest rates and sterling? In 1986--we are trying to move away from the manipulation of that time--the markets were concerned that sterling needed an interest rate increase. Despite that, the then Chancellor, Nigel Lawson, made a speech to the Tory party conference in which he did not increase interest rates. A week later however, he was willing to do just that. He got a standing ovation at the Conservative party conference, but the pound plummeted--as the standing ovation rose, the pound plummeted. That reflects the direct correlation between interest rates, political manipulation and sterling from which we are trying to get away.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> My hon. Friend succinctly makes the case for operational independence of the Bank. He appositely referred to Lord Lawson, who, on leaving office, came out strongly in favour of operational independence, as did his successor. No doubt the ex-Prime Minister will do so too, in due course.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The Minister must address the Chairman.
<P>
<B>Mr Robinson:</B> I am sorry, Mr. Butterfill.
<P>
I have dealt with all the points that have been raised. The Government cannot accept any of the amendments and I will have to ask my hon. Friends to resist them if they are pressed to a vote.
<P>
Will you tell me, Mr. Butterfill, when I should move Government amendment No. 11?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> When we have completed the present set of amendments. Once we have completed the discussion of Government amendment No. 11, we will have had a very full debate on virtually all aspects of the clause. I find it hard to conceive of other aspects that we might want to debate. I therefore give notice, before hon. Members wind up, that I intend to invoke Standing Order No. 89, which would not permit a stand-part debate. Hon. Members may want to reflect that in their wind-up speeches.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> May I speak again to the amendment?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Of course.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I want to return to this group of amendments because we had certain difficulties with the Paymaster General's response.
<P>
For a start, I asked him a straight question about the measurement of inflation, which he said he had not understood, although I read out the title of the alternative EU harmonised index. We then heard a somewhat waffly reply suggesting that the Government might be contemplating changing the measurement of inflation. That is worrying. If he cannot give an answer now, perhaps the Paymaster General could clarify the Government's intention in writing. The issue is of great importance to many people outside the Committee. Inflation itself is important, but the measurement of it--and changing the index or introducing other elements into the package of goods which form the basket from which the measurement is taken--are even more important.
<P>
<B>Jacqui Smith:</B> The right hon. Gentleman is clearly trying to engage the Committee in an interesting academic debate about the measurement of inflation. Does he accept, with regard to the Bill, that it is not the measurement of inflation that is significant, but the strength with which the Government pursue its control? The Bill proves the Government's commitment to pursuing that control. How inflation is measured, while of academic interest--and sometimes more--is not significant in this instance.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> The hon. Lady might, on reflection, find flaws in her argument. The measurement of inflation can depend on what items are measured. She represents many elderly people, as I do, who are concerned that the measurement should include items that they buy. There are many inflation indices, which are based on different, notional baskets of expenditure. If the Government were suddenly to switch to a basket proposed by the European Union, which excluded many of the items on which the hon. Lady's constituents felt they spent most of their money, that would be of interest to them, even if they did not object. They would want to know what was being proposed.
<P>
I am making a modest request for information. The Government are, as we know, keen on providing information and on openness and accountability. I should therefore be grateful if they would clarify their intentions on the measurement of inflation.
<P>
I must return to the possible conflict of monetary and fiscal policy. The Paymaster General seemed to suggest that I was objecting to an independent bank in theory. I was not. I was careful to say that there were good arguments in favour of a type of independent bank. Of course, the Bill is not about an independent Bank of England. It is important that fiscal and monetary policies are co-ordinated. I gave examples of countries where that had not occurred, with serious consequences. It is a precondition of any successful measure of independence by a national central bank that such co-ordination is achieved.
<P>
If we were to run a lax fiscal policy at some stage and put the entire strain on the Bank of England to correct it with a tight monetary policy, that could set up great strains in the economy, which would be dangerous. Amendment No. 13 is one way of ensuring that all the levers of economic management point in the same direction. With that in mind, we intend to press amendment No. 13 when the time comes.
<P>
Labour Members have displayed startling economic ignorance with regard to price stability and the exchange rate. Some of my hon. Friends have drawn this out; I shall fasten on one aspect of it.
<P>
It is not true that price stability necessarily generates exchange rate stability. If one is hit by an economic shock of some sort, it may require real--maybe nominal--reductions in wages and prices. That would be extremely disagreeable for Committee members to sell to their constituents. Under those circumstances, instead of altering downwards millions of prices throughout the economy, it might be easier to alter the price of one exchange rate. This is well grounded in economic theory. It is essential to retain exchange rate flexibility so as to ride out certain sorts of economic shock rather than put the strain on downward wage flexibility, which may or may not exist and which could result in high unemployment. All the price stability in the world--even zero inflation--does not reduce the necessity for that necessary exchange rate flexibility.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Will my right hon. Friend comment on the fact that the shock may not necessarily apply to an economy that is enjoying price stability. It would be possible conceptually for this country to have all these arrangements in place, and an enviable level of price stability, but if something went wrong in one of the Asian tigers which the Chancellor of the Exchequer was telling us until recently we should emulate, it would inevitably affect the exchange rate between the United Kingdom and other countries, and might drive up our exchange rate in a way that would inevitably create further difficulties internally.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> My hon. Friend makes a good point. It is true that the problems experienced by countries in the Pacific rim are being at least partly alleviated by exchange rate flexibility and depreciation of their currencies. Without that mechanism, they would be in very serious trouble.
<P>
What startled us was what I can only describe as the sheer ignorance of Labour Members about the need--
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> Will the right hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> It was the hon. Gentleman's intervention on this point that illustrated my argument. I do no want to give him another opportunity--
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> That is why--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The right hon. Gentleman is not giving way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> If I did, we could be here all morning and afternoon on what perhaps is becoming too much of a general economic debate.
<P>
We shall press the amendment to a vote. Other amendments were tabled in the spirit and intention of probing amendments; they were not wrecking measures. I hope that the Paymaster General accepts that. The debate has been useful in that respect. We shall press in due course the issue encapsulated in amendment No. 13.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I shall respond briefly to the Paymaster General's remarks against our amendment. I was worried about his use of the word ``pragmatic'' on account of the Government wishing to change the inflation target at frequent intervals. If the Government really want to depoliticise monetary policy, they should take a principled approach rather than a pragmatic one. If they limited themselves to setting the inflation target once during a Parliament, it would be seen by the markets as a principled approach.

<P>
Members of the Committee will understand that the amendment is a purely technical change. The clause requires the Treasury to give notice to the Bank and to specify price stability and the Government's economic policy. That will ensure that the Monetary Policy Committee is clear about objectives.
<P>
The first notice, as Committee members will recall, was contained in the Chancellor's letter of 12th June, in which he established inflation targets and the openness of the system. The amendment ensures that notices given by the Treasury are laid before the House as Act papers, rather than being deposited as unofficial documents in the Library. It ensures that notices are formally drawn to the House's attention. I am sure that the amendment will commend itself to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The amendment is acceptable, indeed welcome, to Conservative Members. It would make it slightly easier for us to debate the matter in the House. We give notice that we may wish to debate it however often it occurs.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 23, in page 5, line 27, after `Exchequer', insert `after open competition'.
<P>
We now turn from the clauses that will enact the Monetary Policy Committee to those that deal with the details of its composition, its rules of operation and the other provisions set out in this and later clauses and in schedule 3. The amendment would require what might be termed the four independent members of the Monetary Policy Committee to be appointed after open competition. It thus invites the Chancellor to ensure that the best possible people are chosen on their merits for the job.
<P>
I have no objections to the existing members of the Monetary Policy Committee or to how they have conducted affairs. They must decide matters according to the principles that the Government have set. For reasons that were outlined on Second Reading and elsewhere by hon. Members, including by Labour Back Benchers who are not members of the Committee, the Opposition are not surprised that reservations have been expressed that the Members of the Monetary Policy Committee behave like bankers, act like bankers and have kept interest rates rather higher than is strictly necessary for the overall conduct of the economy. I shall not rehearse those arguments again.
<P>
This, and later amendments, would provide an alternative approach to securing our objective--and I hope that of Labour Members--of providing the Monetary Policy Committee with a genuine degree of independence. The committee may have operational independence and the Chancellor may wish to distance himself from its activities on the ground that it is operationally independent. However, the Chancellor may rig the rules through his definitions of price stability or economic policy or may rig the membership of the committee. If he does, the committee will not provide the Government's monetary policy with the credibility that it requires. In any case, such actions would be discourteous to the House and would damage the Government.
<P>
If the Government are to set up a committee, it is important that it is reputable, freestanding and operates fearlessly. The difficulty will arise when, as so often happens, and which is why I produced a rather arcane case in the debate on the previous clause, the Government want to deal with a hard case in one way, and the European Community or the demands of the exchange rate want them to do something else. The Government would not be able to meet all their objectives and might be tempted to try to nobble the Committee or soften its conclusions because they found them unpalatable. When discussing the question of European monetary union, the late Nick Ridley once said that he did not want, three months before a British general election, to be faced with a central banker and to have to say, ``Who do you think you are, Herr Pohl?'' I have deleted the expletive. That is a slight problem.
<P>
The purpose of this clutch of amendments is to get the Government to tell us how they see the membership of the Committee and the various other devices that might be adopted to ensure that it operates in an open and transparent manner, which will, on occasion, inevitably mean upsetting Ministers and not doing what they would wish. The amendment relates to an open competition for the appointment of what I described, somewhat limply, as independent members.
<P>
It is fair to rehearse here the constitution of the Monetary Policy Committee, which the Government have set out in the Bill. It should consist of the Governor and deputy Governors, making three. Two members are appointed by the Governor after consultation with the Chancellor. Those two members and their duties are set out rather more clearly in clause 13(3). One has the executive responsibility within the Bank for monetary policy analysis; the other has responsibility for monetary policy operations. Within what might be termed the home team we have a total of five. Then there are to be four outside, or independent members appointed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.
<P>
I said that the Opposition do not complain about the choice, though there will be ways of looking at this. We have tabled amendments about whether prospective members of the MPC should come before the Treasury Committee. The suggestion in this amendment is that there should be an open competition. That at least would ensure that, if the rules and conduct of the competition were transparent and open, the persons chosen would be the most suitable people for the job. They would not be chosen because they happen to be Labour party supporters--perish the thought--or even Conservative party supporters. We are not seeking some kind of political balance here. They should not necessarily be residents of the United Kingdom or citizens of it. Indeed, there is one distinguished member of the MPC who is not. They should be the best people for the job.
<P>
I am sure that it would be possible, although I do not have a template for it at the moment, for the Government to draw up a job specification, to seek applications and to enable people to refer themselves or others, or to suggest names. They would all be considered on one basic set of criteria, and the best people would be chosen. It is not quite clear to me, even from the efforts that have been made by the Economic Secretary, that the Chancellor has completely specified the nature of the selection process for the initial members of that committee. There will inevitably be casual vacancies as people move on or retire.
<P>
It would be for the public good, as with so many other appointments in these post-Nolan days, if it was seen that the best people were chosen and that there were proper procedures for doing that. It would get away from any suggestion of cronyism, which I am sure the Paymaster General would not wish to be accused of, and it would enable people at large to see that the strongest possible team had been taken on to carry out a particularly demanding job.
<P>
Inevitably, even if those four openly selected members were completely independent--they might, who knows, include people whose views were Keynesian, or soft on inflation; but presumably they would have to rely on their economic criteria--they would still potentially be outvotable by the five home team members of the Bank: its Governor, deputy Governors and two appointed members. I do not think that there is any suggestion of the Bank losing control of the entire process, but we want openness and transparency and we want the best people to be chosen. The amendment is moved with good will, in an attempt to achieve that--and to secure the Minister's explanation of how it is to be done.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson:</B> I compliment the hon. Member for Daventry on the manner and tone in which he moved a serious amendment. We need some time to consider it, but I was reassured that he found it possible to welcome the appointments that have already been made. I think that those appointed are a distinguished group of people.
<P>
I am not altogether so happy with the idea of a home team and an away team. I think that we should drop that idea if we can. If I wanted to respond unhelpfully I could mention that the two deputy Governors are appointed only after consultation with the Chancellor. The very fact that the four members are engaged full time shows the degree to which they should be regarded as an integrated team. They are based in the Bank working with others on a full-time basis. The fact that the appointments are full time is an aspect of the difference that we have tried to make with respect to the Bank's professionalism and competence in carrying out the supremely important job of managing monetary policy.
<P>
If the hon. Member for Daventry will not press the amendment to a vote we will consider what he has said. I cannot give a commitment on the matter; I want to give it some thought. Similar considerations will, I think, arise in relation to the confirmatory procedures and rights, or otherwise, of Select Committees. We do not want to consider the matter in isolation--and in any case I do not want to anticipate debate on amendments that we shall shortly be debating. If we were to take action on just one set of appointments--with regard to the role of Select Committees or the amendment--we should unnecessarily anticipate the outcome of the general review on how appointments are made, in the context of the procedures and criteria set out by Lord Nolan.
<P>
Given that we agree to consider the amendment in the light of the application of Nolan, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not press to a vote.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am grateful to the Paymaster General, who has a seductive and pleasing manner.
<P>
Only for the purpose of illustration did I suggest a home team and an away team--though the Paymaster General must allow me a slight niggling doubt, in the context of other things that have been said, as to whether the Chancellor at any time may choose to take an interest in the matter and suddenly decide to place someone more congenial to him on the committee. That is, as the Paymaster General will be aware, a familiar problem in the Supreme Court justices system in America. However, we are considering our own concerns.
<P>
I am not absolutely clear, from the Paymaster General's remarks about the post-Nolan discussion, about the time frame in which the matter that I have raised is to be considered. I have a feeling that we are not likely to hear about it before Report, so we would not necessarily be in a position to have the amendment incorporated in the Bill. However, he has spoken with some good will and I should be disposed not to press the amendment, but perhaps to return to it at a later stage. We shall reflect on the Paymaster General's assurances and hope that they will bear fruit in due course. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. The next steps in the consultation process on quangos--I hope we are not dealing with a quango here--will be the White Paper on better government, due early in the new year. We cannot promise anything before Report, but the proposal will be considered in that context.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<B>Dr. Vincent Cable </B>(Twickenham): I beg to move amendment No. 18, in page 5, line 27, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(2A) No member of the Committee may vote on any decision of the Committee until after his appointment has been ratified by the Treasury Select Committee of the House of Commons.'<P>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take amendment No. 24, in page 5, line 27, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(2A) The appointment of all the members of the Committee shall be subject to confirmation by the Treasury Select Committee of the House of Commons.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Dr. Cable:</B> The amendment was tabled in the same spirit as the previous one. We are considering different options to achieve greater openness and transparency. There are three reasons why the Government should take the amendment seriously. First, it would strengthen the accountability of the newly independent central Bank. There is a myth, advanced by its critics, that having an independent Bank of England reduces democratic accountability, but because of the way in which the Government have designed the measure that danger is not real. As we discussed under clause 12, the fact that the Government are setting the Bank's policy objectives and Ministers are ultimately responsible to Parliament for the targets that they set means that a basic accountability is built into the structure. If independent members of the Monetary Policy Committee were grilled or vetted--whatever is the appropriate word--by the Treasury Committee it would build in an additional element of democratic accountability which would strengthen the institution's credibility in the eyes of the public, the financial markets and the House. That democratic accountability argument is important.
<P>
The second reason for the amendment concerns the credibility of the members themselves. It is clear that the Chancellor takes the appointments process seriously, as the present batch of appointments are people of high quality, and we want to institutionalise that process. If the candidates are subject to careful scrutiny and cross-questioning, the House can be fully satisfied that they are competent. Some people who are put forward may not be fully competent and critical scrutiny by the Select Committee will be one way to indentify such people and thus enhance the credibility of those who are appointed. That is the third reason for the amendment: it would benefit the individuals appointed. It would strengthen their legitimacy if they were called to public account and cross-questioned critically, especially if they survived the experience with flying colours, as I am sure that the present batch would.
<P>
There was a good example in the present rung of appointments, when the process we propose might have been useful. One of the appointees, to whom the hon. Gentleman referred, was subject a few weeks ago to a vicious and scurrilous personal attack in a newspaper, fed by a dissident Labour Member who did not agree with the principle of an independent central bank. Had the appointee been cross-questioned in a proper and dignified way by the Treasury Committee and answered members' questions on the record, the air would have been cleared. But she was subject to an attack and could not answer back. If there is no proper democratic accountability that kind of snide process will take place. A Treasury Committee with enhanced status would strengthen the legitimacy of the individuals as well as that of the institution. For those three reasons, I strongly commend the amendment to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I have tabled a similar amendment to that moved by the hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable), although mine follows more closely that recommended by the Treasury Committee. I stress the hon. Gentleman's point about the integrity and independence of members of the Monetary Policy Committee. That must not only be a fact, but be seen to be a fact. I have no quarrel with the calibre of the people in the present court or on the Monetary Policy Committee, but the rationale for moving those decisions to the Bank is to gain extra credibility in the struggle against inflation. Therefore, perception is very important. It would be enhanced by stressing idependence from the Government. It is not just that it should be nominated or proposed by the legislature or any body outside the Government, but that it should be subject to additional scrutiny.
<P>
I do not want to intrude into the love-in between my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry and the Paymaster General over the previous amendment. I was most impressed by this cross-party activity and do not want to spoil it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am quite sure that my right hon. Friend is not seeking to make trouble. Having been rebuffed by the Paymaster General on other occasions, it was pleasant to hear his more conciliatory tone when he responded to my amendment. It left me momentarily fazed and quite astonished.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> Every Committee needs its soft man and its hard man. It falls to me on this occasion to be slightly harder in approach and to propose an additional safeguard. We are impressed at least by the intention to open up the appointments to competition.
<P>
I want to pursue some of the suggestions advanced by the Treasury Committee, which is chaired by a Labour Member. It was definite about the need for confirmatory hearings and, in the absence of legislation, it intends to hold something rather similar on its own account.
<P>
I must introduce a jarring note here. In recent weeks, we have witnessed the possibility--I put it no higher than that--of the Government being leant on by the rich and powerful. I am thinking of the episode of the breach of promise made over tobacco sponsorship as a result of special pleading from large donors to the Labour party. That has put at least a question mark over the Government's independence from outside pressure.
<P>
It is therefore possible that future appointees to the Monetary Policy Committee could be tarnished by the suspicion that they have done favours for, or contributed funds to, the Labour party. That suggests a less than unblemished attitude towards appointments. We have recently heard that the &#163;1 million will be replaced by a man who clearly pays his workers in Planet Hollywood restaurants much less than any conceivable minimum wage. We shall need to watch carefully to ensure that he is not granted an exemption from a minimum wage in return for his &#163;1 million. That shows how important it is to ensure that appointments to the Bank are free of suspicion.
<P>
Virtually all Monetary Policy Committee members will be direct Government appointments. The Governor and the deputy Governors will not be direct appointments--they are Crown appointments--but they are recommended by the Prime Minister. Two other members will be appointed by the Governor himself, but he has to consult the Chancellor, so that amounts to a veto. The other four members are appointed directly--with no constraint at all--by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.
<P>
I contrast that approach with what obtains elsewhere. The Federal Reserve in the United States is a genuine independent bank. It might be thought that the executive would like to keep more control over those appointments, given that once members are appointed they do not work to any remit from the president or the executive. In fact, that is not the case. The important decisions on interest rates and a number of other monetary policy matters are taken by the federal open market committee, on which seven members of the Federal Reserve board sit. They are nominated by the president subject to the advice and consent of the Senate. There are five other members of that important committee, drawn from the regional presidents, who are elected by the shareholders of the regional Federal Reserve banks. That is entirely separate from anything proposed by the American Government or, indeed, the Senate, so there is a high degree of independence in the manner of appointment.
<P>
Much the same is true of Germany. It is a federal state and members of the committees that set interest rates are drawn from the presidents of the Land banks. We cannot replicate that system here, as we do not have a federal constitution. However, it shows that, given their very great independence when they are appointed, the federal Government in Germany are nevertheless quite content not to have this handle on even the initial appointment. When and if we move to a European central bank in Frankfurt, it will be the most independent central bank in the world. It will be immune from any outside influence. That would be forbidden by treaty law. It would not be accountable to any institution, democratic or otherwise. The problem in those circumstances--who appoints the sole, national representative to the governing council--is probably slightly irrelevant.
<P>
I contrast those examples, real and proposed, with the proposal in the Bill. This is very tight control by the Government and, even more than that, by one man--the Chancellor of the Exchequer--and Chancellors are not seen to be particularly independent. Credibility and perceived independence are important.
<P>
We wish, therefore, to adopt the recommendation of the all-party Select Committee: that members proposed or nominated by the Government should be subject to ratification by the Treasury Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson:</B> We may be able to finish the debate before we break. As I said earlier, this is not something that we can decide on our own. It is for the House, not the Government, to decide. As the right hon. Member for Wells just said, the Treasury Committee has made it clear that it will have interviews with individual members after their appointment.
<P>
If the right hon. Gentleman pushes the amendment to the vote we shall resist, because it is a matter for the whole House to consider in relation to the other Select Committees. We are not in a position to embark on a precedent-setting route. However, the right hon. Gentleman has done well to air the issue and we are reassured meanwhile on these matters by the quality of the appointments that have already been made and by the fact that the Select Committee is also taking its responsibilities very seriously.
<P>
I hope that the Committee will see no need to push the matter to a vote. It would be an inappropriate vote, as it is a matter for the whole House, and in the event, we would resist it.

<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I am aware that we are running short of time. Having appointees to the Monetary Policy Committee nominated by the Chancellor and then reviewed by the Treasury Committee is a key issue. The personalities involved with the Monetary Policy Committee will be crucial in determining the tenor of monetary policy. If we accept that translating an inflation target into monetary policy is not just a technical issue, the people on the committee will be absolutely critical not just to monetary policy but to the whole tenor of economic policy, which is a vast proportion--
<P>
