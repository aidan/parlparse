<P>
Government new schedule 1--"Stamp Duty and stamp duty reserve tax: unit trusts
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Part I
<P>
Abolition of stamp duty on transfers etc. of units in unit trusts
<P>
1.--(1) No stamp duty is chargeable on a transfer or other instrument relating to a unit under a unit trust scheme.
<P>
(2) Sub-paragraph (1) does not affect any charge to stamp duty--
<P>
(a) on a conveyance or transfer on sale of property other than units under a unit trust scheme in relation to which such units form the whole or part of the consideration, or
<P>
(b) under Schedule 15 to this Act (bearer instruments).
<P>
(3) This paragraph has effect in relation to instruments executed on or after 6th February 2000.
<P>
Part II
<P>
Stamp duty reserve tax on dealings with units in unit trusts
<P>
Charge to tax
<P>
2.--(1) There is a charge to stamp duty reserve tax where--
<P>
(a) person authorises or requires the trustees or managers under a unit trust scheme to treat him as no longer interested in a unit under the scheme, or
<P>
(b) a unit under a unit trust scheme is transferred to the managers of the scheme,
<P>
and the unit is a chargeable security.
<P>
 Those events are referred to in this Part of this Schedule as a 'surrender' of the unit to the managers.
<P>
(2) The tax is chargeable--
<P>
(a) whether the surrender is made or effected in the United Kingdom or elsewhere, and
<P>
(b) whether or not any party is resident or situate in any part of the United Kingdom.
<P>
(3) The persons liable for the tax are the trustees of the unit trust.
<P>
(4) This paragraph is subject to the exclusions provided for in paragraphs 6 and 7.
<P>
Rate of tax
<P>
3.--(1) Tax under this Part of this Schedule is chargeable at the rate of 0.5% of the market value of the unit.
<P>
This is subject to any reduction under paragraph 4 or 5.
<P>
(2) The market value of a unit means whichever is higher of--
<P>
(a) the price the unit might reasonably be expected to fetch on a sale in the open market at the time of surrender, and
<P>
(b) its cancellation price, or if it is redeemed its redemption price, at that time, calculated in accordance with the trust instrument.
<P>
Proportionate reduction of tax by reference to units issued
<P>
4.--(1) The amount of tax chargeable shall be proportionately reduced if the number of units of the same class as the unit in question that are surrendered to the managers in the relevant two-week period exceeds the number or units of that class issued by the managers in that period.
<P>
(2) The 'relevant two-week period' in relation to a surrender is the period from the beginning of the week in which the surrender occurs to the end of the following week.
<P>
For this purpose a week means a period of seven days beginning with a Sunday.
<P>
(3) The reduction is made by applying the following fraction to the amount otherwise chargeable--
<P>
I
<P>
S
<P>
Where:
<P>
I is the number of units of the class issued by the managers in the relevant two-week period, and
<P>
S is the number or units of the class surrendered to the managers in that period.
<P>
(4) If a consolidation or sub-division of units affects the comparison of the number of units surrendered and the number of units issued, the numbers shall be determined as if the consolidation or subdivision had not taken place.
<P>
'Consolidation or sub-division' includes any alteration of the number of units of the class in question otherwise than in consequence of an increase or reduction in the trust property.
<P>
(5) This paragraph does not apply if on the surrender of the unit the unit holder receives anything other than money, and for the purposes of this paragraph no account shall be taken of a surrender or issue that is not entirely for money.
<P>
Proportionate reduction of tax by reference to assets held
<P>
5.--(1) The amount of tax chargeable after any reduction under paragraph 4 shall be further reduced if in the relevant two-week period the trust property is invested in both exempt and non-exempt investments.
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(2) The reduction is made by applying the following fraction to that amount--
<P>
N
<P>
N + E
<P>
Where:
<P>
N is the average market value of the non-exempt investments over the relevant two-week period, and
<P>
E is the average market value of the exempt investments over that period.
<P>
(3) In this paragraph 'exempt investment' has the same meaning as in section 99(5A)(b) of the Finance Act 1986; and 'non-exempt investment' means any investment that is not an exempt investment.
<P>
Exclusion of charge in certain cases of change of ownership
<P>
6.--(1) This paragraph applies where in pursuance of arrangements between the person entitled to a unit and another person ('the new owner')--
<P>
(a) the unit is surrendered to the managers, and
<P>
(b) the person surrendering the unit authorises or requires the managers or trustees to treat the new owner as entitled to it.
<P>
(2) There is no charge to tax under this Part of this Schedule if no consideration in money or money's worth is given in connection with the surrender of the unit or the new owner's becoming entitled to it.
<P>
(3) There is no charge to tax under this Part of this Schedule if the new owner is--
<P>
(a) a body of persons established for charitable purposes only, or
<P>
(b) the trustees of a trust established for those purposes only, or
<P>
(c) the Trustees of the National Heritage Memorial Fund, or
<P>
(d) the Historic Buildings and Monuments Commission for England.
<P>
(4) There is no charge to tax under this Part of this Schedule if an instrument executed at the time of the surrender--
<P>
(a) in pursuance of arrangements between the person entitled to the unit and the new owner, and
<P>
(b) transferring the unit from the one to the other,
<P>
 would be exempt from stamp duty (if stamp duty were otherwise chargeable) by virtue of any of the provisions mentioned in sub-paragraph (5).
<P>
(5) The provisions referred to in sub-paragraph (4) are--
<P>
(a) section 42 of the Finance Act 1930 or section 11 of the Finance Act (Northern Ireland) 1954 (transfers between associated companies); and
<P>
(b) regulations under section 87(2) of the Finance Act 1985 (power to exempt instruments from stamp duty of fixed amount).
<P>
(6) Whereby virtue of sub-paragraph (2), (3) or (4) there is no charge to tax, both the surrender and the related issue shall be left out of account for the purposes of paragraph 4.
<P>
Exclusion of charge in case of in specie redemption
<P>
7. There is no charge to tax under this Part of this Schedule if on the surrender of the unit the unit holder receives only such part of each description of asset in the trust property as is proportionate to, or as nearly as practicable proportionate to, the unit holder's share.
<P>
Interpretation
<P>

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Nick Gibb </B>(Bognor Regis and Littlehampton): As I was saying this morning, the mood in the industry is hostile to this huge group of amendments. The timing of them, particularly the implementation date, is causing enormous distress. The Association of Unit Trusts and Investment Funds stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Given that we have had one day in which to consider the proposals, and the industry in general has not seen them all, we cannot be certain that all the defects have been identified."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is the industry's view of the amendments, new clauses and new schedule and the Economic Secretary to the Treasury failed to respond to some key points on investor protection. She said that the tax regulations would be made in good time, but that she had no control over the Financial Services Authority process. The FSA, unlike the Government, has a duty to control the industry, and the Economic Secretary has no control over that. Any commitment that cannot be delivered will undermine investor protection. It will be interesting to hear from the Economic Secretary how she intends to ensure that the FSA complies with her commitment given to the Committee that there would be plenty of time for the industry to prepare its systems by 6 February.
<P>
The Economic Secretary also failed to respond to my point about new subsection (5B)(a)(i) of section 99 of the Finance Act 1986, which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"it is not an investment on the transfer of which ad valorem stamp duty would be chargeable".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It would be helpful if the Economic Secretary could state specifically why that condition applies. Foreign securities would technically fall within the system, because ad valorem stamp duty can apply when there is a transfer of foreign securities between two parties.
<P>
The Economic Secretary, apart from blaming the previous Government, blamed the industry for which she is trying to legislate. She seems to be hostile to the financial services industry. That is unhelpful, because it is a key creator of wealth in this country and we should be praising it, not attacking it. During the adjournment following our sitting this morning I asked the Association of Unit Trusts and Investment Funds whether the Government's accusations were correct. I was told that they were not.
<P>
The associations's files show that it wrote to the Stamp Office requesting discussions as far back as 24 June 1998, pending the outcome of the M and G and Schroders case, which was expected to resolve the uncertainty surrounding the legislation. In that letter it stated, contrary to what the Economic Secretary said, that it would like a meeting when that case had been resolved, and suggested:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Perhaps, therefore, when you have had time to consider this letter we could establish the best way of doing this."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There has been no response from the Stamp Office to that invitation.
<P>
The association also wrote to the Economic Secretary on 29 January 1999, following the judgment in the M and G case, noting the likelihood of the debate being revived and offering to discuss the issues with her or her officials. Again, that letter was not answered, and none of the proposals in the Finance Bill was discussed with the association before Budget day. It is unfair to blame the industry for not producing proposals, when it proposed a method of dealing with the uncertainty in the law, by suggesting a meeting when the case involving M and G and Schroders had been decided.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will put the record straight, and not try to blame others for the Government's mishandling of the issue. When she explained that the issue dated back to long before this year's Budget statement, I was astonished that the original proposals in the Finance Bill could have been so hopelessly wrong, and have required 33 amendments and 10 pages of provisions to be put to the Committee today, with only three days' notice. Given the length of time that the Government have had, it is outrageous that the Bill was wrong and we have had to debate all these amendments today. On that point, I shall wait to hear the Minister's response.
<P>
<B>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury </B>(Ms Patricia Hewitt): The hon. Gentleman made various references to the timing of the introduction of the amendments and of the new clause. May I draw your attention, Mr. Butterfill, to the fact that the hon. Gentleman has an appointment, the timing of which is also highly significant? I understand that at some point later this evening, we may risk losing him from the Committee. Despite the sometimes acerbic nature of the debate on the clause, the amendments, the new clause and the new schedule, I wish the hon. Gentleman, on behalf of the Committee, the best of luck with his interview and his subsequent career.
<P>
With regard to the issue of investor protection, and the specific question of the Financial Services Authority regulations, FSA officials have been involved in the discussions that led to the amendments. It is absurd to assume, as the hon. Gentleman is in danger of doing, that the FSA cannot consult in good time and issue the necessary guidance and regulations. The authority is clear that it can do so, and I am confident that that is the case. There have been extensive discussions with the industry, and unit trust managers will already have the information that they need to comply with the provisions.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman also referred to letters dating back a year or so from the Association of Unit Trusts and Investment Funds, following the original commitment that it made in January 1997, in return for which the then Economic Secretary withdrew the previous Government's proposals to simplify and modernise the stamp duty reserve tax regime as it affected unit trusts. I am advised that officials have been in almost continuous consultation with the association, and that a meeting was held between the Inland Revenue and AUTIF within a week of the Budget. However, it is regrettable that AUTIF has continued to request further delays in the implementation of the new regime, in contrast with other parts of the industry, whose constructive contribution I made a point of praising this morning.
<P>
There has already been a marked reduction in the revenue from stamp duty reserve tax charged on unit trust transactions, from some £30 million in the first half of the last financial year, to £7 million in the second half.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick St. Aubyn </B>(Guildford): Will the Minister confirm that in each of the previous years for which she provided figures this morning, there was no variation in the amount of revenue collected in each half of the year?
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman referring to earlier years?
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> The level of income over the earlier years was similar to that of last year. The Minister implied that there had been a sudden fall-off in the second half of last year. We did not hear whether there had been a similar seasonal pattern to the revenue collection in the previous year, which might help to explain this matter, and which would suggest that the Government are panicking unnecessarily about  potential loss of income.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> That is an interesting question. I do not have those figures to hand, but I shall check them and come back to the hon. Gentleman. However, officials have advised me that the fall-off in revenue in the second half of last year is a departure. As I said this morning, following the uncertainty arising from the Member and Gentleman case judgment, we need to prevent stamp duty reserve tax on unit trust transfers from becoming an optional tax. In the light of the further delay proposed by AUTIF and the official Opposition, pressure could build for an optional tax to become an ex-tax. We are not prepared to risk the revenue base in that way.
<P>
As I said, the original proposals were perfectly workable and simplified the old system. After consulting the industry we have improved them, and the Committee need do nothing other than vote against the clause as it stands, so that the new and improved provisions can duly be put in place.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Burnett </B>(Torridge and West Devon): We welcome the closing of loopholes, including loopholes in stamp duty reserve tax, provided that the steps taken are fair and effective.
<P>
You will doubtless correct me if I am wrong, Mr. Butterfill, but a short trip down memory lane to last year's Finance Bill, which contained anti-avoidance provisions in respect of stamp duty reserve tax, is relevant to the question of effectiveness. I exhort the Economic Secretary to provide effective anti-avoidance legislation; I also ask her to say how much revenue was lost as a result of last year's anti-avoidance legislation, which was patently ineffective and was subsequently amended. Because of those provisions' ineffectiveness, in three major transactions--Vodafone, BP Amoco and one other--at least £l billion of public revenue was lost to the Exchequer.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman is straying rather wide of the clause. I have been tolerant, because I thought that he was making a general point about anti-avoidance that was of relevance to the clause. However, I can no longer accept his making specific points about different provisions in last year's Finance Bill. Will he now return the clause?
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I shall, Mr. Butterfill. I prefaced my remarks with a short caveat, and I shall go no further. However, I hope that the Economic Secretary will confirm that the present legislation will be effective, and tell us how much public revenue was lost as a result of the ineffectiveness of the anti-avoidance provisions in last year's Finance Bill.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am afraid that 1 would have to call the Economic Secretary to order if she attempted to answer that question, which is not relevant to clause 100. There are other ways in which the hon. Gentleman can ask that question, and I am sure that he is sufficiently experienced to avail himself of them.

<P>

<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I shall not labour the point any further. However, I should emphasise that, to carry public opinion, taxation matters such as anti-avoidance provisions must be seen to be fair and effective. I hope that the Economic Secretary can assure the Committee that the provisions in the clause are both fair and effective.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> When giving that assurance, will the Economic Secretary deal with third-party transfers, which were raised this afternoon? Under the proposals, transfers to or from managers are exempt from the duty. What will happen when a transfer is made from one custodian to another? Will the Economic Secretary confirm that no inadvertent double taxation will take effect when securities are transferred in that way? Section 87 of the Finance Act 1986--the main piece of reserve tax legislation--states that SDRT is payable on all transfers of chargeable securities, and section 99(3) includes units under a unit trust scheme. Although transfers to or from managers are exempted by section 91, as amended by the Bill, concern exists that transfers from one custodian to another may inadvertently be caught by the proposed legislation.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> As I explained at some length this morning, the intention behind the original provision and the improved version is to avoid double taxation in a range of situations involving transfers of units, and to avoid situations where no taxation arises where it should arise. The provisions that we are debating put that principle into practice effectively and fairly.
<P>
On third-party transfers, as I said this morning, there is no charge to stamp duty reserve tax if there is no change of underlying ownership. That avoids double taxation, but also ensures that taxation arises properly where it should.
<P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Amendment No. 250 is a probing amendment, which would reverse Government's increase in fixed duty from 50p to £5. That is another of the Government's infamous stealth taxes; indeed, it is a tenfold increase in the tax rate. It will limit people's scope to change fund managers. Whereas the stamp duty used to be 50p per different stock of shares transferred to a new fund manager, that charge will now be £5. The charge for a portfolio of 20 shares will therefore be £100, instead of £10. That will inevitably lead to a stifling of competition among equity individual savings account providers. It is yet another attack on savings by the Government.
<P>
One large stockbroker used to pay £180,000 a year in fixed stamp duty charges on transfers between nominee accounts. As that was a relatively small amount for that company, it bore the cost itself. As a result of the clause, that annual charge will increase to £1.8 million, which is too large to absorb and will be passed on to investors. There is already talk in the financial press about the disaster presented by ISAs, and the Government will have to introduce changes to make them more popular. The Finance Bill will make equity ISAs less palatable to the public.
<P>
I look forward to hearing the Economic Secretary's reasons for insisting on increasing the fixed duty by a factor of 10.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I have tabled a series of probing amendments because of the concern expressed in the City of London and by the Confederation of British Industry in its briefing on the Bill. The concern is that the level of stamp duty on securities is far too high for the modern age, and that it will drive business away from London.
<P>
In particular, it may be seen how international companies, considering where to list their securities in Europe, will compare our level of stamp duty at 0.5 per cent. with the levels of 0.15 per cent. to 0.3 per cent. in Paris, where there is a limit on deals in excess of £27,000, 0.14 per cent. in Milan and no duty at all on share sales in Frankfurt, Amsterdam and Madrid. In those circumstances, what forward projection do the Government have of the stamp duty on securities, if the duty is maintained at the current level? What would be the cost of amendment No. 203, which would put the high limit of £1,000 on stamp duty in any one transfer? What would be the cost in the short term of halving the level of stamp duty to 0.25 per cent., given that in the long term, it might preserve some revenue where otherwise there may be very little?
<P>
<B>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury </B>(Mrs. Barbara Roche): What the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb) did not say is that the cost of amendment No. 250 would be about £10 million. I know that my hon. Friend the Member for Shipley (Mr. Leslie), who takes a keen interest in such matters, will be interested to know that.
<P>
The amendment would undermine the streamlining of stamping ad valorem duties in multiples of £5. The hon. Gentleman asked about the position with regard to share transactions, but as the Committee will know, most share transactions are now settled electronically and are subject to SDRT that is not rounded. So quite apart from its cost, the amendment makes no sense. Stamp duty has already been mentioned in the debate. If we brought the 50p duty rate into line with the retail prices index since 1891, it would have been increased to £32, so £5 is not unreasonable.
<P>
Amendment No. 203 would reduce the stamp duty payable on all purchases of shares in excess of £200,000, because at that level, stamp duty at 0.5 per cent. comes to £l,000. I would say to the hon. Member for Guildford (Mr. St. Aubyn) that such a change would be substantial and the loss of tax yield would be very large. I do not know what "very large" means to the hon. Gentleman, but I mean in excess of £1.5 billion at current levels.
 
<P>
This is another good example of how the hon. Member for Guildford tables amendments, which he calls probing amendments, without any consideration of what the cost would be to the public purse. There have been many examples of that, both from the hon. Gentleman and from the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton. I notice that when the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton tabled his amendments, he did not comment on his hon. Friend's amendments, so he is obviously relaxed about any possible loss to the Exchequer.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> It is evident that the cost of my amendments should not be added up cumulatively. They are clearly probing amendments. What does the Financial Secretary make of my point about tax harmonisation? As I said, other European capitals have much lower levels of tax. Is the Financial Secretary not concerned that our revenue will disappear anyway, in the long run?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> It does not surprise me that the hon. Gentleman seeks to change the subject to hide his embarrassment, but I have not yet finished with the hon. Gentleman. He cannot escape lightly, because the amendment would have a staggering distributional effect. There would be a tax break for those who trade very large blocks of shares, so the ordinary small shareholders whom the Opposition claim to support would not do well; they would not benefit at all. The amendment would also have bizarre technical results. It is an ill conceived and expensive amendment, and I urge my right hon. and hon. Friends to reject it.
<P>
Amendment No. 251 would return fixed duties to their 1891 levels. I know that rather than looking forward, the Conservative party prefers to look backwards, but even I must say that looking as far back as 1891 is a little retrospective.
<P>
The scale of stamp duty rates on transfers of land and buildings ranging from 1 per cent. to 3.5 per cent. applies to transactions of certain other assets, including property. Amendment No. 205, tabled by the hon. Member for Guildford, would restrict the rate of duty on intellectual property transactions to 0.5 per cent.
<P>
We are alive to the importance of stimulating high levels of research and development innovation and to the case for reforming intellectual property taxation. The hon. Gentleman looks a little quizzical, but clearly it has escaped his notice, or has not formed part of his reading matter, that last March the Inland Revenue issued a technical note on options for simplifying that. When reviewing the responses to the note, we shall also consider the stamp duty aspect. I understand why the hon. Gentleman tabled the amendment, but it is right to consider that aspect of the tax rules for intellectual property as part of a general review. I therefore ask him not to press his amendment.
<P>
Amendment No. 204 would halve the 0.5 per cent. rate of stamp duty on shares, but would leave the equivalent rate of stamp duty reserve tax unchanged. Presumably, its intention is for the threshold and rate of stamp duty to be halved, too. It would be a little less expensive than the first proposal, and would reduce the revenue yield of £3.1 billion by £1.4
 billion to £l.7 billion, which means that the losses are going down a trifle.
<P>
The hon. Member for Guildford also tabled amendment No. 206, which would take commercial property transfers worth more than £500,000 outside the scope of the 3.5 per cent. rate of stamp duty. We debated that when we discussed stamp duty on commercial property on the Floor of the House. The amendment is a somewhat cheaper proposal than that--a real snip, at a cost of, only £320 million to the public purse. Clearly, the hon. Gentleman believes that the commercial property market is not robust enough to absorb stamp duty that changes at the top rate. I do not accept that, and there is evidence to support that view. I urge him to withdraw the amendment. If he does not, I shall ask my right hon. and hon. Friends to vote against it.

<P>

<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> It will not have escaped the Committee's notice that Conservative Members have a tax-cutting agenda. We believe in low taxes. It would be helpful to us to have the figures from the Financial Secretary. I did not formally move my amendments, but I am grateful for the opportunity to highlight such issues. I am just sorry that the hon. Lady has not dealt with the fundamental strategic problem of imposing such high taxes on share transactions in our financial centre that we are driving business away. The hon. Lady is obviously unaware that that may have a hidden cost.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I am grateful for the information that the Financial Secretary gave. I referred to the tax increase as being one of the Government's stealth taxes, but to save the hon. Lady's blushes I did not reveal how much the Government were levying. She told the Committee that it is £10 million. The hon. Member for Shipley has made a running total of the stealth taxes raised by the Government, which the Opposition are committed to opposing.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I know that the hon. Gentleman has an important appointment coming later, but he is slipping; the £10 million is the cost of his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I am aware of that, but I sought to reverse the tax increases that the hon. Lady is imposing on the country.
<P>
We have had a full debate. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown </B>(Cotswold): Will the Financial Secretary clarify what she said about the increase in stamp duty affecting the commercial property market? She will be aware that that market has been fairly stagnant for the past year, and that an increase in stamp duty will be imposed on a market that is becoming increasingly international. I hope that the view will not prevail in future Budgets that the increase in stamp duty should be commensurate with the increase in this year's Budget, which will undoubtedly affect the commercial property market.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> In the May monthly index, the Richard Ellis research consultancy reported that, although capital growth for all property was stable during that month, the short-term indicator rose to 4.46 per cent. from 2.9 per cent. in April. Over the past three years, total returns from property have been considerably better than the long-term average. That was the evidence to which I referred earlier.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I must explain that as the hon. Member for Cotswold asked a question after the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton sought leave to withdraw the amendment, I must now put the question that the amendment be made.

<P>

<P>

<P>
Amendment No. 81, in page 74, leave out lines 32 to 34.
<P>
Government amendments Nos. 220 and 224.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> It may be helpful if I explain that Government amendments Nos. 216 to 220 and Government amendment No. 224 fine-tune the conditions under clause 106 for relieving foreign currency bearer instruments from the stamp duty rates and threshold charge when they are put into a depository or clearance service. They meet the concerns expressed by LIBA and others. Clause 106 restricts the relief to its intended purpose of helping companies to borrow money, and is designed to prevent artificial issues of securities in this form, avoiding large amounts of SDRT.
<P>
The four amendments--Nos. 216, 217, 220 and 224--make changes that are consequential on amendments Nos. 218 and 219. Amendment No. 218 is a substantive amendment that restates subsections (1) and (2) of the clause. In so doing, it makes three changes to the conditions for relief. First, the requirement for stock exchange listing in order for an instrument to qualify as raising new capital is removed, which simplifies things.
<P>
Secondly, under the clause as it stands, relief is conditional on the loan stock not being convertible into unlisted securities. The amendment refocuses that requirement and prevents loan stock, which benefits from the exemption, from then being converted into other securities that are chargeable to SDRT, thus avoiding the 1.5 per cent. season ticket charge for entering a depository. Stock that is convertible only into non-chargeable securities will be allowed the relief.
<P>
Thirdly, the amendment provides relief in respect of securities within a depository scheme which, although not subscribed for cash, have been received in exchange for other securities that were subscribed for cash.
<P>
Amendment No. 219 makes corresponding changes to those in amendment No. 218, in respect of relief from the charge on issues of securities and clearance services rather than depositories. The Opposition amendments--Nos. 74 to 81--are a pale shadow of the Government amendments. Our amendments will alter the clause, in the light of various representations that have been made to us. The LIBA has said that the Government amendments deal with the major issues that it raised, and it is grateful for that. Our amendments also respond to representations made by the Law Society that the relief should apply when securities are issued in exchange for existing securities that qualify under the clause. The Opposition amendments, although they are designed to achieve a similar purpose to the Government amendments, do not do so. I hope that the Opposition amendments will be withdrawn, and I commend the Government amendments to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I want to speak to amendments Nos. 74 to 81. Clause 106 is another example of the catastrophic drafting that exposes the Stamp Office's and the Minister's complete lack of understanding and experience of the commercial world. In crafting a policy to catch certain tax avoidance schemes, the Government have drafted a clause that has brought within its provisions innocent bearer instruments issued by United Kingdom banks to raise short to medium-term finance to manage liquidity. The offending phrase in the clause is the insistence that to qualify for exemption from the provisions, the securities issued must be "marketable securities", defined as
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"securities which are listed . . . on a recognised stock exchange.
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Given that a number of UK banks issued non-sterling bearer instruments that were not listed on a recognised stock exchange, it will cause huge problems for the UK banking sector. The cost of issuing listed instruments would be prohibitive for those banks, so the measure will increase the overall cost of financing for the UK banking sector.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 74 to 81, which were tabled some time before the Government amendments, deal with the problem by removing the requirement for marketable securities. They are probing amendments intended to alert the Government to the concern that we share with industry. We are grateful that the Government have tabled an amendment to deal with the problem.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> Our amendments respond to representations from the banking and legal professions. It would be absurd to reject their case when the conditions of the clause will have an impact on extremely complex features of the capital market. It would be equally absurd to suggest that the Stamp Office or Her Majesty's Treasury lack experience in these matters. The collective memory of the Stamp Office goes back a couple of hundred years. I note for the benefit of the Committee that in the 1997 Finance Bill, introduced in February 1997 by the previous Government, the clause on stamp duty reserve tax also prompted representations from the industry that it went too wide and caught ordinary commercial transactions. Before withdrawing the proposal completely, the Government revised the legislation to impose a charge on agreements to transfer foreign currency bearers rather than on bearer issues. The need for technical amendments in response to the representations of the industry is a standard feature of Finance Bills. I am surprised that the hon. Gentleman is in such a bad mood, although I understand the reasons for his nervousness.

Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> It has been pointed out to us that the clause represents another example of why stamp duty on share transfers should be abolished in the long term. Will not the clause discourage United Kingdom companies from entering into cross-border mergers? If such mergers do occur, relevant holding companies will almost certainly be situated overseas and there will thus be no revenue for the Government from the measure. How do the Government estimate a yield of £10 million?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I do not accept that that would be the case. Together with clause 106, the clause will close a loophole in SDRT rules about bearer shared denominated in foreign currency. That loophole allows shares to enter a depository clearance service free of tax, putting significant revenue at risk.
<P>
The hon. Member for Guildford adopts a cavalier attitude to questions of public finance. A cool £1.5 billion here or a cool £1.4 billion there obviously do not matter to him. He may smile, but he has a responsibility to his constitutuents and to others to explain how gaps in the public finances are to be met. Will they be best me by higher taxation? If the revenue is not raised, which public services in his constituency would he cut--the health service, education or, most important, services to protect law and order? I shall give way to the hon. Gentleman because I am sure that he will wish to explain himself.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> Of course the Financial Secretary is right--did she not listen when I said that these were probing amendments? the question is not how I would replace the lost revenue but how the Government are to protect the revenue when it is so unsoundly based. in the international economy, share transfers can take place on other exchanges that do not suffer stamp duty at anything like the rate that it is suffered here. The Minister refused to face that long-term problem in previous reponses and she refused to face it now. That is why my constituents are concerned that the tax base is not being soundly constructed. Judging by the Minister's answers this afternoon, they will continue in that clear impression.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> The hon. Gentleman must get his lines straight. What is it to be--are these merely probing amendments or, as he has said before, have they been tabled because he represents a party that believes in cutting taxation? He cannot have it both ways.
<P>
The Government's intention to take action was announced on 29
 January. With effect from 30 January, the clause applies a 1.5 per cent. charge to the issue or transfer by a UK company of foreign currency bearer instruments. Companies knew full well that we intended to close tax loopholes. In any case, in decisions on merger bids, SDRT is only one of the factors involved. I would have thought that the hon. Gentleman would appreciate that. I urge hon. Members to endorse the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies </B>(Croydon, Central): I endorse the sentiments of my hon. Friend the Minister. The Government have acted swiftly, but not swiftly enough to avoid all attempts at successfully evading tax. The Government's action on 29 January--which I welcome--was announced on the front page of the Financial Times on 1 February.
<P>
I shall give an example of why the Government's strategy is necessary. The BP Amoco merger involved a contrivance in the issue of the shares in the new company whereby the new shares were denominated in dollars, thus avoiding 1.5 per cent. stamp duty. That would have been worth £500 million, or around $800 million. Other companies, such as Vodaphone and Air Touch Communications, moved very quickly so that the global avoidance was around twice that amount. We live in a fast-moving, multinational global economy, with electronic transfers of shares and so on. The Opposition's strategy of simply holding up their hands and saying that we therefore need to reduce taxation to nothing so that there are no tax differentials--with the implication that we should move towards some sort of global harmonisation, which the Conservative party seems to have been resisting--is irresponsible and silly.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn rose--</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies On that note, I call the hon. Gentleman.</B><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman Order. The hon. Gentleman does not call anybody. He may give way. In that case, if another hon. Member catches my eye, I may call him.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn Thank you, Mr. Butterfill. I am glad that someone here understands the proprieties more than the hon. Gentleman does.</B><P>
<P>
It is grossly irresponsible not to address the strategic issue, which is how the Government will cope with the threat to their tax base from international competition. It is funny that whenever we hear the Government talk about tax harmonisation, it is about increasing taxes in this country. When we discuss an issue of tax harmonisation through competition, whereby taxation should go down, we hear nothing but insults from the Government. They keep saying that they are somehow going to close the loophole. It is not a loophole it is a competitive pressure. That is the real issue that confronts the Government, and, as the hon. Gentleman demonstrated, they simply run away from it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies That was a farcical intervention. It is not a loophole, but a gaping hole through which tax is gushing. The Opposition's so-called strategy is to hold up their hands and say, "We give in. It's a fair cop--you can keep the money". That is not the way forward. The way forward is to recognise the short-term liability, which is enormous, to plug the gap and then to move towards international agreements and co-operation so that we can mutually gain. The right hon. Member for Fylde (Mr. Jack) is making various grunting noises from a sedentary position. He appears to be at odds with some of his colleagues, who seem to want harmonisation.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett The hon. Gentleman is making one or two powerful points. Does he not agree that it is a shame that the gap was not plugged a year ago? The then Minister--now the Paymaster General--clearly set out how the tax avoidance scheme worked in the fourth paragraph of her letter to the right hon. member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory), dated 29 June 1998. If Ministers had done their homework properly and plugged the gap, they could have saved the British Exchequer more than £1 billion.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies It is easy to be clever with the benefit of hindsight, but there is the issue of retrospection and the announcement of mergers in the light of current legislation that, in theory, could have been disrupted by a sudden retrospective move. Fine decisions need to be made, but the Government have acted to close the loopholes and I applaud that. The Opposition's idea that we should not have acted but simply watched as the tax sped abroad is farcical. I realise that we work in an international market, but it is wrong to think that British companies that take over foreign companies will suddenly leave.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn According to my examination of the "Financial Statement and Budget Report", the likely annual yield as a result of the change in the clause will be £10 million a year. Does the hon. Gentleman agree with his Government's own figures, and does he regard that as a gaping hole in the tax legislation?</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies I have already quoted various figures on the cost of mergers, which were widely reported in the financial press, and which Liberal Democrat members have corroborated. I am making a general point about closing the opportunity to issue merger shares in a foreign currency and a bearer form. I realise that the subject is complicated, and I would suggest that the hon. Member for Guildford, who seems not to be grasping the wider points that I am making, remains sedentary.</B><P>
<P>
The matter is highly technical, but I welcome the Government's initiative. As the Financial Secretary said, we are discussing a large sum that could benefit the public greatly by, for example, buying many places in hospitals and schools.

<P>

<B>Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory </B>(Wells): The Committee ought to examine the clause, which contains another tax-raising measure that the Government have not fully explained. It puts an imposition on business that may have perverse environmental effects at the levels that are contemplated by the Government. The Committee might know that the landfill tax was introduced in the 1976 Finance Bill by myself and other hon. Members.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael Jack </B>(Fylde): rose--
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I apologise for not mentioning my right hon. Friend the Member for Fylde (Mr. Jack) by name.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> Did my right hon. Friend say 1976? I think that may be a little premature.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> My right hon. Friend is right: it was 1996. None of us served in government as far back as 1976.
<P>
The landfill tax was designed to do two things: first, it sent the message that alternatives to putting waste in landfill sites were desirable; and, secondly, it raised a substantial sum, which was recycled in the economy to cut taxes on employment. We were taxing the environment and lightening the tax load on employment.
<P>
When the Conservative Administration took office in 1979, the national insurance contribution rate on employers was 13.5 per cent. Successive Conservative Governments reduced that to 10.2 per cent. by 1996. The revenue from landfill tax was used to reduce the rate by 0.2 per cent. to the 10 per cent. rate when we left office. That gave us a considerable advantage in international terms. It was the envy of the European Union and in no small part contributed to our excellent employment record. We have among the lowest employment taxes in Europe and a correspondingly low unemployment rate. The sums involved were huge, as shown by the expense of shaving that final 0.2 per cent. off the national insurance contribution rate, which cost £0.5 billion a year, most of which was raised from the landfill tax.
<P>
The Government have announced a doubling of the landfill tax rate, but where is the corresponding cut in employment taxation? How will the revenue be recycled in the economy? Will it all go into the black hole of general Treasury expenditure? Those are serious questions. All too often, the Government see a tax and their instinct is to increase it, but there are limits to sensible taxation. Just as the Government got into terrible problems over the annual increase in the road fuel tax escalator--I predict that they will find a way out of that problem next year, although they should have sorted it out by now--they are moving on to a landfill tax escalator.
<P>
The rate for standard landfill is being raised from £7 to £10 a tonne this year. The Government have announced that the rate will increase by £1 every year until at least 2004. Can the Financial Secretary shed some light on that for the benefit of landfill operators, the building trade and industry generally? They want to know whether the Government will have the same problems with landfill tax as with other indirect taxes such as that on road fuel. A tax that is sensible and environmentally beneficial at a low rate may have a perverse effect at a higher rate.
<P>
The purpose of the landfill tax is to effect a behavioural change in favour of waste reduction or recycling, but, by the same logic, it can also divert waste into illegal forms of tipping. People may refuse to pay a high landfill tax and, instead, throw waste, which is often toxic, into a local canal to avoid the tax altogether. The higher the tax rate, the greater the problem.
<P>
Will the Financial Secretary tell the Committee whether fly tipping is a problem, whether it has increased and whether it is likely to increase further with higher tax rates? PricewaterhouseCoopers published a report shortly after implementation of the tax in which it stated that 78 per cent. of respondents to its survey said that fly tipping had increased. That was when the tax rate was £7 per tonne. If it is raised to more than twice that, fly tipping could become a serious environmental problem and overwhelm the benign effect that the tax was designed to introduce.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> Does the right hon. Gentleman agree that the strategy of moving from landfill to incineration is likely to be less environmentally damaging than switching from landfill to fly tipping? Although the risks to which he referred exist, a switch to incineration should be encouraged.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> It is not altogether clear that incineration is a better environmental option. If a company applied for planning permission to erect an incineration plant in the hon. Gentleman's constituency, he would soon discover that the popular perception of incineration is not always as favourable as he seems to think.
<P>
The purpose of the landfill tax was not only to divert waste into recycling, but, even better, to minimise the amount of waste produced. The hierarchy of waste management is, first, to minimise it, secondly, to reuse or recycle it and, as a last resort, to use it for landfill or incinerate it with heat recovery. There are many ways of dealing with waste, but the landfill tax has been successful in sending the right signals and encouraging more benign forms of waste management. That occurs only with relatively low rates of tax and I question whether the same will apply with a rate of tax at £15 a tonne or higher. which the Government are contemplating.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The subject is wide and complicated and I have restricted my questions to two matters. First, what will happen to the revenue and why have the Government lost their enthusiasm for recycling the revenue into lower employment taxes, which they were enthusiastic about when the tax was introduced--I have the official record with me? Secondly, what are the practical limits and, in particular, if fly tipping has been identified as a problem, what are the Government doing to counter it and how much worse will it become as a result of the higher rates now contemplated?
<P>
<B>Several hon. Members rose--</B><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I remind right hon. and hon. Members of Madam Speaker's ruling that electronic devices that emit audible tones must be switched off before Members enter the Chamber, and that applies equally in Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Christopher Leslie </B>(Shipley): I am grateful to you for calling me, Mr. Butterfill, because I have been provoked to speak by the comments of the right hon. Member for Wells. In my constituency, there is a prospective planning application in relation to a former quarry, Buck Park quarry in Denholme, where an environmental disaster is on the brink of taking place if the landfill application is approved. I know that my constituents will be shocked to read the views of Conservative Members who oppose the disincentive that the Government are trying to introduce in order to prevent the proliferation of landfill sites across the country.
<P>
There are many environmental problems with landfill. My constituents have been campaigning vigorously against the application in their area. Indeed, so strong are their views that they held a referendum in Denholme, for which more than 50 per cent. of the population turned out. Some 98 per cent. voted against landfill. The panoply of reasons for this were: the traffic generated by the constant stream of lorries and trucks going to and from the landfill site, the eyesore of landfill sites to local residents, the pollution caused to the air and watercourses in the area, and the noise, flies and seagulls, all of which make life a misery around landfill sites. [Laughter.]
<P>
I am surprised that Opposition Members think that that is so hilarious. My constituents' lives and the peace and tranquillity of the residential areas that they have enjoyed for many decades are under threat from the application, so I feel that it is important to support the measure, which will help prevent the proliferation of landfill sites. I believe that the measure will prevent the application for Buck Park quarry in Denholme from being approved, and I support the Government's proposal.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey </B>(Kingston and Surbiton): The right hon. Member for Wells was right to say that, with respect to employment, the Conservatives left Britain with a tax system that was competitive compared with our EU partners. However, he failed to mention that the record on recycling in this country is behind that of many of our EU partners, and we have a long way to go to catch up.
<P>
The matter is urgent, especially in this country, which is a relatively small island where land is scarce. We need to find new ways to minimise waste, to recycle it and find other ways of dealing with it. That is a crucial issue. As a Member of Parliament for a London constituency, those problems are all too evident to me. Therefore, I was surprised that the right hon. Member for Wells was timid in his support of the proposal--it was not even clear whether he supported it.
<P>
My hon. Friends and I believe that the Government are moving in the right direction. The proposal to introduce an escalator, as was introduced for fuel duties, is the right approach because it will give advance knowledge to the industry and the people who will pay the tax, so that they can plan their strategies accordingly and minimise the tax that they will have to pay by taking the sorts of measures that are needed to tackle the waste disposal problem in our country. It is surprising that the right hon. Gentleman's support was so timid, or even lacking, because landfill tax was one of the most successful environmental measures introduced by the previous Government and we should build on that.
<P>
There has been concern in the industry about where the revenue from this tax will be used.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Wells is right to say that, when in opposition, the Labour party was keen to ensure that, if a revenue-neutral policy were being followed, tax revenues were recycled. That would be the right approach. As we have heard in previous debates in this Committee, if environmental taxes are to get the support of the public, it is necessary to show that they are not merely a way of increasing the tax burden. The money must be recycled to gain support for the recycling of waste.
<P>
There may be other taxes that could be cut, or there may be other measures to assist the industry for which the revenue could be used. Perhaps the revenue could be used to tackle some of the problems of fly tipping, to which the right hon. Member for Wells referred. He is right to say that fly tipping has become more prevalent in some areas. In my constituency, it is the small vans that tend to find the charges at waste sites expensive. Perhaps the Government could introduce a differential charging system at waste sites, which would assist small businesses that are having problems paying the charges. Such businesses could be given advice on how they can dispose of their waste in other ways and how they can minimise the waste that they produce. I hope that the Financial Secretary will indicate that the Government are considering such constructive ways forward.
<P>
It is incumbent on the Financial Secretary to provide the Committee with a report on how recycling is improving the country.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I would be disturbed if the Financial Secretary were to do any such thing. The Committee is considering a specific tax; it is not engaging in a general debate on how environmental taxes should work. I would be grateful if the hon. Gentleman were to return to clause 114.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I shall do so--I was bringing my remarks to a conclusion. I wanted to make the point that if the Financial Secretary wants the Committee to support such a tax increase, she must prove beyond reasonable doubt that she is confident that it will work.

<P>
<B>Ms Sally Keeble </B>(Northampton, North): I want to speak briefly on this tax, which relates not only to a specific area of finance but to the whole question of waste management.

<P>
The right hon. Member for Wells skated, in a haphazard fashion, over many arguments about waste management. For example, he said that incineration did not work. I completely agree with the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey) that the previous Government's changes to the tax and energy price structure, which were intended to boost incineration and put pressure on landfill, were among the more creative things that they did. The energy policy provided good prices for small combined heat and power systems, and selling energy to the grid started to make incineration look acceptable--not only did people receive a fee for incineration, but they received money from the grid for the energy that they supplied. South East London Combined Heat and Power, which was in my ward when I was a local councillor, is an example of that. The right hon. Gentleman said that people objected to such schemes, which they did, but the arguments and the technology were explained to them. As a councillor, I had to deal with such a planning application.

<P>
Despite the previous Government's efforts, the policy did not work, which is a great shame. That was partly because landfill prices were not ratcheted enough, and partly because the incentives for incineration were not high enough to produce a shift in people's behaviour. At the same time, the previous Government's changes to waste management schemes meant that people had to enter 20 to 30-year contracts, which gave landfill an advantage. Despite those measures, the policy did not work. The Government are absolutely right to return to the issue and reconsider the financial structures to ensure that the alternatives to landfill are acceptable, because landfill is not a viable option.

<P>
The hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton said that we should look at recycling, but he cannot seriously have considered the finances of that, because they do not stack up, either. I am not a great fan of recycling, just because I am not organised enough to do it. Northampton, into which my constituency falls, is about third, fourth or fifth on the list of boroughs that recycle the most, but it costs the borough a fortune, not only because recycling is expensive but because the prices for the commodities that it produces have slumped. One cannot sell the paper, for example, for anything approaching a reasonable price--quite often people have to be paid to take the stuff away.

<P>
If we are serious, not just about the environmental issue but about practical concerns such as the number of sites and how the stuff is going to be disposed of, it is right that the Government should reconsider the matter and use the tax system as an incentive to encourage people to consider more sustainable--let alone environmentally friendly--waste management.

<P>
<B>Mr. Stephen Dorrell </B>(Charnwood): I hope that when the Minister replies to the debate, she will go a little further than the Red Book in assessing the net effect on the Government's revenues of the proposal to increase the rate of landfill tax and, in particular, the effect of this extra tax charge--for that is what I believe it to be--that is being imposed on local authorities.

<P>
The hon. Member for Northampton, North (Ms Keeble) referred to the fact that the local authorities responsible for waste disposal are seeing a substantial increase in the expenditure associated with that service, because they are unable to sell waste paper, waste glass and so on for the values for which they used to be able to sell them. There is, in straightforward terms, a glut in that market, so the net cost on local authorities of delivering a waste recycling service is rising, and rising fast. As a result of this change in landfill tax rates, the Government are about to make that problem significantly worse for local authorities.

<P>
As I understand it, the biggest single payers of landfill tax are, indirectly, local authorities, which are responsible for placing contracts with waste disposal contractors. Tax that is imposed on contractors is ultimately paid by the contractors' customers, among whom local authorities are an important element.

<P>
<B>Ms Keeble:</B> Does the right hon. Gentleman accept that quite a few local authorities sell to combined waste management firms, and they decide whether to sell to incinerators or landfill sites? The crucial issue is cost.

<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> Of course, the incentive applies to contractors disposing of local authority waste, as it applies to everybody else, but that does not alter the fact that although this increased rate of landfill tax will be a revenue-raising measure, a substantial element of that extra revenue will not be extra revenue for the Government at all, it will be the Government paying themselves by a money-go-round which has incentive effects, but which does not raise extra money for the Exchequer.

<P>
I hope that when the Minister responds to the debate, instead of inviting the Committee to believe that this extra rate of tax will produce a net revenue effect for the Exchequer, as set out in the Red Book, she will explain what extra public expenditure will be involved as a result of the indirect effect that the extra tax will have on local authorities. I hope that she will give us that information for two reasons First, there is the obvious reason that if the Committee is being invited to raise a tax rate, we should understand what the net effect of that extra tax will be on public-sector revenues, not simply the gross revenue raising on the revenue side of the Treasury account. The second and, from the point of view of local authorities, perhaps more important reason is that we should know how much the allowed rate of expenditure by local authorities must rise to return them to the position that they were in before this tax increase came into effect.

<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
I draw the Committee's attention to that because I am an ex-Health Secretary, as the Committee will know. In that capacity, 1 was the sponsoring Minister for social services. As a result, I am familiar with the disciplines of local authority finance, at least from a central Government point of view. I have observed, both in that capacity and as shadow Education Secretary, the preference of all Governments to claim that all increases in local authority expenditure go into education. When I was negotiating for extra money for social services, I was always told, "Don't worry, it doesn't matter if it doesn't go into the social service standard spending assessment. As long as it goes to local authorities, it is available to be spent on social services." I heard that argument from the Paymaster General's employers several times when I argued the case for social service expenditure. I have observed the present Government continue in that tradition, and several times in Committee we have heard the Government use the previous Government's experience as the authority and endorsement for what they are about to do. The habit that I have just described has carried over the previous Government to the new Government, and when increased local authority expenditure was announced, the Secretary of State for Education and Employment invited us to believe that it would all end up in the school rooms. Of course, that has not happened; some of it has gone off to hard-pressed--

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We are straying somewhat wide of the clause.

<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I am simply inviting Ministers to set out the revenue effect of the clause. The Committee should have that information so that it can guard against the effect about which I am talking.

<P>
When considering the clause, we must have at the back of our minds the tendency of all Governments to claim that all extra local authority expenditure goes into education. That is because we must understand what the extra burden on local authorities will be as a result of the proposed extra tax. I hope that Ministers, when they respond to the debate, will tell us what the net effect of the tax increase will be on public sector revenues and, by implication therefore, what increased burden the proposal will place on local authority finances.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> l want to pick up on the theme that my right hon. Friend developed. The Coopers and Lybrand report that was mentioned earlier made the telling point that local authorities emerge in a survey as being hit the hardest by the proposal. They have little or no control over the volume of waste of which they must dispose, and more than 70 per cent. have seen their waste disposal costs rise by 6 per cent. or more. Clearly, there is a continuing impact, which will increase because of the proposals.

<P>
Fly tipping has been discussed. The Coopers and Lybrand report said:

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"76 per cent. of local authorities also report an increase in fly-tipping".

<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
It would help the Committee when judging whether to support the proposal to know what analysis the Treasury or Customs and Excise have made of its impact.

<P>
I want my contribution to the debate to centre on some words that the Paymaster General uttered on 23 January 1996, when she debated this very measure. The proposal in clause 114 offers no further discount on employers' national insurance contributions as a result of the proposed increase or of any subsequent increases. Yet, with conviction and passion on 23 January, the Paymaster General--the hon. Member for Bristol, South (Dawn Primarolo)--tabled an amendment to the Finance Bill. It effectively proposed that the landfill tax should not come into operation unless there was always a corresponding and matching cut to national insurance contributions when the landfill tax was increased. I find remarkable the amnesia that has overtaken the Paymaster General at this juncture. She was so concerned that she asked:

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Will there be any safeguards on the amount of the charge increases?"--[Official Report, 23 January 1996, Vol. 270, c. 152.]

<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
We know that there will be no safeguards because we have before us a menu for tax rates for the years up to 2005, by which time the tax may be at £15, not the £10 referred to in clause 115. Goodness knows what the Government may do when they look at a nice little earner--we may find those figures amended in future. The hon. Lady went on to ask Questions about the landfill tax.

<P>

<B>The Paymaster General (Dawn Primarolo):</B> I am incredibly flattered that the right hon. Gentleman is reading what I said, although he took no notice of it at the time. Is he to make any points of his own, or is he just going to remind us of the eloquent words that I altered some years ago?

<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> This is a debate and we have heard much from Government Members. When we have had the temerity to criticise some of their points, we have heard Government Back Benchers say, "Oh, you did the same thing." I remind the Committee of the exchanges earlier when we considered drafting matters and the accuracy of legislation. The Paymaster General should not feel upset--

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I am not upset. Will the right hon. Gentleman give way?

<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> I shall make my point. The Paymaster General should not feel upset that I play her arguments back to her. I have a question to ask, of which I shall give the Government notice. What has so changed her mind since she made those statements? The proposals in clause 114 negate her previous position.

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I can assure the right hon. Gentleman that I am not at all offended that he reads what I have said over such a long period so avidly. Has he any thoughts of his own to bring to the discussion?

<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> I am disappointed that the Minister says that--she knows that I have thoughts of my own, some of which I am prepared to share publicly with the Committee and some that I would rather keep to myself. On this occasion, she cannot excuse her record by asking me whether I have thoughts of my own. I want now to probe those who hold high office and who are responsible for the landfill tax about why they have changed their minds.

<P>
Later in the remarks made by the Minister when in opposition she said:

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The Government say that the aim of the tax is to promote a more sustainable approach to waste management. If that is so, why is landfill the only option being considered?"

<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
That is a good question--I have not found it but we might have seen elsewhere in the Bill a carrot to promote alternative forms of waste disposal. All that we have so far is the stick of clause 114, with some of the drawbacks mentioned by my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells.

<P>
The Minister went on to say

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The tax structure does not recognise the fact that, in some cases, landfill is the best method of disposal from an environmental viewpoint".

<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
 That was a clearly thought out position. I say to the Paymaster General that this is my question, not that of somebody else. What has changed--if there is an alternative, why is it not being promoted either by amendment to the clause or by environmental measures? Why, in only three years, has amnesia so clouded the minds of the Minister and other Government Members that they cannot take their own advice?

<P>
When commenting on the amendment the Minister said:

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"This is a tidying-up amendment that would put into legislation the commitments made by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, over two years, for national insurance contribution cuts to run in parallel with the levying of the tax."--[Official Report, 23 January 1996; Vol. 270, c.
 152-3.

<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
It is remarkable that, under pressure from the Chancellor, her own sage words of advice have been neatly forgotten. It would be interesting to know why we are now being presented with what appears to be a nice little earner. I hope that the Government will explain this volte face. The hon. Lady prayed in aid the same Coopers and Lybrand report that I quote from. There must therefore be an element of respectability in the firm's work--I am sure that there is. She pointed out that

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"with a levy on landfill even as high as £20 per tonne"

<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
--the proposals are heading in that direction--

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> "recycling would still remain a relatively unattractive financial option and . . . the use of the tax alone would not be enough to develop alternatives."--[Official Report, 23 January 1996; Vol. 270, c. 167.)

<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
 Out of their own mouths, the Government's policy is now condemned for the future. In clause 114, they have rested on the landfill tax simply to increase it, with no alternative in terms of recycling or cuts in national insurance. Three and a half short years ago, the now Paymaster General asked for precisely those measures. What has changed the Government's mind to defeat and turn around their own carefully thought out previous position?

<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> I rise not only as a keen environmentalist--as you will know, Mr. Butterfill, from my references to the bearded vulture--but as the former leader of Croydon council, London's largest and most successful council, which is at the top of the pecking order for sustainability and recycling.

<P>
I support the initiative on landfill taxes. I should point out that there is no relationship between landfill tax income and national insurance. That hypothecation was invented, and has no inherent logic. In fact much--if not most--landfill tax is paid by local authorities. That puts pressure on local authorities to think about other recycling opportunities. Although it is not the case in all boroughs, Croydon makes money out of recycling. If the expertise and focus is there, that can happen.

<P>
I asked earlier, in respect of incineration, "Who wants an incinerator in their back yard?" The answer is, "Possibly not many people." However, modern incinerators--such as the one at Croydon's Mayday hospital, which is extremely efficient at converting waste into heat and does not give rise to noxious fumes--are progressing. That is partly due to the pressure for innovative change that comes from disciplines such as having to pay the landfill tax. I believe that the landfill tax will not cause more fly tipping, but will move local authorities towards the high benchmark set by Croydon council when I was its leader for recycling, healthy incineration opportunities and a more sustainable life style.

<P>
When the Government look at the incidence of landfill taxes across local authorities, I hope that they will do so in a strategic manner that looks at individual costs by local authority and asks whether local authorities are meeting the challenge of environmentally sustainable recycling. We already know that the Government are embarked on a three year, more strategic approach to expenditure to boost income.

<P>
I welcome the measure as an environmentally sensitive approach that will be incorporated within a wider vision of Government finances.

<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> Time moves on, and I should like to make a few brief points.

<P>
I used to live in Cornwall, where there are several mine shafts. There was always a problem with fly tipping, and there will be a much bigger problem as the cost of legitimate waste disposal goes through the roof under the Government's proposals. Far from being environmentally friendly, a great deal of indirect environmental damage will result from the escalator that the Government are proposing.

<P>
I believe that one of the main causes of the growth in waste disposal in recent years is the growth in the disposable nappy market. I have five children and I can probably claim to have changed almost as many nappies as anyone else in the Room, but as my youngest child is now beyond that, I can discuss the issue with no interest to declare. Because disposable nappies are a significant part of the disposal market, the tax on landfill will in fact be a stealth tax on young families up and down the country. The Government should be careful of milking it too much, because it would be most unfair on young families if the Government were indirectly to cause the cost of those nappies to go through the roof.

<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?

<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> In a moment.

<P>
I am also concerned as a result of constituents' correspondence regarding the collection problems of this tax. There is a difficulty for legitimate landfill operators because the level of tax is high in relation to their underlying charge. That creates a working capital problem, as they may have to pay the tax before they receive payment on bills that they have sent to their customers. Will the Minister comment on that and on the problem of bad debts, about which I have written to the Treasury over the past 18 months? The greater the problem that is created when a bad debt occurs for a legitimate trader who may have passed over revenue to Customs and Excise. He must wait for a rebate on that bad debt and the longer he waits, the bigger the cashflow problem for the operator. If that operator is a local council, there may be an indirect effect on the money available for local services.

<P>
Finally, I welcome anything that discourages inappropriate landfill. We heard from the hon. Member for Shipley about a landfill problem in his constituency. In Shamley Green in my constituency, there is an operator who has been angling for many years to re-open a landfill site on the edge of the village. That would have a devastating consequence and the issue is of great concern, although together we have fought against it successfully up until now. If, as a by-product of higher landfill taxes, marginal sites are no longer attractive to landfill operators, that is to be welcomed, but it will be offset by the fact that on the many brownfield site developments with a landfill disposal element, there will be a marked increase in the cost of disposing of the waste that must be removed before they can be developed. If the tax is taken too far, it may prohibit or discourage the development of brownfield sites, again with negative consequences for our country's environment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Cawsey </B>(Brigg and Goole): I thought that I should take the opportunity to speak while you, Mr. Butterfill, are in the Chair because I noticed in the Hansard report of our 11th sitting on 25th May that I am not listed as being present, which is entirely correct; however, at column 463 I make a speech, which is remarkable. I thought that as you were in the Chair on that occasion, Mr. Butterfill, you might be able to tell me whether it was a good or bad speech. I was actually in Greece.

<P>
I want to speak on this subject because of how the landfill tax has affected the behaviour of local authorities in my constituency and, I am sure, across the country. I was the leader of North Lincolnshire council when the landfill tax was introduced and I saw at first hand how it led to council officers and members trying to do more to recycle or reuse waste rather than simply putting it into landfill sites, of which there are many in my part of the world.

<P>
We saw the introduction of such schemes as giving two wheelie bins per household, one of which could compost waste, while the contents of the other would go to landfill. The council collects the bins on alternate weeks and, indeed, it now makes its own compost and sells it, which has been a very successful scheme.

<P>
We have seen civic amenity sites move away from being little more than huge skips into which everything is put, into a series of collection points for different sorts of waste. I use my own civic amenity site in Winterton quite a lot, and that change means that trips become significantly longer because one has to go round the various facilities for all the different waste. The simple truth is that local authorities might not have moved as far as they have done if it were not for the incentive that the landfill tax gave them. In that respect, I see no great difficulties with the Government's proposal, and I am sure that it will have the same effect.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I agree with the hon. Gentleman's line of argument. None the less, he must concede that a landfill tax is an extra cost on the local authority sector. If the Treasury do not allow for it in calculating SSAs, the only effect must be a distortion, as revenues that would otherwise go into education or social services go towards paying tax to the Treasury.

<P>
<B>Mr. Cawsey:</B> I understand the right hon. Gentleman's point, but I am not necessarily as pessimistic as him. What he says will be the case only if authorities continue to push everything into landfill in the first place. There would be little point in merely adjusting the SSA; if councils were given money to pay the tax anyway, why would they want to push anything into recycling? That would not happen; there must be some pressure on them. However, as Opposition Members have said, something in the mechanism must ensure that local authorities that introduce good environmental projects--often in partnership with the private sector have possibilities to get their hands back on some of the landfill tax. Indeed, a landfill tax credit system is now in place. In Scunthorpe, in the North Lincolnshire council area, a very good environmental heritage project was started in the town centre in conjunction with British Steel. It took a derelict part of the town and made a good job of turning it into a great asset for the community. The project was 50 per cent. funded by landfill tax credits. It will be welcomed by all if such mechanisms are left in place.

<P>
The right hon. Member for Wells started this debate. We have spoken about incineration, and the only claim that the right hon. Gentleman made--although some people jumped down his throat--was that an hon. Member who found that an application had been made for an incinerator in his constituency would also find that there was a lot of public concern about it. There is currently an application in my constituency for a very large incinerator, and what I have said is entirely true. Whatever the rights or wrongs of incineration, there is a long way to go before there is public confidence in it. I recently visited an incinerator in Deptford--my hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, North (Ms Keeble) may have referred to it--and I was quite impressed by the operation, although I was less impressed by the amount of traffic that was taking waste there all the time. I spoke to local residents, who were still concerned about the operation opposite their homes.

<P>
We must think about how we will get rid of waste, but more importantly we must think about recycling and re-using it first. The best incentive to achieve that is a landfill tax. I therefore support the proposals.

<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown </B>(Cotswold): Much has been said about the environmental aspects of the tax, but little has been said about the tax itself. Perhaps we can seek clarification from the Government about exactly how much money the tax will raise and how much local authorities will have to pay.

<P>
I understand that the hon. Member for Southampton, Test (Dr. Whitehead) asked the Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions, the hon. Member for Mansfield (Mr. Meale) a question. The Minister replied that the net yield of landfill tax was £360 million in 1997-98. The tax raised a gross amount of £400 million in that year. That implies that local authorities have to pay 20 per cent. of all landfill tax. If my calculation is correct will local authorities be refunded in full through the local government support grant revenue settlement? If not, the measure will become another stealth tax imposed on hard-pressed local authorities, especially those in rural areas already receiving an unfair settlement from the Government compared with their neighbouring urban authorities.

<P>
Will the Government clarify that matter, and say how much the tax will raise? There is to be a one-off 3 per cent. increase this year, which looks likely to raise £95 million. The Government are set to increase the tax by 1
 per cent. over the next four years, which is likely to increase the revenue initially by £45 million, rising to £85 million in 2001-02. That projection seems at odds with the Red Book figures, which put the rise in the tax at an index base of £45 million in 2000-01 to £85 million in 2001-02.

<P>
It is worth questioning not only the sum that the tax will raise, but whether the tax will achieve its environmental objectives. It seems that the Government are lax or economical with the truth, if nothing else, about what the environmental objectives are and whether they are being achieved. The hon. Member for Southampton, Test asked what statistics the Government were collating on fly tipping. The answer was

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"My Department does not collate statistics on the fly-tipping of either commercial or domestic waste."

<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
If the Government are not collating statistics, how do they know whether fly tipping is increasing?

<P>
The Member for Test asked about the reduction in the quantity of waste going to landfill. The Minister replied:

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"We would, however, expect the tax increases to start to have an effect on the amount of municipal waste sent to landfill, even though there is little evidence so far that the tax has led to a significant change in behaviour. A delayed impact in this area in line with our expectations."--[Official Report, 24 March 1999; Vol. 328, c. 245.]

<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
The Government should collect statistics on that area--they have been in power for two of the three years in which the tax has operated. They do not, so how do they know what the effect will be of increasing the tax by 3 per cent. this year and 4 per cent. over the next four years? They have a duty to the Committee and to Parliament to tell us that. Will it lead to an increase in fly tipping? Will it increase the rate of behavioural change, to ensure that, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells said, people adopt a hierarchy of reduction and re-use of waste rather than send it to landfill.

<P>
It is interesting to note that several hon. Members have compared incineration and landfill. The Committee might be interested to know that only 3.9 million tonnes of waste are currently incinerated each year; a staggering 102 million tonnes of control waste goes to landfill. The idea that all our waste could be incinerated is for the birds--it simply will not happen.

<P>
<B>Ms Keeble:</B> The hon. Gentleman's point is well made--it is precisely the point that I made. The cost of incineration was still too high by comparison with that of landfill disposal, even after the landfill tax was introduced and concessions were made on energy prices. Landfill operators were able to bring their prices down to make them competitive. That presented people with a real problem if they were trying to switch from landfill to other forms of waste disposal.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I appreciate what the hon. Lady is saying--it is a sincere point. From my experience as a member of the Select Committee on the Environment, Transport and Regional Affairs, and having been round several incineration plants and many landfill sites, I think that, unless the landfill levy is increased considerably, it is always likely that the cost of landfill disposal compared with incineration will be lower. Incineration requires a sophisticated process, especially if it is not to lead to polluting emissions.

<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
I want to make two final points. First, are the Government satisfied with their current legislative powers to deal with fly tipping? We know that fly tipping is on the increase, but we do not know by how much and the Government are unable to tell us. It is certainly on the increase in my constituency; the geography and extensive nature of rural areas make it impossible to police fly tipping there. It causes enormous problems and dealing with it involves heavy costs. That compounds the cost to local authorities, because by and large it is they who must deal with fly tipping when it occurs.

<P>
Secondly, there is an important environmental issue which has not yet been mentioned, which is the environmental trust that was set up by my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells and others when he so rightly introduced this tax. It allows 20 per cent. of the tax to be diverted to specific environmental projects. That is an excellent idea, but the problem is that only just over 50 per cent. of the allowed amount has actually gone to environmental projects. That is only a comparatively small part of the total that is raised. Will the Government consider changes to that mechanism so as to encourage firms to divert a greater amount of the landfill levy that they are charged into those environmental schemes? It would appear to be an excellent way of, for example, conducting research into fly tipping and obtaining statistics--which the Government seem unable to collect--that might reveal how a behavioural change discouraging people from fly tipping could be brought about. Various other environmental schemes could usefully be funded by that money, and the Government might well invent mechanisms that would help in that regard.

<P>
Our country has enjoyed cheap tipping through landfill for many years. Other countries have a far greater level of incineration. These changes will take place over time, and it is important that we consider all the environmental factors. Indeed, the European Union objective requires a reduction in the amount of inert waste going into landfill by 2020. Although they have not collected the statistics, how far do the Government think that they have gone towards meeting that goal?

<P>
The Government have a number of questions to answer about this fairly simple environmental tax, but I fear that the answers will not be forthcoming this afternoon.

<P>
<B>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mrs. Barbara Roche):</B> We have had a very interesting debate and I hope to be forthcoming with my answers.

<P>
In last year's Budget, the Government announced that the standard rate of landfill tax would rise in April this year from £7 to £10 per tonne. The clause amends subsections (1)(a) and (2) of section 42 of the Finance Act 1996 so as to implement that increase. As the right hon. Member for Wells knows, the purpose of the tax is to send a price signal to waste producers and the waste management industry to reduce the use of landfill, which has environmental costs in terms of the risk of pollution and the loss of open landscape. From the good debate that we have had, it appears that there is a lot of interest in the issue.

<P>
The right hon. Member for Wells raised a number of points. Although the previous Conservative Chancellor announced, when the landfill tax was introduced, that the proceeds would be used to cut national insurance contributions, that was not a firm hypothecation. Indeed, that cut cost £505 million in 1997-98; but landfill tax raised rather less than that--approximately £360 million in the first full year. The increase from £7 to £10 is the result of a reduction in the rate of employers' NICs of a mere 0.02 per cent. That is linked to the 0.5 per cent. cut from 12.2 per cent. to 11.7 per cent. in 2001-02, announced by the Government as part of the climate change levy. The right hon. Member for Wells merely told the Committee of his experience as Minister when he made the proposals.
Just as important, fly tipping has been much discussed. All members of the Committee are worried about that. We heard of several constituency problems and members asked some important questions. However, there is no evidence that the tax has caused a significant increase in fly tipping. When the previous Government introduced the tax, fears were expressed that it could provoke an increase in fly tipping. The Environment Agency for England and Wales and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency say that, so far, they have found no significant evidence of that happening.

<P>
The recent Tidy Britain group study showed that household waste is the most common fly-tip waste, yet householders are not directly affected by the tax. That presumably comes as a bit of a surprise to the hon. Member for Guildford--[Interruption.] My hon. Friend the Paymaster General relevantly said the hon. Member for lackeys, but I would not say that about him. Indeed, I want to wean him off that sort of argument.

<P>

<B>Mr. St. Aubyn rose--</B><P>

<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I shall give way to the hon. Gentleman, especially as I cracked such a bad joke.

<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> We have all done that in our time.

<P>
I suggest that households have to bear all those costs indirectly through the cost of refuse collection and in other ways. It can, indeed, be a stealth tax.

<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> That was not a bad attempt. However, I was trying to assist the hon. Gentleman. I did not want readers of Hansard to think that the hon. Gentleman had got the facts wrong or that he did not understand the nature of the tax. I have known the hon. Gentleman for a long time, which is why I wanted to give him the opportunity to illustrate that he does understand the clause.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I suspected that the Financial Secretary might say that the Government did not think that fly tipping was on the increase, because that is the sort of reply that they gave the hon. Member for Southampton, Test. I remind the hon. Lady that Customs and Excise recently carried out a survey into the effects of fly tipping. Its report stated:

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Concern over fly-tipping was one of the most common themes in responses received. 273 respondents (38 per cent.) believed that the tax could or would lead to an increase in fly-tipping. Of these, 187 were from local authorities (57 per cent. of local authorities who replied). Thirteen site operators also believed that the tax might increase fly-tipping, as did a number of trade associations."

<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
I know that fly tipping is on the increase in my constituency. I realise that the increase may be localised, but it is a significant nuisance and a significant added cost to local authorities.

<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I understand that concern. However, it is anxiety about what might happen, and our latest figures show that those fears have not been realised. Clearly, there is no room for complacency and we should monitor the situation closely. I repeat what I said about household waste and fly tipping but, as I said, the expectations  raised at the time have not been matched. The hon. Gentleman has certainly raised important points and we intend to continue monitoring.

<P>
The right hon. Member for Wells asked about the nature of the escalator. We announced that it will be reviewed in 2004, when the tax will be £15 per tonne. That is the year in which we expect to review the new national waste strategy for the first time--an appropriate moment. We have combined planning purposes with flexibility to respond to developments.

{**
<p4**}We have debated the impact of the tax to date. There is some evidence that the tax is leading businesses to explore ways of minimising re-using and recycling waste. When I was a Minister in the DTI, I found that companies--especially small and medium-sized companies--that had to look into the matter took the opportunity of examining their productivity more generally, so there was a by-product in terms of efficiency and productivity. Research shows that nearly a third of waste producers are considering such activity as a result of the tax, which is most encouraging. <P>
The past two years of tax data show disposals of active waste stabilising at just under 15 million tonnes a year and landfilling of inert waste falling by some 25 per cent. to 30 million tonnes a year. Although the tax is clearly having an effect, we do not want to be complacent; we want to see even more progress. Waste disposal costs are, of course, a small proportion of most businesses' costs. As I said at the beginning, a price signal that tells them that those costs are going to rise can be effective in encouraging alternatives--especially waste minimisation and re-use.
<P>
Several issues about local authorities were raised. The notice of rate changes allows local authorities to consider alternatives to landfill to reduce their exposure to the tax. Specifically, offsetting the cost of the landfill tax increases might remove the incentive effect, which would defeat the object of the exercise.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> This point is important. I agree with the Financial Secretary that specifically offsetting the cost would entirely negate the effect and be undesirable. However, that was not my point, which was to understand how much extra burden would need to be placed on local authorities in order to see the anticipated effect on local authority expenditure while preserving the incentive for local authorities to use the money elsewhere.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I understand the right hon. Gentleman's important point. I can tell him that we calculate local authorities' share of the increase to be some £22 million, if they take no steps to reduce reliance on landfill. However, that increase was announced a year ago and, combined with the escalator also announced this year for future years, it will give local authorities time to plan their affairs to reduce their exposure. I repeat what the right hon. Gentleman says: if they were to be fully recompensated, the incentive would be removed.
<P>
<H5>6.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Of course we understand the position of local authorities, but responses to Customs and Excise's review of the tax also showed that some local authorities 637 638 recognised that only increasing landfill prices will force the behavioural changes that we want. Most have called for a long-term strategy to help them plan ahead, which we have delivered through the Budget announcements, and which has been warmly welcomed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I am sorry to ask the Financial Secretary to give way yet again. I appreciate that local authorities need an incentive to minimise the amount of their waste that goes to landfill, but how much of that £22 million increase for local authorities will be reflected in an increased local government support grant settlement?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> That brings us back to the answer that I gave the right hon. Member for Charnwood (Mr. Dorrell). Of course we shall consider the impact of that, and of cash flows in relation to local government funding, in considering the appropriate rates. However, I am sure that the hon. Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown) will realise that pre-tax costs for active waste vary widely throughout the country, so it is difficult to do that. Nevertheless, it is important to provide the incentive.
<P>
I shall deal briefly with the points that the hon. Member for Cotswold made about revenue effects. His calculations are not right. The figure of £360 million net revenue was net of credits for contributions to the environmental bodies scheme. The figures in the Red Book are correct; £1 a year will raise £45 million on an indexed basis. Perhaps I could write to the hon. Gentleman, showing that breakdown, and send copies to other members of the Committee.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Fylde (Mr. Jack) mentioned alternative approaches. The Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions will shortly produce a document on a new national waste strategy for England and Wales, to tackle the current situation, and we shall certainly consider how to encourage recycling. Now is not the time to detail that strategy, but I am sure that the right hon. Gentleman will find the document interesting reading.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> I asked a series of questions arising from the Paymaster General's earlier comments. I asked why the Government had radically and completely changed their position on various aspects of the landfill tax, and I am disappointed that the Financial Secretary has not yet supplied answers to those questions.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> Only because the right hon. Gentleman stood up too quickly to speak again, and did not allow me to make that point, which I was about to do. Indeed, it was one of the points to which I especially wanted to reply.
<P>
I am afraid that despite the intensive reading that the right hon. Gentleman obviously does to prepare himself for the Committee, although he has read the good contribution made by my hon. Friend the Paymaster General when she was in opposition, he has not read in detail what the right hon. Member for Wells, the former Paymaster General, said. The eloquent arguments that the right hon. Member for Wells advanced were so persuasive that they persuaded my hon. Friend.
<P>
Had the right hon. Gentleman looked more closely, he would have seen that the amendment that my hon. Friend tabled then was as probing amendment. Unlike many of the amendments tabled to this Finance Bill, it was not put to the vote. I am glad to have the opportunity to say that we now have a listening, understanding Government who are prepared to listen to the arguments and respond. As part of our strategy, we have improved on the previous Government's dismal record on the environment. That is why that work will shortly be produced by my colleagues in the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions. We have had a good debate, and I commend the clause to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> I am afraid that I cannot let the Financial Secretary get away with another of her off-the-cuff, broad-brush bashes at me. She says that I have not read the contribution of my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells, but I did read it, and I ask her whether she has read column 171 of The Hansard report dated 23 January 1996. If she does, she will see that my right hon. Friend advanced a creditable argument in the context of what was suggested. When he mentioned the cost implications of the way in which the now Paymaster General's amendment was framed, she backed off. The then Opposition always backed off at that time, because they were so worried about any implication of racking up spending commitments prior to the general election that was to come only a year and a half later.
<P>
I have considered what my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells said, and I think that the Financial Secretary did not study his remarks with the care that I would have expected of her.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I agree with my right hon. Friend in that the Government have not built on our case. Perhaps I flatter myself when I say that we built a good solid basis for landfill tax at a modest level. Our criticism is that the Government have failed to defend the prospect of doubling the rate, when entirely different forces and consequences could arise.
<P>
The Labour Members who spoke in the debate agreed with the concept of a landfill tax. Again, that is rather flattering, and makes it all the more baffling that their party voted against the clause in the then Finance Bill when it was debated in Committee on the Floor of the House. They have clearly repented of their views and now recognise the value of trying to influence behaviour and move waste up the hierarchy from landfill to recycling--or, even better, to persuade people and industries to produce less waste in the first place.
<P>
That may work at a modest level, but it could break down and lead to undesirable consequences if a higher rate is charged. The Financial Secretary's response has increased our alarm on that score. We do not expect Labour Members instinctively to understand that taxes that work at a certain level can be overdone, because their basic political instinct is that all taxes are a good thing, on all people, at all times, everywhere.
<P>
We thought that the Government would have learnt the error of that during our debate on the hydrocarbon tax and road fuel duty. Clearly, taxes introduced at a modest level to achieve environmental benefits are now having detrimental effects, and are persuading hauliers to undertake unnecessary journeys to fill up with cheap fuel in other countries, thereby avoiding the tax altogether. The Treasury loses out, and it is also bad for the environment. That is a good example of an escalator leading to error.
<P>
The Government are making the same mistake on this subject. The Financial Secretary said, in response to my and my hon. Friends' queries about fly tipping, that there was no evidence that that had so far been a problem. That was only one of the questions that we asked; we also wanted to know whether studies had been done to anticipate what problems might arise. The Minister gave absolutely no reassurance on that. There is certainly plenty of anecdotal evidence from my constituency, where builders and firms that produce waste, some of it toxic, are beginning to say that they could absorb a lower rate of tax, which would give them an incentive to be environmentally responsible; at a higher rate, they feared that their less responsible competitors would simply start disposing of waste irresponsibly, to avoid a penal tax. They even say that they may be forced to follow suit, to preserve their competitiveness. We would have expected the Minister to bring forward a study or evidence, instead of simply asserting in a broadbrush way that there is no problem.
<P>
We are therefore minded to express our concerns by voting against the clause, particularly as the Minister could not satisfy us at all on the issue of where the revenue is to be applied. A business tax is at least partly justified if it offsets other business costs, reducing the cost of employing people. It is a simple economic, principle that if the cost of employment is reduced one can more people. That is our experience. However, the Minister suggested that a future climate change levy would be used to reduce national insurance contributions. The Government are in deep trouble on that because plenty of voices in the market say that if the Government introduce a climate change levy with that intention, businesses, particularly heavy energy users, will simply migrate abroad, to the detriment of the British economy and of the global economy. You will start twitching, Mr. Butterfill, if I go too far down that route, but it illustrates the danger of making too much of a good thing. A tax that works at £7 a tonne may not work at £15 a tonne. We have heard nothing to allay our suspicions, so unless the Minister now comes back with better and further assurances, we shall vote against the clause.

<P>

<B>Mr. John Whittingdale </B>(Maldon and East Chelmsford): I do not want to spend much time on the clause, but that does not mean that we do not have profound reservations about the increase in insurance premium tax. It is a stealth tax increase and a means by which the Chancellor can raise extra revenue. It will be extremely damaging.
<P>
I can do no better than quote the Institute of Directors' comments on the clause. It says
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"We deplore the increase in insurance premium tax. It will increase burdens on business and tempt some businesses to under--insure their assets. The rate of tax has now doubled since its introduction. The tax has clearly come to be regarded as an easy source of extra revenue, rather like tobacco duty. But adequate insurance is manifestly for the benefit of the insured; it should not be deterred by taxation."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I have no doubt that the Paymaster General will point out that the tax was originally introduced by the previous Government. I certainly make no bones about that. However, it is worth reading the debate that took place when the insurance premium tax was introduced. I am sorry that the Government Whip, the hon. Member for Coventry, North-East (Mr. Ainsworth), is not in his place, because before he took up his present post, he described the insurance premium tax as "appalling".
<P>
In a longer contribution on the previous clause, the Financial Secretary to the Treasury was good enough to pay tribute to my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells for the persuasive power of his argument, so I should also pay tribute to the hon. Lady for her speech on this topic at that time. She said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"My constituents--like those of every other hon. Member--will be hit by a tax on protecting themselves from crime: a tax on household insurance, as well as all the other types of insurance that the Bill will capture."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
She added:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"A tax on insurance is an unfair levy on the victims of crime. It is they who are too often forgotten when we discuss this matter. This tax is also likely to mean that some people will simply be unable to afford to insure their homes and cars, even if they are lucky enough to find a company willing to take the risk."--[Official Report, 1 February 1994; Vol. 236, c. 831-2.]
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not regale us with everyone's speech from that debate. There is a danger that he might include mine.
<P>
<B>Mr. Whittingdale:</B> I must say that I particularly enjoyed reading your speech, Mr. Butterfill. As ever, it was one of immense commonsense. If you will forgive me, however, I will not take the opportunity to read it out.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I was rather hoping that the hon. Gentleman would not read out too many more speeches. We do not want to rerun the debates of yesteryear.
<P>
<B>Mr. Whittingdale:</B> Of course I take your guidance, Mr. Butterfill--but I would like to quote one more speech, the remarkable contribution made by the now Secretary of State for Social Security, the right hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central (Mr. Darling). He said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The insurance tax is a tax on victims and will affect 16.5 million households."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
With extraordinary foresight, he went on to say:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The 3 per cent. rate will be just the beginning. Having introduced the principle, it will not be long before the Government increase the tax to 4, 5 and 6 per cent."--[Official Report, 1 February 1994; Vol. 236, c. 823.4.]
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Of course, he was absolutely right, although perhaps he did not realise that it would be his Government who increased the rate to 5 per cent. That was probably an early pledge that the rate will increase to 6 per cent. in future Budgets.
<P>
In opposition, the right hon. Gentleman also said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"It is an important matter ... The typical rates in other European countries are much higher than 2.5 per cent. and in the next Budget and ensuing Budgets, we shall be told from the Dispatch Box that the Government propose a modest increase--as they will no doubt call it--that is still below many of the rates charged in other European countries."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He may have been predicting the response that we shall hear shortly from the Government Benches. He went on
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"How much longer will it be before the Chancellor ... fiddles around with allowances and turns again and again to indirect taxes?"--[Official Report, Standing Committee A, 3 March 1994; c. 519.]
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That was an important question, because there is a genuine fear that the Government have identified the provision as an easy way in which to raise money, and that they will continue to increase insurance premium tax in forthcoming Budgets. The fact that it is currently below that which pertains in several other European countries may mean that the Government see it as a possible area in which to move in the direction of tax harmonisation, so there could be substantial increases in forthcoming Budgets.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Whittingdale:</B> I hope that the hon. Gentleman will forgive me if I do not give way. I shall not be much longer. Having voiced such powerful criticisms of the tax when it was introduced, the Government have now forgotten those objections and have decided instead to increase it by 25 per cent. Will the Paymaster General say whether it is the Government's intention to continue increasing the tax in future Budgets to bring it into line with the rates in other countries within the European Union?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I am delighted to be reminded of the former eloquence of my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary and my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Social Security, not that I ever doubted it. However, the hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford (Mr. Whittingdale) missed out some crucial points. Of course, my right hon. Friend's remarks were about IPT under the Conservative Government, when crime was increasing and not enough was being done to protect our communities. Certainly not enough was done to prevent crime.
<P>
In contrast, the present Government have put in place provisions to tackle the problem and make our communities safe. A statutory duty concerning crime prevention and safer community initiatives has been given to local authorities. I made those remarks in defence of the honour--not that it needs to be defended--of --my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary, and also that of my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary, who has done much work with the social exclusion unit in examining lack of insurance cover and the problems that must be faced. Opposition Members give us only half the argument when they talk about crime and security in our community.
<P>
As the hon. Gentleman rightly said, the clause will increase the standard rate of insurance premium tax from 4 per cent. to 5 per cent. with effect from 1 July 1999. He slipped into his contribution the fact that it was the previous Government who introduced the tax, and also the higher rate of 17.5 per cent. to combat value shifting, especially on supplies of holidays, cars and household appliances. Opposition Members are well versed in the virtues of IPT and why it was introduced.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman said that IPT had something to do with the EU, and was a wicked plot to introduce tax harmonisation. Insurance premium tax is a UK tax, not a European tax. There are no common rules for IPT as there are for value added tax. Rates vary tremendously across Europe, but they are significantly higher than in the UK, which has one of the lowest rates.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman also asked whether the proposal was part of the plan to increase steadily the IPT rate. The increase does not signal a future change. The previous Government introduced the tax in 1994 to raise revenue from a sector that had relatively low indirect tax. That has stood the test of time. The Government have made a clear choice about their revenue. We have been open in the application of the increase, which raises the money that the Treasury needs to invest in our education and health services and to provide safer communities.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 115 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 116</center></H4>
<H4><center>Interest on unpaid customs debts</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Whittingdale:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 253, in page 80, line 10, leave out from "regulations" to end of line 12 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"no such interest shall be payable.".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>

<P>
This is is a small amendment. The clause introduces a charge of interest on the late payment of duty. A minimum amount of interest will be chargeable even if the actual amount of interest is less. Most taxes in this country have a provision attached to them which states that if interest is below a de minimis amount, it will not be collected, usually because the cost of collection outweighs the benefits. However, under this clause, interest will be charged at the minimum amount, no matter how small that may be. The amendment would bring the clause in line with the provision that applies to most other taxes so that if the amount of chargeable interest is below the minimum threshold, it will not be payable.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> As the hon. Gentleman said, the clause will enable the UK to comply with European legislation. The Community customs code provides that interest at a commercial rate is to be charged on customs duties that are not paid by the due date. I am sure that the Committee will accept that the imposition of interest to encourage business to pay duties that it might otherwise fail to pay is the right way forward. The amendment would prevent us from embodying in our legislation that obligation, which is in the Community customs code.
<P>
The hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford asked whether there will be a de minimis limit. That is not included in the Bill. Article 232(3) of the European Community customs code permits the introduction of a minimum amount payable as interest on arrears. Customs intends to have a minimum amount payable by business, which will be fixed at £25. That figure represents the cost of billing and accounting for the interest. As the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford implies, the pursuit of lesser interest amounts would constitute a waste of resources. That will be informed in Customs notices, and Customs and Excise will operate the clause on that basis. Therefore, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept that a reasonable de minimis level has been set, and withdraw the amendment. That will ensure that we comply with the European requirements. None the less, he makes an important point in saying that we must not waste resources by pursuing small amounts of arrears.

<P>

<B>Mr. Whittingdale:</B> I am grateful for that clarification from the Paymaster General. We remain disappointed that the charge will be paid at the minimum level, although it would be ridiculous to collect very small sums where the cost of doing so would be greater. In those circumstances, we would prefer that such sums were not collected. However, I understand the Paymaster General's explanation, and I therefore beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<H4><center>Interest on repayments</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Whittingdale:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 226, in page 81, line 15, leave out "sixty-first" and insert "thirty-first".
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss amendment No. 227, in page 81, line 37, leave out "sixty-first" and insert "thirty-first".
<P>
<B>Mr. Whittingdale:</B> The clause rightly gives to those who are due repayments of customs duty the opportunity to collect interest where repayments are delayed. However, the supplement will begin 60 days after the receipt of a claim, which seems a long time. According to the explanatory notes,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Although subsection (3) sets the time-limit at 61 days, the Commissioners have it in mind to specify a shorter period".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Government said that they want a shorter period, and our amendment will help by specifying a period of 30 calendar days.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> This clause provides for entitlement to interest where a valid claim for repayment of duty has not been met by Customs and Excise within a set time limit. It mirrors the preceding clause, and reflects the Government's commitment to commercial restitution for late payment of bills on the Government's part. The Government are reviewing the time limits--the point at which interest will be paid--to which we are committed in our service first standards charter mark. Currently, Customs responds within 30 working days.
<P>
Although I accept the sentiments behind the amendment, I shall resist it, but I would prefer that the hon. Gentleman withdraw it if he agrees with the points that I am about to make. Although the review is continuing, we have a commitment to standards that we could reflect. The amendment would reduce the time limit available for Customs to handle claims to approximately 22 working days. Here, there is a difference of expression: we describe our standard as 30 working days, but the hon. Gentleman speaks of 30 calendar days. As he will appreciate, that period would reduce the number of working days. The Government could not give a commitment to go further than we already have. Thirty working days would, in practice, become 41 calendar days. Given that our objectives on this matter are the same, and that we do not wish to delay the Committee's proceedings, I would like to ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment, on the understanding that the Government will align on the 30 working days. That would solve the hon. Gentleman's problem with the 60-day figure in the clause, and would enable the Committee to accept the clause while acknowledging the point that he made.
<P>
<B>Mr. Whittingdale:</B> I am most grateful to the Paymaster General for her helpful response. Given that she has asked us so nicely to withdraw the amendment, it would be churlish to refuse. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
