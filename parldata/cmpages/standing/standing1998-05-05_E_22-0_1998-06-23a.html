<P>
and insert `affirmative'.--[Mr. Heathcoat-Amory.]
<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory </B>(Wells): In your temporary absence, Mrs. Dunwoody, we were debating clause 158, and in particular our amendment to it. That amendment seeks to ensure that regulations promulgated under the clause would at least be considered by the House under the affirmative resolution procedure.
<P>
I hope to explain the importance of the matter by indulging in a bit of history. Previous Parliaments have been worried by the use of secondary legislation, in particular the use of so-called Henry VIII clauses, which empower the Government to use secondary legislation to amend or repeal primary legislation. Clause 158 is practically a definition of such a clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ross Cranston </B>(Dudley, North): I asked the right hon. Gentleman a question on the Floor of the House, which he avoided answering. Did he vote for the previous Government's deregulation legislation, which was replete with Henry VIII clauses? Will he now answer that question directly?
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I am glad that the hon. Gentleman is conforming to type, in that he is being helpful. Through you, Mrs. Dunwoody, I can promise the hon. Gentleman that I shall shortly give a straight answer to that very question, which proves our point and which is unintentionally helpful to our case.
<P>
The Donoughmore committee report of 1932, which considered the question of Henry VIII clauses, found that nine Acts of Parliament introduced between 1888 and 1929 contained such clauses. Interestingly, those clauses were transitory provisions designed to help bring the Acts into operation, and they were therefore time limited. The Donoughmore committee said that a case could be argued for the occasional use of Henry VIII clauses in that way. However, the committee concluded that that use must be demonstrably essential, and justified on each occasion by the Minister ``to the hilt''. The committee also concluded that such clauses should be purely machinery arrangements intended to bring the legislation into effect. The committee further concluded they should be time limited clauses that would endure for a maximum of one year after the bringing into effect of the relevant primary legislation.
<P>
The report seemed to have the desired effect. The use of Henry VIII clauses ceased completely until the war years, when the special conditions that applied to wartime legislation brought the use of secondary legislation once more to the fore. After the war, the increased use of such legislation caught the House's attention, particularly during the 1970s and 1980s. No doubt when the Paymaster General replies to the debate, he will give examples of where both Conservative and Labour Governments have used Henry VIII clauses. I remind him that the previous Conservative Government were responsive to criticisms. The Library has helpfully given me a list of examples where such clauses were deleted or reconsidered by the Government, in particular, the Statutory Sick Pay Bill 1990, the Local Government Bill 1992 and the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Bill 1992. Moreover, when the undesirable increase in the practice was pointed out to the Government, the Lord Chancellor said in 1992 that in future he would ensure that the affirmative resolution procedure would normally be used for all orders of this kind. I invite the Paymaster General to give a similar assurance.
<P>
The hon. Member for Dudley, North (Mr. Cranston) mentioned the Deregulation and Contracting Out Bill. That Bill was special because it took specific powers to do a specific job, which was to relieve burdens on business by amending legislation. Unlike clause 158, it ensured that all such orders would be passed by an affirmative vote of both Houses of Parliament. If the hon. Gentleman cannot see that difference, he cannot understand the purpose of our amendment.
<P>
The Deregulation and Contracting Out Bill also set down a requirement to consult interested parties. That too is absent from the clause. More importantly, the draft orders that gave effect to the deregulation measures had to go before two specialist Committees--one in another place and one in this House. Detailed procedures were set out for the laying of the orders before Parliament for a minimum length of time. That specific change in procedure was in addition to a requirement that there should be a positive vote in Parliament before the orders should take effect. That explanation disposes of the hon. Gentleman's point.
<P>
The main issue is whether it is appropriate to use Henry VIII clauses for financial matters which go to the heart of what Parliament is here to do. We observed in previous debates that Parliament obtained powers over taxation only after a long struggle in the 17th century. We should not give them away without clear justification.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick Gibb </B>(Bognor Regis and Littlehampton): Is my right hon. Friend aware of any instance in the past where statutory instruments have decided the rate of tax, as in clause 87?
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> My hon. Friend makes a good point. He will know that the Law Society and other professional bodies have written to the Government making precisely that point. We are all used to secondary legislation setting up the mechanics of taxation, but for it to decide the rate of tax takes us further. Ministers have tried to defend their use of secondary legislation by giving the number of instances when it has been or would be used, but we are discussing a step change that takes us into new areas. This is a qualitative rather than quantitative change. Indeed, the use of secondary legislation in the clause was described by the Law Society as unprecedented. I want the Paymaster General specifically to address the issue of taxation and financial legislation.
<P>
The 12th edition of a book called ``Constitutional and administrative law'' by Bradley and Ewing contains a chapter that is devoted to delegated legislation, and it refers to the delegation of taxing powers. It says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``We have seen how vital to the development of parliamentary government was the insistence that Parliament alone could authorise taxation.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It goes on to observe that modern pressures and the nature of modern government have made it necessary for Parliament to delegate some of those taxing powers to Governments. It refers in particular to the working of customs duties and the fact that since 1961 the Government have had the power to vary certain classes of indirect taxation by order of the Treasury. It asserts that each of those powers is subject to parliamentary control in that audit-imposing import duties or those that vary indirect taxation cease to have effect unless they are confirmed by a resolution of the House of Commons within a limited time. That authoritative study reminds us that the affirmative resolution procedure is, and always should be, used in relation to matters of taxation.
<P>
The clause contains no such provision, which is a serious matter. Only the house has those taxing powers. Other statutory instruments are also debated in another place, which has, in some ways, a superior procedure for sifting and sorting statutory instruments and for debating the necessary ones. However, dealing with statutory instruments relating to taxation is a privilege of the House of Commons alone--the entire procedure takes place here, and they cannot be stopped in another place.
<P>
Pages 585 and 586 of Erskine May make it clear that under the negative procedure those statutory instruments are almost never debated or scrutinised in any way. They are referred to a Committee only at a Minister's discretion. If that Committee refuses to take note of them, they can still be passed on the Floor of the House without debate, again at a Minister's discretion. There is no procedure whatsoever for ensuring that Back Bench Members of Parliament have an opportunity to scrutinise or debate them. The fact that they can be debated only in the House means that Parliament as a whole will never debate them.
<P>
Another feature of secondary legislation is that it cannot be amended--statutory instruments relating to taxation are unamendable. There is a glaring gap in the Bill, in which the Government state--no doubt for good intentions--that matters of taxation that are consequential on the introduction of the euro will never be properly scrutinised. We will never debate such matters relating to direct taxation, income tax, capital gains tax or corporation tax--the whole raft of direct taxation--although doing so goes to the core of our duties and responsibilities.
<P>
Doubtless, the Government will say that the proposals are necessary and that their intention is that there should be no abuse of the powers.
<P>
However, intentions are temporary and transitory, and we are legislating for the long term. Therefore, this is an opportunity to ensure, at the very least, that these matters are scrutinised under the affirmative resolution procedure. I would like the Paymaster General to approach the matter in a slightly less blustering way and to concede as did the previous Conservative Lord Chancellor, that there is an issue here. He believed that all important measures, even outside the field of taxation, should be passed under the affirmative resolution procedure. That would ensure that, however inadequate our procedures may be, there would be an opportunity for Members of Parliament to scrutinise matters of taxation.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. John Burnett </B>(Torridge and West Devon): Clause 158(4)(a) gives the Government carte blanche power,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``to impose charges to taxation''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That power is subject to regulations made under the negative resolution procedure. We object strongly to the arbitrary and inadequate procedure that is proposed for the regulations. As Members of Parliament, we are here not least to safeguard the public against the excesses of the Executive. The clause is deeply objectionable and constitutionally flawed as it delegates to the Treasury power to impose a charge to tax. The regulations should be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure, and we strongly support the amendment.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> I call Mr. St. Aubyn. [Interruption.]
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick St. Aubyn </B>(Guildford): I rise by popular acclaim to support the proposal of my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory). One theme that runs through the Bill is that the Government are so afraid of the House of Commons that they are trying to take more and more decisions away from it--whether that is in the Treasury or other favourite spots that the Treasury team likes to visit.
<P>
The scope of clause 158 is so wide that if we do not provide the restraint that the matter must be justified on the Floor of the House, there is no knowing how far it may go. In his reply to the debate, the Paymaster General could do some service to the Committee by spelling out the precise limitations on the exercise of powers under clause 158.
<P>
There has been much discussion in the press recently about the proposal for a European-wide withholding tax on bond interest payments. There is an argument coming from Europe that that may become part of the framework in which the new euro currency will be introduced. I should like to explain to the Committee how the proposal for a withholding tax could be introduced, through clause 158, without any further reference to the House of Commons. If that were to happen, I believe that the consequences for our economy, particularly for our vital interests in finance and in the City, would be seriously affected.
<P>
We know that the Chancellor has expressed his resistance to a European-wide withholding tax, but that is not to say that he will not concede the point. The clause says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Treasury. . .as appears to them appropriate''--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Treasury does not even have to be reasonable on the matter--it may modify the tax rules regarding,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``transactions in a currency other than sterling''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Clearly, that would apply to every other currency in the world and if sterling were to be replaced by the euro, it would apply also to the currency that was introduced in this country. Therefore, the scope of clause 158 is very wide.
<P>
I am worried by the reference in clause 158(2)(b) to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``any transitional measures or other arrangements applying or likely to apply in relation to the adoption of the single currency by other member States.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Under that provision, the Govenment might claim that it would be appropriate--however unreasonable we might regard it--to introduce such a withholding tax on bonds. The effect, in many ways, would be to undermine, if not destroy, London as a major financial centre. The introduction of a withholding tax on bonds in the United States in the 1960s led to the development of an offshore Eurodollar market in London, which was the foundation of the post-war growth and success of the London financial markets. There would be a deep irony if the introduction of such a measure were to cost our financial services industry as much in the future as it has benefited in the past from such mistakes in other countries.
<P>
The Paymaster General may tell us that he has no intention of using clause 157 in such a way. Will he spell out categorically that under no circumstances will any kind of withholding tax on any interest payments on any bonds traded in London be introduced as a result of this clause? Otherwise, even though the Chancellor has signalled his opposition to the measure and every shade of City opinion has joined in a chorus of disapproval--which has been reported in the press--of how misguided such a measure would be, it could be introduced. The introduction of valued added tax on art sales is a claissic example of how a tax measure that has little effect on other European countries, as their markets are so small, but will have a catastrophic effect on the London market, can be forced through. In the opinion of many commentators, the tax will push the international art market out of London to New York, and it is regrettable that nothing in the Finance Bill will mitigate that threat.
<P>
If one major London market--the art market--can be subject to such a threat, we must be alive to the fact that this other misconceived European tax poses a similar threat to the London financial market. There is a determination in Europe to introduce the tax, and a residual fear that, even though the Chancellor is currently against it, he may be forced to introduce it. Such a withholding tax might be the price of his sacred project of entering the euro at some point in the future. Under clause 158, the Chancellor will be able to introduce the measure without any further reference to the House of Commons. We therefore need a specific assurance from the Paymaster General.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cranston:</B> I did not intend to speak but I want to assure you, Mrs. Dunwoody, that the sky will not fall in as a result of clause 158. You will already have read clause 158 and will know that it is a modest provision. The suggestion of Opposition Members are to be taken with a grain of salt.
<P>
The tax applies only to the adoption by other member states of the single currency. It has nothing to do with this country's adoption of the single currency or euro. Subsection (1) makes it clear that the provision is designed only to ``modify'' legislation or regulations that refer to transactions in a non-sterling currency. It has nothing to do with introducing withholding taxes; it is a modest provision. We need not expect the sky to fall in.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I call Mr. Robinson--on the sky falling in.
<P>
<B>The Paymaster General </B>(Mr. Geoffrey Robinson): Yes, on the sky falling in. My hon. Friend is correct. We should not have to debate this measure because clause 158 concerns only the introduction of the single currency in other member states.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> No. The clause could not be used to implement the draft directive on savings. That is the end of the matter. We cannot take it further. On the other hand, the Finance Act 1996 contains provisions to amend primary legislation using subordinate powers exercisable on negative resolution procedure. How does the right hon. Member for Wells, who was a distinguished member of the Government who introduced that Act--he may even have been my predecessor--have the gall to come here and lecture us on things that he was happy to go along with?
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> No. I will go on.
<P>
The right hon. Gentleman is a man of detail, so I shall give them to him slowly so that he may write them down. Sections 12(6), 65--he is not taking this down; he does not want to know.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order, Clearly please.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> It is too painful for the right hon. Gentleman.
<P>
Sections 65(6), 110, 151, 168(3), 202(5) and (6), paragraph 17 of schedule 15, new section 329AB of schedule 26 and new section 444BB of schedule 32 contain those powers, but I would have to check that with Hansard.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I will give way in a minute. [Hon. Members: ``Give way.''] The right hon. Gentleman's Government was party to nine separate powers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> Goodness gracious me. I will give way to the right hon. Gentleman. He does not want to hear what I have to say because he does not like it. He stands now because he was not happy in government. He could not settle. Eventually he wrote a pamphlet and resigned. Those are the facts. Have I said anything wrong? Was the right hon. Gentleman happy in that Government? No. Why did he resign? Because he was unhappy. That government introduced measures which he is saying were bad. I do not think that they were bad. That was government. It little behoves the right hon. Gentleman to raise them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> It would have saved us a lot of time had the Paymaster General listened to my earlier points. It is not the number of clauses that he can read out that interests us, but the type, quantity and scope of the powers contained within them. I would be grateful if he would return to my first point. The clause gives the Government ``The power to make regulations'' and ``to amend or repeal any enactment'' to do with any direct taxes. Will he concern himself with the points that we have raised rather than those that he would have liked us to have raised?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> You make--[Interruption.] Not you, Mrs. Dunwoody, because you make far better points. The right hon. Gentleman made those points. I do not see why I should depart from them. Was not he a distinguished member of the Government who introduced the Finance Act 1996? Was not he Paymaster General? The Act contains provisions, each of which confers power to amend primary legislation, to use subordinate powers that are exercisable on negative resolution, and I listed some examples. That is what the right hon. Gentleman does not like to hear. If there is anything to be ashamed of in that record, he should be ashamed of it--he should reach a judgment on that. Those are exactly the same--
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> No they are not.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> Yes they are. The right hon. Gentleman does not accept the responsibility that he accepted then. Our approach is a perfectly normal way to arrange affairs and a perfectly normal proposal in a Finance Bill.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The whole issue of secondary legislation has been shown to be totally irrelevant. The young Member for--No, I should not say that. I withdraw it. The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb) should try to understand how Governments enact legislation and what they have to do to push through a radical, reforming Budget. Certain things have to be done in the way that we are doing them.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Wells raised two other points. He said that there was no time limit to the power, but new minor difficulties could emerge after the single currency is introduced. Moreover, in 1996 the Conservative Government introduced regulations that did not include a time limit.
<P>
I do not want the Committee to think that I am trying to restrict, undermine or contain Parliament's powers--on the contrary; I have the greatest concern for Parliament's powers. However, it is hard to pass much technical legislation using the House's procedures. A broad area of legislation, which includes financial and technical legislation, should be dealt with by regulation.
<P>
I must read a quote to the right hon. Member for Wells:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the clause would give the Treasury the power to make further regulations. The regulations are extensive: they will impose a charge in relation to income tax, corporation tax, capital gains tax, inheritance tax and stamp duty--you name it, it is in the clause. We should of course be careful about giving a Secretary of State the power to raise taxes without making reference to primary legislation''.--[Official Report, Standing Committee E, 5 March 1996; c. 710.]
<P>
</UL></FONT>If the right hon. Member for Wells is on his toes, he will realise that those are the words of my right hon. Friend the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, during the Committee stage of the Finance Bill in 1996. The Government and the Opposition have the same concerns. The Economic Secretary at the time was the then hon. Member for Erewash, Mrs. Angela Knight. Her reply is instructive. If the right hon. Member remembered that debate, he would appreciate that we have discussed this issue so many times over the years that to try to make out that one Government rather than another are abusing powers is so trite as to be unworthy of the Committee's time.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> That is what I said.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> Let me go on, then, if I may.
<P>
If we are concurring on the approach to the matter, I cannont imagine why the right hon. Gentleman moved the amendment. However, that is up to him.
<P>
The then Economic Secretary said that the wide-ranging power was needed because a wide variety of legislation might require consequential amendment to accommodate the existence of gift strips. However, the previous Government were not sure what reforms were needed, so they had therefore chosen a route whereby consultation could first take place with markets and with relevant experts in order to ensure that every necessary case was covered. That is the point that I have been making to the committee throughout its deliberations.
<P>
With regard to the question of charges to tax, the then Economic Secretary also said that the regulations could have the incidental effect of imposing a charge to tax, and that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``That is why the phrase has been included.''--[Official Report, Standing Committee E, 5 March 1996; c. 711.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is a fulsome and complete answer to the right hon. Member for Wells. I doubt whether even he believes in the amendment. It is of a kind that we have seen often--a kind that the Opposition will no doubt continue to table for the sake of having to do something. If he were to put it to a vote, we would not accept it.
<P>
<B>Mr Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I do not know if the Paymaster General was listening to our comments. Had he listened carefully, he would have heard me refer to Conservative Governments who made use of those powers. His drawing attention to some of the provisions used by past Governments is a non point, because it is one that I had already conceded. I even read out some Acts of Parliament in which those provisions appeared under all Governments.
<P>
Instead of trying to score party political points, the Paymaster General should have addressed the issue of the extension of those powers in an unqualified way. I cannot imagine a wider provision than that which appears in clause 158(4), where
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The power to make regulations...includes...power to impose charges to taxation''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That power is not in any way qualified. The clause also includes the
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``power to amend or repeal any enactment''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That power is also not confined in any way. The clause further includes the
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``power to make such incidental, supplemental, consequential and transitional provision as appears to the Treasury to be appropriate.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Our amendment would ensure that the power to make such regulations is covered by the affirmative procedure.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman said that the clause is designed to deal with the ``few minor difficulties'' that would follow the introduction of the single currency. If he had anticipated an avalanche of highly technical problems, adherence to the procedures that he has laid down might be appropriate. However, if the problems are to be few and minor, what is the objection to subjecting them to the affirmative procedure? What are the Government afraid of?
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I wonder whether the right hon. Gentleman recalls the points made by the hon. Member for Dudley, North. I also draw his attention to the phrase ``likely to apply'', which is contained in clause 158(2)(b). What is ``likely to apply''? In the light of those words, does the right hon. Gentleman believe that the powers are very limited?
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> Yes, indeed--the hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. The entire clause is hopelessly vague and hopelessly wide. The Government could pray in aid those words to justify virtually anything. The hon. Member for Dudley, North tried to defend the provision by saying that it will apply only to the adoption of the single currency by other countries. We know that that is happening. That is no form of restriction whatsoever; in fact, it further broadens the scope of the clause.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Guildford (Mr. St. Aubyn) spoke earlier about the withholding tax. He pointed out that it is known that the Commission and several other member states wish to introduce a controversial measure. Doubtless, they want to get their directive through, but one can easily imagine a situation in which the single currency goes wrong--perhaps because there is a run on the euro--and the Commission or the mysterious Euro x committee, from which we are excluded, introduces emergency tax measures in order to, as it would see it, secure the position of the euro. Wishing to be influential, the British Government could say, ``We may not be in that committee, but we want to adopt similar provisions because we have agreed in principle to introduce the euro, so it is right that these tax provisions should be adopted by the United Kingdom. Yes, the decision is controversial because the provisions may damage the position of the City of London, but, in our view, the objections are overridden.'' Then, their officials will say, ``There is no problem with the provisions being controversial because they need not be debated at all. Minister, if you revisit clause 158, you will see that anything consequential on, or associated with, the introduction of the euro can be used to alter direct taxes without the need for Parliament to debate the matter, which can be dealt with by negative resolution.'' The Minister will then say, ``But surely matters of tax should at least be debated'' and the official's advice will be, ``That may be the convention, but that is not what the Finance Act requires''.
<P>
The withholding tax or a tax designed to penalise institutions that indulge in what we might call speculative flows of capital could be brought in by the back door. I have hardly begun to imagine the situations that could arise. How does the Paymaster General know that there will be only a few minor difficulties? It is generally thought, certainly by the German Government, that the only hope of monetary union working is for it to be associated with economic union. That is why EMU stands for economic and monetary union. Most economists agree with the proposition that a single currency requires some sort of single government with some sort of taxation powers to make it work. Then there must be a means of enforcing those taxes. What more convenient way is there of doing that than through clause 158? It is easy to think of examples of how the introduction of the euro by other member states, even without our participation, could be used to justify all sorts of fiscal changes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies </B>(Croydon, Central): Is the right hon. Gentleman suggesting that clause 158 acutally constitutes the introduction of a single government in Europe?
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> No. I am not suggesting that. I know that there are rules against repetition, but I shall answer that point by saying that most economists believe that a single currency, such as the dollar in the United State, requires a government or an organisation with similar powers in order to make the currency work and to facilitate cash flows between one system and another. That is not only my view but the view of the Commission in 1977 when it received the MacDougall report, which asserted that a single currency would require a federal budget with federal powers if it were to succeed.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I do not want to interrupt the right hon. Gentleman because this is an important debate, but if right hon. and hon. Members could break the habit of a lifetime and face the Chair rather than their own supporters, it might make the record of the Committee a little clearer.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I apologise, Mrs. Dunwoody. I was trying to address the hon. Member for Croydon, Central (Mr. Davies) on this occasion. I shall not be drawn any further down that road. I want simply to reassert that, at the very least, the introduction of the euro has tax implications. That is such an obvious point that even the Paymaster General will not be able to bluster his way out of it. The issue is whether it would be appropriate to use clause 158 to implement fiscal adjustments or changes that are consequential on the euro. Opposition Members--I include members of parties other than the Conservative party--believe that such fiscal matters should be properly scrutinised and debated. The clause does not allow for that, but our amendment does. We will therefore press the amendment to a Division.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I do not wish to be unneighbourly to the paymaster General--who waved at me across the Committee Room when we began our proceedings this morning--but I prefer the sober analysis of my right hon. Friend to his convivial blandishments. Indeed, whereas my right hon. Friend has clearly drawn on the wisdom of the previous Conservative Lord Chancellor, there were times when I thought that the Paymaster General has been drawing on the cellar of the present Lord Chancellor.
<P>
The fact that this clause relates to the adoption of a single currency by other member states means that it can be used by the Government whether or not we join. It can be used not only if other member states join and we do not, but irrespective of whether we join. Any assurance from the Paymaster General that the clause cannot be used in respect of any witholding tax on bonds must be written in stone.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson:</B> I do not think that the right hon. Member for Wells added anything to our debate, and--with great respect--I do not think that there is a great deal more to be said.
<P>
The Finance Act 1996 provided nine separate powers, which the Conservative Government took and which Conservative Members are now criticising us for taking. As wide as those powers may seem, we cannot anticipate everything that will happen; it is better to have wide powers than to have to take further ones. I believe that we have got it about right. Clause 158, despite and without the amendment, provides the necessary powers for the job.
<P>
The right hon. Members for Wells is being over-punctilious. He is obsessed with Europe--he cannot do anything but talk about Europe; it is all he ever wants to talk about. He resigned from his Government on the issue of Europe and wrote a pamphlet on Europe. He quite recently wrote a rather better pamphlet, which I applaud and endorse, on auction houses and their great importance to the City of London. I cannot applaud or endorse his other pamphlet, his resignation from the Government or his obsession with Europe.
<P>
The measures in the clause are perfectly adequate. I commend the clause to the Committee.

<P>

<B>Mr. Philip Hammond </B>(Runnymede and Weybridge): My right hon. Friend the Member for Wells eloquently described the Opposition's constitutional concerns about the clause, but I want to raise a slightly different point about it.
<P>
Subsection (3) will allow for the discharge of liabilities to the Inland Revenue in respect of tax to be made
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``by payments in the single currency''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That presupposes a situation in which the single currency is in operation in some parts of the European Union, but not in the United Kingdom. Why do the Government want to introduce that power?
<P>
One of the first duties of a Government is to protect the Revenue. Debts to the Revenue in respect of tax can currently be discharged only by payment in sterling. I see no logical reason behind the Government's proposal--allowing for the discharge of those debts in an alternative currency would not enhance or protect the Revenue. We do not allow American companies to discharge obligations to the Inland Revenue in United States dollars and we do not allow German companies to do so in deutschmarks. No company that operates in a single-currency environment--in an all-sterling environment--would suddenly allow its creditors to discharge debts to it in a second currency if that brought no advantage to itself. To do so would expose it to a currency risk to which it does not need to be exposed.
<P>
I imagine that the Government are introducing the provision for dogmatic reasons--they want to send signal about the operation of the European single currency in other member states. They appear to be prepared to jeopardise the Revenue and the United Kingdom's financial stability in order to make a political point.
<P>
How will the proposal work in practice? Will ordinary UK citizens be able to take advantage of the measure if they see a window of opportunity and the possibility of reducing the amount of tax payable by paying in a currency other than sterling? Will the proposal be limited to companies that are based outside the United Kingdom but which have tax liabilities here? Can the Paymaster General explain rationally why, from the Inland Revenue's point of view, the measure is necessary as an exercise in protecting and enhancing revenue? Can he assure us that it is not merely a piece of window dressing or gesture politics but a substantial measure which is needed for the efficient collection of revenue?
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I should like the Paymaster General to clarify subseciton (1). The words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``to such extent as appears to them appropriate''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
gives the Treasury almost unfettered discretion in the exercise of its powers. Will he confirm that the Treasury must at all times act reasonably in the exercise of its powers under the clause and that it would be subject to the process of the law and judicial review if it were to exercise those powers unreasonably?
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson:</B> I am sure the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge knows that we already accept payment of tax in foreign currencies. I think that we accept 300 different currencies. I cannot imagine why we would want to make an exception for the euro because it will be a major European currency.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I will give way in a minute. Why does the hon. Gentleman think that we should not accept the euro as a valid currency for settlement of Inland Revenue bills?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I thank the Paymaster General for that. Under what provisons does the Inland Revenue accept payment in foreign currency? If the provisions are broad and permissive, why is the measure required?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> It is always better to be clear. We are dealing with a new currency that will be used for our major trading partners. I do not see why it should not be specified. We export 60 per cent. of our goods to the European Union. The euro should be regarded as an important, although not exceptional, currency that we should nominate.
<P>
The currency risk is borne by the taxpayer. There is no problem there. The Inland Revenue converts the payment into sterling and credits the taxpayer with net receipts after bank charges. That narrow and fair point was raised by the hon. Member for Guildford, and I have given a clear answer to it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The Paymaster General may be helping me to deal with the problem that is at the back of my mind. If he is merely telling us that the Inland Revenue will accept payments in the single currency as a foreign currency which will be converted to sterling and the sterling equivalent amount will be treated as partial discharge of the liability, then I have no problem. However, I was afraid that the Government were paving the way for acceptance of euro payments to discharge liabilities which might be calculated in euros. For example, if a company were to draw up accounts in euros, would it be able to make its own tax computation under self-assessment in euros and then discharge it in euros? The key difference is whether the euro in those circumstances would be regarded as a foreign currency or as having a special status that is different from other foreign currencies.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> It is a technical point. I am happy to help the hon. Gentleman if it is of real concern to him. We are still considering the details of accepting payment in euros, but tax returns will be in sterling.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael Fallon </B>(Sevenoaks): The mystery about subsection (3) deepens. Will the Paymaster General explain the phrase,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``to be capable of being discharged''?<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Does it mean that, one day, the Treasury might prescribe that, for certain classes of companies, those liabilities must be discharged in the single currency?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I do not think that I wish to anticipate what the Treasury and the Inland Revenue might decide. We are considering the details. I am sorry that I cannot take the hon. Member for Sevenoaks (Mr. Fallon) further than that, but if he listens carefully, he will undertand that that is a reasonable position. I am still considering the details of accepting payment in euros but, for the moment, tax returns will be in sterling.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> For the moment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> Yes, for the moment. That is a reasonable position. We all know about the Opposition. They do not have a policy. They do not know whether they want to go into Europe now, never, sometime soon, in the lifetime of this Parliament, or in 10 years' time. Who are we to take lectures from the Opposition on our entirely pragmatic, sensible position?
<P>
<B>Mr. Barry Gardiner </B>(Brent, North): Will my hon. Friend confirm for the avoidance of doubt that the 39 tonnes of parking revenues held by the city of New York in South American currency would not be acceptable to the Paymaster General under the clause?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I can accept that.--[Interruption.] At least my hon. Friend is coherent, sensible and knows what he is doing. Let me add one further element of clarification into the confused mess of the Opposition's mind on the euro. We will not compel people to pay in euros; we are simply trying to help business. The Opposition are not interested in, and do not care about, business.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Is the Paymaster General giving way? I cannot have two hon. Members on their feet at the same time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I give way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I thank the Paymaster General for giving way. While we are all enjoying his ebullient performance, I have to tell him that he is not making himself clear. I thought that in his initial answer to my question, he was giving me a clear and specific answer, but he then went on to say that the Treasury was still considering the matter of tax payment in euros and that corporation tax and income tax returns would be made, for the moment, in sterling. Is the Paymaster General now withdrawing from the psoition that he stated in his initial reply to me or can we be assured that the Inland Revenue will treat the euro as it treats the US dollar and as it currently treats the deutschmark--as a foreign currency which must be converted to sterling to satisfy Revenue debts?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I do not think--[Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The Minister must reply.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I will reply.
<P>
We are concerned with administrative details. The banks are still considering how they will handle the euro. We shall probably try to have as much settlement in euros as we can, but we cannot commit to that at the moment. We have clearly said that we will not compel people to pay in euros; we are simply trying to help. If major trading companies, such as Marks and Spencer, Rover--I do not know what Glaxo has said so I shall reserve its position--and SmithKline Beecham have made it clear that they would like to deal in euros, of course we will accept euros as far as we can, but there will be no compulsion.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. If hon. Members want to intervene, they must rise to their feet. The Chair has given up trying to divine what is in the minds of hon. Members.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I can well sympathise with you, Mrs. Dunwoody, especially this morning. I hesitated to rise because the Paymaster General has yet to answer the point that I raised. In his answer to my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge, he just said that the Government would want to encourage as much payment in euros as possible. Will he explain the implications of that? What about the currency risks to the Government of payments being made in euros when all their other obligations are in sterling? How can that possibly be in the interests of the British tax system?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> When people want to settle in euros, they will be encouraged to do so. If it suits their business, of course they will do that. The Opposition are showing their europhobia. If companies wish to use euros--and I understand that most, or at least some, of the supermarkets wish to do so--of course, they have our best wishes.

<P>

<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> Wait one second. There was another question, I think from the hon. Gentleman, about whether the Treasury would be subject to the constraints of judicial review. Yes, these powers, like all powers to make subordinate legislation, will be subject to the control of the courts. The principles on which the courts judicially review subordinate legislation will apply. They include consideration of what is reasonable.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Can the Paymaster General say whatever he wishes to say loudly and clearly?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I will. I will say it to you, Mrs. Dunwoody.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am honoured and overwhelmed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I would not expect to be able to achieve that sense of superiority.
<P>
The Tory Opposition are totally in defence on the euro. They hate it and are split down the middle because of it--
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Will the Paymaster General give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> No, not for a moment. The hon. Gentleman cannot interrupt when I am making a serious criticism of the Opposition that is relevant to the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> No, absolutely not--the insolence. [Laughter.]
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> On a point of order, Mrs. Dunwoody. Is it in order for the Paymaster General to describe another hon. Member as insolent?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am sure that the Paymaster General can think of a more apt description. I must point out to right hon. and hon. Members that the function of the House of Commons is to question the Executive.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> They are making a very poor job of it, as we all know. You asked--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am not making a poor job of it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> No, Mrs. Dunwoody, on the contrary.
<P>
I should have said indolent--I may have mixed up consonants.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gardiner:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that if the Government had not had the foresight to put in place the procedures that would be necessary--if and when the arrangements are made in Europe--in order to accept tax revenues in euros, the Opposition would rightly stand up on their two hind legs and complain like mad that the Paymaster General had not made the appropriate provisions? However, because the Opposition realise that the Government have had the foresight to make such provisions, they complain that they do not like what the future may hold.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> My hon. Friend is absolutely right. If we had not made those provisions, the Opposition would be grumbling that we should have done so. We have got it about right. The arrangements are appropriate; they are far less wide than provisions contained within the Finance Bill that the previous Government introduced, to which I have already referred. The arrangements are necessary to us, and the Opposition are unduly detaining the Committee.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. If there were any question of dilatory behaviour, the Chair would of course take note. I am sure that the Paymaster General does not wish in any way to criticise the conduct of the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I am having some trouble following the Paymaster General's reasoning. His answers are somewhat unfocused. Does the clause state merely that a British company can pay the Inland Revenue in euros, but that its liability will be calculated in, and will fundamentally remain in, sterling? If so, the clause is a meaningless PR exercise, because it will make little difference whether the money is converted into sterling by the company or by the Government. Or is the Paymaster General making the more significant point that companies will be able to calculate and to pay their liabilities in euros, and that the Government will be receiving payment in euros? That is the spin that has been put on the provision outside this place.
<P>
I do not ask those questions because I have a phobia about euros. During my professional career I have dealt with many different currencies. This one holds very few fears for me, although I fear its consequences for our economy. However, if payment and liability are to be calculated in euros, a currency risk is being created for the British Exchequer. British taxpayers will incur the associated costs. Why should they have to suffer that risk?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I am afraid that, despite having access to expert advice, the Paymaster General in his lengthy response has failed to answer the question. I freely confess that I am not a lawyer. However, the wording of clause 158(3)(a), which includes power to provide
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``for liabilities to pay amounts to the Commissioners of Inland Revenue . . . to be capable of being discharged''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
suggests to me that payment in euros will itself discharge the liability. In my understanding, that is distinct from a circumstance in which a payment in euros would be accepted. That payment would then be translated into sterling, and the sterling proceeds of that translation would be applied to the liability. That is quite different from a payment in the single currency that discharges the liability.
<P>
The Paymaster General has made it clear to the Committee that the Inland Revenue already accepts payments in foreign currencies. I confess that I did not know that. We have no problem with a banking arrangement whereby the Revenue accepts payments in any currency, translates those payments into sterling, and applies the proceeds to the taxpayer's account. We have no problem with a proposal whereby the euro is granted merely the same status as that currently enjoyed by the currencies of those countries that propose to join the single currency. If the Paymaster General can explicitly confirm that that is the case, and that no provision exists beyond that, we shall be satisfied.
<P>
However, in all the rambling around the houses that has occurred during the past 20 minutes, he has carefully avoided confrming that the clause simply places the euro on the same standing as the deutschmark, the US dollar and the French franc. If he can do that, I will be satisfied.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I am pleased to be able to give the hon. Gentleman that assurance. I can also confirm that this is a modest measure to allow people to pay tax returns in euros. It does not allow tax returns to be made in euros. [Laughter.] It allows people to pay tax in euros, not to make the returns. It may be a nice difference; I do not know. One can have a view.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Will the Paymaster General give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> No. I should like to return to clause 158. It does not allow for the introduction of a Europe-wide withholding tax or provide for the introduction of the single currency in the UK. Nor does it contain the many varied powers with which Opposition Members have imbued it. It is a simple, sensible and pragmatic clause, which would allow the Government to introduce changes to tax legislation consequential on the adoption of the single currency in other member states. I commend it to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Mrs. Dunwoody, I shall be brief. I want to question the Paymaster General on this matter, as I am more confused than I was at the beginning of the debate. Will he set out, for the benefit of the Committee, the rules relating to the submission of accounts in foreign currencies by companies and taxpayers?
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> Perhaps, while the Paymaster General is struggling to answer that question, I can assist my hon. Friend. It is not only business taxes that are at issue. The explanatory note makes it clear that the enabling power will cover all taxes for which the Inland Revenue is responsible, and will apply equally to those who pay income tax. Will there not be certain circumstances--when a taxpayer has operated elsewhere in Europe, for instance--in which people will be required to pay their income tax in euros before we have even signed up to the euro?
<P>
<B>Mr. Cranston:</B> The Opposition are making a mountain out of a molehill to change the geography. They have not read the clause, which makes it clear that the regulations deal with the discharge of a payment obligation. Currently, any creditor can accept any currency in discharge of a payment obligation. In this country, a creditor has the right to demand sterling, but is free to accept any currency in discharge of a payment obligation. The clause simply provides that regulations can be made to allow the discharge by payment in euros. That is a simple provision and, as my hon. Friend the Paymaster General has said, a modest one. I shall support the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Member for Dudley, North. Members of the Committee are beginning to understand what will happen as a result of the clause and the regulations made under it. In other words, company A--I hope that the Paymaster General will elaborate on and clarify this matter--proffers euros in discharge of its corporation tax liability and the Inland Revenue converts to sterling the net of the costs of conversion, which constitutes a discharge, or partial discharge, of that liabiltity. Is that correct?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> Yes. Absolutely. I cannot explain it more clearly. Tax computations can be arranged in euros, but tax settlements are paid in sterling by companies that are subject to Inland Revenue legislation. I cannot see the problem that Opposition Members have found. To be obtuse is one thing; to be stupid is another.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I am disappointed that I have not had a response to a clear question. In what circumstances can companies submit their accounts to the Inland Revenue in a foreign currency?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I could not hear the last question.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> In what circumstances will the Inland Revenue permit companies to submit their accounts or financial statements in a foreign currency?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> That is a narrow point on which I am not a specialist. Companies can already make local currency elections to allow tax to be based on accounts in foreign currencies. That measure was introduced by a Conservative Government. Is that clear enough for the hon. Gentleman? If not, I shall write to him.

Brought up, and read the First time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson:</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, we may take Government amendment No. 313.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> Could you give me some guidance, Mrs. Dunwoody? Shall I now move the other new clause that appears in the amendment paper in the name of my right hon. Friend the Chief Secretary to the Treasury?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The hon. Gentleman should move the new clause now and we shall decide whether to vote on it at the appropriate point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> Thank you, Mrs. Dunwoody.
<P>
The new clause will re-enact some of the stamp duty provisions that are currently in the Government of Ireland Act 1920 and in an order that was made in 1922 under that Act. We have agreed to repeal the 1920 Act as part of the Northern Ireland peace arrangements. I hope that that commends itself to the Committee.
<P>
The 1920 Act set up a Northern Ireland Parliament which was empowered to legislate for stamp duty in Northern Ireland. From 1922 to 1973, when the Northern Ireland Parliament was abolished, the stamp duty legislation in Northern Ireland was separate from that enacted in the rest of the United Kingdom, which was enacted by the Westminster Parliament.
<P>
After the abolition of the Northern Ireland Parliament, from 1974 responsibility for stamp duty in Northern Ireland was transferred back to the United Kingdom Parliament. That did not entail the abolition of the separate stamp duty legislation for Northern Ireland. That legislation has remained in force ever since and it is amended from time to time.
<P>
Some of the stamp duty provisions in the Government of Ireland Act 1920 and in the 1992 order are now obsolete, but a few need to be preserved, including a provision which prevents double taxation in cases where an instrument is chargeable with stamp duty under both the Great Britain and Northern Ireland legislation--for example, where a document executed in Northern Ireland is used in Great Britain, or vice versa. A related provision ensures that the full stamp duty can be collected if a document needs to be stamped in both Northern Ireland and elsewhere in the United Kingdom and the charge in one part of the United Kingdom is less than in the other. The Northern Ireland legislation did not always mirror the Great Britain legislation exactly, and that provision also needs to be re-enacted.
<P>
The other provisions needing to be re-enacted are minor provisions in an Order in Council made under section 69 of the Government of Ireland Act 1920. They contain powers to make Orders in Council to adapt Great Britain enactments to Northern Ireland. The re-enactments and the repeal of corresponding provisions in the 1920 Act take effect from the date of Royal Assent of the Finance Bill.
<P>
I hope that that is sufficient to satisfy the Committee on the desirability of and need for the new clause. Although I would welcome any contribution from the Opposition, I hope that this will not become a contentious issue.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The Paymaster General has just read out, for the benefit of anyone in the Committee who cannot read, the explanatory note to the new clause which we have all been sent--and very beautifully he did it too. Unfortunately, the explanatory note does not answer one or two questions.
<P>
I understand the reason for repealing the Government of Ireland Act, but it seems odd that we are including in this Bill a specific provision arising from that. How do the Government intend to proceed in the wider issue? I imagine that the repeal of the 1920 Act in its totality will give rise to the need for several consequential changes to other bodies of legislation to re-enact the provisions that are required. It is unlikely that the stamp duty provision is the only provision that will be required to survive the scrapping of the Act. Why is it necessary to deal with this specific matter in the Finance Bill instead of sweeping it up in the Bill that will repeal the Government of Ireland Act 1920?
<P>
The Paymaster General told us--the explanatory note gave us helpful notice of this--that documents which are required to be stamped in either the United Kingdom or Northern Ireland will be regarded as having been stamped in both countries if they are stamped in either country, except where legislation in Northern Ireland, England and other countries of the United Kingdom requires different amounts of stamp duty to be paid. In such circumstances, documents that are stamped in the lower-cost jurisdiction will be regarded as having been stamped in the other jurisdiction to the extent that stamp duty has been paid. Provision is made in the new clause for a top-up stamp duty to be paid if at any time the document is required to be produced as a stamped instrument in that higher-charge jurisdiction.
<P>
All that sounds sensible, but the explanatory note does not give us an example of what happens if a different rate of stamp duty prevails in Northern Ireland. Without understanding to what type of transactions the new clause will apply, I cannot begin to establish whether there are possibilities for avoidance. If the Paymaster General answers that question, we will be able to consider the avoidance potential of the new clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> The hon. Gentleman raises a reasonable point, and I can give him some interesting background to it. We have agreed to repeal the whole of the Government of Ireland Act. A small number of provisions in it that deal with matters other than stamp duty will continue to be needed and will be preserved in a Northern Ireland Bill. The stamp duty provisions for re-enactment were considered more appropriate to the Finance Bill. I think he would agree that that is the obvious way to deal with them.
<P>
As for the differences in Northern Ireland duty, the duty payable in Northern Ireland, as the hon. Gentleman well knows, is normally the same as in the rest of the United Kingdom. The rates are now the same but there are some very minor technical differences between the two sets of legislation. That is all we are trying to address; I would hope that he would recognise that no great issue is at stake.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> To what type of instrument does the Paymaster General refer? Are they transactions in land or securities? What are the differences that might require a topping-up payment should the instrument have to be produced in England, for example?
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I am not sure that I can tell the hon. Gentleman that at this moment. Technical differences, which I do not think are major, exist. [Hon. Members: ``What are they?''] I may be able to obtain an answer for him now but I would have thought that it would be more sensible to come back to him on the issue.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cranston:</B> Will my hon. Friend give way?
<P>
<B>Hon. Members:</B> Rescue.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cranston:</B> No. Is there a suggestion from Opposition Members that they are not supporting an attempt at tax avoidance? Is that the implication? They have been assured by my hon. Friend the Paymaster General that any differences are minor, and therefore provision must be made. The new clause, which replicates the provisions in the Government of Ireland Act, attempts to prevent avoidance. Opposition Members are again generating a great deal of synthetic concern about a matter that we should pass over quickly.

<P>

<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I made a gracious suggestion to the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond) who has been assiduous and competent--
<P>
<B>Mr. Derek Twigg:</B> (Halton) Is my hon. Friend the Paymaster General surprised that Opposition Members have spent most of our proceedings condemning us for closing loopholes and have suddenly come up with a spurious argument about this clause? We have to wonder what lies behind it. Will my hon. Friend the Paymaster General comment on that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> If Opposition Members could comment intelligently--sometimes they do--we would be helpful. I explained to the hon. Gentleman that there were minor technical differences. He is perfectly at liberty not to accept that; minor technical differences may for him be great issues of worldwide concern.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> This is the Finance Bill Committee. It is not the United Nations. The Committee wants to understand the clause. The technical details may be minor, but the Committee wants to hear about them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I am sure that the hon. Gentleman wants to hear about nothing else. That is all that he can understand and all that he has been trained in, but bigger issues are involved.
<P>
I shall give the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge an example, and if he does not find it satisfactory he is welcome to come back to me and I shall write to him in great detail with a further list. The example that I was given is conveyances in contemplation of sale, which is a completely technical point of provision for charity common investment schemes, not to be treated as unit trusts. If he would like more information--or if he would like to comment on these two points, on which I have no doubt that he is erudite--that can be arranged. I have given him two examples to prove that the provisions are technical and minor. I hope that the Committee will accept that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> So far this morning I have been, on the one hand, erudite and assiduous and, on the other, indolent, insolent and stupid. I shall not chance my arm by asking the Paymaster General to write a reference for me, in case I catch him on a bad day.
<P>
I shall explain my worries about the matter. The Paymaster General will remember from previous debates that I have a particular interest in stamp duty. Indeed, he expressed a certain sympathy with some of the points that I raised during Committee proceedings on the Floor of the House, when the subject was discussed in greater detail.
<P>
The Paymaster General has quoted two examples, but in this case two examples will not do. The new clause will enable an instrument to be stamped in a jurisdiction where the duty payable is lower than in another jurisdiction in the United Kingdom. If the person who had that instrument stamped was subsequently required to produce it in the higher-duty jurisdiction, he or she could simply top up the stamp duty payable, and produce it as a duly stamped document, without incurring any penalty.
<P>
The vast majority of instruments do not need to be produced in stamp form in, for example, England. However, I am worried that a sizeable class of instruments may benefit by the new clause. A loophole may inadvertently be created whereby instruments will be routinely stamped in the lower-cost jurisdiction in the certain knowledge that, should they have to be produced in a properly stamped form in the higher-cost jurisdiction, they can be topped up without penalty.
<P>
The Paymaster General could put our minds at rest by saying that the categories of instrument that will be affected are minor, tightly defined and unlikely to give rise to avoidance opportunities. However, problems may arise if wider categories of instrument can be stamped in Northern Ireland than the Paymaster General originally thought. We are not expecting him to carry the relevant information in his head; he has civil service support in Committee for that very purpose.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. There is no one in the Committee except Members of Parliament.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Of course there is not, Mrs. Dunwoody. I am suggesting that Committee members might reasonably expect the Paymaster General's formidable memory to enabe him to recall the various instances. If he tells us that the provision applies to three or four classes of instrument only, and if he explains what those classes are, we shall be satisfied. However, the explanatory documentation that was circulated to Committee members did not list those classes. That slightly surprises me.
<P>
The Paymaster General's promise to write to me after we have voted on the clause is not satisfactory, because the Committee's purpose is to scrutinise a new clause that was perhaps hurriedly drafted. By definition, a new clause is something of an afterthought. Moreoever, should they think that a sizeable avoidance opportunity is likely to be created, Labour Members of the Committee may want the Government to reconsider the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson:</B> I should like to respond briefly on this technical and detailed subject. The hon. Gentleman showed some understanding of the position in which any Minister is placed who has to respond to such matters.
<P>
I can assure the hon. Gentleman that few differences now exist between Northern Ireland and Great Britain, and that those differences affect very few cases. That is the best that I can do today. He indicated that he would like to write to me; if he does so I shall willingly respond. The clause will not change the existing rules; it will simply move them from the 1920 Act to the Finance Bill. That is all that the clause seeks to do.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I thank the Paymaster General for that information. Rather than inviting me to write to him, perhaps he should take the more conventional route of offering to write to me. I should be most grateful if he would do so, and explain precisely which classes of instrument are covered.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
Brought up, and read the First time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
The new clause deals with a huge injustice in the Inheritance Tax Act 1984, which was highlighted in a story that appeared in The Daily Telegraph in February 1998 and which was later picked up by the BBC radio programme ``Money Box''. Mr. and Mrs. Prosser, who live in a village called Palestine near Andover, Hampshire, inherited a property from Mrs. Prosser's mother, Edith. The property was initially valued at &#163;125,000 and the couple paid inheritance tax on it of some &#163;50,000. Subsequently, the district valuer decided that the property had been undervalued by the Inland Revenue, which had failed to take into account the value of the property's garden, which was a quarter of an acre in size. If the couple had obtained planning permission, they could have built a bungalow or second house in the garden. The district valuer decided that the garden was worth &#163;70,000 rather than almost nothing, and the Inland Revenue sought a further &#163;28,000 in inheritance tax from the couple.
<P>
In my view--and in that of The Daily Telegraph and of listeners to ``Money Box''--that was a huge injustice. Neither the couple who inherited the property nor Mrs. Prosser's mother, Edith, when she lived there, had any intention of developing the land as a second home. However, because there was the potential for developing a second property in the garden, the Inland Revenue had to place the higher value on it.
<P>
The only way in which the couple could resist the district valuer's new valuation was to apply for planning permission to the local authority, the Test Valley borough council, and to hope that it would be turned down. Mr. Prosser applied for planning permission but made a very weak case. In fact, he said that he did not want planning permission and that he was applying for it only because it was the only way in which the dispute between his family and the Inland Revenue, which had been going on for two years, could be settled. Mrs. Jean Prosser formally opposed the planning permission that her husband was seeking. The officials in the council were bemused and astonished by the situation, but felt that they had to grant planning permission, and did so. They granted planning permission to Mr. and Mrs. Prosser not because they wanted a property to be built in the back garden but because they knew that if they refused planning permission the Inland Revenue would appeal. There were no real grounds for refusing planning permission, and the Inland Revenue's appeal was likely to succeed.
<P>
The situation is grossly unjust, and the way to tackle it is to accept the new clause. The new clause may be technically deficient but if it is, I hope that the young at heart Member for Coventry, North-West (Mr. Robinson), the Paymaster General, will table a correct technical admendment to the Inheritance Tax Act 1984 on report or in another Finance Bill.
<P>
The new clause would change the Inheritance Tax Act such that, at any time that a dwelling house, and its gardens or grounds are inherited and a valuation is made of the property for the purposes of that Act, it will be assumed that planning permission will not be granted for further development, if it has not already been sought.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I am sure that the Paymaster General will point out that some people may benefit from the provision. People may inherit a property with a large garden, seek planning permission from the local authority and thereby make a large profit because they do not have to pay inheritance tax on the development profit on the property. I think that that is a price worth paying to avoid the injustice that Mr. and Mrs. Prosser faced and other couples or individuals who inherit property may face.
<P>
No third party would pay the market price put on the property by the district valuer if planning permission had not been granted. Many property deals between a seller and a property developer are made subject to planning permission being obtained.

<P>

<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman think that the problem would be better solved by enabling property owners to offer the Revenue covenants not to develop?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The hon. Gentleman raises a valid point. A better new clause than the one that I have drafted might say, ``If no planning permission is sought within the following two or three years.'' I am sure that there is a solution to the problem. A solution must be found--I hope that the Government and all the very bright people at the Inland Revenue will try to think of one. The injustice cannot go untackled.
<P>
If new clause 1, or something like it, is not accepted by the Government, we shall be in a position--which I believe will be wrong in principle--in which the tax system forces people to take action that they would not take but for the Taxes Act 1988. Areas such as my constituency of Bognor Regis and Littlehampton have been subject to an enormous amount of building during the past 20 or 30 years. Almost every garden of any size has had an in-fill property built within it, so popular is the area. We are grateful that people have come to live in Bognor Regis and Littlehampton. It is a very pleasant area, as I have mentioned many times before, but it will stay pleasant only if there is not continual pressure on people to in-fill their gardens. The Inheritance Tax Act 1984 places yet another pressure on people to build properties in their gardens, thereby increasing the population density of suburban areas.
<P>
The &#163;70,000--the difference in value between the property with and without planning permission--is an enormous amount of money. If one applies the 40 per cent. inheritance tax rate to that sum, it produces a figure of &#163;28,000. It is difficult for couples to pay that sort of tax without going ahead and building the property. That is precisely what Mr. and Mrs. Prosser will have had to do. Their case is still being disputed, but if, ultimately, they have to pay the money, they will have to build the property in their garden and sell it in order to pay the tax. Or they will have to sell the property to a developer.
<P>
My view is that inheritance tax is overdue for abolition. [Hon. Members: ``Ah.''] It does not raise an enormous sum of money. Opposition Members say, ``Ah, another spending pledge by the Conservative party'', but it is not a spending pledge. We want further tax cuts.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that it is not a spending pledge but a tax-reducing pledge, rather like the way in which the working families tax credit is a tax-reducing pledge and not counted in Government spending pledges?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> My hon. Friend, as always, makes an important point. We are debating not a spending pledge but a pledge that should be a priority when the economy and the time is right, and it is prudent to make the cut. It should be met in the same way as other tax-cutting agenda, which are always a priority of a Conservative Government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown </B>(Cotswold): Does my hon. Friend think that the law was interpreted correctly when the district valuer took a prospective judgment on planning applications in determining what might happen tomorrow in terms of yesterday's chargeable event? Does he think that it is wrong for the district valuer to interpret what may or may not happen?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> My hon. Friend makes a valid point. We have discussed examples of the Inland Revenue's interpretation of legislation--I think that my hon. Friend the Member for Guildford raised the matter earlier today. The Inland Revenue can interpret legislation in a way that maximises revenue but may not be just. I have no doubt that the Revenue's interpretation of the Inheritance Tax Act 1984 is accurate. It would not use an inaccurate interpretation. My purpose is to change the legislation so that no such interpretation will be possible.
<P>
Inheritance tax is paid only by middle Britain. The very wealthy can avoid paying inheritance tax. If they have more than one property, they can make a disposal before death to the people who they intend to inherit their properties. If the major asset of a family or an individual is the property in which they live, there is no way in which it can be disposed of to the next of kin unless the person is prepared to move out. No one would want to do that. It is difficult for people of modest means to make a disposal. Middle Britain therefore suffers most from the tax and it suffers inordinately from the injustice that I am highlighting. The anomaly hits middle Britain in particular and it should be stopped.
<P>
The Labour party has persuaded middle Britain that Labour is on its side. That is a key reason why it was able to win the general election with such a handsome majority. But since then, the Government have implemented measure after measure that seem designed to hit middle Britain. I will not risk your calling me to order, Mrs. Dunwoody, by listing any or all of those examples, but I should like to give the Government an opportunity to re-establish their credibility with middle Britain by accepting the new clause, by tabling a new clause of their own or by stating that they accept the principle and will try to tackle the injustice in future. That will go a long way to re-establishing the Labour party's credentials as a supporter of middle Britain.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I am pleased to support my hon. Friend. The choice before the Committee is simple. It can support us or it can give notice that it approves the idea of a spiv's property charter for the Inland Revenue. That charter would allow the Revenue to become an asset stripper throughout middle Britain, in particular in my constituency and that of my hon. Friend.
<P>
My local authority has managed to build more than 70 per cent. of new housing development on brownfield sites. However, brownfield sites are often the gardens of other properties in the neighbourhood and there is an increasing density of housing which is gradually changing the area's character. If the new clause is rejected, many people may not be able to succeed to historic and important properties because the Inland Revenue will force them to develop the latent potential of that property. I am sure that the Paymaster General, who lives in one such property near me in Surrey, is all too familiar with the associated problems. I should not be surprised if he has to declare an interest in this debate, although I hope that that will not stop him from coming down in favour of conservation.
<P>
The hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon (Mr. Burnett) floated the idea of covenants for the Inland Revenue. Only a Liberal Member could come up with the idea that people should have their property semi-nationalised.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton understood quite well the merits of my proposal. He has some experience of these matters, unlike the hon. Member for Guildford. I cannot understand the hypocrisy that underlies this debate and the clause. The point is well made by the Conservatives that inheritance tax is a tax on middle incomes. The rich do not pay--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Interventions should be brief.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I call Mr. St. Aubyn.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> Thank you, Mrs. Dunwoody. That intervention deserves as much consideration as I intended to give it.
<P>
If the new clause is not accepted, convenants may be taken out because those with such properties will be advised--in good time and before the transfer takes place to make covenants with separate parties who, for the purposes of the legislation, are not connected, in order to reduce the value of their property in the event of such a transfer. Much money will be spent on legal fees. Those who are prescient enough to take such a step will be relatively unaffected by the Inland Revenue's new approach, but those who are not will be caught. The result is that we may see in our constituencies a more intensive development of housing.
<P>
An important principle is involved. When assets are valued for probate, they are valued on a conservative basis. Anyone who has had to insure his wife's jewellery will know that there is one value for insurance purposes and another for the purposes of probate. Similar distinctions will be pointed out to anyone who has had dealings with an auction house--[Interruption.] I see that my comments are of interest to Labour Members. We are discussing middle Britain. An heirloom may be valued at &#163;5,000 or &#163;10,000 for insurance purposes, but at half that for probate. The same consideration applies to a piece of furniture and to many other objects. The idea that those items can be found only among the rich and privileged few shows how out ot touch Labour Members are. Anyone who has watched the ``Antiques Roadshow'' knows that anyone can own such items--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I do not think that the definition of an antique includes a dwelling house.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> Except in respect of a very few examples--not, I am sure, the Dunwoody residence or, indeed, the St. Aubyn residence.
<P>
If it is accepted that a more conservative valuation should be applied to objects of art, for example, it should also--
<P>
<B>Mr. Gardiner:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman accept that his definition of middle Britain--in which heirlooms cascade down the generations and in which recourse is always needed to the auction houses of Phillips, Sotheby's and Christies--would not, I suspect, be recognised by most of his constituents? It certainly would not be recognised by mine.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I know that you will tell me, Mrs. Dunwoody, that I cannot answer that point without straying from the matter under debate. We are debating a problem that does affect middle England. I fear that the hon. Gentleman betrays total ignorance of the section of the electorate whom his party are trying to woo. However, they will not be wooed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Derek Twigg:</B> The hon. Gentleman raises an important point. Is he suggesting that the average person in Britain shuffles off to the auction house every weekend?

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. A little amusement is fine, but we should try to return to the real basis of the new clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I could describe how my father-in-law invented ``The Antiques Roadshow'', and the appeal that it has for all sorts of people from every walk of life. However, if I were to do so in order to make our arguments the more convincing, I would be wasting the Committee's time because we are discussing dwelling houses, as you have rightly reminded us, Mrs. Dunwoody.
<P>
We touched on the subject of family mementoes, which have different values for market purposes, for insurance purposes and for probate value. The new clause would ensure that dwelling houses--the most prized family heirloom of all--could be passed on to the next generation at a conservative valuation. Surely it is clear that the Exchequer would not incur any real loss through such a transfer, because if the subsequent generation chose to sell the property rather than to live in it, the sale could well be subject to capital gains tax. At that point, significant tax would be paid to the Inland Revenue.
<P>
However, it would be inappropriate and unfair to return to the time of transfer and to impute a speculative and dated development value if that generation were to continue to live in the property for a number of years, and to establish it as their primary residence.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> We are talking abut inheritance tax. Is the hon. Gentleman aware that there is a free uplift in respect of capital gains tax at the time of death?
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman, who proves my point, If a lower value is accepted for probate purposes, and the property is subsequently sold for an elevated value because of development, the probate value--not the higher value--will be the capital gains tax base. That is precisely why the measure proposed by myself and my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton is a virtually tax-neutral measure. By way of contrast, the Government are in effect proposing a property spivs' charter for the Inland Revenue.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, affectionately known locally as Mr. Bean, has tabled an amendment that would require the Government to spend an enormous number of beans. In respect of inheritance liability, the market price should be the price on which inheritance is based. After all, development opportunity is naturally factored in to a price in a marketplace.
<P>
The case of Mrs. Edith Prosser and her family, which was reported in The Daily Telegraph, was an interesting anecdotal story. However, it would be somewhat misguided to base tax law on it. If we were to do so, people could drive a coach and horses through the intention of a fair inheritance tax on sites with considerable development value, even though they had not applied for planning permission.
<P>
Distortions and manipulations would occur. Accountants and others of the profession of the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton would spend much time working out how to manage one's asset portfolio in such a way as to accumulate sites with potential for development because inheritance tax would be based on the property--some barn or whatever--that happened to be there at the time. So it would be wrong of the Committee to support what I regard to be a naive amendment.
<P>
As for the--
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I was about to come to the points raised by the hon. Member for Guildford.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> In that case, I shall allow the hon. Gentleman to continue.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I shall also allow him to continue.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> The hon. Member for Guildford seemed to suggest that the new clause would somehow stop the development of people's back gardens and brownfield sites. I do not think for one moment that it would do that. The profit opportunities for brownfield development exist in any case. People are hurtling into the constituency of the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, presumably to be near to him, and developing gardens with gay abandon in order to do so. How can the hon. Gentleman oppose brownfield development and, at the same time, rally the Opposition troops against any development of green belt, given the aggregate housing needs of the United Kingdom? The hon. Gentleman cannot have it both ways. We cannot have a situation in which no houses can be built outside towns or cities and no development can occur on the brown field.
<P>
I am coming to my conclusion and I do not want to detain the Committee, but I will take an intervention from the hon. Member for Guildford.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I also want the debate to reach a conclusion, but as the hon. Gentleman insists that I reply, I shall do so.
<P>
Brownfield developments of industrial sites in inner cities are welcomed by anyone who wants to preserve the green belt. However, the type of so-called brownfield development to which we are referring is development of people's back gardens, and there is a strong feeling, both in my constituency and in others, that although that is more welcome than greenfield development, it should not be encouraged.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> On brownfield development and planning law, hon. Members may know that I was leader of the largest council in London, so I know about planning issues. The planning authority will not simply give planning permission to build a house in someone's back garden unless it conforms to the unitary development plan, which has regard to densities in that area, environmental considerations, the impact on schooling, transportation, congestion, and so on. So the idea that if we do not accept the new clause tabled by the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, there will be greater densities in Bognor Regis is quite wrong. [Laughter.] Indeed, there is quite enough density in Bognor Regis.
<P>
The expression of conservative evaluation for tax rings true with the whole ethic of the Opposition. On Thursday, one of my colleagues elaborated on the costs that would have been incurred had the profligate Opposition been in power, giving away money with gay abandon. This provision is neither affordable nor correct; a conservative evaluation would be quite wrong.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Loughton </B>(East Worthing and Shoreham): It would appear that the hon. Member for Croydon, Central has again eluded the security of the twilight home for the eternally bewildered to be with us here today.
<P>
He mentioned unitary development plans, and said that if the development did not meet the criteria, it would not go ahead. Will he concede that, in west Sussex, the county development plan has been blown to smithereens by the Deputy Prime Minister, who is imposing extra houses on the area, and that that development may involve the sort of brownfield site to which the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton has referred?
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I do not think that that is relevant in the context of the new clause, but obviously, if the hon. Member for Guildford has his way, more and more houses would be thrust on the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton. Clearly, the Deputy Prime Minister has in mind the aggregate needs of the country and is not so much concerned with parochial interests but, at the same time, clearly takes very seriously the individual's right in areas such as the constituency of the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton. I am happy that the right decision was made in that instance.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson:</B> I shall reply to the few specific points raised by the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton before addressing the generality of the argument.
<P>
The tax rules allow tax to be paid by annual instalments until the property is sold. The hon. Gentleman knows that, although at one point he was almost implying the contrary.
<P>
In reply to the point made by the hon. Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown), the district valuer takes into account only those factors existing at the date of valuation. The value of any prospects of planning consent at that date, and not any future opportunity, is taken into account.
<P>
In response to the specific point raised by the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, I should like to make it clear that the Inland Revenue cannot appeal against the granting refusal of a planning consent.
<P>
The hon. Member for Guildford, who has an inimitable command of the English language, referred to a spiv's charter. If his amendment were accepted, it would be even more of a spiv's charter. The amendment would value different assets in different ways, which would allow people to avoid tax by, for example, putting money into dwelling houses.
<P>
If any hon. Members that I have an interest to declare in a clause that I am about to oppose, that would seem to be a contradiction in terms.
<P>
We see what the Opposition intend. The new clause changes the basis of valuation of a dwelling house and its garden for the purpose of inheritance tax. The aim is to exclude from the inheritance tax charge on the dwelling house and its grounds any potential development value attaching to the property. I hasten to add that I shall not try to hide behind any technical deficiencies; the clause is completely technically efficient.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> Conservative Members have said that inheritance tax is a tax on middle Britain--the rich do not pay. Who is responsible for that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> They are, Madam Speaker, and they always have been.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I have not yet promoted myself to Speaker. The Paymaster General should be a little careful.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Perhaps I can suggest a method that would exclude the Paymaster General from my hon. Friend's proposal. A provision of the Taxation of Capital Gains Act 1992 limits the exemption for a normal-sized dwelling house to a garden of one acre, or a larger garden in the case of a substantially larger dwelling house. That would avoid a situation where a large amount of land would be excluded from the scope of the tax simply because it is part of the curtilage of a dwelling house.
<P>
Does the Paymaster General have any sympathy for the objectives suggested by my hon. Friend? Will he consider using the same definitions of a dwelling house that are provided in capital gains tax legislation, which would provide an exemption for those who are genuinely middle-class, middle-income families living in ordinary houses with modest gardens?

<P>

<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> Any Labour Minister or new Labour Member of Parliament will be extremely sympathetic to middle England and middle-class people with gardens, who were the bedrock of our victory at the last election. There is no question about that. A majority of 179 seats makes it clear that we appealed to and convinced that constituency. We would think carefully about anything that might be awkward, negligent or deleterious. I do not, however, think that anything is. We are talking about trying to reduce the value of a house that is eligible for inheritance tax. It is as simple as that. I cannot find an objective basis for saying that that class of asset should not be judged on its full value. Why take a more generous and indulgent view of that class of asset?
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> Will the Paymaster General give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I will make a little more progress. No doubt the hon. Member for Guildford will have more points to make.
<P>
The aim is to exclude from the inheritance tax charge on a dwelling house and its grounds any potential development value that is attached to the property. That is the size of it. I do not think that the Opposition's approach is justified. It would make the inheritance tax code less coherent and fair.
<P>
The general principle for inheritance tax purposes is that, in determining the tax charge, property is valued at its open market value. I can see no other way to proceed. That principle applies to all assets covered by the tax and, of course, inheritance tax applies to all types of assets, not just dwelling houses. There could be a problem of discriminating between categories of assets.
<P>
Where it is relevant, the open market value will take account of any development or hope value attaching to an asset. I believe that that is right. Excluding any element of that kind from the valuation would mean that the real worth of transferred assets would be artificially depressed. There would be obvious inconsistencies of treatment, for example between assets with a development value that was realised before a person died and those where it was realised by a person's heirs after his or her death.
<P>
To exclude any development or hope value relating to a dwelling house and its garden for inheritance purposes would discriminate between owners of dwelling houses and owners of other land. It would be unfair to taxpayers whose wealth is held in other assets. Of course, the phenomenon of hope value is not confined to land or houses; it can apply to other assets. For example, the value of shares may be enhanced by the prospect of a company take-over. I cannot see why the valuation of a transfer of shares should be treated less favourable than the valuation of a house.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I am listening carefully. Works of art have an intrinsic value and a more speculative value. But there is also an intrinsic value and a speculative value of a house, assuming that it might have development potential. The Inland Revenue has forced the issue by obtaining the development value--which was fortunate for the Revenue--and imposing a speculative value rather than an intrinsic value on the owners. That is our objection.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> If the hon. Gentleman was selling a property--I am sad to say that I do not know where he lives, although I do not think that it is in as good quality--[Laughter.] I cannot take ministerial responsibility for that.
<P>
If the hon. Gentleman was selling a property which he felt had development potential, would he ignore that?
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> The Paymaster General seems to want an answer, but we want to make progress. The issue is whether, at the point of transfer, such speculative questions are legitimate with the Inland Revenue.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gardiner:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that one has to make speculative judgments in relation to the hypothetical value of a house? The suggestion of the hon. Member for Guildford that one should not consider the speculative element in such a transaction is clearly incoherent.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I agree entirely with my hon. Friend. The less clear contribution made by the hon. Member for Guildford showed only too clearly why we cannot accept the new clause.
<P>
The new clause's proposed change would introduce a wholly unwarranted distortion into the tax base for inheritance tax. As a result, it would encourage abuse of the tax system through tax-driven, short-term investment in houses, which has implications for taxpayers at large. I do not think that even Opposition Members want that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> In his endeavour to assist middle Britain, will the Paymaster General consider the point that was made by the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge? He should also consider another point of merit, namely the possibility of allowing one spouse's unused inheritance tax band to accrue to his or her surviving spouse.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> That is a narrow point. I hope that the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon will let me reflect on his point--not many contributions to today's debate have merited reflection--and get back to him.
<P>
The Government are firmly committed to ensuring that the tax system works fairly and we are always ready to examine situations in which the rules are claimed not to be working properly. For the reasons that I have given I do not believe that the proposed change would produce a fairer system--on the contrary, it would make the system less fair and more open to abuse. Accordingly, I advise the Committee to reject the new clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I want to raise several points that have not been raised so far. The Prosser case is breaking new ground and, as a chartered surveyor, I want to discuss the situation.
<P>
The principal question is about how far the taxpayer is expected to go to obtain planning permission. Is he or she expected to overcome adverse planning restrictions, which include, for example, the need to obtain permission to demolish other buildings and to remove tree preservation orders? Is he or she expected to negotiate legal impediments to planning permission by, for example, buying out adverse rights of way, ransom stripes and restricted covenants? Is the taxpayer expected to try to remediate contaminated land that is found on land for which planning permission is being obtained?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gardiner:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman accept that if such obstacles as he outlined persist, they would be reflected in the speculative price accorded by the Treasury in the relevant situation? They would be taken into account in any respect. There is no question of the freeholder having to buy out or to make the necessary arrangements; such matters would be taken into account when the notional price is set.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes a valid intervention. The point is that we are breaking new ground, and many matters may eventually need to be tested in the courts. Tax practitioners will be looking carefully at the Paymaster General's reply to such questions, and it would be helpful to know what was in his mind and in the mind of the Inland Revenue. It may save considerable legal expense to have an answer to some of those questions now, especially as we are breaking new ground.
<P>
I have mentioned planning restrictions and legal restrictions. A further category of problems relates to the cost of obtaining planning permission, and especially the cost of taking a case to appeal, which can be considerable. Would that be deemed to be part of the value of the land with planning permission?
<P>
Finally, for how far into the future would the possibility of obtaining planning permission be taken into account in the uplift of value? It would be helpful to practitioners outside the Committee if the Paymaster General could answer those questions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I am not sure that the hon. Gentleman, who has been understanding on other matters, really expects me to give him explicit and factual answers--answers that he says will be scrutinised by practitioners outside the Committee after our debates--immediately, while I am on my feet. I hope that he will be agreeable to my writing to him. I will ensure that he receives a detailed response.

<P>
Brought up, and read the First time.
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. John Whittingdale </B>(Maldon and East Chelmsford): I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
The purpose of the new Clause is to reduce the rate of bingo duty from 10 per cent. to 5 per cent. This is not the first time that I have addressed hon. Members on the subject of bingo. In the previous Parliament, I spoke on the bingo industry in an Adjournment debate. My interest in the industry was aroused following a visit to the Gala club in Colchester. I suspect that many hon. Members will have visited bingo clubs at one time or another. With your permission, Mrs. Dunwoody, I should like to say a few words about the bingo industry in order to set in context our proposal for a reduction in duty.
<P>
There are still several misconceptions about the bingo industry. Many people regard bingo clubs as old-fashioned, stuffy, perhaps somewhat shabby places, usually populated by a few elderly ladies filling in cards on a wet afternoon. Nothing could be further from the truth. The modern bingo industry has received considerable investment. There are several brand new clubs, which are spacious and comfortable, and which provide a range of entertainments. They offer not just the game of bingo, but restaurants and entertainment facilities as well. Many people in this country visit bingo clubs for a good night out.
<P>
When I went to my club in Colchester, there were more than 1,000 people present, and that was an ordinary midweek evening. Indeed, during the course of the evening, I had the opportunity to call a game, so I have some experience of the enjoyment provided by the industry.
<P>
When I spoke about the subject last, I concentrated on the regulations that govern the industry, which have imposed enormous burdens on operators. I do not wish to dwell on that subject today because it is outside the scope of the new clause, but it is important to recognise that the bingo industry is suffering under several burdens placed on it by Government. The restrictions on advertising and membership make life more difficult for bingo operators. On top of that, the level of bingo duty represents a considerable burden.
<P>
Bingo clubs are obviously a commercial enterprise, but they also fulfil an important social purpose. For many people, they present an opportunity to get out of the house, see friends and enjoy an cheap meal in comfortable surroundings, and they form an important part of many local communities. It is perhaps not surprising that more than 3 million people enjoy playing bingo.
<P>
It is also important to recognise that bingo is not hard gambling. It is regarded by the Government in some regulations as being akin to casinos or horse-racing. In fact, bingo is very different. One of the principal differences is that it is almost impossible to loose a large amount of money playing bingo.
<P>
It being One o'clock, The Chairman adjourned the Committee without Question put, pursuant to the Standing Order.
