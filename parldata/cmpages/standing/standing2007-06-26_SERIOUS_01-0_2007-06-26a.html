						<b class="B">
							<a name="07062684000514"></a>Mr.
Browne:
						</b> This is the first time since I was elected two
years ago that I have served as a member of a Bill Committee, and it is
a privilege to do so under your chairmanship, Mr. Bercow. I
hope that others will bear what I have said in mind if there are any
glitches in my performance during the ensuing
weeks.</div>
					<a name="07062684000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am throwing
myself into the deep end by getting to the nub of matters at the start
of the Committee&#146;s consideration of the Bill. I shall explain
why I consider this group of amendments to be of such import. The
essential point is this: in order to fall foul of the Bill&#146;s
provisions, the court needs to be satisfied only that a person has
committed an offence or may commit an offence. That is not a
sufficiently rigorous threshold, which is why the amendment would,
after &#147;satisfied&#148;, add &#147;beyond reasonable
doubt&#148;. I shall give the Committee a little background and
explain my
motivation.</div>
					<a name="07062684000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">First, I
shall tell the Committee about some of the representations that have
been made. Kirsty Brimelow, the spokesperson for the Bar Council,
said:</div>
					<a name="07062684000427"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
tortuous logic appears to be that the word &#145;prevention&#146;
means that restrictions are not punitive. This is word play and the
logic is fallacious.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07062684000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Criminal Bar Association said that one would need an &#147;astute
gymnastic mind&#148; to be convinced of the provisions. John Stalker,
a notable former deputy chief constable of Greater Manchester who
appears regularly in the media, said
that</div>
					<a name="07062684000428"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;super-ASBOs, as
these are being called, are not the answer to heavyweight criminals.
They may be OK for hoodies on the
street&#148;</div>
					<a name="07062684000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">but that they
were not appropriate for heavyweight
criminals.</div>
					<a name="07062684000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">So a person
need not commit a criminal offence and need not be found guilty by a
jury &#147;beyond all reasonable doubt&#148;. I was led to believe
when I was growing up&#151;and people still believe it to be the case
today&#151;that people expected such a threshold if their liberties
were to be curtailed. All that is needed under the Bill is for the
court to be &#147;satisfied&#148; in that regard. If people
subsequently breached what John Stalker called the super-ASBO, criminal
sanctions could follow even though the person had not been found guilty
of an offence to that standard or burden of proof. That is my motive
for moving the amendment.</div>
					
					<a name="07062684000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07062684000515"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Douglas Hogg</b> (Sleaford and North Hykeham) (Con): I support
the hon. Gentleman&#146;s remarks. I have tabled a number of
amendments in this group, one of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column5" />Column number: 5</div>which is in the same terms as those used by the hon. Gentleman in moving
the lead amendment. The purpose of my amendments is to enhance the
standard of proof required before the order can be made. The Committee
will see that I have incorporated the higher standard of proof with
regard to both of the elements set out in clause 1, which is to say
that the court must be satisfied not only that it is beyond reasonable
doubt that the individual has been involved in serious crime, but,
secondly and differently, that the order would protect the public in
the way set out in the Bill.</div>
					<a name="07062684000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is important to understand
how far-reaching the orders are. For that purpose, we need to look at
clause 6, which sets out the consequences of an order. Until one has
addressed those, one cannot understand how important it is to have a
high standard of proof for the making of the order. If one looks at
subsection (3), one will find that the orders are among the most
draconian ever contemplated by the legislature in this country. The
power of the court is not confined to the making of the orders in
subsection (3); they are but examples. It says:</div>
					<a name="07062684000429"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Examples of
prohibitions, restrictions or requirements that may be imposed on
individuals (including partners in a partnership) by serious crime
prevention orders include prohibitions or restrictions on, or
requirements in relation
to&#151;</div>
					<a name="07062684000432"></a><div class="hs_brev">(a) an
individual&#146;s financial, property or business dealings or
holdings;</div>
					<a name="07062684000433"></a><div class="hs_brev">(b) an
individual&#146;s working
arrangements;</div>
					<a name="07062684000434"></a><div class="hs_brev">(c) the
means by which an individual communicates or associates with others, or
the persons with whom he communicates or
associates;</div>
					<a name="07062684000436"></a><div class="hs_brev">(d) the
premises to which an individual has
access;</div>
					<a name="07062684000437"></a><div class="hs_brev">(e) the use of
any premises or item by an
individual;</div>
					<a name="07062684000438"></a><div class="hs_brev">(f) an
individual&#146;s travel (whether within the United Kingdom, between
the United Kingdom and other places or
otherwise).&#148;</div>
					<a name="07062684000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Committee needs to understand that an order made under those provisions
will wholly restrict a person&#146;s liberty in every material way.
It could be used to prevent him from earning his living; to prevent him
from travelling; to confine him to a particular part of the United
Kingdom; to prevent him from living in his own house; to prevent him
from visiting another person&#146;s house; to prevent him from
talking to individuals; to prevent him from using his bank, and so on.
It is some of the most draconian legislation that I have had the
misfortune to see.</div>
					<a name="07062684000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those are facts. In what
circumstances should such draconian orders be made? Let us consider the
order-making power that is set out in clause 1, to which the hon.
Gentleman referred. He was absolutely right: such orders can be made in
respect of a person who has committed no substantive offence of any
kind, because that is the effect of subsection (1)(a) and (b). The
definition of involvement in serious crime is set out in clause 2; it
embraces convictions, to which we will come shortly, but it also
embraces such offences as
facilitating</div>
					<a name="07062684000034"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
commission by...another person of a serious
offence&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07062684000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">Incidentally,
the definition of a serious offence in the schedule includes unlawful
fishing and other such examples.</div>
					<a name="07062684000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us stand back and consider
the matter seriously. Through the Bill, the Government propose to
incorporate the most draconian restrictions that one 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column6" />Column number: 6</div>can readily contemplate, in respect of people who have committed either
fairly trivial offences or no offence whatsoever. I ask rhetorically:
is that what this House should do? I hope that the answer is no, it is
not.</div>
					
					<a name="07062684000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07062684000516"></a>
								The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department
(Mr. Vernon Coaker):
						</b> Notwithstanding the right
hon. and learned Gentleman&#146;s passion, does he believe that the
High Court, which is a public authority for the purposes of the Human
Rights Act, will put into place an order that will do the things that
he is suggesting to this Committee that it would do, which would be
totally disproportionate and at odds with the Human Rights Act? Does he
really think the High Court would do
that?</div>
					<a name="07062684000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">Mr.
Hogg: </b>It is the business of Parliament to safeguard the rights of
the citizen. Of course we trust the courts to act justly; we need to
set out the criteria by which they will have to implement the
order-making power. Incidentally&#151;we will come to this
shortly&#151;this Bill does not provide any proper criteria of any
kind to guide the courts. That is why I tabled amendments, one of which
includes the word &#147;proportionate&#148;, which the hon.
Gentleman has just used, which does not appear in the Bill as drafted.
As the hon. Gentleman used my word, I hope he will support my
amendment, because it reflects exactly the policy that he is
articulating.</div>
					<a name="07062684000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
truth is that it is the business of Parliament to safeguard the
liberties of the subject; the courts have an important role to play,
but the plain fact is that if you give power to anybody there is a risk
that it will be abused. That is why, as a matter of principle, we
should give the minimum power that has to be extended in a democratic
society for the good of society. I am not in favour of giving powers
that are capable of being
abused.</div>
					<a name="07062684000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I
return to my point: the Bill creates the power to make draconian orders
in respect of trivial offences&#151;or things that are not offences
at all. That being so, how can we remedy it, other than having a stand
part debate and excluding clause 1? It is a matter for the Chairman,
Mr. Bercow, but I hope that we will have lots of stand part
debates on clause after clause. One very important step is to ensure
that the courts cannot make these orders unless they are satisfied
beyond a reasonable doubt that the criteria are made

							<b class="B">Jeremy
Wright</b> (Rugby and Kenilworth) (Con): I entirely agree with
my right hon. and learned Friend&#146;s argument, that the safeguard
for the criminal standard of proof is necessary. Does he agree that one
of the reasons for that is that when one considers the proposed offence
of facilitating the commission by another person of a serious offence,
paragraph 33 of the explanatory notes makes it clear that subject to
any consideration of whether what the respondent has done is
reasonable,</div>
					<a name="07062684000440"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the court
must ignore the intentions and other aspects of the mental state of the
respondent at the time of the act in question. This means that it does
not matter if the respondent did not, for example, intend to facilitate
the commission of a serious offence, or had no knowledge that he was
conducting himself in a way that was likely to facilitate serious
crime.&#148;</div>

Hogg:
						</b> My hon. Friend is entirely right; he is anticipating
some of our later debates. He will see that in amendments that appear
further down the selection list I have incorporated the phrase
&#147;knowingly and intentionally&#148; with regard to the
facilitation offence, and I have also taken up the particular point
that my hon. Friend made, to so amend the Bill that the court is
directed to have regard to the intention and knowledge. We will come to
that debate
shortly.</div>
					<a name="07062684000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						My
hon. Friend has highlighted the fact that the facilitation offence is
strict liability in respect of something that is not an offence known
to the criminal law and which exposes the respondent to extremely
draconian risks. We need to tighten up the legislation to try to ensure
that the courts act only when they are satisfied beyond reasonable
doubt.</div>
					<a name="07062684000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have no
difficulty with my hon. Friend&#146;s word &#147;certain;&#148;
the word &#147;sure&#148; could be incorporated, but some form of
higher standard is
required.</div>
					<a name="07062684000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am well
aware that the Minister is likely to say, &#147;What about the case
of McCann?&#148; As the Committee knows, McCann is a case in the
Court of Appeal that relates to antisocial behaviour orders. It is true
that the courts apply a higher standard of proof in respect of a range
of matters that are quasi-criminal. In the McCann case, the House of
Lords indicated that the standard of proof should be virtually the same
as the criminal standard.</div>
					<a name="07062684000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">When this matter was debated in
the other place, it was conceded that the standard of proof is always
on a sliding scale: sometimes it is the full standard of proof, as
required in a criminal case; sometimes it is not, and sometimes it is
virtually the full standard. It depends on the facts of the particular
case and the degree of criminality being
asserted.</div>

importance, then we should incorporate the required standard of proof
in the

courts, &#147;We do not leave to your exclusive discretion the
minimum tariffs to be imposed for life sentences, because we think that
these things should be determined by this House&#148;. That is my

court will look at the civil standard as a sliding scale, with the

mealy-mouthed words in there? For example,</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07062684000523"></a>The
Chairman:
						</b> Order. I am listening intently to what the right
hon. and learned Gentleman is saying, but I must implore him to speak
from behind his desk, rather than to perambulate around the room; that
is not in order. So, if he would speak from his position in the way
that every other Member does, that would be very
helpful.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07062684000524"></a>Mr.
Hogg:
						</b> I will remain chained to my place, Mr.
Bercow.</div>
					<a name="07062684000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">The problem
that Baroness Scotland faced in the other place was this; although the
proposition that in serious cases involving criminality the court will
generally impose something approaching the highest standard of proof is
a correct one, it is a sliding scale, as she herself acknowledged. I
think that the sliding scale will vary depending upon the nature of the
consequences incorporated in the order and the nature of the
criminality being asserted. Therefore, she could not be more positive
than that in her assessment. However, what both she and the hon. Member
for Taunton are right in saying is that we do not know for certain the
standard of proof that the court will require in respect of the
order-making powers, and we need to know that. That is our duty, and I
say that anybody who argues otherwise is failing in their
duty.</div>
					<a name="07062684000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is
another point; it is the last point that I am going to make on this
particular measure. I can see prosecution authorities coming to the
conclusion that it would be better to use the order-making power than
to institute prosecutions, because if one looks at the order-making
power itself one will see that, in reality, one can impose a whole
range of penalties upon people against whom it is not possible to
secure a conviction. It is even worse than that, because if one looks
yet further within the Bill, one can see that the orders can be rolled
over, year after year after year. So let us pause just for a moment and
note this fact; prosecution authorities may well be tempted to use this
power, because there is a lower standard of proof required, they can
achieve very much the same effect in terms of penalty and the process
can go on for very much longer. Of course, it can also be used in
respect of unlawful fishing too, if people were foolish enough to try
that. Now, is that really something that the House of Commons should be
promoting? I leave that question hanging in the air, because the answer
is, &#147;Manifestly not.&#148;</div>

						<a name="07062684000525"></a>
							<b class="B">Nick
Herbert</b> (Arundel and South Downs) (Con): I agree with the
hon. Member for Taunton, who tabled this amendment, and with my right
hon. and learned Friend the Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column9" />Column number: 9</div>that this is a very important amendment, as it goes to the heart of what
clause 1 and part 1, which deal with the operation of serious crime
prevention orders, are about.</div>
					<a name="07062684000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">I agree with both of them that
the reason we should be concerned about the evidential
burden&#151;which is what the amendment and indeed very similar
amendments that I tabled which would have had largely the same effect
as the hon. Gentleman&#146;s amendment are about&#151;is because of
the very serious nature of the potential offences that are created by
breach of these orders and because of the nature of the restrictions
that can be placed upon an individual&#146;s freedom as a consequence
of these orders.</div>
					<a name="07062684000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
orders are very wide-ranging in their scope. Clause 2 makes it clear
that the involvement in a serious crime, which must be demonstrated if
an order is to be made by the High Court, does not need the
commissioning of any criminal offence. Indeed, the definition of
&#147;serious offence&#148;&#151;the list of potential serious
offences&#151;includes one that is actually determinable by the court
itself. We will come to all these issues in later amendments.</div>
					<a name="07062684000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">The restrictions that the High
Court is able to enforce in the making of a serious crime prevention
order are very serious ones. There is a non-exhaustive list of the
potential restrictions in the Bill. They include specifically under
clause 6(6) restrictions relating to the occupation by the individual
of their own private dwelling. Those restrictions can also apply to
third parties who may be affected by the serious crime prevention
orders but are not subject to them.</div>
					<a name="07062684000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">The penalties are very serious.
Breach of these orders carries a criminal sanction: under clause 26 a
fine or a term of up to five years&#146; imprisonment. As my right
hon. and learned Friend observed, these orders can last for five years
and they are renewable indefinitely. No system of review of the
operation of these orders has been proposed under the Bill by this
place or anybody else. Again, I hope we will come to these matters in
later amendments. All of this demonstrates that the nature of these
orders requires us to be very careful indeed before allowing this
incursion into the civil law of what is a quasi-criminal
remedy.</div>
					<a name="07062684000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Indeed, I
should observe that some of the restrictions that can be placed on
individuals under the operation of serious crime prevention orders are
actually more restrictive than those relating to control orders, where
a review process is permitted under legislation.</div>
					<a name="07062684000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">So the question is, given that these are
civil orders, not criminal orders, but ones which carry a serious
criminal sanction should they be breached, what is the correct
evidential burden? To what extent should the court be satisfied that
there has been some involvement in serious crime? Should they be
satisfied to the criminal standard which is beyond reasonable doubt, as
we propose in the amendment&#151;an alternative wording I proposed is
that the court should be certain&#151;or is it acceptable that the
far lower civil standard on the balance of probabilities should be
applied, in other words that the court need only believe that it is
likely that the person had been involved in serious crime, bearing in
mind this very wide definition of what the nature of that involvement
can be and bearing in mind that no offence need have been committed for
the person to have been so involved?</div>

							<a name="07062684000526"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> May I point out to the hon. Gentleman that clause
1(1)(a) may be an example of where you would expect the evidence to be
beyond reasonable doubt. If, however, he looks at clause 5(2)(a), which
is where a respondent is saying to a court that is trying to impose a
serious crime prevention order that, in fact, their behaviour was
reasonable and not unreasonable, it is perfectly proper in those
circumstances for the standard of proof not to be &#147;beyond
reasonable doubt&#148;, in other words the criminal standard, but to
be &#147;on the balance of probabilities&#148;. That would be
fairer to the respondent in the case.</div>

						</b> Before my hon. Friend welcomes the suggestion made
by the Minister, perhaps he would look a little more carefully at
clause 5(2)(a). He will see that there is a reverse burden of proof;
that the burden is actually on the respondent rather than on the Crown.
In any event, it is in respect of the facilitating offence, which is
not an offence known to the law. So what the Minister is actually
requiring is that, in respect of an act that is not an offence known to
the law, there should be a reverse burden of proof on the respondent to
show that what he was doing was reasonable.</div>

							<a name="07062684000529"></a>Nick
Herbert:
						</b> I agree entirely with my right hon. and learned
Friend. However, that matter is not the subject of this amendment and
not what we are discussing. We are discussing clause 1 and the original
evidential burden that will be necessary for the making of one of these
orders. No doubt, we will come on to that issue of the reverse burden
of proof in clause
5.</div>
					<a name="07062684000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">So, should we allow
these orders to be made on the balance of probabilities, or should we
allow them to be made only where there is evidence beyond reasonable
doubt that the person concerned has been involved in serious
crime?</div>
					<a name="07062684000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">Part of the
problem here has been that the Government have not been clear about
what they intend in relation to the legislation. Part of the purpose of
this amendment is to get the Government to be clear about what they
mean, and to put in the Bill a measure that I think most hon. Members
would like to see in relation to the evidential burden.</div>
					<a name="07062684000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">My right hon. and learned
Friend has already raised the issue of the McCann judgment, which has
also been raised by a number of external organisations, including
Liberty. During the Second Reading debate on 12 June, the Minister for
Security, Counter Terrorism and Police went to the trouble of trashing
Liberty&#146;s briefing on this issue. He did so in a very
uncompromising manner. He quoted the part of the briefing that
said:</div>
					<a name="07062684000443"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The

					<a name="07062684000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister for Security, Counter Terrorism and Police went on to
say:</div>
					<a name="07062684000445"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;That is
absolutely wrong. My noble and learned Friend Baroness Scotland stated
categorically in the other place that, in keeping with the House of
Lords judgment in the case of McCann, we expect that the standard of
proof required in relation to the question of whether a person has been
involved in serious crime will be the same as in criminal cases, namely
&#145;beyond reasonable doubt.&#146; Liberty&#146;s assertion is
thus entirely unfounded&#151;a bit of a
shame.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report</i>, 12 June 2007; Vol. 461,
c. 664.]</div>
					<a name="07062684000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">If that is
the case and if we are to take the word of the Minister for Security,
Counter Terrorism and Police for it, as expressed on Second Reading,
that the test is to be &#147;beyond reasonable doubt&#148;, what
possible objection can the Government have to the inclusion of those
words in the Bill by this amendment? What possible objection could they
have, given that that is the test that the Minister has said would
apply?</div>
					<a name="07062684000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">In fact, the
Minister, disgracefully, misquoted what Liberty actually said. Liberty
made it clear that there was a caveat. Although it said it was clear
that the Government intended originally to apply the test of the
balance of probabilities, it pointed to the McCann judgment and
noted:</div>
					<a name="07062684000446"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In the
context of ASBOs this does not seem to have worked...The Courts
have developed a heightened civil standard of proof which Lord Bingham
has described as, for all practical purposes, indistinguishable from
the criminal
standard&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07062684000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore, it
is the McCann case we should turn to, because, as the hon. Member for
Taunton pointed out, contrary to what the Minister said on Second
Reading, Baroness Scotland, the Minister in the House of Lords, was
talking not about beyond reasonable doubt being the correct evidential
burden for the clause but the balance of probabilities when she said
that there should be a sliding scale. She
said:</div>

							<a name="07062684000530"></a>Mr.
Hogg:
						</b> It is interesting in this context to consider
clauses 34 and 35, where the Bill makes it plain that proceedings
before the High Court and proceedings before the Crown court are civil
proceedings. When the Bill was originally drafted, the Government had
it in mind to use, if they could, the civil, bare standard of proof;
that is why, inter alia, they put this in the
Bill.</div>
					
					<a name="07062684000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07062684000531"></a>Nick
Herbert:
						</b> My right hon. and learned Friend is absolutely
correct. We do not have to rely only on our interpretation of the Bill
to realise that; we can refer to the Green Paper, &#147;New Powers
Against Organised and Financial Crime&#148;, published last July, in
which the Government proposed serious crime prevention orders for the
first time. On page 32, paragraph 3.4 of the document, they deal
specifically with the standard of proof. The Government point out that
standards of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column12" />Column number: 12</div>proof vary for the various civil orders on the statute book. In the case
of terrorist control orders the basis of the proof is reasonable
suspicion; for ASBOs, which are analogous to the serious crime
prevention orders, although the orders are civil, the legislation
refers to proof being necessary. The McCann judgment has imposed a
standard not far from the criminal one. Paragraph 3.4 of the document
continues:</div>
					<a name="07062684000448"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
believe these varying standards usefully reflect the different levels
of threat posed to society by terrorism and anti-social behaviour. In
the case of organised crime, the potential harms are somewhere between,
and we would envisage stating on the face of the legislation that to
impose an order the courts should be satisfied on the balance of
probability that the test is
met.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07062684000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
document says that the test should be on the balance of probability,
the Minister in the House of Lords says that there is a sliding scale
in relation to the balance of probabilities, but the Minister in the
House of Commons tells us that the test is beyond reasonable
doubt.</div>
					<a name="07062684000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">We should not
underestimate the importance of clarity in this matter; we are talking
about restrictions in relation to people&#146;s lives, which could be
immensely onerous, and about whether a court has to decide that it is
likely that a person has been involved with serious crime&#151;in
other words, there may be only a 51 per cent. chance that that person
has been involved in serious crime&#151;or whether the court is
certain that they have.</div>
					<a name="07062684000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">On that test will fall the
operation of these orders and the very serious conditions that can be
attached to them; freedom of assembly, which is granted under magna
carta will be compromised, and breaches of those conditions will be
very serious criminal offences. The lack of clarity in this matter is
very serious. These are not nice legal points; they go fundamentally to
the operation of these
clauses.</div>
					<a name="07062684000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
referred to the McCann judgment, which is immensely important because
it set what should be the correct evidential burden in relation to
ASBOs. The first thing to say about the McCann judgment is that it
specifically related to ASBOs, so we do not know that it will be used
by the courts in relation to serious crime prevention
orders.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07062684000532"></a>Mr.
Hogg:
						</b> What is more, it is quite plain from paragraph 3.4
of the White Paper that the Government was taking the view that you
cannot necessarily transfer the McCann judgment to the power now under
discussion because in that paragraph the distinction is made between
ASBOs and these powers. With respect to these powers, the Government is
saying that they hope, notwithstanding ASBOs, that the balance of
probability will be the test used.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07062684000533"></a>Nick
Herbert:
						</b> Again my right hon. and learned Friend is exactly
right. We cannot therefore expect the courts to rely on what has been
said in this place or what Ministers may have said when setting the
burden when it has been made quite clear that the burden is to fall
below the standard of &#147;beyond reasonable doubt&#148;. That is
in effect what is implied in the Bill and that is what was said
directly in the White
Paper.</div>
					<a name="07062684000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">The McCann
judgment in any case was completely unambiguous. There was no sliding
scale, to use the

judgment. Lord Stein, in delivering his judgment in McCann in relation
to the standard of proof
said:</div>
					<a name="07062684000088"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In my
view, pragmatism dictates that the task of magistrates should be made
more straightforward by ruling that they must in all cases under
section 1&#148;&#151;</div>

other judgment that was given on this matter by Lord Hope who
said:</div>
					<a name="07062684000450"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I would
hold that the standard of proof that ought to be applied in these cases
to allegations about the defendant&#146;s conduct is the criminal
standard.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07062684000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">So
we have the extraordinary proposition in this Bill, if the Minister
will not accept this amendment or clarify that &#147;beyond
reasonable doubt&#148; is the correct test, that in the making of an
ASBO the courts will, when following the McCann judgment, have to apply
an evidential burden which is, to use the words of Lord Chief Justice
Bingham, indistinguishable from the criminal standard. They will
therefore effectively have to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that
a person had been engaged in anti-social behaviour before they can make
that ASBO&#151;for low-level issues of anti-social
behaviour.</div>
					<a name="07062684000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">For the
operation of serious crime prevention orders, however, if
&#147;beyond reasonable doubt&#148; is not to be the test, if there
is to be some test which is lower than the evidential burden of McCann,
courts will not have to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt. For these
much more serious orders, therefore, relating to much more serious
potential offences, targeting the Mr. Bigs with very onerous
restrictions and criminal penalties attached to them, the evidential
burden for making these orders is apparently to be lower than that in
relation to ASBOs. Nobody will have the ability to review the making of
those orders.</div>
					<a name="07062684000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think
the Minister will have to provide a very clear explanation of this. If
his colleague was correct and the test is &#147;beyond reasonable
doubt&#148;, there is absolutely no reason why he should not accept
the hon. Gentleman&#146;s amendment and place that immediately on the
face of the Bill. If that is not to be the test, which is the import of
the White Paper, the Minister should say so and we will know that there
is to be this lower evidential burden for the making of these orders,
in which case the Committee and indeed this place as a whole will start
to take a very different view of the way in which these orders can be
applied. The Minister must now tell us which of the evidential burdens
is to
apply.</div>

take this opportunity to welcome all other hon. Members to the

part of the debate was interesting and important. As the right hon. and

Friends and the hon. Member for Taunton made the same

reassure hon. Members of the Government&#146;s
position.</div>
					<a name="07062684000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall
answer a couple of specific points before I make some general comments.
The hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs asserted that an order can
impose restrictions on a person who is not the subject of that order.
That is absolutely not the case; an order can place prohibitions,
restrictions, requirements or other terms only on its
subject.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07062684000535"></a>Mr.
Hogg:
						</b> The Minister understands that the Bill provides a
power for a third party to make representations if their interests are
affected. He will know that from the terms of the Bill, and we have
tabled amendments to deal with it. It follows that where a person who
is the subject of an order has restrictions placed on him that affect
his rights to trade with third parties, those third parties will be
affected.</div>

the impact on them, but they would have to be included in the order as
a subject.</div>

and learned Gentleman&#146;s other points. He mentioned Baroness
Scotland&#146;s position. She stated quite clearly that the
applicable case law was the McCann case, which discussed the civil
standard, as the right hon. and learned Gentleman knows. She stated
equally clearly that the civil standard was flexible. The civil
standard will apply to civil orders. The flexibility means that, in
relation to clause 1(1)(a), the court will be able to require a
standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt, as set out in
McCann.</div>

to clause 5(2)(a)&#151;this was the intervention that I was trying to

Downs&#151;the court can apply the lower standard of proof, that of
balance of probability. That is what we mean by a sliding

However, the rules are the rules and they will be applied without

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07062684000552"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> Perhaps we could apply a sliding scale, under
which &#147;beyond reasonable doubt&#148; would apply to the right
hon. and learned Gentleman and &#147;on the balance of
probabilities&#148; to
others.</div>
					<a name="07062684000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am afraid
that the Government must resist the amendments, as they are unnecessary
and undesirable in principle. In discussing them, I shall also try to
set out why clause 1 provides an effective and appropriate 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column16" />Column number: 16</div>test, to be met by the applicant authority before an order will be
granted by the High Court. Such orders aim to reduce the harm caused by
serious crime by preventing those engaged in it from carrying on. They
are about not punishing past actions, but preventing future engagement
in activities that cause harm to society.</div>
					<a name="07062684000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">That extremely important point
goes to the heart of the Bill. The measures are preventive, not
punitive&#151;they are about preventing harm. As I said, they are not
about punishment; if they were punitive, they would not be appropriate
for a civil order. Clause 1 sets out a two-part test that must be met
before an order is made by the High Court. The first part of the test
is a question of fact: has the proposed subject of the order been
involved in serious crime in the past? The second part is a matter for
the judgment of the court. Does it have reasonable grounds for
believing that the order will prevent future harm caused by serious
crime?</div>
					<a name="07062684000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 1 and 2 would change in clause 1 the required standard of proof to
be discharged in respect of the first limb of the test, from the civil
standard to the criminal standard of &#147;beyond reasonable
doubt&#148;. The appropriate standard of proof for such orders was
debated at some length in the other place. As can be seen from
<i class="I">Hansard</i>, there was initial confusion about what having the civil
standard of proof would mean in practice. It will be best if I clear up
any potential
misunderstandings.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07062684000553"></a>Jeremy
Wright:
						</b> On the specific point of clearing up any
misunderstandings, the Minister said that clause 1(1)(a) was a simple
matter of fact. Will he confirm that what is involved is not simply a
matter of the court looking at the person&#146;s record of previous
offences and considering whether they have committed a criminal
offence? Clause 1(1)(a) states that the High Court must be</div>
					<a name="07062684000451"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;satisfied that a person has been
involved in serious
crime&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07062684000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">&#147;Serious
crime&#148; is defined in clause 2, which goes into some of the
issues that we have discussed, such as the facilitation of</div>
					<a name="07062684000452"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the commission by another person
of a serious offence&#148;</div>
					<a name="07062684000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">or
a person&#146;s
having</div>
					<a name="07062684000453"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;conducted himself
in a way that was likely to facilitate the commission by himself or
another person of a serious
offence&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07062684000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">The issue is
not quite as straightforward as the Minister puts
it.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07062684000554"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> That is a matter of opinion; our belief is that
the vast majority of cases relating to clause 1(1)(a) would involve
people who had been convicted of a criminal
offence.</div>
					
					<a name="07062684000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07062684000555"></a>Mr.
Hogg:
						</b> Will the Minister give a reason for making that
assertion? The Bill makes the issue plain; we have only to look at
clause 2(1)(a), (b) and (c). Two of the paragraphs deal with
facilitation; only one deals with the commission of an offence. Why
should we suppose that the commission of a serious offence will be the
majority
case?</div>
					
					<a name="07062684000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07062684000556"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> I said that we believed that the majority of such
cases would involve people who had been 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column17" />Column number: 17</div>convicted of a criminal charge and that the serious crime prevention
order would be applied alongside that. On facilitation, the High Court
would have to be satisfied that the person had been involved in serious
crime. So different measures of the Bill refer to different people, who
may then be made subject of a serious crime prevention order. As I say,
the application of the Bill would be different for different people,
which is the essence of why we believe, with respect to a civil order,
there would be a sliding scale of evidence, because it would be
different in different circumstances for different people.</div>
					<a name="07062684000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I said, the civil standard
of proof is a flexible one. The House of Lords, in the case of McCann,
decided that, for ASBOs, the standard of proof that the courts should
apply when deciding if a person has acted in an antisocial manner
should be the same as the criminal standard, which is &#147;beyond
reasonable doubt&#148;. To quote Lord Steyn in the McCann
judgments:</div>
					<a name="07062684000454"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Having
concluded that the relevant proceedings are civil, in principle it
follows that the standard of proof ordinarily applicable in civil
proceedings, namely the balance of probabilities, should
apply.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07062684000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, I agree
that, given the seriousness of the matters involved, at least some
reference to the heightened civil standard would usually be necessary.
Lord Bingham of Cornhill went on to
observe:</div>
					<a name="07062684000455"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The heightened
civil standard and the criminal standard are virtually
indistinguishable.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07062684000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the McCann judgment, therefore, the House of Lords is laying out for
us, in case law, what would be the appropriate standard of proof with
respect to civil orders. The hon. Members for Arundel and South Downs
and for Taunton made the point that, although the McCann judgment
relates to ASBOs, many of the principles from the case have been
applied in relation to other civil injunctive orders and we can expect
them to apply in relation to serious crime prevention orders.</div>
					<a name="07062684000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 1(1)(a)
says:</div>
					<a name="07062684000456"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The High
Court in England and Wales may make an order
if&#151;</div>
					<a name="07062684000457"></a><div class="hs_brev">(a) it is
satisfied that a person has been involved in serious crime (whether in
England and Wales or
elsewhere)&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07062684000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">For clarity,
let me say that we expect that, with respect to clause 1(1)(a), the
standard of proof, as laid out in the McCann judgment, would be
virtually identical to the criminal standard of proof. Baroness
Scotland has said that in the House of Lords. I have repeated that
here. I hope that that gives some reassurance to the hon. Member for
Taunton. By saying that the criminal standard of proof is beyond
reasonable doubt, through McCann and in the statements that Baroness
Scotland has made in the House of Lords and that I have made in this
House, that shows that we expect that the standard of proof, with
respect to that first limb in clause 1(1)(a), to be virtually identical
to the criminal
standard.</div>

Hogg:
						</b> Does the hon. Gentleman not understand that this
Committee finds it very difficult to reconcile what the Minister has
just said with what is in his White Paper, in paragraph 3.4, which was
published long after McCann? In that paragraph, there is a specific
reference to McCann and it goes on to
say:</div>

to do is to set out not what is in the White Paper but what is relevant
to the Bill that is going through Parliament now. What was said by
Baroness Scotland in the House of Lords, in answer to questions by many
of his hon. Friends in the other place, was to reassure them that, as
far as the Government are concerned, the judgment in McCann in the
House of Lords will inform the practice when it comes to the
implementation of serious crime prevention orders. It is perfectly
reasonable for him to quote the White Paper, but it is also perfectly
reasonable for me to say that, notwithstanding what is in the White
Paper, I am saying in this Committee, in the House of Commons, as
Baroness Scotland said on the Floor in the House of Lords, what we
expect the standard of proof to be, with respect to clause 1(1)(a). I
hope that that reassures him; to repeat myself, notwithstanding what it
says in the White Paper, what is relevant and appropriate is what has
been said by Baroness Scotland in another place and what I have said
here.</div>

the Minister not understand that his assurances are not sufficient to
allay concerns? There is no guarantee that the courts will apply the
McCann judgment to these offences, which are more serious than those
requiring ASBOs. If what he says is correct and his intention is that
the evidential standard should be &#147;beyond reasonable

understand entirely that he is attempting to reassure 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column19" />Column number: 19</div>the Committee. Does he accept, however, that the difficulty is that,
owing to the seriousness of the orders that could be made under the
legislation, whether civil or criminal&#151;we will argue about that
later&#151;it is important that the Bill is clear about what an
individual may face, before they are made, and what standard of proof
they are expected to meet? It is peculiar in the extreme that he is
really saying that he expects the courts to clarify that matter at a

Lord Bingham of Cornhill observed that the heightened civil standard
and the criminal standard are virtually indistinguishable. I have tried
to reassure the Committee and to demonstrate our belief that, with
respect to the first limb in clause 1(1)(a), we expect the civil and
criminal standards to be virtually
indistinguishable.</div>
					<a name="07062684000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are saying also that there are other elements to the making of the
serious crime prevention orders in which we expect that the standard of
proof will not necessarily be at that level. That was the point that I
was trying to make to the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs, but
I was accused of not understanding. I was trying to point out that,
with respect to clause 5(2)(a), notwithstanding the reverse burden of
proof, which means that it is for the respondent to prove that their
actions were reasonable in the face of an SCPO from the applicant
authority saying that they were unreasonable, we think that it would be
much fairer and better for the respondent in a civil court to
demonstrate that their behaviour was reasonable on the balance of
probability, rather than on the balance of &#147;beyond reasonable
doubt&#148;. That was the only point that I was trying to draw
attention to. It is a sliding scale and, of course, therefore, courts
must have the discretion, when deciding whether to apply a serious
crime prevention order, to apply the appropriate standard of proof,
depending on which part of the proceedings is being dealt
with.</div>

							<b class="B">Ian
Lucas</b> (Wrexham) (Lab): Does my hon. Friend agree that the
central difficulty is that those who propose the amendment do not
recognise that the Bill is intended to deal with situations that are
not currently covered by criminal law? It is for that reason that the
clause contains civil proceedings. The purpose of the Bill is to
protect victims of crime who are not currently protected by criminal
law, so the orders have a civil burden of proof&#151;they are civil
orders, after all. The sliding scale is necessary to cover
circumstances in which victims of crime are not currently covered. That
is the entire purpose of the Bill.</div>

							<a name="07062684000564"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> My hon. Friend makes an excellent point. To
reinforce what I was trying to say, we do not want to punish past
actions. The orders are not punitive; we will not be saying, &#147;As
a result of you being found guilty of this, this is your
punishment.&#148; That will be a matter for the criminal process. As
my hon. Friend points out, we are trying to reduce harm and prevent
further crime. As that is the aim of part 1 of the Bill, it is entirely
appropriate for the civil process to be
used.</div>
					
					<a name="07062684000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07062684000565"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Crispin Blunt</b> (Reigate) (Con): The Minister says that the
orders are not about punishment, but his own party&#146;s former
Attorney-General, the noble Lord Morris of Aberavon, said in another
place that we were</div>
					<a name="07062684000460"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;in a
situation that inevitably is in the same ballpark as a criminal penalty
by the restrictions set out in subsection (3), that is in reality
nothing more or less than a criminal
penalty.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 7
March 2007; Vol. 690, c.
240.]</div>
					<a name="07062684000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">So we are talking about
things that amount to a pretty serious punishment, however the Minister
attempts to dress them
up.</div>
					<a name="07062684000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the sliding
scale, the implication in the White Paper and elsewhere is that there
should be a lower standard. When there is a serious risk of terrorist
offences, the test is on the balance of probabilities. If it is
assessed that there should be an intervention to prevent a serious
threat to society, a lower burden of proof is required for the state to
intervene. The McCann judgment on ASBOs, which are on a less serious
threat to society, was that the criminal burden of proof should apply.
I have to
say&#151;</div>

							<a name="07062684000568"></a>Mr.

						</b> I am trying, as always, to be reasonable and fair
in giving way to hon. Members, but I take your point about brevity,
Mr. Bercow, and will bear it in
mind.</div>
					<a name="07062684000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the point
made by the hon. Member for Reigate about Lord Morris and punishment,
the orders are called prevention orders because they are about
preventing future crime to reduce harm. The restrictions placed on an
individual by the High Court are about trying to prevent an occurrence
in the future, not about punishing people for what they have done. The
hon. Gentleman may sigh, but that is the fundamental purpose of the
orders&#151;to prevent crime and reduce the possibility of serious
harm.</div>
					<a name="07062684000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the hon.
Gentleman looks again at the McCann judgment, he will see that it will
apply to serious crime prevention orders. The whole point made in the
judgment was that such are the serious consequences of orders being
imposed on people through due process that, in serious cases, one would
expect the standard of proof to be close, or virtually identical, to
the criminal 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column21" />Column number: 21</div>standard. The hon. Gentleman might not accept that. His colleagues might
go to the House of Lords to argue that the McCann judgment was wrong
and that all the Lords involved had got things wrong and misunderstood
the process. That is a point of view and the judgment that the hon.
Gentleman and his hon. Friends have made, but the Government accept the
McCann judgment and the point that there should be a sliding scale for
the standard of proof for civil orders.</div>
					<a name="07062684000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given the seriousness of some
of the allegations that are made against people&#151;the hon.
Gentleman made the point about terrorism&#151;and some of the
restrictions that are placed on people as a consequence of the High
Court taking action, the standard of proof should be virtually
identical. All I am saying is that the Government accept that. That is
the Government&#146;s position on the very serious issues covered in
clause 1(1)(a), and whether the hon. Gentleman agrees with it or not, I
hope that I have made it clear. We expect the standard of proof in this
case to be virtually identical to the criminal
standard.</div>
					
					<a name="07062684000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07062684000569"></a>Mr.
Blunt:
						</b> I am confused because the implication of the
sliding scale is that the more serious the offence&#151;the more
serious the threat to society&#151;the lower the burden of the proof.
That is the implication of the treatment of terrorism as opposed to
ASBOs. In other words, a lower burden of proof is required for the
state to intervene in respect of terrorism than in respect of ASBOs.
The implication of the arguments that the Government advanced in
another context is that the burden of proof would be lower, and I am
rather confused about where serious crime fits in the scale. The Bill
should not leave the Committee in a confused state, and these matters
should be set out absolutely clearly in the
Bill.</div>
					
					<a name="07062684000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07062684000570"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> It is not confused at all. It gives the High Court
discretion and allows it to understand that, as far as Parliament is
concerned, there is a sliding scale for the standard of proof. Perhaps
I can repeat what I said before, because this is an extremely important
point, and I hope that hon. Members will forgive me. Such is the
seriousness of the test in clause 1(1)(a)&#151;the first of the two
tests&#151;that we would expect the standard of proof, consistent
with the McCann judgment, to be virtually identical to the criminal
standard. There are other aspects, however, where the balance of
probability would be used.</div>
					<a name="07062684000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I said, this may be a matter
of disagreement between us, but my comments about what the standard of
proof in clause 1(1)(a) should be will be perfectly clear when we read
the transcripts of this Committee, just as Baroness Scotland&#146;s
comments in the other place are perfectly
clear.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07062684000571"></a>Mr.
Hogg:
						</b> We are looking now at the issue of facilitating
somebody who has committed, or is going to commit, a serious offence.
Is the Minister saying that the courts will apply the criminal standard
in respect of the two elements of the standard of proof, or will they
apply a criminal standard to one element and a civil standard to the
other? They will have to decide, first, whether there is facilitation,
and secondly, whether another person has committed, or is going to
commit, a serious offence.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07062684000572"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> I am saying that there is a sliding scale, which
the High Court can use as appropriate. Given the seriousness of some
aspects of the orders, we would expect the standard of proof to be
virtually identical to the criminal standard.</div>
					<a name="07062684000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is not the only question
in the Bill to which a standard of proof must be applied, and I alluded
to that earlier. For example, when the court is deciding whether a
person&#146;s actions were reasonable and should therefore be
disregarded, as set out in clause 5, we would expect the courts to use
the flexibility of the civil test and to apply the lowest possible
standard, the balance of probabilities, because the burden is on the
subject to demonstrate the reasonableness of the actions. They are
civil orders, so it is right that the civil standard of proof should
apply. As a result, I urge the Committee to resist the
amendment.</div>
					<a name="07062684000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
intention of the hon. Member for Taunton is to make the applicable
standard &#147;beyond reasonable doubt&#148;, but the House of
Lords has already done so; I hope that what I have said reassures him
that the amendment is unnecessary and that he will feel able to
withdraw it. Amendment No. 16 would achieve the same end, so I ask the
hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs not to press it
further.</div>
					<a name="07062684000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 17 would alter the threshold in relation to the second limb of the
test. As I said, following McCann the second limb of the test in
subsection (1)(b) will not be subject to a standard of proof as such,
because it is a question of judgment and not of fact. It is not
possible to prove something that might happen in future. The same
argument applies to amendments Nos. 119 and 124 to clauses 20 and 21,
on the power of the Crown court to make or to vary an order. The
intention may be to require the second limb of the test to be proved,
but I hope to have explained why it is not appropriate&#151;although
the amendment may be aimed at probing the appropriate threshold for the
test in subsection (1)(b).</div>
					<a name="07062684000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments Nos. 51 and 52 seem
to be aimed at the same question. We believe that we have set the
threshold at the appropriate level. The courts must have reasonable
grounds for believing that an order would protect the public. They must
therefore have an objective basis for such a belief. The courts are
used to applying the test of reasonableness, and it presents a
significant hurdle for the applicant authority to meet it without it
being so high as to make things unworkable.
</div>
					<a name="07062684000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that the hon.

						</b> I want to step back from the nitty-gritty for a
moment, and consider why the amendment is so fundamental. It goes to
the heart of people&#146;s objection to the Bill. The expectation of
residents and citizens of the United Kingdom is that if they were to
commit an offence and be caught by the police, they would go to court.
They would be put before a jury and if found guilty they would be
convicted.</div>
					<a name="07062684000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						However, we
are talking about people who may never have committed any criminal
offence. I get the feeling that the Government are saying, &#147;We
know who these people are, we know who the troublemakers are, and if we
cannot get them through the normal conventional
procedures&#148;&#151;they were established over many hundreds of
years&#151;&#147;we will come up with a lower threshold so that we

described in the Bill as serious. Indeed, salmon fishing was mentioned
earlier. Sadly, I do not own a salmon pond, but if I did I would
doubtless find it deeply objectionable if others were illegally to fish
in it. I have not visited the constituencies of all the Labour members
of the Committee, so I do not know whether it would be regarded as a
serious crime in those places, but I have my doubts. Then there are
areas such as the pirating of DVDs. DVD pirating is an offence, and it
might be one that people take seriously, but is it in the same category
as some of the other offences in the Bill? In any case, the Secretary
of State has the power to amend the list at any
point.</div>
					<a name="07062684000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">As has been
touched on, the sanctions are in some circumstances an extremely
serious curtailment of the liberty of the individual, including, for
example, the individual&#146;s right to travel freely in the United
Kingdom. That kind of restriction is normally associated with more
draconian regimes than we have traditionally had in this country.
Ultimately, somebody who breaches the conditions could find themselves
spending five years in prison&#151;a considerable period even if they
might quality for the early release scheme that the Prime Minister
outlined to his great discomfort in the House of Commons last
Wednesday. In addition, their reputation as an individual, as a
business man or business woman, or as a citizen could be compromised or
even destroyed.</div>

Lord Chancellor, as large as the Lord Chancellor&#146;s tum, might be
another approach one could use. It is not unparliamentary to refer to
the fatness of a person, Mr. Bercow; at least, I have never
heard that it is so. On subsection

						We
come to the serious point: what are the criteria on which the court
should determine the matter? The Committee has already been referred to
the breadth of clause 6(3), in which the extent of the order-making
powers is sketched out. Although the Minister said that they are not
punitive&#151;that may not be the purpose; the purpose may be
preventive&#151;there is no doubt that the consequences are punitive
because they can restrict people&#146;s liberty in an extensive way,
and guidance should be given to the courts. They should not simply be
asked to determine whether it is appropriate; there should be more
precise tests. They should be required to ask themselves whether it is
necessary, just and proportionate to make one of these
orders.</div>
					<a name="07062684000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
earlier used the word &#147;proportionate&#148; when he asked me
whether I was really suggesting that the High Court would not make an
order that was proportionate, and I reminded him of the language of my
amendment. I am very anxious that the word
&#147;proportionate&#148; should appear in the Bill because I wish
to protect the civil liberties of my fellow citizens; whether or not
they are criminals, they have their rights to be protected. The least
we can do is to oblige the courts to ask themselves the question I have
set out: is the order in question necessary, is it just, is it
proportionate? To suggest that the word &#147;appropriate&#148;
necessarily involves those tests is plain
wrong.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07062684000604"></a>Jeremy
Wright:
						</b> My right hon. and learned Friend said that all our
fellow citizens have rights that are in need of protection, whether or
not they are criminals. Does he agree that the point of the debate is
that those subject to these penalties would not, in the
Minister&#146;s words, be criminals, because they would not be
responsible for criminal
offences?</div>
					
					<a name="07062684000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07062684000605"></a>Mr.
Hogg:
						</b> Exactly. Even as I uttered the phrase I was
conscious that I was only stating part of the fact, as I was going for
brevity on this occasion. But my hon. Friend is entirely right: many of
the people who will be affected by the orders will not have committed
criminal offences. They will be people against whom it is said that
they have facilitated someone else&#146;s criminal offence. Surely
the very least we can do for them is to ensure that the relevant term
of the order is just, necessary and proportionate. It is the very least
that a House that should be safeguarding the rights of its constituents
should require.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07062684000606"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> Let me start by repeating something that the right
hon. and learned Gentleman said. It is important to place it on the
record, lest there be any misunderstanding. I do not believe that any
member of this Committee would play fast and loose with the civil
liberties of citizens of this country. People may have different ideas
about how to protect civil liberties, but I do not believe that any of
us do not see them as important. As the hon. Member for Rugby and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column26" />Column number: 26</div>Kenilworth said, we all also believe that everyone has rights. All of us
on this Committee accept that. It is important to lay it on the table.
I do not believe that any member of this Committee does not feel that
the rights of individuals are important. There will be differences
between us about how we protect those rights, but that does not
undermine the fact that we support them and feel that the civil
liberties of citizens of this country are
important.</div>
					<a name="07062684000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 53 and 120 seek to amend clause 1(3), and the similar provision
for orders in the Crown court in clause 20, by changing the word
&#147;appropriate&#148; to &#147;necessary, just and
proportionate&#148;. Those provisions establish the test that the
court must apply when deciding on the terms included in an order.
Placing a requirement on the court to act justly and proportionately is
unnecessary, because it simply reflects principles by which the court
will already abide in making the orders. There is no need to tell the
High Court to be just or proportionate in legislation. As I made clear
in an earlier intervention on the right hon. and learned Gentleman, the
High Court has an obligation as a public authority under human rights
legislation to ensure that everything that it does is just and
proportionate.</div>
					<a name="07062684000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">As for
a requirement that the terms of an order be necessary, we believe that
we have set the standard in clauses 1(3) and 25 at the right level,
striking a balance in requiring the test to be sufficiently tough to
ensure that an order will be proportionate but not so tough that it can
never be met.</div>
					<a name="07062684000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
those reasons, I ask the right hon. and learned Gentleman to withdraw
his amendments. We have already discussed the principles running
through clause 1 and have considered the test in clause 1(1) in detail.
We believe that the orders will provide a valuable new tool for law
enforcement, and that the test in clause 1 lies at the heart of the
legislative and procedural framework that will ensure that they are
proportionate.</div>

be seriously

					<a name="07062684000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister suggests that the word &#147;appropriate&#148; necessarily
encapsulates the concepts of necessity, justice and proportion. I do
not agree. It means something different. It may include them in part,
but it is not obliged to, and there may be things included in
&#147;appropriate&#148; that fall outside the test of necessity,
justice and proportion. I did not hear him say in any terms that my
test was wrong in principle; he merely said that it was unnecessary. I
do not share that view, and for that reason I will not withdraw the
amendment. I hope that it will be voted
on.</div>

							<a name="07062684000623"></a>Mr.
Hogg:
						</b> I am not going to repeat at length the points that I
have made already because that would be otiose. The Committee will by
now have learnt that I am a strong enemy of the clause. I could be
persuaded that it is right to make a serious crime prevention order in
respect of a person who has been convicted of a serious offence,
provided that the concept of a serious offence is redefined. We will
come to that in the next group of amendments. I think that there are no
circumstances in which I could sensibly be persuaded that the
facilitator should be the subject of a serious crime prevention order
unless the standards of proof are raised substantially. That has not
happened as a result of the Committee&#146;s
decisions.</div>
					<a name="07062684000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">I repeat
that these are orders of a very, very draconian kind. They can be made
against people who have committed fairly trivial offences&#151;an
issue that we will come to. They can also be made in respect of people
who have committed no criminal offence at all. It is no good saying
that they are not punitive, but preventive. One has to look at the
consequences. Although the motives might be different, the consequences
are much the same; indeed, they can be worse. I hope that the Committee
will take the view that the clause should not be passed in its present
form.</div>
					
					<a name="07062684000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07062684000624"></a>Nick
Herbert:
						</b> We, too, have serious concerns about the
operation of the clause. I have tabled proposals, but because they
amount to new clauses, they cannot be considered now. They would
introduce a review regime in respect of the operation of serious crime
prevention orders. Since the orders are analogous to control orders, we
feel that it is perfectly reasonable that, as happens with control
orders, this place should appoint an independent reviewer to advise on
their operation and subject them to a regular review so that we can be
certain of how they are being
used.</div>
					<a name="07062684000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">A difficulty for
the Committee in deciding whether to support this power is that we are
unclear as to the extent to which it may be used and how many orders
may be made. Many concerns about the ambit of the orders have already
been set out and we will discuss them further in respect of later
amendments. However, it is of concern to us that when given the
opportunity, the Minister chose not to clarify the evidential burden in
the Bill&#151;a matter central to the operation of serious crime
prevention orders. His argument that different evidential burdens are
required in different parts of the legislation frankly does not wash,
because he could easily have accepted an amendment just to the
main substantive provision, clause 1(1)(a), but he did not.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column28" />Column number: 28</div>
					<a name="07062684000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the operation of the clause,
it is also important that we examine how exactly the powers may be
employed and in what particular circumstances. It is clear from what
the Government have said that the provision may be used as an
alternative to prosecution. Indeed, the July 2006 paper, &#147;New
powers against organised and financial crime&#148;&#151;we have
still not clarified whether it is a White Paper or a Green
Paper&#151;makes it clear on page
31:</div>
					<a name="07062684000465"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;There are
also...likely to be cases where orders are an appropriate tool as
an alternative to prosecution. In practice, law enforcement and
prosecutors need to make difficult decisions around putting cases
together for court. The courts have reasonable practical and case
management reasons for objecting to over-large trials. But in the case
of organised crime investigations, there may be significant numbers of
individuals at the fringes who cannot be pursued in the main trial, and
for whom a separate trial is not thought worthwhile. Such
individuals&#146; role might have been marginal and not warrant a
prosecution, but an order might be sufficient to deter future criminal
activity.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07062684000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
regard that position as absolutely unacceptable. It is effectively an
argument of resources to say that the state will not mount a criminal
prosecution, not because of a lack of evidence, but because it is, in
the words of the Green Paper, &#147;not thought worthwhile&#148; to
pursue a prosecution. Of course, a prosecution could not proceed unless
the Crown Prosecution Service was satisfied that there was a reasonable
chance of its success in the first place. We fear not only that the
measures will become an alternative to prosecution, but that they are
intended as such, and that the authorities will choose the line of
least resistance and apply for the order.</div>

							<a name="07062684000625"></a>Mr.

						</b> Before my hon. Friend moves on from the Green Paper,
I should like to make the point that at the bottom of page 31, it
includes the words:</div>
					<a name="07062684000466"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;and
for the court in deciding whether it would be proportionate to make
it.&#148;</div>

							<a name="07062684000626"></a>Nick
Herbert:
						</b> My right hon. and learned Friend has successfully
made his point. Of course, the court will show regard to what the Green
Paper says is the intention of the legislation. To be fair to the
Government, I must say that they have never demurred from outlining
their objective, which is to set out an alternative&#151;&#151;in
part&#151;&#151;to prosecution, in relation to the prevention of
serious crime.</div>
					<a name="07062684000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
not just the official Opposition who have concerns about the potential
for the legislation to be used as an alternative to prosecution. The
Law Society has expressed similar concerns:</div>
					<a name="07062684000467"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Where there is evidence
that a person is engaged in criminal activity, that evidence should be
gathered with a view to prosecuting them. We fear the proposed orders
are a measure of expediency to deal with cases where a prosecution is
not possible because there is insufficient
evidence.&#148;</div>
					
					<a name="07062684000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07062684000627"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> To eliminate any doubt, I should point out that
where an offence can be prosecuted, the Government would expect it to
be prosecuted. If someone commits a criminal offence that requires
prosecution, we would want them to be prosecuted. We are talking about
the reduction of harm and the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column29" />Column number: 29</div>prevention of future crime. The measures are serious crime prevention
orders. Where appropriate, the Government would expect people to be
prosecuted.</div>
					
					<a name="07062684000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07062684000628"></a>Nick
Herbert:
						</b> It is all very well for the Minister to say that.
The Government&#146;s Green Paper sets out a number of case studies.
Case study D, on page 33,
says:</div>
					<a name="07062684000468"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;R runs a
business inviting people to participate in bogus
&#145;competitions&#146; in return for personal details. In
practice, the prizes offered are almost worthless, and there is no
commercial rationale for the operation. The sole purpose of the
mailshots is to identify likely future candidates for advanced fee
fraud. These frauds are either carried out by R, or he sells on his
mailing lists. Law enforcement applies for a prevention order
prohibiting R from engaging in any activity involving large scale
mailshots.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07062684000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Green
Paper envisages that, in those circumstances, the serious crime
prevention orders will be used to prevent the individual from
undertaking such fraudulent activity. If there is evidence, as set out
in the case study, that the individual is engaged in that activity, why
would not that individual be prosecuted? If it is due to insufficient
evidence, that gives rise to the question whether potentially, on a
lower evidential burden than would be accepted in a criminal trial,
greater restrictions could be placed on his liberty than would be
applied on criminal conviction. They could last for five years, but
would potentially be renewable by the High Court indefinitely. It is
the uncertain ambit of the provisions and the seriousness of the
restrictions that can be imposed with regard to an individual&#146;s
freedom that cause us to be concerned about the scope of clause 1, if
not its intention.</div>
					<a name="07062684000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">Magna Carta&#146;s key
provision on the liberty of individuals still remains in force in
English law. Chapter 29 of Magna Carta
states:</div>
					<a name="07062684000469"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;No
Freeman shall be taken or imprisoned, or be disseised of his Freehold,
or Liberties, or free Customs, or be outlawed, or exiled, or any other
wise destroyed; nor will We not pass upon him, nor condemn him, but by
lawful judgment of his Peers, or by the Law of the
Land.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07062684000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of course it is
open to this place to change the law of the land, but as the hon.
Member for Taunton said, we should use the greatest care before
allowing any incursion on that fundamental principle of liberty.
Without the reviews that apply in relation to control orders, and
without the parliamentary safeguards or the placing of the evidential
burden on a statutory basis, and bearing in mind the likely attitude of
the Government to subsequent amendments about the scope of the
Bill&#151;going by what we have heard from the Government this
morning, a disagreement about that is likely&#151;I am not persuaded
that we can accept serious crime prevention orders in the form in which
they are now presented.</div>

							<a name="07062684000646"></a>Mr.
Hogg:
						</b> The amendments all stand in my name, and I straight
away acknowledge that their purpose is to change the architecture of
the Bill. I have tried to change the definition of a serious offence.
As the Committee will appreciate, a serious offence is defined in
schedule 1 to the Bill. It is, incidentally, an amendable schedule.
That is, the Secretary of State can amend the contents of schedule 1 to
delete or for that matter include items. I think that the clause is at
the heart of the debate. Although the phrase &#147;a serious
offence&#148; sounds weighty, the schedule shows that many of the
offences are hardly of a character to qualify for the draconian orders
that the Committee is
considering.</div>
					<a name="07062684000305"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would
be possible for me to go on at great length, but you would accuse me of
filibustering, Mr. Bercow. I could read out the whole
schedule, but I am not going to do so. I shall identify some matters,
and I make the point that because I am not going to read out the whole
schedule, I do not want to hear the Government Whip say later that we
are taking too much time. I could take a lot more time if I wanted to,
and it may be helpful to keep that in
mind.&#151;<i class="I">[</i>

					<a name="07062684000322"></a><div class="hs_Para">a serious
offence?</div>
					<a name="07062684000323"></a><div class="hs_Para">My point is
that anyone looking at the schedule will be struck by the fact that it
is a rag-bag of offences, some of which are grave and some not, but all
are classified as serious offences, in respect of which a serious crime
prevention order can be made. That is deeply offensive, because it is
not just that a person could be convicted of those offences and give
rise to the making of an order, but that that person could be
facilitating another person at arm&#146;s length from the unlawful
fishing, and I suppose that an order would apply to the person who
sends the unlawful instrument to the fisherman, and so on. It is not
right.</div>
					<a name="07062684000324"></a><div class="hs_Para">What should we
do? Let us assume for a moment&#151;this is a big
assumption&#151;that we should go down the road of having a serious
crime prevention order. We should try to define what we mean by a
&#147;serious crime&#148; that attracts such an order. I do not
believe that it is possible to do that by categorisation without
exposure to ridicule, which is what the Government have done. Better by
far is to look at sentences, because they are a mark of whether an
offence is serious. The court will have considered all the facts and
come to a view, and the sentence will reflect the court&#146;s view
of the gravity of the
offence.</div>
					<a name="07062684000325"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have
selected as my criterion an immediate term of imprisonment of seven
years, but I do not suggest for a moment that that should be writ in
concrete. The Government might not like seven years, and might suggest
five or 10 years. I would not quarrel with that, and that might be a
sensible way forward, but we should not try to categorise offences. We
should determine whether an offence is serious by reason of the penalty
that it attracts. That is a much better way of determining whether
something is truly serious and of a quality to attract an
order.</div>
					<a name="07062684000326"></a><div class="hs_Para">One technical
point which the Committee will have observed is that we also have to
deal with life sentences and what are known as IPPs&#151;imprisonment
for public protection. As the Committee will know, the courts now have
extended powers to impose extended sentences and life sentences. This
has to be addressed and as the technical way forward I suggest that the
seven-year test should be incorporated as being relevant to the period
at which point the parole board can safely consider whether the person
can be safely released. This matter is not set in concrete&#151;one
could have five or 10 years. It is a matter for debate. What I do think
is wrong is the categorisation.</div>

							<a name="07062684000649"></a>Mr.
Browne:
						</b> I am seeking clarification. Would the right hon.
and learned Gentleman explain to the Committee what would happen if two
people, perhaps from different parts of the country, had committed the
same offence but in the first case the person had been sentenced to six
years&#146; imprisonment and in the second case the person had been
sentenced to eight years&#146; imprisonment? Would this mean that,
even though the offence was identical, in one case it was regarded as
serious and in the other case it was not?</div>
					
					<a name="07062684000328"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07062684000650"></a>Mr.
Hogg:
						</b> It is unlikely to arise in this sense: if they were
co-defendants in one trouble, of course the judge would have regard to
the impact&#151;I take the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point. If they
were co-defendants convicted for precisely the same offence the judge
could determine whether it was just. If they were not convicted on the
same indictment or in separate trials then one must not assume that the
offences are the same because the degree of culpability within a
particular offence can vary substantially.</div>
					<a name="07062684000329"></a><div class="hs_Para">None the less, the same point
is also raised under the existing Bill. Under the existing Bill the
fact that something is a schedule offence only triggers the ability to
make the order; it does not require the making of the order. It is
possible to have precisely the same situation arising on the existing
Bill as on my suggested reshaping of the architecture.</div>
					<a name="07062684000330"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not therefore think that
there is anything fundamentally difficult about this. We obviously
could get orders made that are differential, I accept that, but I do
not think that goes to the heart of the

						</b> Does the right hon. and learned Gentleman accept
that a sentence and the length of a sentence necessarily reflects not
the offence but the individual who is sentenced by the court? It is
perfectly possible, therefore, for an identical offence to be committed
by two individuals and for them to receive two different sentences
before the same court.</div>

							<a name="07062684000652"></a>Mr.
Hogg:
						</b> Of course, a sentence reflects a number of things.
As a general rule, Parliament only applies maximum sentences. There are
mandatory sentences, particularly for murder and some other crimes, but
it is very rare. When a court imposes a sentence it is doing at least
three things. First, it is addressing the offence itself&#151;the
offence on which the person is charged. Secondly, it is addressing the
question of the culpability of that particular individual. Thirdly, it
could also be considering public protection. I am sure that I could
think of other considerations that come into play when a court is
concluding a sentence. For the same offence, however, there are often
quite different sentences reflecting differing degrees of culpability,
differing backgrounds of individual offenders and actually within the
same offence differences as to mode and conduct. So of course there are
different penalties.

							<a name="07062684000653"></a>Ian

						</b> Is the right hon. and learned Gentleman now
undermining the essence of the argument that he is advancing by relying
on the sentence imposed by the court?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07062684000654"></a>Mr.
Hogg:
						</b> No, because we come back to this basic point, which
is that we are providing for a very 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column35" />Column number: 35</div>draconian order. I do not think anybody can seriously dispute that.
Given that we are going down this road at all, the question is how to
define that class of offence which should trigger such a draconian
power. We have to bear it in mind that it relates not only to offences
that the person who is to be the subject of the order has committed,
but offences that he has not committed but may have facilitated a third
party to commit.</div>
					<a name="07062684000335"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
accept that there are two choices. We could try to categorise offences
in a schedule that is amendable&#151;I dislike that intensely. Or we
could let the court decide what is truly serious. The way that a court
decides what is truly serious, generally speaking, is by reference to
the sentence. If I have to go down this road, which I very much dislike
because I dislike part 1 of the Bill intensely, I would very much
rather use the sentence imposed by the court as a criterion than
anything else. That is not to say that that situation is perfect, but I
am against the Bill anyway, and I am trying to improve a bad Bill. I am
sure that using the categorisation is wrong. I am perfectly prepared to
listen to alternative arguments about the length of sentence, because
the sentence is a better way forward.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07062684000655"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> I thank the right hon. and learned Gentleman for
the way in which he made his points. I shall pick him up on a couple of
them, but I say to the Committee that it is easy to try to undermine
the whole schedule by pointing to one or two aspects that, taken out of
context, we do not regard as serious crime. The right hon. and learned
Gentleman mentioned fishing for or poaching the odd salmon here and
there. Although it is an easy debating point to make, none of us would
expect a judge in the High Court to impose a serious crime prevention
order on somebody poaching one trout or
salmon.</div>
					
					<a name="07062684000337"></a><div class="hs_Para">

							<a name="07062684000657"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> Or a red herring.</div>
					<a name="07062684000339"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is important to put that
point to the Committee. Points of debate are one thing, but using them
to try to trivialise the schedule is another. I cannot conceive of a
situation in which the High Court would act in the way that was
suggested. Since environmental crime was pointed out, many of our
constituents and, indeed, many people in the country would think that
the type of environmental crime that the schedule refers to is an
extremely important crime which should be regarded as serious; and
given the increasing importance of environmental issues, many people
would wonder why it had not been included in the schedule.</div>
					<a name="07062684000340"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although the right hon. and
learned Gentleman mentioned that some Lords had pointed to small-scale
poaching, other Lords pointed out the serious nature of organised
poaching. I think it was Lord Dear&#151;I apologise if I am
incorrect&#151;who referred to an incident in which explosives had
been used to reach a number of salmon or trout. He regarded it as very
serious, and he was right. We all agree on the inclusion of offences
such as arms and drugs trafficking, which are easy examples. There are
other offences through 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column36" />Column number: 36</div>which people seek to ridicule the schedule, but on a moment&#146;s
proper reflection, they are properly and appropriately
included.</div>
					<a name="07062684000341"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments would be made to the definition of a serious offence for the
purposes of this part of the Bill. We will return to the issue later
when we discuss schedule 1 in more detail, but perhaps it would be
helpful to discuss the concept of a schedule approach now, and the
specific content when we discuss the proposed amendments to the
schedule. I do not propose to refer directly to each amendment; I hope
that the Committee will find it more useful if I talk to the broad
principles in question.</div>
					
					<a name="07062684000486"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.30 pm</div>
					<a name="07062684000342"></a><div class="hs_Para">First, the amendments would
change the approach in the Bill and replace it with one based on a
tariff of seven years. I ask the Committee to resist the amendments. It
will help if I explain why the Bill is drafted as it is. Those who
commit serious crime do not and will not limit themselves to a certain
set of crimes because we set out what that list should be in this
House. We need to be realistic; serious criminals are intelligent and
adaptable people who see themselves as business men&#151;and
successful business men diversify when necessary.</div>
					<a name="07062684000343"></a><div class="hs_Para">If anyone here can produce with
absolute certainty an exhaustive list of the crimes that such criminals
commit, or will commit in future, I am sure that we would all be
pleased, but unfortunately that is simply not possible. Let me reassure
the Committee that we do not mean to provide that the orders should be
available against any criminal or on the basis of any crime. That is
not the Government&#146;s intention and would not fit with the
targeted and intelligence-led type of law enforcement that the orders
are designed to
support.</div>
					<a name="07062684000344"></a><div class="hs_Para">As a result,
we have provided a schedule of offences to show the large majority of
the offences in relation to which the use of the orders would be
appropriate. Furthermore, we have provided within the framework of the
schedule a discretion for the court to treat an offence as serious if,
in the circumstances of the case before it&#151;circumstances that we
cannot know or foresee&#151;it considers the offence serious enough
to be treated as if it had been specified in the
schedule.</div>
					<a name="07062684000345"></a><div class="hs_Para">The issue
has generated discussion and debate, but it is extremely important that
we do not fetter the discretion of the court. If we did, the court
might not in future be able to impose a serious crime prevention order
for an unspecified serious crime because it would not have that
discretion. It is entirely appropriate that we say to the court,
&#147;If you think something is serious enough for a serious crime
prevention order, you have the power to treat it as
such.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07062684000346"></a><div class="hs_Para">We shall
come to the latter point shortly. However, schedule 1 provides a strong
guideline for the level of offence that we are talking about. No matter
what the circumstances, no High Court judge will think that littering,
shoplifting or the taking of an individual trout from a stream are so
serious that they should be treated as if specified in the schedule. I
simply do not believe that, and no member of this Committee does
either.</div>
					<a name="07062684000347"></a><div class="hs_Para">We also
consider that the alternative approach, suggested by the right hon. and
learned Gentleman in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column37" />Column number: 37</div>the amendments, is too much of a blunt instrument. We wish to maintain
flexibility, but also to ensure that the Bill is targeted at offences
committed by serious career criminals. In the Bill, the meaning of
&#147;serious offence&#148; is more subtle than the level of
punishment that it attracts. The Bill focuses on offences most likely
to be committed by organised criminal networks. That primarily means
offences that can be committed on a large scale for a large
profit.</div>
					<a name="07062684000348"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Amendment
No. 116 would delete clause 20(1)(a), which allows the Crown court to
make an order in respect of a case that has been committed to it from a
magistrates court. It is appropriate for the Crown court to have powers
in such circumstances for two reasons. First, the definition of a
serious offence would be the same; the behaviour under consideration
would not be lower level simply because the conviction was given by
magistrates. Secondly, the case would be serious; when magistrates
courts decide that their sentencing powers are inadequate for the
seriousness of a case before them, they commit it to the Crown court.
Given my comments, I hope that the right hon. and learned Gentleman
will withdraw the
amendment.</div>

						</b> No, I will not withdraw the amendment, although I
may not get as much support as I would like. No matter&#151;I am used
to standing alone and do not care about it. We should come back to the
basic point: we are dealing with very serious orders. I do not believe
that we should expose people to such orders unless their conduct is
truly serious. I do not think that categorisation is the best way
forward for the reasons that I have given. I think that a sentence
imposed by a court is probably the best assessment of the gravity of an
offence that could be constructed. I am not dogmatic about the seven
years. I would be prepared to compromise on that, but not on the
general approach set out in the
amendments.</div>

Hogg:
						</b> All the amendments, except amendment No. 3, are in
my name. The Committee will have seen that I am not a team player. I do
not like teams&#151;or playing, for that matter. I hope that I can
persuade my hon. Friends to do a little better on the next group of
amendments. They will have plenty of opportunity during the course of
the Committee to rally behind my amendments; I can tell them that
now.</div>
					<a name="07062684000373"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us return to
the purpose of the amendments. I shall not continue to emphasise in
detail how grave the orders are, but we need to remind ourselves at
every stage that we are talking about serious consequences for
individuals. What I am trying to do in this group of amendments is
twofold. I want to confine the impact of the orders to those who have
in fact committed an offence known to the law&#151;in other words, to
exclude the facilitator from the ambit of the order-making powers. Many
amendments have been tabled, and I could identify clearly the effect of
each, but I do not suppose that you would want me to do that,
Mr. Bercow. It might be called filibustering, and I do not
want the Government Whip to get uneasy about these matters; otherwise,
I would go on longer and longer. <i class="I">[Interruption.] </i>I am very glad
to hear that.</div>
					<a name="07062684000374"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
first thing that I want to do is confine the impact of the orders to
those who have committed offences. However, if I cannot achieve that
highly desirable objective, I want to incorporate the concept of what
lawyers call mens rea into the facilitation offence. Unless I have
overlooked some part of the Bill, the facilitation offence is one of
strict liability. There is no requirement for intent or, indeed, for
knowledge, which I do not believe is fair. It is all right to say that
they are not criminal orders but civil powers. So they are! But they
could have the most appalling consequences&#151;the sorts of
consequences that I do not think should be visited on people who do not
have the knowledge or required intent.</div>
					<a name="07062684000375"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have tried to confine the
impact of the orders, therefore, as far as the facilitators are
concerned, to those in respect of whom it can be established that they
acted &#147;knowingly and intentionally&#148;. I suggest that that
is in accordance with the basic principles of natural
justice.</div>

right hon. and learned Friend&#146;s amendments, which would add the
words &#147;knowingly and intentionally&#148; to the clause,
because, like him, I think that in relation to these very serious
matters and the serious consequences that can be visited on an
individual who is made subject to a serious crime 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column39" />Column number: 39</div>prevention order, it is vital that it is made perfectly clear that an
individual could not find himself in such a position without knowing
what he was doing and intentionally causing the harm that the
Government seek to avoid. It seems probable that if the clause is left
as it is, there will be cases in which someone finds themselves subject
to an order accidentally, without having intended to do anything
wrong.</div>

clearly:</div>

means that it does not matter if the respondent did not, for example,

crime.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07062684000379"></a><div class="hs_Para">If someone has
not done so intentionally or knowingly, it is unacceptable that they

						</b> I support my right hon. and learned
Friend&#146;s amendments, particularly amendment No. 57, for all the
reasons that my hon. Friend the Member for Rugby and Kenilworth set
out. It seems wrong to me, too, that it is possible for someone to be
subject to a serious crime prevention order without having intended the
conduct that would make him liable for it, particularly when there is a
reverse burden of proof placed on him to show that his actions were
reasonable. We referred to that early
on.</div>
					<a name="07062684000387"></a><div class="hs_Para">I see no reason
why the proposal should add a significant evidential burden to the
operation of serious crime prevention orders. They are so wide in their
potential effect. The Government explicitly said in their explanations
of how the orders would operate that the type of activity that they
might catch is, for instance, the supply of vehicles with compartments
that could be used for the running of drugs and so on. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column40" />Column number: 40</div>It is important that some safeguard is built in that would make it clear
that the provision cannot catch that type of activity unless it can be
shown that the person intended that activity to take place. That would
be a very important safeguard, given the wide ambit of the potential
restrictions on people&#146;s liberty and the serious penalties that
could attach to breach of those restrictions, particularly as no
offence needs to have been committed by the person concerned, as we
have all observed. Indeed, under the terms of the clause, people could
be caught for tangential involvement with offences. I hope that the
Minister will view the amendment sympathetically or explain why a
simple evidential test like this one should not be
included.</div>

3, the purpose of which is to require the prosecuting authority to
establish that a person was acting unreasonably, thereby reversing the
burden of proof in the Bill. Following on from the two brief speeches
that have just been made, I shall be interested to hear from the

practice.</div>
					<a name="07062684000389"></a><div class="hs_Para">Am I right
in believing that were I to lend someone a fishing rod and he then
fished illegally and caught salmon, I would fall foul of this part of
the Bill? As I understand clause 2(1)(c), if I were to open a fishing
shop within walking distance of a lake that contained salmon, I would
have to be certain that someone who came into my shop to buy a fishing
rod did not intend to use it for illegal purposes, even if I could not
be certain one way or the other of their
intention.</div>
					<a name="07062684000390"></a><div class="hs_Para">Earlier,
the Minister said that the salmon and trout were red herrings, but that
slightly begs the question of why the provision is in the Bill if it is
so easy to ridicule. One could make examples of this sort right across
the piece; for example, would taxi drivers who take people to the scene
of a crime, knowingly but perhaps unwittingly, fall foul of the
sanctions as well? I would be grateful if the Minister could address
those specific
points.</div>

Coaker:
						</b> I shall deal now with one of the points that the
hon. Gentleman made, although I will return to it later in my remarks.
Someone in a fishing tackle shop who sells a rod to someone who then
goes off and poaches would not be subject to a serious crime prevention
order. But if somebody asked the person in the fishing shop whether
they knew that lots of people were coming to the shop to buy rods and
then going off to poach salmon, but no action was taken, or if the shop
sold some sort of material that was then used for something that could
be regarded as serious, a crime would have been facilitated, and an
order may be appropriate. However, the shop owner could just be selling
stuff that he expected to be used appropriately and normally. I shall
deal with that in my later
remarks.</div>
					<a name="07062684000392"></a><div class="hs_Para">Someone may
buy a computer and then use it for criminal purposes, but the person
who sold the computer facilitated a crime without realising it. The
problem comes when somebody is told, but refuses to take any action as
a consequence of being told.</div>

							<a name="07062684000681"></a>Mr.
Hogg:
						</b> I am listening to what the Minister is saying, but I
am not sure that he is right. Facilitation does not carry within it, by
itself, the concepts of intent or knowledge. It is an act. It is strict
liability. Facilitation itself, if it is to be in the Bill by itself,
is a strict
offence.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07062684000682"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> My understanding of the situation is that in civil
proceedings, as these would be, what I am saying would be right. We
used the example of somebody who sells a computer or fishing tackle
that is then used without their knowledge for something else. An order
would not be appropriate for them. However, even though they did not
know and had no understanding of what was taking place, if they were
told what the equipment was being used for but still carried on, they
might be subject to a serious crime prevention
order.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07062684000683"></a>Mr.
Browne:
						</b> I am still unclear on that. Let us say that I run
a kitchen utensils shop and I sell&#151;among a range of
items&#151;knives. At what point would I become culpable for aiding
and abetting or facilitating the committing of grievous bodily harm
through knife crime? Is it the point when someone comes in and says,
&#147;You know those kitchen knives that you are selling, well most
people use them to make tasty meals, but one or two people come in and
buy them as weapons&#148;? How many people have to come in and tell
me that some people use them as weapons for me to be found to be
facilitating a crime by not closing my
shop?</div>
					
					<a name="07062684000396"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07062684000684"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> Let us say that the court or one of the applicant
authorities were to try to impose a serious crime prevention order on
someone like the kitchen shop owner who sells one or two knives. I do
not believe that that would actually happen. All sorts of examples
could be made up in relation to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point that
would just not happen in the real world. Let us say that somebody says,
&#147;Do you know that those knives are being used to kill
people?&#148; Let us then say that the kitchen shop owner carries on
selling those knives and the applicant authority believes that it
should put a serious crime prevention order on them. The kitchen shop
owner who is selling the knives will then have the opportunity to
demonstrate to the court that they have acted reasonably. If they can
do so, they will not be the subject of a serious crime prevention
order.</div>
					<a name="07062684000397"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I say,
examples can be made up and the one that I used was the fishing shop
owner. Let us say that somebody is unknowingly facilitating serious
crime through the selling of equipment and that comes to the notice of
somebody who says to them, &#147;Do you know that the selling of that
equipment from your shop, business or premises is facilitating serious
crime?&#148; If the person says that they do not know anything about
it and it is nothing to do with them, and they carry on selling the
equipment, they may then become the subject of a serious crime
prevention order.</div>
					<a name="07062684000398"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
important point is that the person on whom the applicant authorities
are trying to impose a serious crime prevention order has the
opportunity in court to demonstrate that their behaviour was
reasonable. If they can do that, they will not become the subject of a
serious crime prevention order.</div>

							<a name="07062684000685"></a>Mr.
Browne:
						</b> Does not that get to the nub of the issue and
combine the point made by the right hon. and learned Member for
Sleaford and North Hykeham with the point that I was trying to make in
amendment No.3?</div>
					<a name="07062684000400"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
us settle on the example of the fishing rod shop owner and pretend that
I own a fishing rod shop that is in an area where there are lots of
lakes and rivers for fishing, where it would be an obvious commercial
decision to open a shop. There are likely to be people in the immediate
vicinity who come into my shop to buy a fishing rod and fish nearby. I
cannot be certain how the fishing rods are used and whether they are
used properly or improperly. If somebody walks into the shop and tells
me that one of the fishing rods bought in my shop is being used to fish
illegally for trout, under the Government&#146;s model, I have to
prove in court that I have done nothing wrong, rather than the court
proving that I have. Can the Minister not understand why that is of
concern to
us?</div>
					
					<a name="07062684000401"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07062684000686"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> It goes to the heart of the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s amendment about reasonableness and unreasonableness
and who should have to prove that. On the point that he makes, let me
take him again through the process as I see it, which I hope will
clarify the matter&#151;even if he does not agree with my point. If
he sells equipment from his shop, whether it is a computer or fishing
tackle shop, that is used for serious crime&#151;let us leave aside
somebody just taking one fish&#151;as the court would define it, he
facilitated that crime without knowing or intending it; he sold the
equipment and the crime happened. He sold the computers and people used
them for the purposes of committing serious
crime.</div>
					<a name="07062684000402"></a><div class="hs_Para">If, however, a
law enforcement agency or somebody were to go to him and ask,
&#147;Do you know that the computers that you are selling to this
business, or the fishing equipment that you are selling to these
individuals, are being used for serious crime?&#148; and he were to
say, &#147;Well, I&#146;ve got no intention of it being used for
serious crime. I&#146;m just a person selling fishing tackle,&#148;
or, &#147;I&#146;m just a person selling computers. What I am
expected to do about it?&#148; he might be subject to a serious crime
prevention order. The applicant authority would then say to the
prosecuting authority, &#147;We believe that this person should be
made the subject of a serious crime prevention order. They are
facilitating a crime. We have told them so and they have said,
&#145;What&#146;s it got to do with me? I&#146;m just conducting
my business.&#146; Yet they are facilitating crime by the nature of
their
business.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07062684000403"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
suspect that the hon. Gentleman would believe that it is perfectly
reasonable for somebody in law enforcement to go to a business and ask,
&#147;Do you realise what is going on with the goods that you are
selling?&#148; I think that he would expect a proper, legitimate,
upstanding business person who was told by a law enforcement agency
that their goods or services were being used to facilitate serious
crime to say, &#147;I didn&#146;t realise that. I&#146;m going to
stop it.&#148; We would not need to go down the route of serious
crime prevention orders at all, because the vast majority of business
people would agree and comply with the law. They would say,
&#147;Thank you for bringing it to my attention. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column43" />Column number: 43</div>We all have a common interest in tackling such illegal activity and
serious crime, and I will
stop.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07062684000404"></a><div class="hs_Para">If a
person did not stop their activity and just said, &#147;Well,
it&#146;s not my intention for it to be used for crime, I&#146;m
just in business. I&#146;m just selling the computers, and
it&#146;s nothing to do with me what happens with them,&#148;
although they did not intend it to be used for serious crime, that
would be an abrogation of what most of us would see as the sensible,
reasonable course of action.</div>
					<a name="07062684000405"></a><div class="hs_Para">In such a case in which a
person did not respond, the law enforcement agency would go to the
applicant authority, such as the Serious Fraud Office, the Revenue
prosecutors or the Crown Prosecution Service, and say, &#147;We
believe that in this situation it would be appropriate for a serious
crime prevention order to be used.&#148; If that were taken before
the court, the respondent would be able to say to the court,
&#147;Look, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column44" />Column number: 44</div>what I did was perfectly reasonable.&#148; It would then be a matter
for a High Court judge to determine. In the circumstances that I have
illustrated&#151;I apologise if I have done so
long-windedly&#151;the fishing tackle or computer shop owner could
say to the court, &#147;I acted reasonably. It is not appropriate to
put a serious crime prevention order on me.&#148; That would then be
a matter of judgment for the
court.</div>
					<a name="07062684000406"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall give
the hon. Gentleman another example, which I think was used in the
Lords. Somebody owns a bed and breakfast and is asked by law
enforcement, &#147;Do you know that lots of your lodging rooms are
being used to traffic individuals?&#148; If the owner were to say,
&#147;Nothing to do with me; I&#146;m a bed and breakfast
owner,&#148; the vast majority of hotel
owners&#151;</div>
