<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Lansley </B>(South Cambridgeshire): May I say what a pleasure it is to serve on a Committee under your chairmanship, Mr. Gale? It is not a pleasure that I have had, and I look forward to doing so in future. I hope that the chambers of commerce in Kent, as in other parts of the country, will monitor our proceedings and reflect positively on them. I should also like to thank the Minister for Small Firms, Trade and Industry for her time and trouble in preparing the Bill. I look forward to her comments on this first substantive debate on clause 1 and the new clauses.
<P>
I am grateful to you, Mr. Gale, for allowing the discussion of the clauses in this way. It will be more helpful to the Committee if I explain the purposes of the Bill as a whole at this stage than if I explain the purpose of the clauses one by one. I hope that the Committee will agree that the original clauses should be negatived and replaced with the new clauses.
<P>
I shall speak in two parts: on the purposes of the Bill and on the procedure of the proposed legislation and how it might work.
<P>
For many years, companies legislation has recognised the title of chamber of commerce as sensitive and requiring special approval. That sensitivity arises from several factors. First, the title is global--in Europe alone, there are 1,200 chambers of commerce and industry, representing 14 million enterprises. Chambers of commerce have an international role, and businesses, whether they trade in this country or abroad, must have confidence that chambers of commerce--or bodies so titled--will act objectively in encouraging trade between their members.
<P>
Chambers of commerce are therefore in a position of trust. Although they are membership organisations and--in this and some other countries--private sector bodies, they represent an element of public service. For example, chambers of commerce have played their part in establishing training and enterprise councils, supporting Business Links and working in local economic development partnerships. In a real sense, they emulate the philosophy of private enterprise allied to public service. That philosophy plays an important part in current policy, played an important part in past policy and, I hope, will play an important part in future policy.
<P>
The title denotes an organisation that should be accountable to the business community and the overall area that it serves. For those reasons, it is a sensitive title. It has always therefore been argued--with justification, I hope--that the title should not be allowed to be used by inappropriate persons, or in a way that does not provide the accountability that is the essential characteristic of a chamber of commerce.
<P>
I emphasise that the existing legislation has not been applied badly. Robust procedures within the present system have been followed by Companies House and the British Chambers of Commerce. I do not regard the Bill as a criticism of Companies House in relation to its activities under existing legislation; the Bill will help Companies House to do its job more effectively.
<P>
The Bill is intended to address weaknesses in existing legislation. When Companies House receives an application for the incorporation of a chamber of commerce, it must consider whether the application will result in a genuine chamber of commerce, which will enjoy the respect, and attract the membership, of the business community. No benchmark exists for making such a judgment; in British law there is no definition of what constitutes a chamber of commerce, and there are no criteria for approval as a chamber of commerce, or for related titles or the use of those titles. The Bill will provide for guidance to be published by the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, to enable objective criteria to be used in determining which bodies should be able to use the title of chamber of commerce.
<P>
Chambers of commerce will vary from area to area, as the demands of industry in one area will differ from those in another. That is partly why there have been distinct problems in making judgments under the current legislation. Many of those problems have related to applications to establish bilateral chambers, which are involved in trade between this country and another country or are British chambers of commerce established in country X or country Y. Trade with eastern Europe since 1989 has been not the least important factor in that development. The British Chambers of Commerce has feared that some of the chambers resulting from such applications would be effectively a front for a relatively small group of businesses, and that the chamber would be more a trading house than a representative body. Too often, such proposals have come from public relations companies rather than from the business community as such.
<P>
It is not only bilateral chambers that have caused such problems. How can a judgment be made on applications to establish a Northern Ireland Chinese chamber of commerce or an international Christian chamber of commerce? There is currently an application before Companies House for the incorporation in Great Britain of the Democratic Republic of Congo chamber of commerce, the draft articles of association of which could result in a board consisting of one person. Companies House must be able to make such judgments with the benefit of objective, published benchmarks and criteria.
<P>
All over the world, the title of chamber of commerce is clearly identified with a specific geographic area. That is an important part of the judgments that Ministers, and Companies House on their behalf, make on the suitability of a title. Disputes about the geographic descriptor are often resolved at a local level and are not a matter for Companies House. In the past, however, a chamber of commerce, which was established only in one part of a region, has applied to amend its title to embrace the whole region. For instance, one city in west Yorkshire sought to become the west Yorkshire chamber of commerce, despite the fact that there were strong, powerful and traditional chambers of commerce in Leeds, Bradford and mid-Yorkshire. An application was also made for a black country chamber of commerce, even though there are strong chambers of commerce throughout that area. An application for a Wessex chamber of commerce related only to a small part of west Wiltshire.
<P>
The use of geographic descriptors therefore creates problems. In the past, there have been arguments about whether east London is the same as east of London. The east London chamber had already been established, but another group of people sought to set up another chamber of commerce with the geographic descriptor, east of London. The imprecise nature of the law, and Ministers' lack of type of powers that will be made available by the Bill, led Ministers to decide that they could not reject the east of London chamber title. That is not to say that such a body should not necessarily be established as a chamber of commerce, but the geographic descriptor applied should already be understood and justified by its membership and intentions.
<P>
When an application for incorporation is received, the current defences are good but not good enough. In effect, anyone can set up a chamber of commerce, canvass for members and sell services under a chamber trade name. In practice, virtually nothing can be done to stop that process. No evidence exists of wide-scale abuse. However, as many chambers of commerce are unincorporated associations, we may see further examples of businesses attempting to sell services to local small businesses in particular. They may also try to use the title ``chamber of commerce'' even though their constitution and membership does not justify the use of that title.
<P>
The structure of the Bill that was passed on Second Reading set out the objectives. That is one way of proceeding. However, the securing of Government support opened up new opportunities, for which I am grateful to Ministers.
<P>
We must be alive to the fact that chambers of commerce constitute an organic movement that has been established for more than 200 years. We wanted to assure chambers of commerce that the legislation would not limit the opportunity to reflect change. For example, during the past two years chambers of commerce in some parts of the country have merged with training and enterprise councils, which have duly been granted distinct functions such as training. In so far as Ministers take decisions on controlled titles, they are able to update and vary the factors and the characteristics of the chamber of commerce.
<P>
Happily, Ministers have contributed to and co-operated fully with the proposed structure, which is more consistent with existing legislation. For example, the listing of controlled titles will be carried out through the same regulations as the listing of companies and business names for all other purposes. Business will therefore find all titles relating to the chamber of commerce where it expects to find a list of controlled titles.
<P>
The measure will be fleshed out in guidance to be issued by the Secretary of State, which will provide a degree of flexibility over time. The British Chambers of Commerce and the Scottish Chambers of Commerce have discussed the matter with Ministers. They are happy that the legislation will reflect those factors that should determine which bodies enjoy the title ``chamber of commerce''.
<P>
I shall turn to the way in which we might proceed under your guidance, Mr. Gale. I hoped that we might use the first debate to discuss the Bill's substance, as you rightly said. I should inform the Committee that I am happy that we move through and negative the clauses that currently stand part of the Bill. Having then debated the new clauses, we might bring them in, along with the amendments.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. It must be understood by the Committee that no further opportunity will arise to discuss new clauses 1 to 4--they will simply be moved formally later and then voted on. The hon. Gentleman is therefore right to say that the clause should be moved and discussed now.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> Mr. Gale, I am grateful for that helpful clarification.
<P>
The Minister will want to explain precisely the structure of the new clauses. However, in simple terms they seek to lay a duty on the Secretary of State to control the title ``chamber of commerce''. They will also require the Secretary of State to publish guidance on the factors to be taken into account in determining whether to approve an application. New clause 2 and new clause 3 set that out. Such factors would embrace the characteristics of a chamber of commerce, its representative functions, its membership character, and its accountability to the local business community and the community at large. Moreover, the new clauses will ensure that the proposed geographic descriptor is justified in respect of that body's constitution.
<P>
The new clauses will also lay upon the Secretary of State a requirement to consult a relevant representative body. In that context, the new clauses will also specify that the British Chambers of Commerce and the Scottish Chambers of Commerce constitute such bodies, although not exclusively so. The guidance should take into account bodies such as the training and enterprise councils' national council, a legitimate and relevant representative body that the Secretary of State might consult when establishing a chamber of commerce. Should a chamber of commerce and a training and enterprise council merge, the resulting body might enjoy a chamber of commerce training and enterprise title.
<P>
If the Committee is minded to negative the clauses, the schedules will also fall. Amendments Nos. 1 to 7 need not then be considered, because they would be overtaken by the clause stand part votes. We would then have just two sets of amendments with which to deal, one of which tackles the change to the short and the long title. That amendment would bring the title into line with existing title usage governed by Companies House under the companies and business names legislation.
<P>
The commencement and extent provisions will enable Ministers to enforce the legislation once they are happy that guidance can be published. With regard to extent, there will be a change. We had previously thought it sensible to extend the legislation to Northern Ireland. However, companies legislation has in the past been extended to Northern Ireland by way of subsequent statutory instrument, and I am happy for us to proceed in the same way in this case.
<P>
As you say, Mr. Gale, having debated the new clauses we would be able formally to move them in order to bring them into effect at a subsequent stage. I hope that the Committee now understands the Bill's purpose and the way in which we plan to proceed this morning. I invite the Committee to support the Bill by negativing clause 1 and proceeding subsequently to approve the new clauses.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (Mrs. Barbara Roche):</B> Mr. Gale, I begin by welcoming you. It is good to see you chairing the debate on what is a very important Bill.
<P>
I had intended to congratulate the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley) on his successful balloting for the legislation. However, I believe that it was someone else's success.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley indicated assent.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> The hon. Gentleman had the good fortune to inherit that success, which he further advanced with much effort.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for giving way. For the record, my hon. Friend the Member for Windsor (Mr. Trend) was successful in the ballot. However, because of his other commitments I was given the opportunity to introduce the Bill, for which I am grateful.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> That shows that the hon. Gentleman is doubly lucky. We must consider deliberations in another place; however, if matters proceed according to plan we hope that legislation will stand in his name. I congratulate him on his perseverance with the Bill. It will be of great importance to our smaller and medium-sized businesses.
<P>
The Government warmly support the work of the British Chambers of Commerce and the Scottish Chambers of Commerce in promoting recognition of the title of chamber as one that is synonomous with quality. I am sure that I speak for all members of the Committee when I say that the House greatly values the work of the chambers of commerce and their representative bodies. We all know, as constituency Members, how important the services of chambers are to local business, which makes this a good opportunity to record our thanks for their work.
<P>
The Government are therefore very pleased to support the core objective of the Bill, which is to establish a statutory right for the BCC and the SCC to be consulted when the Secretary of State is considering whether to approve new business or company names that include the expression, ``chamber of commerce'', or specifiy related expressions. The new clauses and amendments seek to secure the core objective of statutory consultation in the clearest and most workable way, by providing a clear link with existing legislation on the protection of business and company names and by ensuring that there is no duplication in the Bill.
<P>
As has been said, the new clauses will require the Secretary of State to consult the BCC or the SCC when determining whether expressions such as ``chamber of commerce'', ``chamber of trade'' or ``chamber of commerce, training and enterprise'' may be used as part of a registered company or business name. The names would be specified by statutory instrument under existing names legislation and not specified in the Bill. That is a more effective way of ensuring that businesses wishing to use such names know that the Secretary of State's approval will be required.
<P>
The new clauses will also ensure that the expression ``chambers of commerce'' and its Welsh equivalent could not be removed from the relevant statutory instrument without primary legislation. That is important. The new clauses provide for the Secretary of State to issue guidance on the factors that she would take into account before approving the expression ``chamber of commerce'' or similar specified expressions. My Department would agree this guidance with the BCC and SCC, and once agreed it would be placed in the Libraries of both Houses.
<P>
Finally, the amendments would provide for the Bill to apply in Great Britain, rather than in the United Kingdom as a whole. In line with the normal form for companies legislation, comparable provisions will be introduced in Northern Ireland by order, and not through this Bill.
<P>
There were many helpful and productive discussions between the Government, the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire and the BCC prior to the Committee. That illustrates the way in which Labour and Opposition Members can work together on legislation to help the business community as a whole. I am delighted to commend the new clauses and amendments to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brian Cotter </B>(Weston-super-Mare): I support the thrust of the objectives of the Bill, and I wish to congratulate those hon. Members who are responsible for its satisfactory state.
<P>
Clearly, any room for doubt about who can adopt the title of chamber of commerce is unsatisfactory. I know that my hon. Friend the Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Mr. Brake) has been lobbied by the London chamber of commerce and industry, and I am sure that many other hon. Members have been lobbied by other chambers elsewhere.
<P>
It is vital that any organisation that sets itself up as a chamber should be absolutely what it is seen to be. Chambers are effective organisations in representing the voice of business and acting as a support for business. It is therefore vital that businesses should be able to trust such organisations.
<P>
The Bill clearly aims to ensure that chambers of commerce are what they are seen to be, and Liberal Democrat Members will support the Bill.

<B>Mr. Page rose --</B><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am sorry. Mr. Davies leapt to his feet slightly later than the hon. Gentleman. Nevertheless it is traditional to take a speech from the other side of the Committee Room.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> First, I declare an interest. I was a member of the Croydon and South London chamber of commerce for many years, and ran several businesses.
<P>
I welcome the Bill and the cross-party support for it. It protects the brand equity that is carried in the words ``chamber of commerce'' and--pleasingly, given my ethnic origins--the Welsh equivalent. I am pleased that there will be no risk of rogue chambers of commerce in future, which might take members' subscriptions but fail to represent those members in a way that accords with the long tradition of chambers of commerce in Britain. I welcome the consensus in support of this worthy Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> Thank you, Mr. Gale. May I also add my welcome? I am glad that you have agreed that a wide-ranging debate may take place. I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire, who is present, and my hon. Friend the Member for Windsor, who is elsewhere, on the Bill. It will achieve something that the British Chambers of Commerce has wanted to achieve for quite a few years.
<P>
The measure has not always enjoyed everyone's full and open support, but it will generally help chambers to advance, especially with regard to the accreditation process that is under way. That process will raise the expertise of chambers of commerce to ensure that it is appreciated by their members. I am not telling tales out of school by saying that chambers have been of variable ability: some have been very good while others have not quite reached those standards.
<P>
I must express mild surprise, however, at the vast raft of changes to the numbering of the clauses, the deletion of clauses and the amendments. Such a dramatic degree of chop and change in a Committee is undesirable; only the calmness and assurance of my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire has prevented me objecting strongly. I do not speak for the rest of the Committee, but I was only informed of the chops and changes in a note that I received at six o'clock last night. Without the assurance of my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire, I should have been exceedingly worried. The notes on clauses, which I studied with great interest, no longer amount to a row of beans; I had no new notes on clauses to inform me of the detailed changes. However, as no one from the British Chambers of Commerce has lobbied any members of the Committee to say that the changes are terrible, I do not wish to press the matter to a vote.
<P>
I join the Minister in expressing appreciation of the work done by British Chambers of Commerce, especially its work as a partner in the Business Link organisation. It plays a fundamental role in underpinning that organisation, which, without that underpinning, would be an under-performing unit. That would be to the detriment of small and medium-sized businesses throughout the country.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Mr. Gale, I know that you have offered a wide-ranging debate. It is tempting to spend the next half-hour explaining the importance of small and medium-sized business to Britain. It is especially tempting when one considers the difficulty caused by various aspects of high-pound pressures. We shall need small and medium-sized businesses to be part of an employment creation operation as the months ahead unroll.
<P>
Having expressed my appreciation for the work done, and having guided through the House two private Member's Bills that reached the statute book, I recognise the strain that may accompany such actions. I shall not object, and I support my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire in the moves that he is making.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I should like briefly to thank the Minister and the hon. Members for Weston-super-Mare (Mr. Cotter) and for Croydon, Central (Mr. Davies) for their support for the Bill, and to thank my hon. Friend the Member for South West Hertfordshire (Mr. Page), who made one or two points to which I should respond.
<P>
First, my hon. Friend was right to refer to changes in recent years in the chambers of commerce. The Minister rightly spoke about the importance of objective of making the title of chamber of commerce synonymous with the provision of quality services to the business community, managed and governed from within that community. I recall that I was the deputy director-general of the British Chambers of Commerce in 1990, at the moment when the process of accreditation was starting in the chamber of commerce movement. Happily, the movement has done far better without me than I could have achieved had I stayed. The chambers have moved from being subject to criticism about variability in quality and performance across the country. Increasingly, strong chambers of commerce are established in many parts of the country with ISO 9000 accreditation and so on, and they regulate their activities very positively.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for South-West Hertfordshire also referred to wide-ranging changes to the Bill. I shall not delay the Committee by speaking about them in detail. They were a consequence of proceeding in a way more consistent with the manner in which Governments would introduce legislation in order to amend companies and business names legislation. It is, of course, not possible to set out to introduce a private Member's Bill that is contingent upon the order-making powers of Ministers. The Bill will be acceptable in practice, and has proved to be acceptable to the chambers of commerce in discussion with the Department. If Ministers are happy for the Bill to allow them to issue guidance, it will deliver not only the same results, but will do so in a manner that is more likely to be flexible.
<P>
I do not disguise the fact that, even if we had proceeded on the basis of presenting the Bill as approved on Second Reading, we should have had to make changes. Difficulties have arisen, for example, concerning the question of extent. Clause 4 of the original Bill would have given difficulty to some existing chambers of commerce, in relation to giving the Secretary of State a power to order the abandonment of titles. It is simpler to move toward the new structure.
<P>
Although my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Hertfordshire is right to say that some of the amendments seem relatively recent in relation to the Standing Committee, they were tabled in relation to a proposal that the Bill be considered by a Committee of the whole House, way back in April. I assure my hon. Friend that they have been the subject of detailed consultation with the bodies to be affected, and that they have been available for study in the House for a considerable time. I hope that he will understand and accept my assurances.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I do not wish to intrude on the harmony of the Committee, but in light of the observation made by the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire it is appropriate for me to say that the Chairman expects the Committee to be given as much notice of changes--especially of dramatic changes--as possible. I say that because the Bill was debated on Second Reading, and the House, as a whole, had the opportunity to consider it.
<P>
To date, the House has not had the opportunity to discuss these dramatic amendments, although it will do so later. I accept the assurance of the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire that the matter has been the subject of consultation with the appropriate bodies outside the House, but the Chair must be concerned with courtesies to the House itself.
