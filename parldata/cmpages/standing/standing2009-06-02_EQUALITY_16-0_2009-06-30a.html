Evan Harris</b> (Oxford, West and Abingdon) (LD): It is a
pleasure to welcome you back to the Chair, Lady
Winterton.</div><a name="0907017000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
had set out why we were particularly concerned to deal, in our
amendment, with the quality of opportunity limb of the positive duty
and its relation to religion and belief, not limbs 1 and 3 and limbs A
and B of subsection (1). I also explained that, even if
subsection (1)(b) survived&#151;my probing amendment would delete
it&#151;changes to subsection (3) would be needed, because of the
concern about how subsection (3)(b) might work in practice in relation
to religion and belief. It may not even be necessary to delete that
paragraph; it may be necessary only to qualify it in some way to ensure
that we gain the intended benefits without the
drawbacks.</div><a name="0907017000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
was discussing with the hon. Member for Glasgow, East whether
&#147;needs&#148; was an objective term. I am concerned that
nothing in the structure will require a public authority to judge
whether the needs that are cited, which may be genuine from the point
of view of  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column562" />Column number: 562</div>the individual or the religious community that claims to have them, are
reasonable to meet. Will the Minister clarify whether it is her view
that some form of reasonableness test exists in relation to
that?</div><a name="0907017000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clearly,
having regard to something does not require one to do it, and the
public authority may still not consider it reasonable to do. I am
concerned that the expectations of individuals who seek to have their
needs met may be raised, but that they may not realise that, although
public authorities should have regard to something, that wording still
allows them to say that, in all circumstances, either it is legitimate
for them not to meet those needs or that meeting them would not be the
most effective way to deliver
services.</div><a name="0907017000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our
concerns about this matter are set out by the Equality and Human Rights
Commission in its briefing, which seeks to rebut those concerns, and
stem to a certain extent from work done and concerns raised by Lord
Lester of Herne Hill, who has been engaged in correspondence with the
EHRC and has recently published an article, co-authored with Paola
Uccellari, in a law journal, setting out his concerns in more
detail.</div><a name="0907017000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
fundamental questions in relation to the provision are, first, whether
there is a judgment about whether the needs are reasonable and,
secondly, whether this will lead to a call for and a meeting of the
demand for services to be delivered to people on religious grounds.
This is different from the other strands, as I was saying when
discussing the point with the hon. Member for Glasgow, East, because
there are no other grounds on which public services can be delivered,
to the same degree, in a discriminatory way. There is no exception in
any schedule for services to be delivered on the basis of an ethos
specifically to people of one gender, race or form of ability or
disability&#151;that is no surprise&#151;but there is a wide
exemption in schedule 23 that enables public services to be delivered
by organisations of a religious ethos only to users of those services
who pass a religious test. That is why, when considering public
authorities and public functions, one cannot claim that religion is
therefore just like every other
strand.</div><a name="0907017000033"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0907017000516"></a><b class="B">John
Mason</b> (Glasgow, East) (SNP): The hon. Gentleman seemed to
suggest that no other strand or protected characteristic is allowed
special exemption or protection. However, I understand that virtually
every strand is. He mentioned disability. Clearly, many organisations,
including public authorities, are allowed to favour and help those who
are
disabled.</div><a name="0907017000034"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907017000517"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I was very careful about what I said. I spoke
about the structure of the exemption in schedule 23. Of
course the Bill allows for services to be provided in specific ways
that are appropriate to individual needs. However, schedule 23 is
different. The hon. Gentleman must accept that. Paragraph 2(10)
states:</div><a name="0907017000427"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;This
paragraph does not permit anything which is prohibited by section
27&#148;&#151;</div><a name="0907017000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">which
is about not discriminating in the provision of
services&#151;</div><a name="0907017000428"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;so
far as relating to sexual
orientation,&#148;</div><a name="0907017000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">but
not to religion. That applies to services provided on behalf of a
public authority
or</div><a name="0907017000429"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;under
the terms of a contract between the organisation and the public
authority.&#148;</div><a name="0907017000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">Things
are entitled in relation to religion that are not entitled in relation
to sexual orientation, which is peculiar.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column563" />Column number: 563</div><a name="0907017000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a wide
exemption for religion elsewhere in schedule 23, relating to religious
ethos. A restriction is
permitted</div><a name="0907017000430"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;relating
to religion or belief only if it is imposed...because of the
purpose of the organisation, or...to avoid causing offence, on
grounds of the religion or belief to which the organisation relates, to
persons of that religion or
belief.&#148;</div><a name="0907017000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is a pretty wide provision that is not allowed in respect of any other
characteristic&#151;for example, sexual
orientation.</div><a name="0907017000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before
we broke for lunch, I was about to explain another reason why religion
is different. The hon. Member for Glasgow, East said that to exclude
religion and belief from part of the positive duty provision would be
setting it aside for different treatment from the other strands.
However, it is already treated differently by legislation and by the
House, which voted to have different approaches for religion and race
in respect of incitement to hatred, even though the mischief makers
might be similar, because it recognised that religion was
different&#151;it relates to belief, which is not as innate a
characteristic as the other
strands.</div><a name="0907017000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">Inevitable
conflicts arise between different religions because of freedom of
speech. That does not exist for the other strands. One person&#146;s
strong expression of religious belief is another religion&#146;s
blasphemy. Long may that continue. I am a strong believer in the right
to religious belief and the right to express religious belief, even if
it offends other people. That is the nature of having free speech for
religions. However, one cannot say that about any other strand to the
same extent. My point is that religion is already recognised to be
different. The organisations that have supported the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s amendments were on my side of the
argument&#151;they may say that I was on their side of the
argument&#151;when we debated the need to ensure that incitement to
religious hatred was treated differently from the other strands. I
stress that there is precedent for
this.</div><a name="0907017000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
arguments about why there is a problem boil down to four or five areas
that I will go through. I will try to deal with the rebuttals that
might come. The first problem is that a duty to advance equality of
opportunity for religion or belief may inspire and entrench resentment,
rather than dispel it, even though that may not be the intention. It
will engage public authorities, such as local councils that are already
overstretched, in matters that should not concern them and that are a
distraction to their main mission. There is a real problem that
organisations or individuals of a certain religious belief will seek to
say, &#147;Why can&#146;t I have this service delivered to me in
the way that I want? You have a duty to do it.&#148; Such cases will
occur quite frequently, and the corollary will be absurd calls for
local authorities not to engage in Christmas celebrations because they
do not advance equality of opportunity across all religions.</div>
<a name="0907017000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">Essentially,
subsection (3)(b) involves the meeting of needs on an equal basis. The
Government may not intend to cover specific and unique support by a
public authority for a religious festival such as Christmas, which is
the most important festival of the most commonly held religious belief
in this country, but that is what may flow from the measure. That
already happens, and the danger is it will happen even
more.</div><a name="0907017000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
concern is that there will be a blurring of the boundary between needs
that are based on holding a religion and needs to implement, or see
manifested 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column564" />Column number: 564</div>more widely, the consequences of that religion. For example, public
authorities may be asked, regardless of whether it is the intention of
the statute, to make extra provision to allow employees to discriminate
in line with their religions beliefs on the basis that they have that
need. I do not doubt that many religious people genuinely feel that
they have a need not to be forced to register gay partnerships. The
Minister has been clear&#151;perhaps not as clear as she could be if
the measure was set out in statute&#151;that it is unacceptable for
an employee of a public authority performing a public duty to
discriminate on another ground in the exercise of those public
functions. However, there will be calls for that based on the public
duty, which would be regrettable given that, even before we have the
public duty, there are already those calls that cannot be
justified.</div>
<a name="0907017000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
concern is that organisations and individuals will argue that public
authorities need to support their religion in the way in which the
state supports the established Church and other Churches more broadly
through certain exemptions for places of worship and so forth. If the
authorities do not support their religions in cash terms, they will
argue that it is not equality of
opportunity.</div><a name="0907017000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">Naturally,
many of the views and opinions held by religious people are dictated by
religious doctrine, and they relate to areas of public policy. On the
basis of public sector duty, does the Minister understand the risk of
public authorities being asked to have regard of some religions that do
not want to have gambling in the local authority area or sex education
in state-run schools?</div>
<a name="0907017000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">If evolution
is being taught in schools, some may argue that creationism should be
taught as well. Again, it is hard to argue that that is a need.
Moreover, it is hard to argue that that is not a need that is different
from the needs of people who do not share the belief, or the
&#147;relevant protected characteristic&#148;. I can see nothing in
the provision&#146;s construction that will give an obvious defence
to local authorities that will enable them to strike out such a claim
at the outset. We need something that can be pointed to in statute that
shows that the public authority can say, &#147;No, we are not going
to do that. It is not justified.&#148; If we do not have that, the
public authority will have to say, &#147;Okay, we will investigate it
and see if we can reach a compromise, and we accept that you have a
need that is specific to your religion&#148; and more and more claims
will be made under the duty.</div>
<a name="0907017000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should be
grateful to the Minister if she told us how a local authority and an
education authority will respond to an argument made under subsection
(1)(b) and (3)(b) that their need to have creationism taught should be
met on the basis of equality of opportunity. We have already debated
the fact that people cannot claim discrimination if creationism is not
taught in the curriculum, because the curriculum is exempted from such
claims. However, I am not talking about that. What comes into play here
is the positive duty outside of simply not
discriminating</div><a name="0907017000474"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.15
pm</div><a name="0907017000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
further concern&#151;my real one&#151;that I hope the Minister will
be able to address at some point is that religious organisations funded
by public authorities are involved in the provision of public services.
We know that such organisations claim that they need to provide
services for a particular group of people, which I can 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column565" />Column number: 565</div>accept in principle, or that, because of their ethos, doctrine or the
need not to offend people who are of their belief, they want the right
to discriminate in the provision of public services on the grounds of
religion and belief. That means&#151;and we can see it happening
now&#151;that public services are delivered by religious
organisations under contract to a public authority to specific
religious groups. Such organisations say that they are catering only
for those religious groups. I have concerns about that, which I will
discuss in relation to schedule 23.</div>
<a name="0907017000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">My point is
that if we couple that with the right of everyone to have their needs
met, what is to stop every religious community saying, &#147;Well,
you fund this organisation with cash to provide this service to their
people. We think you should provide this service to our people through
our organisation.&#148; Again, I cannot see how the local authority
will be able to resist that request or, at least, not feel under great
pressure to do so and, indeed, to defend itself in court if necessary.
Such a measure will have created the start of what I have described as
the trend towards the balkanisation of
services.</div><a name="0907017000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are asking for some stop on that process&#151;perhaps through some
restriction on discrimination on the grounds of religion in respect of
the exemption permitted under schedule 23. I say to the hon. Member for
Glasgow, East that that would still allow the sort of provision that is
already allowed in other areas, but not under such a wide exemption.
Alternatively, there should be some stop within the measure that
enables public authorities to have due regard to the matter. I know my
feelings about the splitting up of public services in that way are
shared by many people, especially in the House of
Lords.</div><a name="0907017000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have already said that there is a concern that the provision will be
misunderstood by religious organisations. They will say, &#147;If
there are Christmas celebrations, we should be entitled to our own
celebrations funded and backed by the public authority.&#148; I do
not think we should go down that path. Perhaps the Minister thinks that
that is a path down which we want to go, but sooner or later one has to
draw a
line.</div><a name="0907017000053"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907017000518"></a>John
Mason:</b> I am restraining myself from intervening too often,
but on that point, is the picture that the hon. Gentleman paints not a
little bit away from reality? The reality in Glasgow, with which I am
familiar&#151;I believe it is also the case in other cities and
boroughs&#151;is that councils support the celebration of religious
and other cultural events across the spectrum. They might support a
larger group a little bit more, but my experience of local authorities
is that they are very good at supporting all sorts of groups in the
community. Is that not the way we want to
go?</div><a name="0907017000054"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907017000519"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> Local authorities do not need legislation of this
kind to do that. The provisions might mean that they have a
duty&#151;not discretion&#151;to do such things. Every religious
group might say, &#147;We have a right to be funded to the same
extent as every other religion is funded or supported by
you&#148;&#151;by which I mean the public authority. There is no
bar to that expectation in the drafting of the provision. I am all in
favour of there being discretion, but the duty to have regard to the
need to provide equality of opportunity coupled with the fact that
public authorities are already funding some 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column566" />Column number: 566</div>religions to do certain things, will lead to more not less
religion-specific provision. It will also lead to more divisiveness and
more segregation in the delivery of public services. That is not
something we should be looking
towards.</div><a name="0907017000055"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907017000520"></a>John
Mason:</b> Again, I wonder about the gap between the theory
and the reality. If, for example, a religious group is giving out soup
to homeless people at night, it will give it to every single homeless
person who is there. It would not know what someone&#146;s religion
was, if they had a religion or about any such issues. Surely there is a
danger, if we go to the other extreme, of squeezing out all the
religious groups that hand out soup, and the people who will suffer are
the homeless people who will not get any more
soup.</div><a name="0907017000056"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907017000521"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> There is nothing wrong with local authorities
giving contracts to religious organisations. My concern is where
religious organisations discriminate on the basis of religion or
belief. An example is given in the explanatory notes to another part of
the Bill. Public funding may be used for adoption agencies, which
perform a critical public function. It is the Government&#146;s
intention, apparently, to allow adoption agencies to discriminate
against people of the wrong religion in deciding who can apply to adopt
a baby.</div>
<a name="0907017000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">Perhaps
Catholic adoption agencies are a particular attraction to prospective
Catholic parents. There is nothing wrong with that&#151;indeed, they
could market more among those people&#151;but to say, &#147;No
Protestants can access services through us&#148; seems to me to be
wrong in a public function, whether or not it is funded by the public.
It means that a Muslim organisation or Muslim individuals will say,
&#147;Wow, there&#146;s a Catholic adoption agency and we
can&#146;t apply there. Equality of opportunity means by definition
that we should have our own adoption agency, which caters only for
us.&#148; Then the Jews might say, &#147;Well, we can&#146;t
apply to the Catholic or the Muslim adoption agency. We want our
own&#148; and then Protestants will want their own. The only group
that would not want their own&#151;although they might be forced to
have one&#151;is the atheists.</div>
<a name="0907017000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
balkanisation of services would result, founded on the basis that
discrimination is allowed, for no good reason. I do not think the
parents&#146; religion matters, in the end, in terms of whether
babies will be well placed with them. I agree that Catholic adoption
agencies might encourage Catholic parents to come forward. They might
be good at recruiting parents, who are desperately needed; I do not
have a problem with that. But to have a blanket ban on people of other
religions accessing a public service is unjustified. Coupling that with
an equality duty will result in the same thing with every single
religious organisation, and only religious organisations. An adoption
agency cannot say, &#147;No blacks,&#148; so that balkanisation
would never occur in race; it occurs only in religion. The cat is
already out of the bag, unless we close it in this clause. I have made
that point enough times, so I promise not to return to it.</div>
<a name="0907017000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the paper
provided to hon. Members, the EHRC makes the point that a possible
benefit of the public sector equality duty in respect of religion and
belief is improved access to health or other public
services</div><a name="0907017000431"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;by
enhancing responsiveness to religious sensitivities and practices, such
as greater consideration of the impact of Ramadan observance in the
context of providing health care, support for students and even in
terms of adjusting scheduled timetables&#148;.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column567" />Column number: 567</div><a name="0907017000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have not
argued that there is no merit in the proposal whatever; this is just a
series of risk-benefit analyses. However, many of the examples given by
the EHRC are clearly covered by subsection (3)(a), for example. If my
amendment is not made, and an amendment were later made to
remove subsection (3)(b), leaving in subsections (1)(b) and
(3)(a), any disadvantage suffered by people who cannot access services
could be covered. I would be prepared to see it covered; I cannot speak
for Lord Lester, who I suspect feels more strongly about the public
sector duty as it applies to religion. If a clear disadvantage is
suffered by people who share a relevant protected characteristic, the
provision can be left in, but that is different from a cited need. That
is why many of the EHRC&#146;s examples can be addressed without the
need for subsection (3)(b), although I accept that some of them are
arguable.</div><a name="0907017000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">Many
of the EHRC&#146;s examples are examples of unjustifiable indirect
discrimination. If one criterion for accessing health services in a
hospital is wearing a very immodest gown&#151;both women and men are
made to wear them, but in this case, it is of concern to Muslim
women&#151;and people cannot comply with that criterion because of
their religious belief, that is unjustifiable indirect discrimination.
Hospitals should provide&#151;many do, and they all ought
to&#151;appropriate hospital gowns that do not create such
discrimination. I do not believe that it is a question of need as laid
out
here.</div><a name="0907017000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">Other
examples given by the EHRC involve improving police practice and
attitudes across the public sector towards particular religious groups.
It is not my view that a public sector equality duty is needed to
achieve that, where it is required. That has been happening for a long
time, and I do not think that the public sector duty should hinge on
whether that is
done.</div><a name="0907017000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
EHRC gives the example of the provision of women-only gyms, but the
Bill already permits women-only gyms or swimming periods to be
provided. A public sector equality duty is not required to allow that
for, for example, Muslim women. Interestingly, the EHRC cites the
Southall Black Sisters in defence of extending the public sector
equality duty to religion and belief, but, in fact, that group has
written to the discrimination law review consultation strongly opposing
extension of the public sector equality duty to religion and
belief.</div><a name="0907017000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
quote from the organisation Women Against Fundamentalism,
which</div><a name="0907017000432"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;is
opposed to the extension of the single equality duty to religion and
belief. We strongly feel that an extension will not promote equality
but will instead reinforce inequality...We would remind the
Equalities Office, that the right to manifest one&#146;s religion,
unlike the race and gender equality duties, cannot be treated as an
absolute
duty.&#148;</div><a name="0907017000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
says &#147;duty&#148;, but it is a right, of course. Women Against
Fundamentalism goes on to state that there
is</div><a name="0907017000433"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;an
urgent need to address the complications that arise when religious
discrimination is treated unproblematically as an
&#145;equality&#146; strand. At national and local levels,
religious identity politics is being contested by women and others
within minority communities, as well as in the wider society in their
struggle to be free from racism, gender violence or other oppressive
restrictions whose persistence are themselves an indicator of
inequality.&#148;</div><a name="0907017000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
group has concerns, and I know that the Minister will be aware of other
organisations that share them.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column568" />Column number: 568</div><a name="0907017000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">Southall Black
Sisters wrote to say similar things about its opposition to the
provision relating to religion. It stated in its letter of 8 October to
the discrimination law review
team:</div><a name="0907017000434"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Our
concerns about extending the equality duty to religion and belief stem
directly from our day to day casework experience and our struggle to
maintain a service for all black and minority women in a context where
the politicisation of religion (a deeply reactionary and discriminatory
development) worldwide, has resulted in the shrinking of secular
spaces&#151;a necessary precondition in our struggle for
women&#146;s human
rights.&#148;</div><a name="0907017000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
letter goes on to explain the background of Southall Black Sisters,
which is a respectable organisation. That is why I am not surprised
that the EHRC should seek to cite it in support, but, in fact, the
group is clear that it is opposed to the duty. It
states:</div><a name="0907017000435"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;By
seeking to include religion in the promotion of equality, our concern
is that the state will be signalling the view that the promotion of
equality involves supporting organisations of a particular faith or
belief even if they have beliefs that are profoundly exclusionary and
discriminatory. By extending the equality duty to cover religion, the
state will be implicated in promoting indirect discrimination and
inequality and indeed in human rights violations, leading to a watering
down of human rights standards where minority communities are
concerned.&#148;</div><a name="0907017000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not say that the group is saying that that applies to all religious
organisations or, for example, to Muslim organisations in general, but
it is clear that its experience from the work that it does shows that
there is a problem. It does not want what it sees as the subjugation of
women by some religious organisations to be helped by the state through
a public sector
duty.</div><a name="0907017000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have raised with the EHRC, as has Lord Lester, a concern about this
matter of public policy: religious organisations will say that equality
of opportunity means that their need to have creationism taught in
schools, or not to have casinos in their area will be supported by an
equality duty. For some reason, in its response, the EHRC seems to feel
that the concern is about legislation&#151;that there would be a
positive duty in legislation to promote equality of opportunity. We are
talking about public policy, not
legislation.</div>
<a name="0907017000475"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.30
pm</div><a name="0907017000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
I return to the main concern. We must decide, when considering how to
proceed carefully and get the balance right, whether we will be a
bulwark to the increasing trend, and the fear of an increasing trend,
for public services, whether adoption, counselling or hospice services,
to be delivered on the basis of one religious group receiving from one
provider, and another religious group receiving from another. That
trend goes against the rest of the public sector equality duty, which
talks about fostering</div>
<a name="0907017000436"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;good relations
between persons who share a relevant protected characteristic and
persons who do not share
it.&#148;</div><a name="0907017000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is a matter of concern that an attempt to promote equality might lead
to greater conflict.</div>
<a name="0907017000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">We must be
certain that the promotion of equality will not be used by public
authorities to suppress free speech. Some people feel very strongly
about other people, and that might be because of those other
people&#146;s religious views or behaviour. The people who feel
strongly are often, though not exclusively, of their own religious
view. There is a concern that public authorities will feel pressured to
restrict freedom of speech, to meet people&#146;s need not to be
attacked&#151;short of unlawful incitement 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column569" />Column number: 569</div>to hatred and violations of the Public Order Act 1986&#151;and will
say, &#147;We are not going to allow you to hold your meeting in our
hall.&#148;</div>
<a name="0907017000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should like
an assurance from the Minister that, although we might not agree with
strongly held religious views being expressed against the followers of
other religions, the public sector duty will not be used by public
authorities to justify not allowing, for example, a fiery Baptist
preacher to preach in strong terms to his followers against followers
of other religions, short of breaching laws on incitement to religious
hatred. In promoting community cohesion, there is a natural concern to
prevent such activity, but we must recognise that the protection of
free speech trumps much of that concern when the speech itself is not
unlawful. I should be grateful for clarification and support from the
Minister on those
grounds.</div><a name="0907017000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
297 is about exactly that need to protect free speech when public
authorities perform their duties. It is only a probing amendment, but I
want reassurance from the Minister that the duty will not be used to
undermine the free speech of individuals, whether they are religious or
not.</div>
<a name="0907017000076"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907017000522"></a>John
Mason:</b> I appreciate the opportunity to speak this
afternoon, Lady Winterton. I want to start by touching on the final
remarks of the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon, who painted
perhaps a slightly extreme picture of where we are, or where we are
going. He used the word &#147;balance&#148;, which was encouraging;
we are looking for some kind of balance and compromise. We do not want
one group to be dominant over others.</div>
<a name="0907017000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was
interested in the hon. Gentleman&#146;s view that society might be
moving more towards religious organisations running things. I had felt
that things were the other way round. In Scotland, virtually all the
schools were started by Churches and have gradually come to be run by
the state and to become more secular. The trend that I and, I think,
other religious people perceive is away from religion and towards
secularism.</div><a name="0907017000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am happy to welcome the clause and its intentions. The idea of a public
sector equality duty is good, and I welcome it on the whole. In the
Equality Act 2006 and the 2007 sexual orientation regulations, the
Government decided against extending the public duty on the grounds of
religion and sexual orientation because of the controversy that it
could have caused. The Government wanted to take their time. The
question remains: have we got the right balance?</div>
<a name="0907017000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clearly, some
want the duty to do more, and others want it to do less. The BBC and
Channel 4, as publicly funded broadcasters, say that they are worried
that the duty goes too far and that it might affect their editorial
independence. I assume that the Conservative amendments in the next
group would address that. The TUC, however, says that the duty does not
go far enough and that it should apply to charities. Of course, much of
the detail on how the duty will apply is yet to be thrashed out in
secondary legislation, which we will come to when we debate clauses 145
to 149.</div>
<a name="0907017000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government
have taken on a monumental task in trying to square this circle.
Amendment 49 goes to the heart of what I have been trying to achieve
throughout the Committee, which is a recognition of the need for
balance between the various competing rights and the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column570" />Column number: 570</div>fostering of good relations and mutual respect between people of
differing views, rather than one side being given a stick with which to
beat the other. I hope that I have found some support for
that.</div>
<a name="0907017000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am also
grateful that, although the Minister has not accepted any of my
amendments, she has sought to offer reassurance to religious groups
that religion does not come bottom of the equality pile. My amendment
would make that clear. In fact, it would make it clear that no strand
comes bottom of the pile, but that public authorities promoting
equality must balance all strands.</div>
<a name="0907017000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection
(1)(c) mentions the need to &#147;foster good relations&#148;. I
must admit that that is one of the phrases in the clause about which I
am most enthusiastic. My amendment would make it clear that fostering
good relations involves a</div>
<a name="0907017000437"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;balance between
the rights of persons who share
a&#148;</div><a name="0907017000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">particular</div><a name="0907017000438"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;protected
characteristic and the rights of persons who share a
different...protected characteristic&#148;.</div>
<a name="0907017000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clearly, as is
now obvious to all, a clash is most likely to arise between rights
based on religion and belief and rights based on sexual orientation.
Some people feel that one strand dominates another. We have previously
talked about the case of Lillian Ladele, the Christian registrar. I
understand that since last week, one of Miss Ladele&#146;s
colleagues has gone public about the fact that she too has been
disciplined and threatened with dismissal by Islington over her
conscientious objection to registering same-sex civil partnerships.
Supporters and opponents of Miss Ladele both feel that the Employment
Appeal Tribunal ruling on her case, which is being appealed, means that
every time religion conflicts with sexual orientation, the latter wins.
Adam Fuge, a principal at Matthew Arnold &amp; Baldwin solicitors,
wrote in <i class="I">Personnel Today </i>magazine in May that the Ladele case
means that there is
now</div><a name="0907017000439"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a
pecking order of competing
equalities&#148;</div><a name="0907017000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">in
which religion often loses out.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907017000523"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> Will the hon. Gentleman not accept that that is a
statement that the right not to be discriminated against in the receipt
of a public service&#151;on whatever ground, because a religious
person could want to racially discriminate&#151;always trumps the
right of someone who is delivering the public service to manifest their
religious belief in a discriminatory way? That is nothing to do with
religion versus sexual orientation; it is to do with the right not to
be discriminated against versus the right to discriminate while
delivering a public service.</div>
<a name="0907017000087"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907017000524"></a>John
Mason:</b> I would word it slightly differently. I suggest
that the right not to be discriminated against applies to both the gay
couple and the employee. The gay couple have a right to have their
relationship registered and the employee has a right not to be
discriminated against by their employer. That is what I am trying to
raise in the Committee. Ultimately, it is for Parliament to decide how
to bring together those two apparently conflicting examples of being
discriminated against.</div>
<a name="0907017000088"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907017000525"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> Let us say that there was a registrar with British
National party sympathies. Let us suppose that, because of their
strongly held beliefs, they did not want to register gay couples. Would
it be right for the council 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column571" />Column number: 571</div>to say, &#147;All right, we&#146;ll schedule you something
else,&#148; or would the council be right to say, &#147;No.
Whatever your views, you have to do your
job&#148;?</div>
<a name="0907017000089"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907017000526"></a>John
Mason:</b> At the beginning, we discussed the link between
sexual orientation and sexual behaviour, and the link between religious
belief and religious behaviour. That is what I am discussing now.
Clearly, I am not trying to deal with the separate question of what
happens when someone is in the BNP and a
racist.</div>
<a name="0907017000090"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0907017000527"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Mark Harper</b> (Forest of Dean) (Con): Looking at the detail
of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s proposals, and thinking back to a debate
on a previous clause, I remember that he raised the issue of how, in
such a circumstance, the two different sides&#151;employee and
management&#151;behave and how they deal with and resolve the clashes
of rights. Does he think that a proposal such as his amendment 49 would
effectively get those public bodies to think a little harder about how
they manage those clashes of rights? Perhaps they would still have the
same outcome, but they might get there a little more sensitively and
have at least made a better effort at balancing those competing
rights.</div><a name="0907017000091"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907017000528"></a>John
Mason:</b> I appreciate that intervention, because the hon.
Gentleman put it very well&#151;getting people to think a bit harder.
That is why I was keen to be part of the Committee and to see the
provision reflected in the legislation and put into effect by the
public bodies concerned.</div>
<a name="0907017000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">The lawyer to
whom I referred says that although equality laws are supposed to
protect religious believers from discrimination, case law has tended to
place religion at a disadvantage compared with other protected
characteristics. Michael Rubenstein, publisher of <i class="I">Equal
Opportunities Review</i> and by no means sympathetic to Miss
Ladele&#146;s position, has said that he, too, believes that the
Employment Appeal Tribunal ruling is
wrong.</div><a name="0907017000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
view seems to be that since the law requires public authorities to
provide civil partnerships, a registrar who does not feel able to do
that should get another job. However, we do not take that view with
teachers. Schools are required to provide religious education and, as
was mentioned the other day, to provide a daily act of collective
worship that
is</div><a name="0907017000440"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;wholly
or mainly of a broadly Christian
character&#148;.</div><a name="0907017000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is a legal requirement placed on a public authority, just as the Civil
Partnership Act 2004 is a legal requirement placed on a public
authority. Does that mean that all teachers must take part in
fulfilling that duty?
No.</div><a name="0907017000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">Sections
59 and 60 of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998 specifically
allow a teacher to opt out of providing religious education or
participating in collective worship, which is quite right. That is the
pluralistic society that I am looking for. The law creates space for
atheists and for people of differing religious convictions not to be
compelled to take part in promoting things to which they
conscientiously object. Why can we not do the same for issues of
religious conscience in other
settings?</div><a name="0907017000096"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907017000529"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> That is all backwards. The problem with collective
worship and sections 58 to 60 of the School Standards and Framework Act
is that they create religious discrimination. My position and that of
the Liberal 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column572" />Column number: 572</div>Democrats is consistent: there should not be that religious
discrimination. If we did not have the discrimination of forcing people
in school, potentially, to deliver a prayer that they did not want to,
we would not have to have the exemption. The hon. Gentleman must
remember that section 60 of the School Standards and Framework Act
allows a state school to sack a maths teacher for not believing in God,
if it is a reserved post. I do not think that he can defend that as a
paradigm of fairness in religious
terms.</div><a name="0907017000097"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907017000530"></a>John
Mason:</b> On that point, I am perhaps more in agreement with
the hon. Gentleman than I usually am. On whether there should be
religious worship in schools and his reference to the maths teacher and
so on, I broadly agree with him. My point is that in other parts of
legislation there is scope for the individual to have a little freedom
of manoeuvre&#151;that is what I am asking for here. I am not seeking
a &#147;get out of jail free&#148; card, which would make it
impossible for a local authority to fulfil its functions,
but simply some reasonable accommodation for individuals. The opt-out
works well for teachers, and pupils do not suffer. Why could the same
not be true for
registrars?</div><a name="0907017000476"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.45
pm</div><a name="0907017000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
amendment would focus the minds of decision makers in local authorities
on the need for such give and take in all their functions. Even if the
public sector duty does not apply specifically to employment, it would
affect the culture, which the Minister is very keen on doing through
the Bill. There is a danger that, without my amendment, the new duty
could be used against religion, pushing it further out of the public
square. Leaving sexual orientation aside, there are lots of stories
about how existing equality requirements are used to remove expressions
of religious faith from the public
square.</div><a name="0907017000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">Oxford
city council was criticised in November last year for deciding to hold
a winter light festival in the city instead of traditional Christmas
celebrations. Interestingly, the strongest criticism of the council
came from non-Christian religious
leaders.</div><a name="0907017000100"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907017000531"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> The hon. Gentleman mentions my constituency, so I
rise to support the actions of the Oxford Inspires group. The event was
not a substitute for Christmas light celebrations at all. That was a
typical myth produced by one of the newspapers, and it has been denied.
Everyone in Oxford who is aware of the facts accepts that that was not
so. The allegations about Winterval are exactly the sort of thing that
we are likely to see if this public sector equality duty is red in
tooth and claw regarding religion or belief. We should downplay that
aspect in respect of the public functions so that public authorities
can get on with delivering what is required, rather than have scare
stories about Christmas lights being taken
down.</div><a name="0907017000101"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907017000532"></a>John
Mason:</b> I am happy to accept that the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s knowledge of the detailed case is greater than mine.
All we are trying to say is that there is a tradition of Christmas and
Easter&#151;and Muslim festivals as well&#151;which we are all
happy to celebrate or, at the very least, happy to allow other people
to celebrate. We do not have to water everything down to a minimalist
secular position.</div>

over-interpret concepts of religious equality as requiring the
eradication of religion, especially the traditional religion, which in
our case is Christianity. There needs to be a rebalancing of how public
authorities handle the different equality streams. Good relations
between strands are not possible where religion is ignored. I feel, as
do others, that something needs to be done, and where better to start
than in this
Bill?</div><a name="0907017000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
249 would leave religion out of the public sector duty altogether. If
the proposal had been to leave out religion and sexual orientation,
that would have had the virtue of avoiding the main clash of rights
that I am concerned about. However, leaving out only religion, yet
again, relegates religious people. The explanatory wording to the
amendment talks about removing the

think about whether there is anything that they can or should do to
tackle that. My hon. Friend the Member for Stroud put his finger on
that at the outset. He was right that that is the primary
aim.</div><a name="0907017000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have approached this from the position of finding out whether there is
any evidence that some people with religious beliefs are suffering
disadvantage or have different needs. That is a narrow question, and we
think that the answer is yes. Let us take different needs first.
Because of their religious beliefs, some members of religious groups
might have different needs when it comes to accessing or engaging with
public services. For instance, to cite a tried and tested example that
nevertheless makes the point, some Muslim women might not feel able to
receive medical care, particularly gynaecological care, from a member
of the opposite sex. For a primary care trust or a hospital trust not
to deliver that service to them would not be discrimination, and would
not therefore be dealt with under paragraphs (a) or (c). This is about
equality of opportunity. Given that there are poorer ante-natal,
post-natal and infant health outcomes for Muslim women now than for
anyone else, would one not want the local authority or PCT to
acknowledge that need and to ensure that it was
met?</div><a name="0907017000108"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907017000534"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> Will the Solicitor-General give
way?</div><a name="0907017000109"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907017000535"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> No, not all. How long have we
listened?</div><a name="0907017000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is a similar argument about opening swimming pools to women-only
groups&#151;Muslim women, for instance, who would not be happy
swimming in scanty swimwear with men around. We would not want a
special swimming 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column574" />Column number: 574</div>pool demanded by the Muslims, and then one for the Jews, one for the
Catholics and one for the British Humanist Association. Instead, a
special time could be designated when women could swim on their own, as
often happens now. This requires local authorities, primary care trusts
and all public authorities to think about the impact of their policies
on people who have religious beliefs. It certainly does not mean
separate services on demand, and it is fatuous to suggest that it will
lead to balkanisation. Where there is evidence of need, we must ensure
that public services are responsive to that need for the benefit of
people who use the services. It will not lead to balkanisation, let
alone the abolition of Christmas.</div>
<a name="0907017000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon wanted to know whether need
involved an objective element. This is very straightforward. The duty
is on the public authority, which will have to decide whether there is
a need to be met and exercise due regard in making that decision. It
will have to behave and determine the issue in an appropriate and
proportionate way. Evidence will be required; it will not be possible
for some fatuous or supposed religious organisation to suggest that it,
too, should have something that other people have without any evidence
at all. The hon. Gentleman will say that there must be equal provision
for every strand of religion. He says it again and again&#151;and
again and again and again. That simply is not the case. We are talking
about need. This is not a difficult provision to understand, and I do
not know why it causes such a lot of anxiety. However, it
does&#151;and has done so about eight times now.</div>
<a name="0907017000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another aspect
to advancing equality opportunity is that of encouraging participation
in public life. We want local authorities to think about how they can
encourage Muslim women. I think that nine Muslim women are councillors
in England and Wales. Local authorities would be encouraged to use the
provision to ensure that they brought in more people. If we accepted
amendment 249, we would return to a hierarchy of inequality that would
bleed into the other limbs. For instance, if the current unfair
patchwork of coverage survives, Jews and Sikhs would still be covered
under the race strand, whereas Christians, Muslims and humanists would
not.</div>
<a name="0907017000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">There seems to
be a sense among Opposition Members that gay people and religious
people hate each other relentlessly all the time, that that happens
throughout life, and that every day is full of perpetuated hatred
between those groups. That is a wholly unrealistic position. We took a
lot of evidence from witnesses from Stonewall, and the hon. Gentleman
tried to prod them into saying that there were deficiencies in the Bill
and that they were insufficiently protected as gay people. They
repudiated that entirely and try as he might&#151;several
times&#151;they simply would not have it. Stonewall&#146;s
&#147;Living Together&#148; report makes it clear that about 84 per
cent. of people of faith do not think that homosexuality is morally
unacceptable in all circumstances. Let us be more realistic with our
submissions and they might be a bit shorter.</div>
<a name="0907017000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 49
would make explicit the concept of &#147;due regard&#148; by
involving an additional element of ensuring a balance. We think that
due regard, which is central to the operation of the duty, is better.
It requires the public authority to take into account all relevant
factors and arrive at a proportionate decision. Instead of requiring
all that, the amendment would turn the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column575" />Column number: 575</div>process into a simple balancing exercise that we would find unwelcome.
Inherent in the concept of advancing good relations is the need to
ensure that one part of the community is not unfairly favoured over
another. One could not describe a public authority as fostering good
relations if it had ridden roughshod in any way over one section of the
community and unjustly prioritised another. There is already a concept
of balance in the duty, and the legislation does not need this gloss.
That would make it a less sophisticated process than the one that we
feel is appropriate for all groups. We do not favour the amendment,
although we understand why it was tabled.</div>
<a name="0907017000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 297
would require public authorities not to inhibit free expression when
complying with a duty. Subsection (5) is clear about where the duty
sits in relation to the law. It does not trump or override the law, but
operates within its limits. A public authority will have to obey the
law and ensure that it does not infringe the lawful rights of anyone,
whether intentionally or otherwise. The Human Rights Act 1998 enshrined
the right to freedom of expression in law. Although it is a qualified
right, people are free to think and say what they like within the
boundaries of the
law.</div><a name="0907017000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are powerful reasons why we need these provisions in the Bill. They
will form the leverage that we use to transform the culture, and it is
a pity that that is not evident to other Committee
members.</div><a name="0907017000117"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907017000536"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I am grateful for the Minister&#146;s words
about amendment 297, in which she gave a clear defence of free speech
and explained the duty for public authorities to protect it. That
should send a message to universities in particular that no platform
policies are acceptable. They should not infringe the right of lawful
free speech, even for unpleasant organisations and individuals. That is
especially true on campus when whom is deemed to be unacceptable is
determined by some kangaroo court on the basis of who the National
Union of Students or the local student union thinks should not be
allowed to speak. Of course people are allowed to demonstrate. However,
public authorities should not be involved in preventing people from
speaking. They should allow people to speak, even if the police then
listen carefully to what they
say.</div><a name="0907017000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
amendment 249, I regret that I could not persuade the Minister to
address the distinction, if there is one, between
&#147;disadvantages&#148; in subsection (3)(a) and
&#147;needs&#148; in subsection (3)(b). I accept her example about
the importance of access to health services for hard-to-reach groups,
some of which may share the protected characteristic of religion or
might have poor access because of the manifestation of their religious
beliefs. That puts them at a disadvantage and would automatically
enable subsection (3)(a) to
apply.</div><a name="0907017000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
249 would take out subsection (1)(b), which is the stem for the whole
of subsection (3). I accept that it goes wider than just the question
of needs. In respect of what a need is when it is not an established
disadvantage, the Minister relied on the fact that local authorities
and public authorities would have to determine whether there was a need
that they ought to meet. As I said, my concern is about the expectation
that needs will automatically be met. That causes a reciprocal
expectation by public authorities that such needs, however unwarranted
or however much they cause inefficiency&#151;or what I have called
balkanisation&#151;ought to be met.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column576" />Column number: 576</div><a name="0907017000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">The assertion
that Opposition Members&#151;whether me or the hon. Member for
Glasgow, East&#151;think that there is widespread conflict between
gay people and religious people is misplaced and creates a straw man.
However, it is true that the nexus between religion and sexual
orientation is being tested in case law. Another issue is the ability
of employers to restrict the manifestation of religious belief in
employment, irrespective of issues of sexual orientation. That is where
the case law is. It is not unreasonable when debating the Bill to
concentrate on where the problems are and not on where there is broad
agreement.</div><a name="0907017000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
249 has not found favour. It might be too wide, so perhaps it would be
more appropriate to table a narrower amendment at a later stage. I beg
to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="0907017000122"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

Featherstone</b> (Hornsey and Wood Green) (LD): I beg to move
amendment 281, in schedule 18, page 215, line 25, leave out paragraph
1.</div><a name="09070131000004"></a><div class="hs_brev"><i class="I">To remove the exception
from the age public sector equality duty so far as relating to
education and public services for young people, such as
children&#146;s
homes.</i></div><a name="0907017000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment would remove the exception on age from the public sector
equality duty so far as it relates to education and public services for
young people, such as schools and children&#146;s homes. We briefly
discussed such issues when we considered an earlier provision. I expect
that colleagues have received the briefing from Young Equals, but a
survey carried out by the Department for Children, Schools and Families
shows that 43 per cent. of 18-year-olds reported unfair treatment on
the basis of their age. Three in 10 children under 11 felt that they
had experienced age discrimination, and nearly two thirds of older
teenagers said the same. Unfair treatment on the grounds of age was by
far the single biggest example of discrimination, so I hope that I can
use the amendment to probe the Minister about why schools and
children&#146;s homes have been exempted from the public sector
equality
duty.</div><a name="0907017000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would have thought that under-18s have the same need, if not more,
regarding the elimination of unlawful discrimination, the advancement
of equality of opportunity, and the fostering of good relations. The
way in which are treated at school colours the rest of our lives. If we
are disrespected because of our age, we will grow up with a certain
view. If we are treated with respect, that ethos has the possibility of
staying with us throughout school life. That goes for the numerous
relationships formed at an incredibly important time in a young
person&#146;s life, such as between children of different ages and
between children and
teachers.</div><a name="0907017000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">Schools
provide an amazing opportunity to work on intergenerational projects
and to foster good relations between different ages, and between old
and young. One of the most powerful events at my daughter&#146;s
school was when the older children were able to go into 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column577" />Column number: 577</div>the class of the younger children and be their teachers for the day.
Being able to form such relationships is crucial at that age, and
respect for all ages is really
important.</div><a name="0907017000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
was even more confused about the exemption of children&#146;s homes
from the public sector equality duty under schedule 18. One of the
great problems facing children in care is being shifted around from
home to home because they have reached the age limitation of the homes.
That could affect 10 to 14-year-olds or 14 to 18-year-olds. The
children are artificially moved on and that creates instability. It is
a requirement of Ofsted to register, specifying by age the categories
of children as a condition of the registration. That means that other
children are precluded, which flies in the face of other legislation
that favours keeping siblings together. If there are two siblings, one
in the 10 to 14 age group, and the other younger or older, it will be
impossible to keep them together if the Bill is enacted with such an
exemption.</div><a name="0907017000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">At
present, a children&#146;s home could get into trouble by taking in
siblings of a younger age than that specified. Moreover, older children
seem to have less favourable treatment in the commissioning of child
care. Commissioners are likely to make sure that an appropriate
placement is found and to take extra care for a younger child because
sometimes, when cost is a dominant factor in the decision-making
process, the needs of an older child are rated as less
important.</div><a name="0907017000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
for fostering good relations between people of all ages, I cannot
understand why the Government do not believe that the exemption will be
of particular benefit, because it relates to something that is
absolutely essential in the provision of important care. Research shows
the particular importance for children in residential homes of
relationships with not only the staff, but other children and young
people. When the ages are more varied, children benefit from exposure
to older youngsters acting as role models. The current arbitrary age
restrictions prevent what I would regard as completely natural and
beneficial age
integration.</div><a name="0907017000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will be interested to hear the Minister&#146;s response. I do not
know whether the provision existed in legislation before I was in
politics, but if it has something to do with removing the bad influence
of older children so that younger children will not be exposed to what
teenagers and older children get into, I would think that things should
be the other way around. There is more of an onus on young people to
behave better when they are given support and looked up to by even
younger ones. If they are off in a group on their own, they might be
encouraged to get into all sorts of things when they do not have the
responsibility that comes from being looked up to by siblings or
younger
children.</div><a name="0907017000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">Perhaps
the Government are saying through the exemption that such young people
are not supervised and cannot be trusted to live in a situation similar
to that of a normal family, which can include children of all ages.
There is no exemption for families relating to an age range among
siblings. On that basis, I ask the Minister to respond to those issues.
Why have the Government sought to exempt the provision of education to
pupils in schools, and of benefits, facilities and services to pupils
in schools and children&#146;s homes? I look forward to her
response.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column578" />Column number: 578</div><a name="0907017000133"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907017000538"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> Let me make it clear that the equality
duty will require the vast majority of public authorities to think
about how they can advance equality for people of all ages, including
children, when designing policies and delivering services. For
instance, that might involve ensuring that swimming pools and leisure
centres are accessible to children, or considering whether bus services
cater adequately for children. Although the prohibition on age
discrimination in the provision of goods and services does not cover
under-18s, children will still benefit from the proactive duty in
clause 143.</div>
<a name="0907017000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, we do
not think that clause 143, in so far as it relates to age, should apply
to the exercise of functions relating to education and services to
pupils in schools, and accommodation and services in children&#146;s
homes. Schools are based on the premise that children need to be
treated differently according to their age, ability and aptitude.
Advancing equality of opportunity for children of different ages makes
much less sense than advancing equality of opportunity for children of
different races or sexual orientations, for boys and girls, or for
disabled children. That is where the focus should
be.</div><a name="0907017000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Lady gave an example involving children&#146;s homes and
siblings being split so that a 13-year-old could not go into the
children&#146;s home that started at age 14 and a 14-year-old could
not stay in a children&#146;s home with a 13-year-old sibling.
However, her example makes exactly the opposite point. The arbitrary
right to insist on placing a child of inappropriate age in a facility
that provides for children of a different age, on the grounds that age
inequality provisions apply, is exactly what we want to avoid. We want
the child to be put with its sibling if it is good for the child to be
with its sibling and the environment is acceptable, and not to be if it
is not. That would be a decision taken on the basis of the welfare of
the children, not an arbitrary test of age discrimination or advancing
equality of opportunity for children of different ages. With great
respect, the hon. Lady damages her own argument with that particular
example.</div><a name="0907017000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">Concern
has been expressed by the hon. Lady and others that not having an
age-related duty for under-18s in schools and children&#146;s homes
means that nothing will be done to tackle some older children&#146;s
problems accessing child protection services or being safeguarded, but
those are functions of a local authority, and the duty applies to local
authorities. The examples that I have heard are usually found to relate
to functions of local authorities or other bodies, which are all
covered. All that the exception covers is the actual environment of the
care home or school. I know of no concrete examples so far of any
mischief that has arisen from the duty not being in place, so we do not
think that we will put it in place&#151;in fact, we are quite sure
that we will not.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907017000539"></a>Lynne
Featherstone:</b> I thank the Minister for her response. I
think that we have a basic disagreement about the benefits of promoting
opportunities for different ages and that we will not see eye to eye. I
understand some of her rationale, and I will reflect on what she said.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907017000541"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I want to probe this part of schedule 2. The
amendment has two functions. The first function is to explore why
religion and belief are included in the exemption. Perhaps we might
disagree for the same reason that we disagreed on the direct
discrimination exemption. The Committee will remember that we had a
debate about why one needs to keep out religious extremists. One cannot
justify doing so simply on the basis of indirect discrimination, given
the views that they express. I do not know whether the inclusion of
religion and belief mirrors that, or whether there is another reason,
such as rules to do with the immigration of imams and so on. It does
not seem logical just to exempt religion and belief, since the
immigration authorities would have to have a good reason and
justification for taking action against someone whose immigration
status is threatened because of a particular manifestation of their
religion or
belief.</div><a name="0907017000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
second function is to ask why the provision applies broadly to race,
which includes colour, nationality and ethnic origins, and why it does
not simply refer to nationality. One can understand why nationality
needs to be exempted from a positive duty, since it is exempted,
understandably so, from the discrimination legislation. It seems
strange that there should not be a positive duty to ensure that
immigration services are provided equally on the grounds of colour,
given that people of colour&#151;ethnic minorities&#151;may face
difficulties in dealing with the immigration service that other people
with immigration issues who are white Australians or Americans are not
as likely to face. The onus is on the immigration service to have
regard to its need to deal with that, so it would be unfortunate if all
references to race were taken out of a positive duty in respect of
immigration. I would be grateful for the Minister&#146;s
clarification of those two separate
points.</div><a name="0907017000146"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907017000542"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> We do not believe that the amendment is
helpful. Extending the duty to have due regard to the need to advance
equality of opportunity on the grounds of race, religion or belief may
not always be compatible with the UK Border Agency&#146;s functions
to provide effective immigration control that is consistent with
Government policy and with public
safety.</div><a name="0907017000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Bill will permit the UKBA to differentiate between people on the
grounds of ethnic or national origin, or of religion or belief in
particular circumstances. Such circumstances do not occur frequently,
but, when they do, it might not always be possible to say that due
regard had been taken to the need to advance equality 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column580" />Column number: 580</div>of opportunity. We would not want to open up a new avenue of costly and
time-consuming challenges against the
Government.</div><a name="0907017000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
example, the UKBA has a policy of excluding from the country
individuals whose so-called religious beliefs are so extreme that it
would not be in the public interest for them to enter or remain. We
would not want to open ourselves up to a hopeless challenge from a
representative of an extremist group who suggested that, by excluding
him, the UKBA was in breach of its obligation to have due regard to the
need to advance equality of opportunity. None the less, it is important
to make it absolutely clear that immigration policies will continue to
respect the fundamental religious freedoms that are protected by the
Human Rights
Act.</div><a name="0907017000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
times when the UKBA would want to differentiate on grounds of ethnic or
national origin are even more rare, and there has been no ministerial
authorisation under section 19D of the Race Relations Act 1976 that
would permit differential treatment on those grounds since 2002, but we
cannot rule out a crisis abroad occurring at some stage in the future,
when we may need to bring certain groups to this country for protection
but not others of the same nationality. In such rare emergency
situations, it may not be possible to have due regard to the need to
advance equality of
opportunity.</div><a name="0907017000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
exception is not designed to be a blank cheque to permit the
immigration authorities to evade their responsibilities. It is there so
that, when necessary, they can exercise their essential functions in
these respects without the possibility of a challenge, and to ensure
that the important new equality duty that we are creating is not
misused and brought into disrepute by those who seek to frustrate the
immigration
system.</div><a name="0907017000480"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.30

detain the Committee, but I am curious about why we are allowing skin
colour, which is part of the race strand, to be a means by which the
immigration service may discriminate. The Solicitor-General has not had
my experience, but almost every black professional has experience of
being singled out by immigration authorities, whether in this country
or elsewhere, purely and solely on the grounds of skin colour. When
they discover that someone has a British passport or even that they are
an elected official, they back
off&#151;<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> Yes, it has happened to
me. Black people are singled out because of skin colour. I listened to
the Solicitor-General, but she did not explain why the immigration
authorities need to be able to discriminate against people on the basis
of their skin colour. It causes considerable bad feeling among people
who otherwise do not interact with immigration
authorities.</div><a name="0907017000152"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907017000544"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> The hon. Lady makes my only residual point more
eloquently from her direct experience than I could have done. I do not
know whether the Minister has an answer, but I am not minded to press
the amendment. If she does not rise now to respond, will she write to
me about
it?</div><a name="0907017000153"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907017000545"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> I am happy to rise. Colour is part of
the definition of race. That is all. We do not want to use the power in
connection with colour&#151;far from it. All the examples that have
been given are 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column581" />Column number: 581</div>appalling and should not occur. I have seen them at airports, but race
includes all those characteristics, and there is no fundamental point
in seeking to slice out any aspect of the definition. The race
exemption has not been used since 2002, and it has not been authorised.
It is likely to be used, as I said, when we need in an emergency to
take in one group of people and leave out
another.</div><a name="0907017000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall not satisfy the hon. Gentleman or my hon. Friend that we can
solve the problem with the Bill, but colour is included because it is a
component of race and not because there is any intention of the UK
Border Agency discriminating on that
basis.</div><a name="0907017000155"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907017000546"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I do not want to prolong the matter, but the point
that the hon. Lady and I are making is that, if there is a way of
taking colour out of the exemption, that would put a positive duty on
the immigration services to undertake even more training to prevent the
incidents that have happened to my constituents who are from ethnic
minorities but that do not happen even to overseas nationals who are
white. Obviously, there is no point in pursuing the debate now, and we
will reflect on what the Solicitor-General said. I beg to ask leave to
withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="0907017000156"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907017000548"></a>The
Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to discuss
Government amendments 283 to
285.</div><a name="0907017000159"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907017000549"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> The amendments, essentially, will make
minor
corrections.</div><a name="0907017000160"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907017000550"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> I do not want to take too much of the
Committee&#146;s time, but I have a few questions.
Amendment 282 will insert an exemption for judicial
functions. Will the Solicitor-General explain why those functions will
be removed en bloc?</div>
<a name="0907017000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">What is the
logic behind amendment 284, which will remove the exemption for those
who take decisions about prosecution&#151;presumably the Director of
Public Prosecutions, the Attorney-General, the Solicitor-General and
bodies such as Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs&#151;so they
will have to make decisions bearing in mind the public sector equality
duty in clause 143. That seems to go in one direction for decisions
about prosecutions; but at the same time, there will be a wider 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column582" />Column number: 582</div>exemption for judicial functions and two issues connected with judicial
decision making seem to go in opposite
directions.</div><a name="0907017000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
282 refers to judicial functions conferred on a person other than a
court or tribunal. I just wanted to check that that applied to
Ministers when they are making quasi-judicial decisions in their
role&#151;for example, when the Secretary of State for Communities
and Local Government makes a decision about planning cases, or when
other Ministers make similar decisions in that quasi-judicial
capacity.</div>
<a name="0907017000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
explanatory notes refer to the UK Border
Agency:</div><a name="0907017000443"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
UK Border Authority, when taking immigration-related decisions, will
not need to give due regard to the need to advance equality of
opportunity for people of different races, religions beliefs or
age.&#148;</div><a name="0907017000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
the agency does have to give due
regard</div><a name="0907017000444"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to
the need to advance equality of opportunity for disabled
people...for people of all sexual orientations and transsexual
people&#148;.</div><a name="0907017000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
the UK Border Agency makes a decision, that decision could be appealed
at the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal, which is carrying out a
function of a judicial nature. Presumably, the AIT is then exempted
from the need to apply the public sector equality duty, which is a
different test to the one that is being applied by the UK Border
Agency. So the measure does not seem to be wholly consistent and could
lead to one agency making decisions based on a certain set of criteria,
but when it reaches the judicial part of the process, it is effectively
exempted from that duty. That could lead to those organisations making
different decisions purely based on whether or not the public sector
equality duty is applied. It is not a major issue, but there is a
potential for conflict. Perhaps the Minister could take us through the
logic behind the reason for amendments 282 and 284, because they seem
to be going in opposite directions, and address the other two issues
that I have raised.</div>
<a name="0907017000166"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907017000551"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> The measure does not apply to
Ministers. I certainly did not have Ministers in mind. We were thinking
about people, such as planning inspectors, who exercise judicial
functions but who are not judges as such. It has never been our policy
intent to have judicial functions in the
Bill.</div><a name="0907017000167"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0907017000552"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Tim Boswell</b> (Daventry) (Con): I am sorry that I had to
leave the Committee for a moment. Just to be clear, is the
Solicitor-General saying that Ministers never exercise quasi-judicial
functions, that they might do or that, if they do, they are not covered
by this kind of
provision?</div><a name="0907017000168"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907017000553"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> Ministers are covered when they make
decisions on various kinds of development. I did not have it in mind
that the exemption would cover Ministers, but we will write to all
parties and clarify that point.</div>
<a name="0907017000169"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907017000554"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> I just want to be clear. Ministers are explicitly
set out in schedule 19 as being subject to the public sector equality
duty. The example that I gave was in the planning case. The
Solicitor-General just confirmed that the exemption would apply to a
planning inspector, but the planning inspector will make their report
to the Secretary of State, who will then make a decision in a
quasi-judicial capacity. As in my example of the UK Border Agency and
the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column583" />Column number: 583</div>different bodies will make decisions. The AIT will operate in a judicial
capacity and the Minister in a quasi-judicial capacity, and they will
have a different set of duties to the subordinate body. It just seems
to be rather messy, and we could end up with some court cases. The
Solicitor-General knows how controversial planning decisions can get,
so it strikes me that it would be better to be very clear about this.
If the planning inspector does not have to follow the public sector
equality duty in quasi-judicial cases, neither should the
Minister.</div>
<a name="0907017000170"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907017000555"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> That sounds like a sensible conclusion
to draw from the argument. We will write to the parties on whether
Ministers will be exempted when exercising that role. There will not
necessarily be an incompatibility between the UK Border Agency, for
example, or the police and the judicial functions that follow them.
They are different kinds of agency. The UKBA makes a decision that is
not part of the judicial function, and if there is an appeal, it goes
to a judicial body. Likewise, the police make a decision about whether
to charge somebody in a non-judicial way and the matter then goes to
court. The judicial function is exempt from the Bill in a way that the
police are not. That is not a real issue, but we will write about
whether Ministers are quasi-judicial.</div>
<a name="0907017000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think that
the hon. Gentleman was making another substantive point about whether
we will go in opposite directions by excluding judicial functions for
all purposes and bringing in a prosecution function. We do not think
that we are doing that, although it is an oversight that we have not
dealt with the matter before. We now wish fully to exclude judicial
functions from the duty for all purposes. That is about the exercise of
actual judicial functions. The measure is not, for instance, about HM
Courts Service, the Ministry of Justice or administrative support to
the courts; it is about purely judicial functions. The courts will have
to have regard to the equality duty even when carrying out the
instructions of a judge, but the judge will
not.</div><a name="0907017000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
amendment 284, the policy is that the prosecution functions of the
Crown Prosecution Service and the Serious Fraud Office should be
subject to the requirements of the equality duty in the same way as
other functions. They are included in schedule 19, so their decisions
to prosecute will be subject to the requirements of the duty. However,
paragraph 3(3)(f) of schedule 18 will disapply the equality duty to
organisations other than public authorities exercising public functions
in respect of decisions on whether to institute criminal proceedings.
For safety&#146;s sake, that will have caught any organisation not
listed in schedule 19 that from time to time might exercise public
functions in respect of decisions on whether to prosecute. We do not
think that that is necessary, and we cannot think of any body like that
anyway.</div><a name="0907017000173"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907017000556"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> If I am clear about the matter,
amendment 282 on the wider exclusion of judicial functions
will correct an oversight. Amendment 284 will effectively reapply the
duty to those who make prosecuting decisions. Is that an oversight or
is that changing something because somebody has thought again? Does the
measure effectively mean that, in relation to the test already applied
by pretty much all of those who make prosecution decisions about the
likelihood of success, the public interest test that is already used
will be widened to cover 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column584" />Column number: 584</div>the public sector equality duty? I am thinking specifically about the
area with which I am most familiar: the CPS&#146;s decision to make
prosecuting decisions in cases of hate crime. When making decisions in
those cases, will the CPS effectively set the bar lower because of the
need to advance equality? I am thinking particularly of hate crimes
against disabled people.</div>
<a name="0907017000174"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907017000557"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> The CPS already has that duty, of
course, because it is already subject to the public sector duties that
currently exist. The measure is not a change in policy towards the main
prosecuting bodies. Paragraph 3(3)(f) of schedule 18 will disapply the
equality duty for a community of people whom we now do not think need
the exception at all, because we cannot think who would be involved.
The measure will disapply the equality duty for persons who are not
public authorities, but who exercise public functions in respect of
decisions on whether to institute criminal proceedings. However, we
cannot think of a body that is not a public authority that would, none
the less, carry out the public function of prosecuting. The measure was
left in the Bill when it probably should not have been, but it is not a
change of policy. The CPS remains covered; the judiciary for pretty
obvious reasons do not. In a nutshell, I hope that that is sufficient
to deal with the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
concerns.</div><a name="0907017000175"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907017000558"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I beg to move amendment 300, in
schedule 18, page 216, leave out line
25.</div><a name="09070131000007"></a><div class="hs_brev"><i class="I">This amendment removes
the exemption for the General Synod of the Church of England from the
duty in section
143(2).</i></div><a name="0907017000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
amendment was tabled in response to one tabled earlier by the hon.
Member for Glasgow, East, which we debated previously, that sought to
un-exempt all the law-making bodies, except the Church of England, and
remove them from the schedule. I thought that it was only fair that the
Church should not be discriminated against and that this matter should
be debated. I accept that it is a rather rhetorical point and that it
was meant for the hon. Gentleman, so I do not expect the Minister to
bother responding to it, because I guess that what she said in respect
of lines 21 to 24 would apply. However, I should like to make an extra
point.</div><a name="0907017000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Church of England is different, because we have an established
religion. Therefore, in my view, anything that it does as a religion
that is discriminatory it is entitled to do. It is its own business if
it does not want to have women priests or bishops or gay priests or
whatever. However, that becomes our business, because the established
nature of the Church means that our country, and this institution, is
associated with the policies of the Church and many people, including
many in the Church of England, do not find it satisfactory that there
is essentially a homophobic Church of England and General Synod.
Despite the many virtues of many of its policies relating to
development aid and so forth, it is still, essentially, endorsing a
homophobic position. That is either the Church of England&#146;s
business, because it is its own religion, or it is our business because
it is the established Church and we are associated with it. The best
example of this is in the House of Lords, where seats in our
legislature are reserved for heterosexual,
white&#151;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column585" />Column number: 585</div><a name="0907017000179"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907017000559"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. The hon. Gentleman is going slightly
astray. This is not about the House of Lords; it is about the
Synod.</div><a name="0907017000180"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907017000560"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I will seek to stay in order, Lady Winterton. My
point was that without the duty applying to the General Synod, we end
up in a situation where our society is male-only in respect of bishops
in the House of Lords and heterosexual-only, which raises the question
of whether there is a basis for the General Synod&#146;s being
exempted from this duty. However, I accept that I have gone wider than
that point and I apologise for doing
so.</div><a name="0907017000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not expect much of a reply&#151;just an explanation as to why the
General Synod is treated in the same as the House of
Commons.</div><a name="0907017000182"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907017000561"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> Most of the functions of the General
Synod are private, so they would not be subject to the requirements of
the duty at all. However, it can pass measures that, if approved by
each House of Parliament and given Royal Assent, have the same force
and effect as Acts of Parliament. So there are sound constitutional
reasons why legislative bodies should not be subject to the
requirements of the duty. That is why we keep them out of
it.</div><a name="0907017000183"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907017000562"></a>Dr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907017000565"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> The amendments relate to whether the Bill will
affect those involved in broadcasting. Committee members will have had
a brief from the BBC, Channel 4 and S4C outlining their concerns about
whether they will be caught under the Bill&#146;s provisions. They
have made it clear that they are committed to equality of opportunity
and diversity and they recognise that, despite the progress they have
made, they need to do more. They also mention the diversity pledge they
have made, which is a commitment by broadcasters, independent
production companies, in-house producers and suppliers to introduce
measurable steps to improve
diversity.</div><a name="0907017000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">BBC,
Channel 4 and S4C have said that the Bill aims to streamline the law
and strengthen equality legislation, that it talks about the public
sector equality duty and that it is about the positive duty to promote
equality, which will apply to all their functions, unless some are
specifically excluded. They are concerned that the Bill will result in
inappropriate interference with their editorial independence, thereby
having a negative effect on the range and depth of their
programming&#151;from news and current affairs to drama&#151;and
limiting their ability to make challenging content. They have made it
clear to Government that functions relating to the commissioning,
content and broadcasting of programmes and other 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column586" />Column number: 586</div>output should be excluded from the positive duty to promote equality and
from the non-discrimination provisions.</div>
<a name="0907017000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">Broadly
speaking, that is what amendments 192 and 193 would
do&#151;at least, I think so. Amendment 192 would amend schedule 18,
adding to the list of persons exempted from the public sector equality
duty
those</div><a name="0907017000445"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;involved
in the commissioning, content and broadcast of
programmes.&#148;</div><a name="0907017000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
193 would amend the same schedule, adding to the list of functions that
are exempted from that duty</div>
<a name="0907017000446"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a function in
connection with the commissioning, content and broadcast of
programmes.&#148;</div><a name="0907017000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
three broadcasting organisations have explained why this issue matters.
They think that if the Bill applied to their content, they would
effectively have complaints brought against their programming via the
EHRC. That would create for them what they call double jeopardy,
because they think those issues are already dealt with by existing
broadcasting regulators: Ofcom and the BBC
Trust.</div><a name="0907017000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
broadcasting organisations suggested two main types of action that
might be brought: an action by a member of the audience who objects to
a particular aspect of output as discriminatory; or an action by a
person who has a closer relationship with the broadcaster&#151;for
example, a participant in a show, the subject of a documentary or an
interviewee. Examples they have given in the brief include a claim of
race discrimination on the basis that, over a period of time, their
dramas featured too few non-white people; a claim that they were
showing a film that was thought offensive to a particular group; a
claim of sex discrimination on the basis that a programme was degrading
to women; and a claim of indirect discrimination, in that output
generally contained a disproportionate amount of material offensive to
a religious group. They said that some of those complaints would not
succeed, but even so, just dealing with them would have an impact on
time and resources. They also said that it would have an inevitable
chilling effect on the creative process.</div>
<a name="0907017000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
broadcasting organisations made the point that if people do not like
the content of their programmes, they can already complain via Ofcom or
the BBC Trust, and that in the Communications Act 2003 Parliament
decided that the process involving Ofcom or the BBC
Trust was best placed to supervise and make judgments about
programme content and balance. The organisations want the Government to
make it clear that they do not intend that functions relating to the
commissioning, content and broadcasting of programmes and other output
should be covered by the Bill&#146;s proposed duty to promote
equality or its non-discrimination provisions.</div>
<a name="0907017000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">I asked the
Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport
what</div><a name="0907017000447"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;discussions
he has had with the Minister for Women and Equality on the likely
effects of the provisions of the Equality Bill on the commissioning,
content and broadcast of television and radio
programmes.&#148;</div><a name="0907017000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
a written answer that I received on 9 June, he
replied:</div><a name="0907017000448"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Officials
from my Department and from the Government Equalities Office have had
detailed discussions about any effect that the Equality Bill may have
on the commissioning, content  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column587" />Column number: 587</div>and broadcast of television and radio programmes. The Government policy
is that the new equality duty should not apply to the commissioning,
content and broadcast of programmes.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official
Report</i>, 9 June 2009; Vol. 493, c.
824-5W.]</div><a name="0907017000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">From
my point of view, that is a helpful answer. That may be what the
Government intend, but I reread the Bill and the schedule, having
received that assurance, and I am not entirely clear that the Bill does
what Government policy wants it to do. Given that the Secretary of
State has set out what Government policy is, is the Minister
comfortable that the clause and schedule as
drafted adequately deliver that intention? Alternatively, can the Bill
be improved, either by my two amendments&#151;accepting that they
themselves may be improved&#151;or by tabling alternative Government
amendments on Report to ensure that the Bill delivers that policy
intention? That is what I am looking for from the
Minister.</div><a name="0907017000197"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907017000566"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> I rise briefly in support of my hon. Friend. It
is appropriate to remind the Committee that I am a vice-chairman of the
all-party BBC group, although that is not material to the comments I
shall make.</div>
<a name="0907017000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to
begin by reinforcing what has already been said. Of course, the BBC, to
some extent exceptionally among public service broadcasters, is in
effect a taxation authority, through its operation of the licence fee,
for a very substantial sum&#151;just under &#163;3 billion
annually. Indeed, in our earlier exchanges about Ministers exercising
quasi-judicial functions and the Solicitor-General&#146;s assurance
that the Government thought they had covered the coterie of potential
prosecutors, I was almost tempted to say that the BBC prosecutes for
failures to pay the licence fee. It is the nearest to a public sector
body that might have been covered by the discussion. Without commenting
further, she might reflect on that before she responds. There is no
doubt that the BBC, unless and until the arrangements for public
service broadcasting are changed&#151;they are controversial, as she
will know&#151;has a public
function.</div><a name="0907017000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
second point&#151;occasionally people can wax lyrical and seek to
extend protection into areas where it is not appropriate&#151;is that
the BBC is an employer. Many of the functions it discharges are, as I
understand it, quite properly within the remit of the Bill. I see the
Solicitor-General nodding. I do not have a problem with that, and I
understand that the BBC also does not have a problem with it. However,
the point that my hon. Friend rightly homed in on&#151;the integrity
of editorial independence&#151;is serious because clearly, nobody
wants to claim that their editorial independence has been subverted,
and provisions are already in place for regulation and receiving
complaints. I cannot see a strong case for seeking to intervene in such
things through the Bill when provision is made elsewhere.</div>
<a name="0907017000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">None of that
is to say, and nobody is saying, that the BBC and other media or public
service broadcasters are walking away from the discrimination pledge.
If I recall correctly, I was there when Mark Thompson, who was then
leading Channel 4 rather than the BBC, led on the pledge. It is quite
right that we should have it. The issue is simply the form in which any
disputes are resolved, and I think my hon. Friend has performed a
service to the Committee in the researches he has done, and by
receiving assurances from the Department for Culture, Media and Sport.
I hope that he will receive assurances from the Solicitor-General
now.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907017000567"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> Our intention is exactly as set out by
the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport. We have also
written to the director general of the BBC, but let me again make it
crystal clear that we have no intention of encroaching on the
independence of public service broadcasters. The duty will not apply to
the broadcasting and output functions of the public
sector&#151;public service broadcasters, whose editorial independence
we are committed to retaining.</div>
<a name="0907017000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">We will
therefore list the BBC, Channel 4 and S4C in schedule 19 when we amend
it to put the rest of the list in. When we do so, we will explicitly
exclude their broadcast and output functions, which will make the
situation clear beyond peradventure. As was said, they need to be in
schedule 19 because they have other functions that it is entirely
appropriate to cover by the equality duty.</div>
<a name="0907017000203"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907017000568"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> I am grateful to the Minister&#151;that is what
I was seeking. She rightly says that the broadcasters do not resile
from the fact that the duty should apply to other aspects of their
role, such as employment. That is why the amendment was focused
specifically on &#147;commissioning, content and broadcast&#148;.
Given her assurance about what the Government are going to do to make
it explicit that the duty applies to broadcasters in general but not to
those particular functions, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="0907017000204"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907017000569"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> I beg to move amendment 278, in
schedule 18, page 216, line 34, at
end insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">&#145;(aa) a function
in connection with membership of the House of
Commons;&#146;.</div><a name="0907017000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope to make some remarks that might have been included in a stand part
debate and to address the exclusion of the House of Commons from the
public sector equality duty. My probing amendment would provide a
safeguard. It allows me to raise the exclusion of a Member of
Parliament who has been sectioned from membership of the House of
Commons under section 141 of the Mental Health Act 1983. I tabled a new
clause on the matter, but I will not dwell on that because it was not
selected for
debate.</div><a name="0907017000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to consider what would happen if the public sector equality duty
was applied to membership of the House of Commons. It states that
bodies should eliminate discrimination and &#147;advance equality of
opportunity&#148; between persons who share a relevant protected
characteristic and persons who do not. In relation to membership of the
House of Commons, that would mean that Members of Parliament who had
mental health problems should be treated in the same way as those who
had a physical medical condition, but that simply is not the case at
the
moment.</div><a name="0907017000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
a Member of Parliament has a physical problem that prevents them from
carrying out their duties, such as suffering severely from cancer,
there is no legal way of excluding them from membership of this House.
By and large, satisfactory arrangements have been put in place when
Members have been physically unable to participate in their duties,
such as Members from neighbouring constituencies taking up
constituents&#146; cases and tabling questions, and their membership
of this 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column589" />Column number: 589</div>House has continued. However, the seat of a Member of Parliament who has
a mental health problem can be vacated under section 141 of the 1983
Act if they are sectioned for a six-month period and a report is laid
before the House. If the public sector equality duty applied to the
membership of the House, that would not be allowed to
stand.</div><a name="0907017000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
think that the Minister was in the Chamber when I raised this issue
during last week&#146;s Prime Minister&#146;s Question Time. I
mentioned that Alastair Campbell had talked about the specific issue
when giving evidence to the Speaker&#146;s Conference on
parliamentary representation, which is considering how to make
Parliament more representative and diverse. He has great experience of
dealing with this issue and he stated that this would be a clear way of
changing the law. What he said fits well with the public sector
equality
duty.</div><a name="0907017000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
I asked the Prime Minister whether he would change the provision in the
1983 Act, he
said:</div><a name="0907017000449"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Mental
health is a serious problem and we should look at it with great care
before we make any decisions, but of course I will look at what the
hon. Gentleman says. I think he will understand that it needs the
greatest of care.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report</i>, 24 June 2009;
Vol. 494, c.
793.]</div><a name="0907017000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
certainly does. Will the Minister commit to consider this issue with a
view to returning to it, preferably with amendments, on Report? It
would be better if we dealt with this matter in the House of Commons
because that is the body that is affected. However, it would be better
to do it in the House of Lords than not do it at
all.</div><a name="0907017000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
reasons behind the proposal are straightforward. I have never been one
for reading out great chunks of &#147;Erskine May&#148; and I will
not start now, but I will read a small
section:</div><a name="0907017000450"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Mental
illness is a disqualification at common law. There is also, under
section 141 of the Mental Health Act 1983...a statutory procedure
for vacating the seat of a sitting Member of unsound
mind.&#148;</div><a name="0907017000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
relates only to those of unsound mind. It does not mention those who
are physically ill, and that is the discriminatory nature of the
current law. Given the way in which the process works, there is not
even a requirement for somebody to assess whether the Member of
Parliament is capable of doing their job. If an MP has been authorised
to be detained, the Speaker would be notified. If, after six months,
the specialists report that the MP is suffering from mental illness,
and they are authorised to be detained again, their seat automatically
becomes vacant. That seems to be discriminatory, and a number of
organisations agree. The Royal College of Psychiatrists thinks that it
is a discriminatory provision that gives the false impression that an
MP cannot recover from a mental disorder. It also makes the point,
which was raised by Alastair Campbell, that the provision has never
been used. Nevertheless, it stated that it was</div>
<a name="0907017000451"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a totemic piece
of law, which ensures that discrimination exists at the heart of our
democracy&#148;</div>
<a name="0907017000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">and it would like it to
be removed.</div>
<a name="0907017000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">What would
happen if the public sector equality duty applied to the House of
Commons specifically with regard to membership? If we think back to one
of the previous clauses, we specifically tackled legislation that
applied to political candidates, and there are provisions 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column590" />Column number: 590</div>in the Bill for widening the diversity of candidates with regard to
gender. If the Bill as a whole were applied to disability, and mental
health specifically, that provision would have to
go.</div><a name="0907017000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Royal College of Psychiatrists welcomed the fact that I raised that
issue last week during Prime Minister&#146;s questions. It said that
my amendment to the Equality Bill presented
a</div><a name="0907017000452"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;significant
opportunity for MPs to demonstrate to the outside world that
discrimination against mental health has no place in
parliament.&#148;</div>
<a name="0907017000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I have said, this is
a probing amendment and I would like the Minister to take it away, look
at it and come back, perhaps with a more elegantly drafted solution.
Rethink, a mental health charity, pointed out that there is no such
provision for physical illnesses. It said that mental illnesses and
physical illnesses were both common and that people could recover from
them and lead a full and meaningful life, and so should be treated in
exactly the same way. Rethink supports a move to change the law and
RADAR, the disability organisation, has welcomed the raising of this
issue, as well as the change that would be implemented. There is a
clear support for the proposal.</div>
<a name="0907017000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">The final piece of
evidence that I wish to cite comes from a report on mental health in
Parliament carried out by the all-party parliamentary group on mental
health. It was based on responses to a questionnaire that was sent out
in February 2008 to all MPs in the Commons, all eligible Members of the
Lords, and staff members. There were responses from 94 Members of
Parliament, 100 Peers and 151 staff members&#151;a pretty good
response rate&#151;and there were very clear findings. Of those who
responded, 94 per cent. had friends or family who had experienced a
mental health problem. That number was significantly higher than that
found from a similar poll of the general public. One in five MPs who
responded&#151;they did not need to identify themselves&#151;had
some personal experience of a mental health problem, and two thirds
thought that the fact that an MP would automatically lose their seat if
sectioned under the Mental Health Act was
wrong.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907017000570"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. I remind the hon. Gentleman that he must
stick to the subject of his amendment and not go too wide. I have
allowed him some rein, but I must reign him in
now.</div>
<a name="0907017000220"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907017000571"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> I am grateful for your guidance, Lady Winterton. I
will finish off
narrowly.</div><a name="0907017000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those
statistics are clear, and I think that people have got the message.
This is an opportunity for the Minister to go away and look at this
issue&#151;as the Prime Minister promised that he would do last
week&#151;and come back to it on Report, if she thinks that there is
something worth moving on. That would get support from not only
Committee members, but from across the House and from the
public.</div>
<a name="0907017000222"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907017000572"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> I assure the Committee that I do not intend to
speak at length. I do not guarantee that I will always support my hon.
Friend, but I have great pleasure in doing so on this
occasion.</div>
<a name="0907017000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">My first
recollection of this place is being invited to have lunch here in 1959
by the then Clerk, because of school connections. For the record, he
had joined this 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column591" />Column number: 591</div>place in 1924, so the link is a fairly long one. I remember listening to
the debate on the Mental Health (Scotland) Bill. I will just make the
point to the Solicitor-General that we are not many years out of the
world of using &#147;lunatics&#148;, &#147;persons of unsound
mind&#148; and all the other deeply derogatory phrases that we were
prepared to entertain in legislation, as well as in substance, for our
treatment of persons with a mental health problem. As my hon. Friend
said under your tutelage, Lady Winterton, the matter has been one of
great concern to the all-party group on mental health. It is a matter
of record that the problem has been identified as substantial among our
numbers as well as in the population more
generally.</div><a name="0907017000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
basic support for this is on the stigma issue, but my secondary support
relates to the question of what will happen in public policy. One
danger is that if a Member has a sufficiently serious mental health
problem&#151;one that could result in a loss of livelihood, or the
threat of a loss of livelihood&#151;they might not seek or take help
as they should, thus aggravating their problems, meaning that they are
unable to resolve them, whereas they might have been able to do so if
they had been attended to in good time.</div>
<a name="0907017000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">My third
concern is the potential for discrimination, which is more than purely
formal. If we understand the importance of attending to physical
disabilities&#151;people with physical disabilities have, or should
have, opportunities here&#151;we should equally be prepared to deal
with mental health issues as
well.</div><a name="0907017000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
final concern&#151;I look at the Annunciator as I say this&#151;is
that the provisions interact with the legislation on parliamentary
standards and our conduct that is going through this place. Although I
know that the Government, on reflection, have made some concessions on
the matter, and I think that we should debate that Bill in its context
and this Bill in this context, the Minister might well want to reflect
on the fact that there is an interaction with whatever a standards
authority might want to say about the fitness of persons to serve in
this place and expectations.</div>
<a name="0907017000227"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907017000573"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> My hon. Friend makes a good point. The body that
will be set up by the Parliamentary Standards Bill does not yet exist,
so clearly it has not been put into this Bill, but it would be
interesting for the Minister, when she responds to this debate, to
touch on whether the Parliamentary Standards Authority would be
captured by the Bill, whether the public sector equality duty would
apply to it, and whether that would have any bearing on my hon.
Friend&#146;s
comments.</div><a name="0907017000228"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907017000574"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> I am grateful to my hon. Friend. My concern is
with the individual Member of Parliament and whether they would be
disciplinable under the Parliamentary Standards Bill or sanctionable
through the mental health provision. However equally, as my hon. Friend
said, the Parliamentary Standards Authority will clearly be a public
body discharging public functions and will, prima facie, be embraced by
this Bill&#146;s obligations, notwithstanding the fact that
Parliament is probably seeking to exempt itself. There is a lot to
think about. The amendment is looking not for trouble, but for a
sensitive and more enlightened approach to how those difficult issues
can be resolved.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column592" />Column number: 592</div><a name="0907017000229"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907017000575"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> We were trying to work out what
amendment 278 was for. Not unsurprisingly, we did not. Although the
hon. Member for Forest of Dean clearly pinpoints an issue that looks,
on the face of it, like discrimination between one kind of disability
and another, that is the law, because Parliament has decided that it is
so. The equality duty will operate only within the law, so even if it
were applied to Parliament, it would not trump the law and get around
section 141 of the 1983 Act. The way to deal with the problem is not to
apply the equality duty to something that it cannot reach, but to look
at repealing section 141, which others are reflecting on, partly in
response to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
question.</div><a name="0907017000483"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.15
pm</div><a name="0907017000230"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907017000576"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> To help the Minister, I am aware that that is how
to do it. I attempted to draft such a clause, but it was not selected.
The amendment was a convoluted way of getting the discussion to happen,
which we have managed. That was the objective. I am aware of the
appropriate solution, which is working out how to get that into
law&#151;changing the law so that that is the objective achieved. We
shall not be relying on the public sector equality
duty.</div><a name="0907017000231"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907017000577"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> As I say, other people are thinking
about a way forward, now that the issue has been drawn into public
focus. I invite the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment on the
basis that this is not the right
place.</div><a name="0907017000232"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907017000578"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> Your admonitions earlier in the debate and my new
clause not being selected, Lady Winterton, suggest that the Bill is not
the correct vehicle for bringing about that change, despite it
promoting equality of opportunity for those with mental health problems
and other disabilities. Given the Minister&#146;s assurances,
following the issue being raised by me at Prime Minister&#146;s
questions and by others a number of times, that other Ministers are
looking at it, I am happy for the time being and, therefore, I beg to
ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="0907017000233"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

insert&#151;</div><a name="0907017000453"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#145;The
relevant qualifications regulator (The Office of the Qualifications and
Examinations Regulator&#151;Ofqual).&#146;.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column593" />Column number: 593</div><a name="0907017000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">The reason for
the amendment was touched on when we debated clause 91 on
qualifications bodies. I went through a number of the arguments then,
so I shall not repeat them all here. I gave examples in which disabled
people, specifically deaf children, when seeking to take examinations
appear to have been discriminated against by examination bodies. I gave
some examples in which the examination bodies did not seem to have
thought creatively enough, while holding up the standards and rigours
of their exams, which is clearly important, about how disabled people
could be given the opportunity to demonstrate their talent and ability
and to show that they were at the appropriate level of skill. The
Solicitor-General rightly responded briefly and made the point that,
when we came to schedule 19, we could hit the nail more firmly on the
head when talking about the equality
duty.</div><a name="0907017000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment is about making sure that the qualifications regulator is
explicitly mentioned as one of the bodies. I wanted to make sure that
the issue was discussed, partly because of the specific cases, but I
also remember a discussion that we had much earlier in the Bill
concerning which bodies were included. We had a discussion at that
point in response to amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Hornsey
and Wood Green about regulators&#151;specifically energy regulators.
The Minister made the point then that it would not be appropriate to
extend that particular duty to the regulators because they did not have
the appropriate powers to take those steps.</div>
<a name="0907017000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the
amendment were accepted and the Office of the Qualifications and
Examinations Regulator were included, I should like to explore whether
it would have the appropriate powers. I think that it would because it
is specifically given the power to make decisions about which
adjustments should not be considered reasonable, and also about what
parts of the qualification of a qualification body are not subject to
adjustment.</div>
<a name="0907017000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have
specifically focused on Ofqual in England in the amendment, but there
are equivalents in Wales and Scotland that I have not specifically
mentioned Those regulators have powers over qualification bodies about
what adjustments are reasonable or are not reasonable and, by
implication, what is reasonable. They also have powers about what parts
of their qualifications are not subject to adjustments and, by
implication, which are.</div>
<a name="0907017000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">The measure
takes some decisions about competence standards and reasonable
adjustments away from courts and gives it to the regulator. In this
particular case, the regulator has some powers and abilities to take
steps to insist that qualification awarding bodies behave in a
particular way. The powers piece is made clear.</div>
<a name="0907017000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">I laid out
some specific examples when we debated clause 91. That can be found in
the report of our proceedings in <i class="I">Hansard</i>, so I shall not repeat
those and I think that the Minister can remember one or two of them. My
amendment seeks to find out whether she thinks that explicitly putting
the qualifications regulator in the schedule would be useful and help
to deal with some of the cases that I mentioned. If she does not want
to accept my amendment, what alternative solution does she propose in
order to deal with those examples of discrimination that I have
highlighted under clause 91?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column594" />Column number: 594</div><a name="0907017000246"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907017000580"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> I completely agree that Ofqual should
be subject to the equality duty&#151;it has all the roles that the
hon. Gentleman has outlined. The Qualification and Curriculum Authority
is subject to an existing equality duty. He has spoken about his
concerns that qualification bodies need to do more to meet the needs of
disabled people. We think that by showing that Ofqual is subject to
that duty it will need to think more creatively about how it works with
the disabled.</div>
<a name="0907017000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">The specific
duties consultation document proposes a duty to involve people from the
protected groups, including the disabled, when drawing up policies and
taking decisions. That duty will be highly relevant to engaging Ofqual
in using more imaginative ways to ensure that the disabled do not
suffer in their attempts to learn. There is a &#147;but&#148;,
which concerns the peculiar state of Ofqual.</div>
<a name="0907017000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would be
useful to mention the way that we have approached schedule 19. I have
already alluded to that, but I shall now do it at the right place.
Ofqual exists, but only on an interim basis. The Apprenticeships,
Skills, Children and Learning Bill, which is in the Lords, will put
Ofqual on a statutory basis and we will put Ofqual into schedule 19
when it has that
status.</div><a name="0907017000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I have already said, we have a core of about 90 per cent. of public
authorities already in schedule 19. However, we are talking to a number
of other bodies that we think should be included in the schedule. We
will update the schedule through secondary legislation before the new
duty comes in, in 2011, so that there is no gap in coverage.</div>
<a name="0907017000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is the
same process that was used to build up the list of bodies subject to
the race duty. I have already referred my hon. Friend the Member for
Stroud, who is not in his place, to that sizeable list and we are
following that precedent. It allows us to have informed discussions
with those we want to list. Public authorities need to let us know
their views on whether they should be subject to the duty, but they
need to know what the general duty is. Therefore, we have put it out
publicly and we will engage with them now that they know what being a
public authority will involve. We would like to deal with Ofqual at the

I recognised the point about the status of Ofqual, which is why I
tabled the amendment to test it, but she has confirmed that once it has

briefly to comment on clauses 145 to 149. The Government appear to be
aiming to create wide-ranging order-making powers for themselves to
fill in the gaps in the public sector duty. Clauses 145 and 146 create
powers to specify&#151;</div>

will apply more widely to the other clauses, but I shall not repeat it
each time. Creating the powers to specify which public authorities the
duty will apply to is too important to be left to secondary
legislation. I should be interested to hear the Minister say why, after
10 years or so of preparation, the Government have not been able to

the intention of extending the reach of schedule 19 to other bodies
that we think should be in it, but we did not feel that it was right to
do that until we had finalised the general duty. Now that duty is in

22 is rather similar to amendment 21 on clause 143, which we discussed
earlier, as Committee members can tell from the sequential numbering.
The amendment would ensure that the Government are producing plenty of
proof and evidence about the effectiveness of the public sector
equality duty, both for current consumption and to ensure that we have
an evidence base to see how well the duty is working and whether it can
be made to work more effectively and efficiently in
future.</div><a name="0907017000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
147 allows a Minister of the Crown to impose additional duties on a
public authority specified in part 1 of schedule 19 for the purposes of
enabling a better performance by the authority of that duty. The
amendment is duplicating the questions that we were asking with
amendment 21 to clause 143. Since the Minister has already given a
fairly full answer to that previous amendment I will not ask her to
repeat it, but I should like her to clarify what she believes is the
scope of the powers that could be required under the clause, where the
edges of those powers would be and what she feels would be the maximum
scope that could be applied and, therefore, the extent of the evidence
that might be required, which I hope that the Government will
produce  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column596" />Column number: 596</div>in any case, bearing in mind the response that the Minister has already
given to the Committee on amendment 21. I hope that she can
clarify the matter and help
us.</div><a name="0907017000265"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907017000587"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> The amendment would have an interesting
effect. Regulations can be made under the clause by the Welsh and
Scottish Ministers, too. I am sure that the hon. Member for
Weston-super-Mare did not mean it, but the amendment would require
Scottish Ministers as well as Welsh Ministers to lay before the
Westminster Parliament any regulations that they intend to make before
imposing specific duties on public bodies. My note drafter has
described that as not showing sufficient respect for the devolution
settlement.</div><a name="0907017000484"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.30
pm</div><a name="0907017000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
get to the point, the power under the clause to impose specific duties
is subject to affirmative procedure in Parliament under clause 195(4)
and (5). Draft regulations will have to be laid before the imposition
of specific duties, and they will be debated. The amendment would add
nothing to that. Evidence will be tested in debate and we are
consulting, as the hon. Gentleman knows, on our proposals for specific
duties, some of which I recited this morning. We have published the
independent research that we commissioned to inform those proposals
and, when we have finished consulting on the plans, backed up by that
research, we will consult again on the draft regulations and also
consult the EHRC since it will have to implement and police everything
that is introduced. The combination of all that consultation, which the
hon. Gentleman is welcome to join, with the affirmative procedure in
Parliament is probably sufficient, and I invite him to withdraw the
amendment, especially as it would have a funny effect on Wales and
Scotland.</div>

unintentionally have a funny effect on Wales and Scotland. I thank the

<a name="0907017000271"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907017000589"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> I have some brief questions, one of which caught
my eye mainly because the geographical location of my constituency, the
Forest of Dean, is on the border between England and Wales. I do not
know whether it is relevant, hence my wanting to test it, but I want to
know exactly what is meant by the provision. The clause refers to part
4 of schedule 19, so I looked at the schedule, but there is not yet a
part 4. I presume that it will contain reference to the cross-border
authorities. I was not entirely certain what sort of bodies they
will be.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column597" />Column number: 597</div><a name="0907017000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">My constituency
has many issues with public bodies and matters that have been devolved
to the Welsh Assembly Government, but are also exercised in England.
Such functions do not work well across borders: NHS functions, public
transport functions, and in particular concessionary fares.
Furthermore, clashes can occur with different rules in respect of
education, particularly on transport to education facilities, which is
important in a rural
area.</div><a name="0907017000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am not entirely certain whether current cross-border authorities would
be captured by the clause.</div>
<a name="0907017000274"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907017000590"></a>John
Penrose:</b> Like my hon. Friend, my constituency shares a
border with Wales, albeit through the middle of the Bristol channel.
Will the Solicitor-General explain, for example, whether an authority
in charge of both constructing and managing a future Severn barrage,
reaching from one side of the Severn to the other, would be included in
that classification of authorities and qualify under the
rules?</div><a name="0907017000275"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907017000591"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> My hon. Friend makes a good point. That would be a
classic case of an undertaking that could cost a significant amount of
money, and it would need statutory authority. One part would be in
England and one would be in Wales, so there would have to be a fair bit
of co-operation between the UK Government and the Welsh Assembly
Government. Any legal jurisdiction or body that was created to bring
that about would have a cross-border function. It might well be the
kind of thing envisaged under the
clause.</div><a name="0907017000276"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will
the Minister tell us whether we have any cross-border authorities
already? If we do, could we have some examples? If we do not, what
kinds of things are Ministers talking and thinking about?
Constituencies like mine on the English-Welsh border and those on the
English-Scottish border have specific concerns about any possible
impact. I am thinking particularly about how those authorities would
treat people who live on the other side of the border. I will give just
one example so as not to test the patience of the Committee. My example
relates to the national health
service.</div><a name="0907017000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have a number of constituents who live in England and whose GP is
physically based in Wales, although some are physically based in
England but registered in Wales, so they are regulated under the
jurisdiction of the Welsh Assembly Government. That has consequences
for their access to secondary health care and the screening regimes
undertaken by the health service. Constituents who live and vote in
England, and who ultimately decide on the policies of the UK Government
on the NHS in England, are treated differently from constituents who
live elsewhere in my constituency but whose GPs are not registered in
Wales. Clearly, that has an impact on the public sector equality duty
and the bodies making decisions about how they treat people and whether
decisions should be based on geography&#151;where they live or where
their GP is registered. There are clearly policy implications and that
is why I am trying to get a handle on which kinds of bodies are
affected. If we are talking about bodies that are not necessarily
called &#147;cross-border&#148; but that have some kind of
cross-border impact on the policy functions that they exercise, whether
in health, education or transport, that might bring them into part
4.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column598" />Column number: 598</div><a name="0907017000278"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, does
being in part 4 and being a cross-border authority make any difference
to how the duties are applied? Again, what I am driving at is: how will
people from different sides of the border be
treated?</div>
<a name="0907017000279"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907017000592"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> First, on the absence of part 4 of
schedule 19, it will be created under clause 145(6) the first time a
cross-border authority is added to schedule 19. Subordinate
legislation to the Scotland Act 1998 contains a list of Scottish
cross-border bodies, so that they are easily identifiable. They include
British Waterways, the British Wool Marketing Board, the Criminal
Injuries Compensation Authority and its appeals panel, and more.
However, there is not an equivalent list for Welsh cross-border bodies,
so we need to develop a different approach. Not only do we have no
schedule; we have nothing about Wales to put in it right now, but we
are working on
that.</div><a name="0907017000280"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
cross-border authorities are public bodies that have a mixture of
devolved and reserved functions, which operate in more than one nation.
They have to be treated as a separate category of public authority,
distinct from Scottish, Welsh or English bodies. Because they have
devolved as well as reserved functions, we need to say who has the
power to impose specific duties on them. It is intended that that will
be done case by
case.</div><a name="0907017000281"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907017000593"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> For the avoidance of doubt, is the
Solicitor-General saying that there are two tests, both with reserved
and devolved elements, operating in the two jurisdictions, and that my
example of an NHS body in Wales may affect constituents who live in
England and Wales, but because it is a wholly devolved power, it would
not be captured by the provision for cross-border authorities? I think
that that is what she
said.</div><a name="0907017000282"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907017000594"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> Inspiration tells me that we should
look at clause 151, which refers to a relevant Welsh authority, whose
functions</div>
<a name="0907017000454"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;are exercisable
only in or as regards Wales, and...wholly or mainly devolved Welsh
functions&#148;</div><a name="0907017000283"></a><div class="hs_Para">and
a cross-border Welsh authority, which is not one of the above and has
functions that are
exercisable</div><a name="0907017000455"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;in
or as regards Wales, and...is a devolved Welsh
function.&#148;</div><a name="0907017000284"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
seems to suggest that being a devolved Welsh function makes something
into a cross-border Welsh authority, if indeed it is cross-border,
because that is presumably a key
requirement.</div><a name="0907017000285"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907017000595"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> That is helpful, but not necessarily to the
Minister. Subsection (2)
says:</div><a name="0907017000456"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
relevant Welsh
authority&#148;&#151;</div><a name="0907017000286"></a><div class="hs_Para">so
that is not a cross-border
authority&#151;</div><a name="0907017000457"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;is
a person whose
functions&#151;</div><a name="0907017000458"></a><div class="hs_brev">(a)
are exercisable only in or as regards Wales,
and</div><a name="0907017000459"></a><div class="hs_brev">(b)
are wholly or mainly devolved Welsh
functions.&#148;</div><a name="0907017000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
sounds like the NHS bodies in Wales that deal with wholly or mainly
devolved Welsh functions, but it depends on the interpretation of
being</div><a name="0907017000460"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;exercisable
only in or as regards
Wales&#148;.</div><a name="0907017000288"></a><div class="hs_Para">Around
6,500 of my constituents are in England and registered with a GP who is
not necessarily in Wales, but may be in England, and if they are part
of a bigger practice they may be registered in Wales. It sounds as
though those functions and their impact are
exercisable  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column599" />Column number: 599</div>not only in Wales, but stretch across the border into England and affect
a significant number of people. Such a body would not then count as a
Welsh authority but would fall into the definition of a cross-border
Welsh authority because it had a function that was
exercisable</div><a name="0907017000461"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;in
or as regards
Wales&#148;</div><a name="0907017000289"></a><div class="hs_Para">and
was devolved. It would not fall into the definition of a Welsh
authority, which would put it in the cross-border category. If my
interpretation is correct, how does the duty apply to a cross-border
authority?</div><a name="0907017000290"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907017000596"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> There is a provision covering Scottish
cross-border authorities, but I shall concentrate on Wales. In
Scotland, the power to impose specific duties is split between the UK
and Scottish Ministers, but Wales, for the reasons that the hon.
Gentleman gave, requires a more nuanced approach to fit the different
devolution settlement. The provision is about who imposes specific
duties, and for some cross-border authorities we will split the power
between UK and Welsh Ministers. That is procedure A. For other bodies
that have only minimal devolved functions or whose administrative
set-up means that it is hard to distinguish between devolved and
reserved functions, UK Ministers will impose specific duties on all
their functions, but they will consult with the Welsh. It is a question
of
degree.</div><a name="0907017000291"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
definition of a &#147;relevant Welsh authority&#148; in clause 151
means that some bodies will have mostly devolved functions, but a few
reserved functions. In such cases, we contend that Welsh Ministers can
impose the specific duties. It is a question of balance and
nuance.</div><a name="0907017000292"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907017000597"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> Taking my specific example, if it were decided
that because the NHS body had a significant reach across the border,
and it was therefore a cross-border authority, both Welsh Assembly
Ministers and UK Health Ministers would have an impact. If that is the
interpretation, I am pleased, because I do not seek to undo the
devolution settlement and have UK Ministers telling the Welsh what to
do. But if the Welsh Assembly Government are responsible for a
significant amount of policy with regard to the NHS that affects my
constituents, there needs to be some democratic input into that
process. If UK Ministers have none at all, my constituents will be
being affected by policies of a Government over whom they have no
democratic control at all. What the Minister is saying is therefore
very
helpful.</div><a name="0907017000485"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.45

Featherstone:</b> I beg to move amendment 303, in clause 152,
page 112, line 19, after &#145;needs&#146;,

now move to the positive action provision. This is a probing amendment
on the general application of the provision. Clause 152(2)
states:</div><a name="0907017000463"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;This
Act does not prohibit P from taking any action which is a proportionate
means of achieving the
aim&#148;.</div><a name="0907017000306"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our
amendment relates to paragraph (b), which refers to &#147;meeting
those needs&#148;. As the clause does not refer to a
&#147;legitimate&#148; aim in relation to undertaking positive
action, the amendment would impose a reasonableness test when the needs
of a person with a protected characteristic were being considered. At
the moment, the need could be unreasonable, because there is no
legitimisation of the aim. I hesitate to tread on religious territory
when my hon. Friend the Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon is not
present, but it could be any of the protected characteristics. If a
religious view could be considered unreasonable&#151;for instance,
that all gay people have no place in society or that all women should
wear a burqa&#151;surely it would be unreasonable 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column601" />Column number: 601</div>to undertake positive discrimination to accommodate that view, to
accommodate the need of the person requiring
it.</div><a name="0907017000307"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
probing amendment is designed merely to test what traction, in legal
terms, need has on its own without there being a legitimate aim and
whether we need to include a reasonableness test to ensure that there
are no untoward or unintended consequences. I am interested in what the
Minister has to
say.</div><a name="0907017000308"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907017000603"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> I appreciate that we would not want the
provisions allowing positive action to be misused in any way that could
be considered unreasonable, but we think that there are sufficient
protections within the four corners of the clause
itself.</div><a name="0907017000309"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
152(1) requires that a person who intends to take positive action
reasonably thinks that people within his
remit</div><a name="0907017000464"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;who
share a protected characteristic suffer a
disadvantage&#148;</div><a name="0907017000310"></a><div class="hs_Para">or</div>
<a name="0907017000465"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;who share a
protected characteristic have needs that are
different&#148;</div><a name="0907017000311"></a><div class="hs_Para">or
that participation is disproportionately low because of a protected
characteristic. There has to be a reasonable point of view in the first
place, before any positive action even comes on to the scene. That is
an important
protection.</div><a name="0907017000312"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is also clause 152(2), to which the hon. Lady referred, which requires
the action to be taken to be a proportionate means of achieving the
aims set out in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c). She is mostly concerned
with &#147;meeting those needs&#148;. Again, this is about balance
and appropriateness. Even if it were possible for a person to use the
provision to meet unreasonable needs, the steps to meet their demands
would have to be proportionate, so it is difficult to see what good the
provision would be to
them.</div><a name="0907017000313"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause includes a power to make regulations to set out action that
would not be permitted, so there is a power if there were ever
something capable of being envisaged in advance that we would want to
exclude on an unreasonableness basis. Always, when looking at positive
action, the EHCR is committed to issuing clear guidance. In this case,
since this is a new power, guidance probably ought to include examples
of the kind of needs for which protection is
intended.</div><a name="0907017000314"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that the hon. Lady is satisfied that those two distinct sets of
phraseology within the four corners of the clause will fit the need to
ensure that the protection is not abused, and we expect good guidance
from the
commission.</div><a name="0907017000315"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907017000604"></a>Lynne
Featherstone:</b> I thank the Minister for that helpful
explanation. There are indeed enough safeguards in place. With those
words on the record, it is clear that unreasonable needs would not be
permitted. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="0907017000316"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

Bill.</i></div>
<a name="0907017000318"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907017000605"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> I do not want to speak terribly long on clause
stand part, but, before we move on to clause 153,
I would like to draw some distinctions, and invite the Minister to do
so as well, and set out just what is and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column602" />Column number: 602</div>what is not included in positive action. Having read the clause, I am
happy to support it, because positive action is distinct from positive
discrimination&#151;I think Members have said that&#151;which I
would not be in favour
of.</div><a name="0907017000319"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Committee must be careful to be clear about what we mean. On one or two
previous clauses, there has been some confusion in language when people
have said &#147;positive discrimination&#148; when what they meant
was positive action. The two are
distinct.</div><a name="0907017000320"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
can give an example of positive action. Perhaps a particular group is
under-represented in someone&#146;s work force. The employer might
decide to advertise in a particular publication that was read by many
in that group, or, if they were going out and physically
recruiting, they might decide to target particular
geographic areas to try to increase the number of people who apply for
a job in their organisation. That is a positive step to try to widen
diversity, but, crucially, it is not discriminating against anybody
else. It is not stopping anybody else from applying for a role and,
assuming that the organisation is advertising in other publications as
well, it is not prohibiting or disadvantaging anybody. It is simply
trying to widen the pool. Positive discrimination would be where an
organisation was trying to widen its diversity, but it was doing so by
specifically discriminating. I will cite a specific example from my own
constituency when we come to clause 153. It is worth clarifying this
matter so that people outside are clear what this provision permits
them to do and what it does not.</div>
<a name="0907017000321"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Law
Society, which provided us with a brief on clause 152, specifically
says that</div>
<a name="0907017000466"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the current
positive action provisions in current legislation can be confusing for
employers.&#148;</div>
<a name="0907017000322"></a><div class="hs_Para">Presumably, if they are
confusing for the Law Society, which should understand this stuff very
well, they will be confusing for pretty much everybody else. It makes
the point that it uses existing usual targeting measures. It
says:</div><a name="0907017000467"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Broadening
the circumstances in which an employer can draw attention to an
imbalance in an advertisement might be helpful.&#148;</div>
<a name="0907017000323"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again, an organisation
will not say that people from another group should not apply or that it
is biased in favour of a particular group. It will simply be saying
that in its work force, there are groups that are under-represented and
it may encourage people who share that protected characteristic to
apply. As long as it does not discriminate against people who do not
have that protected characteristic, I see nothing harmful in doing that
at all, and this particular clause is welcomed by the Law
Society.</div>
<a name="0907017000324"></a><div class="hs_Para">For the
avoidance of doubt and to stop those who like to misuse and
misrepresent such provisions, it would be helpful if the Minister could
outline what the Government mean by the clause and what they do not
mean. That would benefit both the Committee and those outside who are
listening to our
proceedings.</div><a name="0907017000325"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907017000606"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> I am glad to have a welcome from the
hon. Gentleman. The measure is not a wholly new concept. Provisions on
positive action already exist within the Sex Discrimination Act 1975
and the Race Relations Act 1976, and the clause is an extension of
that. Positive action provisions can apply in different ways to
different characteristics. They can even apply to some and not to
others. We now intend to regularise them and to make a platform for all
of the strands. The 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column603" />Column number: 603</div>first thing that the clause does is establish a permissive framework
under which forms of positive action can be taken. Any use of such
provisions will be entirely voluntary. There is no requirement for them
to be used by specific individuals or organisations. Although they are
voluntary, lots of UK businesses have recognised the benefits of using
positive action to create a more diverse work force, to better
understand customers&#146; needs and to attract new business.
Therefore, the provisions will be used, but it is important to
emphasise that they are totally voluntary.</div>
<a name="0907017000326"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second
characteristic is that it is not, as the hon. Gentleman has said,
positive discrimination. Positive discrimination would favour a person
from a particular under-represented or disadvantaged group solely
because they come from that particular group irrespective of merit. In
the main, positive discrimination is unlawful in the UK. Therefore this
is not positive discrimination. We are not talking about favouring
somebody just because they come from a particular group. The provisions
are about ensuring that people&#146;s needs are met, that they have
equal opportunities and that they are not held back because of a
particular
characteristic.</div><a name="0907017000327"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause will have effect in cases in which it is reasonable to consider
that those with a protected characteristic suffer a disadvantage that
is linked to that characteristic, that those who share the
characteristic are under-represented in some way, or that those
who share the characteristic have particular
needs not shared by those without the characteristic in question. In
any such situation, the clause will enable organisations, public
authorities, employers and service providers to take a wide range of
positive action measures to address the
disadvantage, and to increase the participation of people with that
characteristic. Moreover, any action must be a proportionate
way of accomplishing the intended outcome. I am referring to specific
training opportunities, targeted health services to address
particular needs and providing lessons exclusively for disadvantaged
pupils. We want to ensure the appropriate use&#151;we have just
canvassed this&#151;of the positive action
measures.</div><a name="0907017000486"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">7
pm</div><a name="0907017000328"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause contains a power to make regulations to set out what would not
be permitted under it. It ensures that any act that would be unlawful
under any other legislation will not be permitted by it. It also
provides that if positive action measures are taken under
clause 99, which is about the selection of candidates and
clause 153(3) regarding recruitment or promotion, which we
will come on to in a minute, those provisions will apply, rather than
clause
152.</div><a name="0907017000329"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
addition, should the provision allowing registered political parties
the use of single sex shortlists in selecting election candidates,
which clause 99(7) deals with, be repealed, the clause will not allow
the use of similar measures to be taken&#151;I emphasise that point,
and it is only what is permitted within the law. Where there
is a specific provision to cover a specific kind
of positive action, that is the provision that will prevail,
not clause 152.</div>

to&#146;.</div><a name="0907017000334"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907017000609"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> The clause specifically looks at recruitment and
promotion regarding positive action. My amendments may be broken down
into three groups. The first consists of amendment 29. Currently,
subsection (1) refers to the way that a person can use the clause. I
object to the words &#147;reasonably thinks&#148;, preferring
&#147;can demonstrate&#148;, just to get rid of the
&#147;thinks&#148; part, and make the definition slightly less
subjective. That is the first amendment, which is a relatively small
one, and I do not want to make a huge deal about it.</div>
<a name="0907017000339"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendments
in the next group are similar, as they have the &#147;thinks&#148;
word in them, which is why they have been grouped together. They would
amend clause 191, which refers to &#147;the
Minister&#148; rather than &#147;Person (P)&#148;. I will deal
with those at the end of my remarks, because they are not talking about
positive action&#151;they have been grouped with it because they use
the same
concept.</div><a name="0907017000340"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
crux of my argument on the clause is on amendment 23. It
would amend the clause by replacing the words &#147;as qualified
as&#148; with &#147;equally qualified to&#148;. It may sound a
small change, but it is significant in respect of how the clause would
operate. The amendment would change it from a way that my party and I
do not find acceptable to a way that we
would.</div><a name="0907017000341"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
would also mean that the Bill will be in line with the explanatory
notes, which talk about candidates being &#147;equally
qualified&#148;. It is my contention that that does not mean the same
as &#147;as qualified as&#148;. &#147;Equally qualified&#148;
implies that the candidates are equal in every material way pertaining
to that particular job, either as a new recruit or as a promotion. This
is the argument that has been used by both Ministers and the EHRC:
where we would usually have two equally qualified candidates&#151;the
larger the number of candidates, the less likely, I suspect, that they
would be equally qualified&#151;the clause would be used as a
tie-breaker.</div>
<a name="0907017000342"></a><div class="hs_Para">An example
commonly used by the EHRC, us and Ministers is that of a primary school
in which all the staff are female and there are no male role models for
the pupils. Let us say that the head teacher has a vacancy for a new
teacher and there are two candidates equally qualified in terms of
teaching ability and how they would fit into the school; in all ways
they are the same, but one is a man and one is a woman. The contention
is that the clause would enable the head 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column605" />Column number: 605</div>teacher to say that there are some good reasons why it would be good to
have a more diverse work force and to have a male role model in the
school. Therefore, because the two candidates are equally qualified and
capable of doing the job, the head teacher would prefer the male
candidate in order to have a more diverse work force. In those limited
circumstances, in which there are two equally qualified candidates, we
would be content with that.</div>
<a name="0907017000343"></a><div class="hs_Para">If two equally
qualified candidates are genuinely equal&#151;and there is only one
job&#151;there has to be some way of making a hiring decision.
Widening the diversity of the work force seems to be as good a reason
as any. Alternative ways of making the decision would be completely
subjective, for example by asking, &#147;Do I like them?&#148;,
&#147;Who do I like best?&#148;, &#147;Who would I get on with
best?&#148;. I suspect that that is how a lot of hiring decisions are
made. In the limited circumstances I have mentioned, widening the
diversity of the work force seems as good a way to make the decision as
any.</div><a name="0907017000344"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
problem with how the clause is currently drafted is that the use of the
words &#147;as qualified as&#148; does not have the same meaning at
all for me. Those words seems to set a bar or hurdle and indicate that
there are a certain set of qualifications or characteristics that are
needed for the job and that, as long as someone gets over that bar or
requirement, they are equally qualified to do the job and to be
recruited or promoted as any other candidate. That leads to a problem,
because if someone is in that situation and they have a significant
number of candidates, we will start to get what is effectively positive
discrimination, which I do not think we
want.</div><a name="0907017000345"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that I am not talking out of turn here, but I have discussed the
matter with the chairman of the EHRC, who conceded that it was unlikely
there would be equally qualified candidates applying for a role. He
agreed with my characterisation that &#147;as qualified as&#148;
would put candidates within a band of capability. He suggested that as
long as the difference between the candidates was fairly narrow, the
diversity measure could be allowed to kick in. The danger in relation
to that is where to stop.</div>
<a name="0907017000346"></a><div class="hs_Para">The heart of
the matter is if there are two equally qualified candidates and one or
the other gets the job, it does not cause too many problems. However, a
situation might arise in which candidates are qualified for the job and
able to meet the criteria, but there is a big difference between some
of them and a number of the candidates are much better. Let us say that
those who are better happen to be men and that although there are
female candidates who are qualified to do the job, they are not as
qualified as the male candidates. If the work force is largely male,
the employer might decide to hire or promote the female candidate. It
seems likely that that would stir resentment because weaker candidates
are being preferred purely because of their gender. That is certainly
not helpful to the cause of equality. That would give equality a bad
name and damage the idea of fairness. It could lead to what the hon.
Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon suggested in relation to a
different matter, with people not thinking that this sort of thing
applies to them.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column606" />Column number: 606</div><a name="0907017000347"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have a
specific example for the Minister of such a situation being damaging.
In my county, back in 2006, the Gloucestershire constabulary admitted
breaking the law because it had a policy of deselecting potential
recruits because of their colour. It was trying to advance the
diversity of its work force, mainly to meet a Government target for
ethnic minority recruits, so that the percentage in the force matched
exactly the percentage in the county. The reason why I am aware of it
is that it affected one of my constituents, who was certainly qualified
to do the job. He and a number of others were disregarded in the
selection process purely because they did not meet the criteria for
advancing the diversity of the work force as far as race and colour
were
concerned.</div><a name="0907017000348"></a><div class="hs_Para">Apart
from being illegal&#151;I am not sure that it would be if we allowed
the wording &#147;as qualified as&#148;, because that implies that
one could have a large pool of candidates and then start making
decisions about the diversity of one&#146;s work force&#151;I do
not think that the measure sits well with subsection (4)(b), which
prohibits a policy, because as soon as one starts talking about lots of
people, one is effectively talking about a policy.</div>
<a name="0907017000349"></a><div class="hs_Para">Such measures
lead to damaging headlines and damage the cause of equality, as well as
creating the slightly bizarre situation of a police force going around
breaking the law. I do not think that it is particularly effective. We
do not want a situation where candidates applying to join an
organisation are discriminated against because of their colour. I want
to ensure that the clause will not allow that sort of behaviour to
become lawful, as it is damaging, and it is difficult to explain to
constituents why they should be treated in that
way.</div><a name="0907017000350"></a><div class="hs_Para">Just
so that the Minister is aware, a number of organisations concerned
about such matters have reached the same conclusion in their briefs for
members of this Committee; I presume that other hon. Members have them.
The British Retail Consortium agreed absolutely that companies should
address under-representation in their work force, but notes the
difference between the explanatory note, which discusses candidates who
are &#147;equally qualified&#148;, and the term &#147;as
qualified as&#148; in the Bill. The BRC agrees that the two are
distinct and likely to confuse and believes, as I do, that the wording
of the Bill suggests a principle of minimum merit or a bar that must be
got over, whereas &#147;equally qualifies&#148; indicates that
candidates have got to the same level. The BRC wants clear guidance for
employers so that they do not fall foul of the law. It says explicitly
that it supports amendment 23 because it believes that the wording is
much clearer than the
Bill&#146;s.</div><a name="0907017000351"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
CBI, in its briefing for the Committee, is happy with the tie-break
concept but not with how it is currently drafted. It does not think
that the Bill is clear enough about how the tie-break would work in
practice, or that the word &#147;qualified&#148; is defined in any
way. The CBI is unclear whether the use of the word
&#147;qualification&#148; is purely academic or whether it will
apply more widely to consideration of the candidate&#146;s qualities
and ability to do the job. Those things are clearly important,
particularly when it comes to promotion, which is likely to be based
not on paper qualifications but on ability to do the
job.</div><a name="0907017000352"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
British Chambers of Commerce suggests in its memorandum to the
Committee that the majority of businesses will use the provision, but
that those that do will want certainty. The BCC also notes the
difference of language between the Bill and the explanatory notes 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column607" />Column number: 607</div>and does not think that the two are the same. The BCC explicitly
supports our amendment, as do a number of organisations. When the
Minister responds, she needs to explain why the Bill uses the language
that it does and whether it means the same
thing.</div><a name="0907017000353"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
final point pertaining to amendment 23 concerns subsection (4)(b),
which says that the person concerned&#151;the company, the business
or whatever&#151;cannot have a policy of treating people who share a
protected characteristic more favourably but must take decisions on a
case-by-case basis. I think that that works and I know that it is there
because that is what the European directive requires. I cannot remember
whether we discussed that in Committee or whether it was in a
discussion I had with the EHRC. I can see that that holds up for two
equally qualified candidates, where it is not about policy but a
decision between two
individuals.</div><a name="0907017000487"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">7.15
pm</div><a name="0907017000354"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
the language &#147;as qualified as&#148; is used for a pool of
candidates, any organisation bigger than an individual employer who
makes the decision himself will have to have a policy. That means that
we will be encouraging people to take positive actions when they have a
pool of candidates and giving them the power to do it, but saying that
they cannot have a policy. Recruitment and promotion decisions will
then be taken under the table, out of sight and not in accordance with
a policy. We should not encourage businesses to go down that
route.</div><a name="0907017000355"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
31 to 34 apply to clause 191. They have nothing to do with positive
action but have been put in this group wisely because of the similarity
in the words &#147;thinks&#148; and &#147;demonstrate&#148;.
Clause 191 is about harmonisation and will enable Ministers to amend
the Bill through order-making powers. I will not go into whether
order-making powers are right or wrong because we will discuss that
under clause
191.</div><a name="0907017000356"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
objection is that clause 191 contains four references to Ministers
being able to use order-making powers because they
&#147;think&#148; something. I am not happy that we are giving
Ministers powers to amend primary legislation by order, but if are, we
should jolly well have objective tests that can be reviewed properly
through judicial review and that can constrain Ministers&#146;
actions.</div><a name="0907017000357"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will go through the provisions of the clause briefly one by one. Line 4
states that clause 191 applies
if</div><a name="0907017000468"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;there
is a Community obligation of the United Kingdom which a Minister of the
Crown thinks relates to the subject matter of the Equality
Acts&#148;.</div><a name="0907017000358"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
would be better to say that the Minister must
&#147;demonstrate&#148; that it does. Ministers should not be able
to use this clause simply because they &#147;think&#148; something.
That does not give a judge much to go
on.</div><a name="0907017000359"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
the Minister thinks that the community obligation relates to the
subject matter of the Bill, clause 191 applies only
if</div><a name="0907017000469"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
Minister thinks that it is appropriate to make harmonising
provision&#148;.</div><a name="0907017000360"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again,
that relies just on the Minister&#146;s opinion. There is nothing for
a judge to test it against. There is no guidance for Ministers on how
they should make such decisions. It is just down to whatever they
think. The clause gives the Minister the power to make the harmonising
provision by order to change primary legislation. I do not think that
that is sound.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column608" />Column number: 608</div><a name="0907017000361"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are some
rules about the timing of making the order. Clause 191 says
specifically that there must be consultation and prohibits the Minister
from making the order before the end of the period of 12 weeks after
the consultation starts. As we are talking about changing primary
legislation, the Minister is not allowed to make the order before the
end of that period unless he thinks that
the</div><a name="0907017000470"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;making
of the order is a matter of

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907017000610"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> I was running through amendments 32 to 34. I had
just finished with the fact that there is a provision under clause
191(5) that says that the Minister cannot make an order until there has
been a 12-week consultation period, unless the Minister thinks that
making the order is &#147;a matter of urgency&#148;. There is no
test, there are no criteria, on which the Minister has to base that
decision. Potentially, the Minister, having thought that changing the
law was necessary, could start a consultation process, which is
mandatory, and pretty much as soon as that process was started could
think that the order was a matter of urgency and change primary
legislation by order. That is simply not appropriate. The Minister
ought to have a test at least of demonstrating that it is necessary,
rather than just thinking
it.</div><a name="0907017000365"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
final example of what I want to change is on line 23 of page
136, which explains what a &#147;harmonising provision&#148; is.
Again, it is
what</div><a name="0907017000471"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
Minister thinks is necessary or
expedient&#148;.</div>
<a name="0907017000366"></a><div class="hs_Para">I always get nervous
about the word &#147;expedient&#148;, particularly when it is
allied to a Minister thinking
something.</div><a name="0907017000367"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments in the group would take out the word &#147;thinks&#148;
and put in the more objective test of &#147;can demonstrate&#148;.
Such a wording would imply that a Minister would have to produce some
evidence and tests to be met. The amendments are wide-ranging and I
look forward to the Minister&#146;s
response.</div><a name="0907017000368"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907017000611"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> Amendment 29 would make statistical
evidence a prerequisite for employers to justify the use of positive
action measures. The formulation of wording used in the Bill is
&#147;reasonably thinks&#148;, which we stick to. That wording
requires a decision maker to act reasonably when deciding whether to
use the measure. If a decision is taken to use the measure and there is
no evidence to suggest that people having the protected characteristic
have ever been disadvantaged or under-represented, it would be open to
challenge. The provisions take into consideration the voluntary nature
of the use of positive action measures and the fact that any use of the
measures would need to be plausible, otherwise it would be open to
challenge.</div><a name="0907017000369"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
wording &#147;can demonstrate&#148; would obviously provide a
higher threshold based on statistical evidence, but we think that that
would have a chilling effect on the willingness of employers to use
such measures, even when they can make clear identifications from their
day-to-day business, from the evidence surrounding 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column609" />Column number: 609</div>them, from their own understanding of the market and from the need to
redress any imbalance in their work force. In the face of something
that they might regard as completely clear evidence that they ought to
use the power, and that convinces them that they wish to use the power,
they would be unable to do so, unless they could get some presumably
rather expensive consultant to obtain statistical evidence to ascertain
that what they could see before their very eyes was in fact
statistically justifiable. We do not think that that is a good thing to
impose on businesses, and it would undermine the impact of the
provisions. Clause 153 sets out the criteria by which the provisions
may be applied, while subsection (4) specifically ensures that
employers cannot abuse the positive action measures. We would resist
the amendment and, in the light of our argument, we ask the hon.
Gentleman to withdraw
it.</div><a name="0907017000370"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
also resist amendment 23, which would change the present wording of
subsection (4)(a) from &#147;as qualified as&#148; to
&#147;equally qualified to&#148;. Although that does not sound like
much of a change, it probably is in the way that the hon. Gentleman
suggested, and it is something that we ought to give at least a full
airing. The point of the provisions is to allow employers to take
targeted action. We think that business welcomes the proposals as
beneficial to the success of organisations, to filling skills gaps, to
understanding customers&#146; needs and to creating a more diverse
work force. However, to ensure that the provisions are not abused, we
need to spell out the extent to which they
apply.</div><a name="0907017000371"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
153(4), which is the policy provision to which the hon. Gentleman
referred, is there to ensure that there is not a blanket policy of
favouring candidates because they have a protected characteristic, even
if they are disadvantaged and under-represented as a consequence. An
employer has to ensure that the candidate that she wishes to prefer is
as qualified for the job or promotion as another person. For example,
what if an employer has specified the requirements necessary for a job
and two candidates meet her? Let us suppose that one has a protected
characteristic connected to disadvantage or under-representation and
the other does not. If the candidate with the protected characteristic
is as qualified as the one without a protected characteristic, the
permission to treat the candidate with the protected characteristic
more favourably will step
in.</div><a name="0907017000372"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907017000612"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> I want to ask about two things. The
Solicitor-General said that business welcomed the provision. Both the
BRC and the BCC support amendment 23 explicitly because it would make
the situation clearer for business and they believe that that is
important. The CBI, while not commenting specifically on the amendment,
thinks that the Government should re-examine the clause to make sure
that it is clear and that its members will not get in trouble when
using it, for the reasons that I have
outlined.</div><a name="0907017000373"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. and learned Lady will correct me if I am wrong, but she has agreed
that &#147;as qualified as&#148; means that a person has reached a
point just above a hurdle. It does not mean that the candidates are
equally qualified, but that criteria have been set for the
job&#151;whether educational qualifications, skills or particular
talents&#151;and as long as the person is over the minimum hurdle, he
will be able, if he has a protected characteristic, to be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column610" />Column number: 610</div>given an advantage. That system has lots of disadvantages. It is not the
tie-break scenario that the Minister for Woman and Equality cited on
Second Reading. It is quite different&#151;it is the type of thing
that gives equality a bad name&#151;and easily turns the situation
into one involving a pool of candidates with discrimination taking
place in favour of one group and against another, which is
dangerous.</div>
<a name="0907017000374"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907017000613"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> That is exactly what cannot be done
because subsection (4)(b) prohibits such action. There is no danger of
such a thing taking place lawfully under the Bill. Let me be as clear
as possible. The hon. Gentleman says that businesses have requested
clarity. Businesses tell me that they are already undertaking such a
process. We must bear in mind that, when launching an assault on the
provision, they are probably doing it unlawfully at the moment because
no power is available for someone to be preferred because they have a
protected characteristic, even granted the equality of merit. We need
to be a little cautious about claiming where business overwhelmingly
lies on the
matter.</div><a name="0907017000375"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
a business is trying to target a particular community with its product,
it is commonplace to identify a sales person from that community. It is
a good thing for the business to appoint them to the job if they are as
good as someone who is not from that community. By changing the wording
from &#147;as qualified as&#148; to &#147;equally qualified
to&#148;, the hon. Gentleman would reduce the provision to something
that would really never work, nor have any application of great import,
because it would be relatively rare that exactly identical
qualifications occur.</div>
<a name="0907017000376"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman makes a point about a pool of candidates, but let us say that
the test ought to be that both candidates have demonstrated that they
have met the employer&#146;s particular requirements for the post.
That seems to be entirely the right approach. In that sense, both
candidates who fulfil the employer&#146;s particular requirements for
the post will be as qualified as each other to fill the
vacancy.</div><a name="0907017000377"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907017000614"></a>Lynne
Featherstone:</b> I want to clarify one thing. I tend to agree
with the Solicitor-General, but if specifications and criteria were set
out for the job, is she saying that as long as that criteria and
specific requirements of the job specification were met, the employer
would then be able to choose? That seems very broad compared with what
I thought that the provision was
about.</div><a name="0907017000378"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907017000615"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> But that is the hon. Lady&#146;s
device, not mine. I have set out pretty plainly what the position would
have to be. The employer would have ways of attracting people from the
right pool and they would be as broad as he wished. He would have ways
of short-listing people and getting them in for interview. There would
be criteria all the way along, such as person specifications and job
descriptions, all of which people would have to fulfil to reach the
stage that I have described. That would be appropriate. Nothing much
more could help further than the fact that both candidates demonstrated
to the employer that they had met his particular requirements for the
post.</div><a name="0907017000490"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">7.45
pm</div><a name="0907017000379"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is a sort of false aura&#151;I am not saying that it is
deliberate&#151;around the whole notion of, &#147;Oh, does
&#145;qualified&#146; mean academic qualifications? Oh, do they 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column611" />Column number: 611</div>have to be absolutely the same, and how wide can the band be?&#148; We
are talking about business, which is used to appointing people to jobs
and evaluating one against another to see who crosses the line, who is
absolutely right for the job and how many applicants reach that
standard. We are not bringing the provision to a bunch of neophytes,
and the people who will use it will know what they want from
applicants. If they are satisfied that they have two or more candidates
before them, they may, if they choose, use the voluntary process. It is
not about having a blanket policy and it is not positive
discrimination. What the clause provides for is not in the slightest
bit dangerous. I hope that my explanation has removed any lack of
clarity there might have
been.</div><a name="0907017000380"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907017000616"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> The Minister has made things clearer, but not
necessarily more helpful, and I will tell her why. I think that there
is a qualitative difference. If there are two candidates who are
equally qualified, or within a very narrow band, and one of the
protected characteristics is used as the decider or tie-breaker, that
will not lead to a situation in which it is felt that the better
candidate did not get the job because of the protected characteristic.
However, that changes as soon as the hurdle of a minimum requirement is
introduced. If there is a wide spread of candidates, but they are all
capable of doing the job, one who was much better than the others might
not get it because a less good candidate who was still over the minimum
requirement had a protected characteristic. We are talking about this
being done by not only business, but any organisation. I am thinking
about pubic sector bodies that might have a pubic sector duty on
promoting people with particular protected characteristics.</div>
<a name="0907017000381"></a><div class="hs_Para">That worry is
flagged up in the specific example set out in explanatory note 508. The
example is of a police service that employs disproportionately low
numbers of people from an ethnic minority background giving
preferential selection to a candidate from such a background after
identifying several equally qualified candidates for recruitment. That
preferential selection would not be unlawful, provided that the
comparative merits of the other candidates were taken into
consideration. The note states that the candidates were &#147;equally
qualified&#148;. As soon as we use the term &#147;as qualified
as&#148;, we are faced with a situation in which a less good ethnic
minority candidate, albeit one who is still qualified for the job,
could be given
it.</div><a name="0907017000382"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
use that example because, as the Minister will know, it is a real
example of what has happened to some of my constituents. Candidates
might not be given a job or promoted in favour of a less good candidate
from an ethnic minority background. Apart from being wrong in
principle&#151;in my view&#151;nothing is more guaranteed to give
the provisions of the Bill a bad name than that sort of behaviour. The
way in which she has explained the clause shows that that sort of
behaviour would be
lawful.</div><a name="0907017000383"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907017000617"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> To refer to that as &#147;that sort
of behaviour&#148; does not give due credit to the fact that it is a
positive step forward. To suggest, as the hon. Gentleman has done, that
there will never be resentment if it is only used as a tie-breaker is
wholly unrealistic. Often, people think that they did not get a job
because the successful candidate is younger, prettier, taller, blacker
or gayer 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column612" />Column number: 612</div>than they are, so there is really no guarantee that changing the wording
to &#147;equally qualified&#148; will remove such
resentment.</div>
<a name="0907017000384"></a><div class="hs_Para">If a candidate
is, as the hon. Gentleman suggested, clearly superior or better
qualified, and if the employer does not consider that person
over-qualified for a job, in which case they are entitled to choose at
the right level, common sense suggests that they will not be as
qualified as the other person, because they are clearly superior. It is
not difficult to separate people who are as qualified as each other
from those who are not. We are not talking about simply crossing some
sort of low threshold that will let hordes of people in, and making it
a clear blanket policy involving hordes of people within a massive band
of ability being preferred over hordes of people from another group who
are in the same massive band of ability. We are talking, very sensibly,
about somebody who meets the employer&#146;s particular requirements
for the post, and somebody else who meets those requirements; it could
be one on one, two on two&#151;it makes no difference.</div>
<a name="0907017000385"></a><div class="hs_Para">If an employer
wishes to choose between people who, in his view, are as qualified as
each other, he can choose somebody from an under-represented group.
This is an excellent provision that will protect a lot of businesses
that do this now out of common sense, and I hope it will encourage not
only other businesses but people from the public sector to do it, as
well.</div>
<a name="0907017000386"></a><div class="hs_Para">Suppose there
were a practice of looking at groups of people and deciding that they
were all within a range of ability, and that it would be just as easy
to pick somebody from the bottom as from the top of that range. Someone
could help themselves to a white person over a black person, a man over
a woman, or a gay person over a straight person, but they would be
implementing a policy that is not allowed under clause 153(4)(b). There
is a distinction between two equally qualified people, and operating a
policy that has &#147;as qualified as&#148; in the middle of it. In
my view, it is quite clear what is available and what is not, and I
hope that there can be no serious doubt about that.</div>
<a name="0907017000387"></a><div class="hs_Para">I suggest that
this is the right phraseology to use. It allows the appropriate
flexibility and will make the provision useful. To narrow it down in
some way to require identical qualifications&#151;we need only to say
the word to be clear that one would rarely get people who are
absolutely identically qualified. On the question of whether that means
academic qualifications, of course it does not. It means identically
qualified for a particular job, and that just will not happen often.
The impact of the clause must be far broader than that. I invite the
hon. Gentleman to see that this is a useful and good measure.</div>
<a name="0907017000388"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments 31
to 34 are about limiting ministerial flexibility in deciding where the
use of the harmonisation power is appropriate, and its timing and
extent. They would require the Minister to demonstrate at each stage
how the requirements of the clause are being met in each case. The
Minister&#146;s reasons would therefore be subject to challenge in
the courts on an objective basis.</div>
<a name="0907017000389"></a><div class="hs_Para">The point of
the provisions is to give future Equality Ministers the flexibility
they need to ensure that the Bill remains coherent and harmonised
legislation in the years ahead. I know that the hon. Gentleman does not
like the turn of phrase, &#147;The Minister is required to
think&#148;&#151;I tell the Committee that it is not easy at this 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column613" />Column number: 613</div>time of night&#151;because he thinks it a whimsical or subjective
measure. However, although it is an odd way of putting it, the point is
expressed correctly because the thinking has to be rational. It must be
capable of resisting judicial review on the basis that it was
irrational, or that it did not take everything necessary into account.
It must not have left out something that should not have been left out
of account, and must be otherwise not unreasonable. If that thinking
process is not a public law compliant way of thinking, which, as one my
officials said to me outside the Committee, is how I always think
anyway, it will not work. It is not a casual process at
all.</div>
<a name="0907017000390"></a><div class="hs_Para">We can offer
more reassurances. The initial trigger would be a thought process of
that kind for the Minister following advice. None the less, the power
can be used only where a Community obligation is to be implemented
through the regulation-making power under section 2(2) of
the European Communities Act 1972. That obligation must be one that the
Minister thinks relates to the subject matter of the equality
Acts&#151;the Bill and the Equality Act 2006&#151;but the existence
of implementing regulations to be so made will be a matter of
fact.</div><a name="0907017000391"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
power can be used only where the Minister thinks it appropriate to make
harmonising provision in the equality Acts&#151;the same thinking
again&#151;for instance, where there is extra provision in the
equality Acts that goes beyond the subject matter of a Community
obligation, but which is part of the provisions that must be amended to
comply with the new Community obligation. This situation could arise in
the area of racial discrimination; currently, the Community provisions
do not address nationality or colour, but the UK always has. To
preserve our harmonised approach, we might need to use this power. It
is inherent in the exercise of such a power that the Government will
need to demonstrate why the use of the power is both appropriate and
necessary, or expedient in those
circumstances.</div><a name="0907017000392"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
understand why the hon. Gentleman might wish to strengthen
accountability where a Minister &#147;thinks&#148; that the urgency
of the situation requires circumvention of the normal 12-week
consultation period. However, it is not a &#147;thinking&#148;
process that can just come to someone over
breakfast&#151;&#147;Although I have just set about the
consultation process, I will abrogate it now, because I think we should
move forward&#148;&#151;it has got to be a completely rational
decision-making process, and it is there for urgent situations when, by
definition, there will not be the opportunity to demonstrate formally
and objectively all the evidence that the consultation might have put
up. Ministers will have to report to Parliament every five years on the
exercise of the power over the previous five
years.</div><a name="0907017000393"></a><div class="hs_Para">All
regulations giving effect to this power will have to be laid before and
debated by both Houses of Parliament. As with the consultation process
to which I have just referred, the Minster will have to demonstrate
that the regulations under section 2(2) of the 1972 Act trigger a need
to retain harmony through the use of this power, and that the
adjustments proposed are necessary. The debates would provide Members
with opportunities to probe where, for instance, the 12-week
consultation has been
shortened.</div><a name="0907017000394"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is a lot more accountability built into the provision than might at
first appear the case, when all one has to do is to have some rational
ministerial 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column614" />Column number: 614</div>thinking, and that particular piece of language does not provide the
complete picture; I hope I have now satisfactorily done so. I know that
the hon. Gentleman feels strongly that the requirement should be about
more than just being over a threshold. I hope I have satisfied him. It
is about more than being over a threshold; it is about the
employer&#146;s depiction of what he needs in that job&#151;people
who are as qualified as each other in every way to fit that job, but
who might fall short of being identical. If they had to be identical,
the power would never be used.</div>

looking at the private or the public, increasingly, progressive
management understands that being able to recruit a more diverse work
force&#151;not just at the bottom, but in middle management and at
the very top&#151;enables them to compete better, do their business
better and provide a better service to
people.</div><a name="0907017000398"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the question of qualifications, progressive management also understands
that it is not just a question of necessarily having formal experience
or formal qualifications. Other attributes and other added values are
involved when people consciously try to recruit a diverse work
force.</div><a name="0907017000399"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
put it to the hon. Gentleman that in expressing the fear that
underskilled and underqualified tinted people will take jobs from his
constituents, he shows that he is not keeping up with where management
is and where the bosses of some of our biggest international companies
are at this
time.</div><a name="0907017000400"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907017000619"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> I cannot be quite as brief as I had intended,
because I need to deal with the points that the hon. Lady has
made.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column615" />Column number: 615</div><a name="0907017000401"></a><div class="hs_Para">I chose the
example that I did not because I was just picking randomly the idea of
a less qualified black candidate, for example, getting a job from a
better qualified white candidate. I used it because I had a specific
case in my constituency and because my constituency does not have a
terribly diverse population&#151;it is 99.6 per cent. white. It was
hardly surprising that the case involved a white person being
discriminated against. That is why I chose that example; I had no
ulterior motive in choosing
it.</div><a name="0907017000402"></a><div class="hs_Para">Anticipating
the particular argument that the hon. Lady made is exactly why I took
the trouble when we debated clause 152, which is on general positive
action measures that can be taken, to say that I am in favour of those
measures. I am in favour of companies taking steps to have a more
diverse work force and I made that clear in the debate on clause
152.</div><a name="0907017000403"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are now specifically discussing my concern that in making specific
hiring and promotion decisions when there are a number of candidates,
some of whom are demonstrably better than others, people will be able
to prefer the less good candidate, of whatever colour and of whatever
protected characteristic, rather than choose the better qualified
candidate who does not have that protected characteristic. I do not
think that that situation is very
helpful.</div><a name="0907017000404"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
candidates are equally qualified, a decision must be made based on
something. At least the protected characteristic is objective, rather
than the employer just liking a person better. Other than that, this
situation stores up a lot of dangers. However, that does not mean that
I am not in favour of employers taking lots of positive steps, as the
hon. Lady correctly said. I just think that the situation I have
described is a step too far.</div>
<a name="0907017000405"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907017000620"></a>Ms
Abbott:</b> Briefly, the notion of less qualified and better
qualified candidates can be highly subjective. Years ago, before I came
to the House, I worked for the big London television company, which was
called Thames Television. When I first went to work for that company,
the head of news and current affairs was a tall, thin, cerebral man
with a Cambridge degree. He systematically promoted to the editorship
of programmes and to head of department tall, thin, cerebral men with
Oxbridge degrees. When that man left and his post was taken over by a
rotund, northern, beery ex-tabloid journalist, lo and behold&#151;the
people he thought were better qualified were people in his image. Had
he spent as much time as I have examining these issues, he would have
known that the propensity of people to promote in their own image and
justify it by some subjective notion of qualifications is one of the
big issues when it comes to
diversity.</div><a name="0907017000406"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
welcome the provisions in the Bill. As I have said, some managers and
some employers might have problems with them, but if the hon. Gentleman
talks to our biggest companies and our most advanced management, he
will find that they understand that these provisions can help
them&#151;not to be nice to black people and ethnic minorities, but
to make businesses better, more successful and more competitive,
thereby providing a better service and ultimately making more money for
their shareholders.</div>
<a name="0907017000407"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907017000621"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> I do not disagree with a lot of what the hon. Lady
says, but I still think there is a distinction between what we talked
about on clause 152 and this 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column616" />Column number: 616</div>clause. I will not pursue the debate because we will not agree and I
detect that other members of the Committee would like us to move
on.</div><a name="0907017000408"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
only thing I would like to say on amendment 29 is that P must think
&#147;reasonably&#148;. The Minister made great play of the word
&#147;reasonably&#148;, yet under clause 191, when it is
the Minister thinking, the word &#147;reasonably&#148; does not
appear. Perhaps we can explore that more when we reach that
clause.</div><a name="0907017000409"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
amendment 23, I will think again about whether subsection (4)(b) checks
the use of subsection (4)(a) and so deals with the problem that I
described. My concern was that if there is pool of people the fact that
a policy is not possible effectively means that systematic
discrimination is not possible. The Minister has planted some seeds
there on which I will cogitate. I will withdraw amendment 29, but I may
wish to press to a vote one or more of amendments 31 to 34 when we
reach clause 191. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="0907017000410"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,
by leave, withdrawn.</i></div>
<a name="0907017000411"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907017000622"></a>Lynne
Featherstone:</b> I beg to move amendment 301, in
clause 153, page 113, line 17, leave

(b).</div><a name="0907017000412"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907017000623"></a>The
Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to discuss
amendment 302, in
clause 153, page 113, line 23, at
end insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">&#145;(ca) offer work

</i><i class="I">a</i><i class="I">mendment to allow positive action in the recruitment of
volunteers.</i></div><a name="0907017000413"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907017000624"></a>Lynne
Featherstone:</b> The points are relatively brief, everyone
will be relieved to hear. The first amendment would remove the now
famous subsection (4)(b). This is really a probing amendment because we
have not been able to understand the effect of the proposal.
Subsection (2) applies only if P does not have a policy of
treating persons who share a protected characteristic more favourably
in connection with recruitment or promotion. If P did have such a
policy it would presumably be illegal. Why would someone who did not
have that policy want to apply subsection (2) anyway? I hope the
Minister gets my drift on that&#151;possibly, possibly
not.</div><a name="0907017000414"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment is probing because there is a lack of clarity around this. I
note that the hon. Member for Forest of Dean is going to think about it
some more. We have not been able to identify why subsection (2) can be
applied only if someone does not have such a policy. If one does not
have a policy of wanting to promote people, why would one apply
subsection (2), as it is enabling legislation rather than
mandatory?</div><a name="0907017000415"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
amendment 302, we discussed the recruitment of volunteers and whether
the protection from discrimination extended to them. I was grateful to
the Minister for saying that it did extend to volunteers, but this
application of positive action does not seem to extend to the
recruitment of
volunteers.</div><a name="0907017000416"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
I am taking on interns I will not be able to apply positive action to
interns who are as qualified as each other to bring them into my
office. Volunteering plays an important role in opening doors and
giving access to different worlds, experience and accreditation, which
is why it is so productive, particularly for young people. It presents
opportunities to advance careers and get skills and training. It would
be a good thing if organisations were allowed to take positive action
when particular groups were under-represented in their place of
work.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column617" />Column number: 617</div><a name="0907017000417"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907017000625"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> Amendment 301 would wreck the positive
action stance that we have taken by allowing a policy of habitually
treating somebody with a protected characteristic more favourably in
connection with recruitment or promotion than people who do not share
it, irrespective of merit. What the hon. Lady is struggling
with&#151;I understand the point&#151;is why, if the individual who
wanted to make an appointment was not willing to use the provision,
would they ever use it? She is equating that willingness with having a
policy of using the provision. However, using such a provision requires
an organisation to do it by assessing merit and then comparing only
those who are as qualified as each other. If a company has a policy of
appointing someone because they are black or a woman, they are acting
unlawfully. Paragraph (b), which the hon. Lady seeks to remove, is
about ensuring that merit is in place.</div>
<a name="0907017000418"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907017000626"></a>Lynne
Featherstone:</b> It is the &#147;does not have a
policy&#148; that I am confused about. I am talking about
subsection (4)(b), which
says:</div><a name="0907017000472"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;P
does not have a
policy&#148;.</div><a name="0907017000419"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907017000627"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> The person can use positive action as
long as they use positive action only and do not have a policy of
positive discrimination.</div>
<a name="0907017000420"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 302
is about the difference between volunteers and employees. The other
week, we discussed whether we should involve volunteers. I think that
the hon. Lady appreciated that, given the range of volunteers, it is
difficult to fit them into the legislation. If we were 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column618" />Column number: 618</div>to do so, it could have a chilling effect on them coming forward. We are
talking here about the difference between a volunteer, who comes and
offers their services freely to causes that are special to them and
does not look for remuneration, and people who are looking for a real
opportunity and a contract with remuneration. One can see how positive
action is a more relevant tool to the second category and much less to
the first. I ask the hon. Lady to consider that it is not necessary to
have amendment 302
either.</div><a name="0907017000421"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0907017000628"></a>Lynne
Featherstone:</b> Got it. I thank the Minister for removing
the clouds from my brain with regard to paragraph (b). All I was
seeking was to ensure that there would be no illegality were I to use
positive action to choose a volunteer who had a protected
characteristic but who was as qualified as any other applicant for,
say, an internship. I want to ensure that I would not be in jeopardy
were I to use that method of selecting a volunteer. As far as I can
understand the Minister, I would not be in any jeopardy. On that basis,
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="0907017000422"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,
