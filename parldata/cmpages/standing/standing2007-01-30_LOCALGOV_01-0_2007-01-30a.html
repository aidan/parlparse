quite an historic occasion. For the first time, a Public Bill Committee
will be hearing oral evidence on a Bill. So that everyone is clear
about what is happening, I shall briefly explain what is proposed. The
Committee will first be asked to consider the programme motion on which
debate is limited to half an hour. We shall then proceed to debate a
motion to report to the House the written evidence that the Committee
receives and a motion to permit the Committee to deliberate in private
in advance of the oral evidence
sessions.</div>

Committee has agreed its lines of questioning, the witnesses and

programme motion, it will hear oral evidence this week before reverting
to the more familiar proceedings of clause-by-clause scrutiny at
subsequent
sittings.</div>

that this form of scrutiny has taken place. I thank all members of the

							<b class="B">Alistair
Burt</b> (North-East Bedfordshire) (Con): Good morning,
Mr. Benton, to you and members of the Committee. I wish
first to endorse many of the remarks made by the Minister. It is indeed
a pleasure to work under your chairmanship at the historic start to
proceedings on the Bill. We are all looking forward to seeing how it
will work. As Lord Cope said in his recent note that he sent round
about the new
procedure:</div>
					<a name="07013092000168"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
new process is not described as an experiment, but it is recognised
that the system may need modification in the light of
experience.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07013092000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are in
the happy position of being the first people to provide some of that
experience on which modification might be based.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column3" />Column number: 4</div>
					<a name="07013092000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">The decision to modernise
legislative proceedings and to improve the way in which a Committee
informed itself of what was before it through the process of taking
evidence was warmly welcomed by the House when the Modernisation
Committee reported after the matter was debated in November. We are
pleased to be able to start the process that the Minister has
outlined.</div>
					<a name="07013092000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">Now comes
the historic &#147;but&#148; moment. We have recognised over the
years that, whereas consensus is incredibly important, the danger of
being over-consensual is that we miss things. We believe that it is our
job to assist the process of modification by pointing out things that
could be improved and by putting a little bit of grit in the oyster,
which I intend to do. I shall come to that in a
second.</div>
					<a name="07013092000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">I add to my
welcomes by saying what a great pleasure it will be to work with the
Minister. He and I have known each other for many years, and I regard
him as a highly capable colleague with a great interest in and
knowledge of the subject. I look forward to representing the
Conservatives while he applies his skill to outlining the
Government&#146;s measures. In that spirit, I am sure that when we
suggest changes that he knows need to be made, he will agree and ask
his colleagues to do the
same.</div>

							<a name="07013092000245"></a>Alistair
Burt:
						</b> The Whip shakes his head, as is his wont. He would
be in trouble with the Whips&#146; union if he did not. We are
looking forward to the debate on this interesting
topic.</div>
					<a name="07013092000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">I turn to our
slight concern about the programme motion and the reason why the
Conservatives object to it. It is a bit rushed. We all know that
calling witnesses, particularly to give oral evidence, was always going
to involve a squeeze in the parliamentary legislative procedure, but it
is necessary to get it off and running well in the first place, and we
are not certain that that has happened.</div>
					<a name="07013092000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">In order for there to be
sensible consideration of who ought to give evidence and to give
witnesses time to rearrange their diaries accordingly, a certain amount
of time is necessary. We are concerned that that has not been given.
Progress was unduly hasty from Second Reading to the meeting of the
Programming Sub-Committee, which is meant to make such decisions, and
to this first Committee sitting. Second Reading was last Monday, the
Programming Sub-Committee met on Thursday and here we are on Tuesday
expecting people to be ready to come and give evidence.</div>
					<a name="07013092000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our point is that further
consideration might have helped us. The Minister is right to say that a
range of witnesses will be attending today and on Thursday, but there
could have been more. Further time might have allowed the Committee to
consider adding one or two. Our suggested witnesses included London
Councils, which will be appearing; the parliamentary boundary
commission, the Association of Chief Police Officers and the
Association of Police Authorities for their experience of
regionalisation; Professor Michael Chisholm, to whom the Clerks&#146;
briefing notes to the House referred for his work on the costs involved
in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column4" />Column number: 5</div>local government reorganisation; Professor Tony Travers, who I suspect
needs no introduction because of his knowledge of local government
finance; Gordon Keymer, the head of the Local Government Association,
who will be appearing this afternoon; and Michael Lyons, whose
knowledge of local government finance is second only to that of Tony
Travers.</div>
					<a name="07013092000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">Michael
Lyons could have enlightened us about the continuing debate about which
cart comes before which horse&#151;whether we should be listening to
him about the financial structure of local government or to others
about the structure of local government to which he will apply his
financial structure. There has been an interesting debate that could
cut both ways, but it might have been enlightening to listen to what he
thought and probe him with questions about the financial structure. Our
point is that it is difficult now to decide on two-tier and unitary
structure issues without knowing precisely what financial regime will
be operating
shortly.</div>
					<a name="07013092000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">We thought
that hearing from Christopher Booker from <i class="I">The Sunday Telegraph
</i>might have been interesting, with his knowledge of the Standards
Board and of ethics in particular, about which he has written
extensively. We thought that Health Link might be involved, and it will
be appearing. We suggested a think tank called Involve, as well as the
Socialist Health Association in order to see whether it still had any
chums among Labour Members.</div>
					<a name="07013092000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">Only in the last couple of
days, we all received an e-mail from Gill Morgan of the NHS
Confederation. Her absence is a potentially serious hole in our
deliberations. If we had had a little more time, perhaps we would have
thought of calling the NHS Confederation to give us its experience and
wisdom, particularly concerning part 11 of the Bill and the issues of
patient and public involvement. The possibility also arises that we
might see Gill Morgan later in the Committee. I note that the guide
given to us by the Chairman of Ways and Means includes a paragraph that
states:</div>
					<a name="07013092000169"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Although the Committee
is expected to take oral evidence at the start of its proceedings,
there is no procedural reason why it may not return to evidence-taking
later in its consideration of the
Bill.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07013092000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">Bearing in mind
that the Bill is neatly drawn into local government and public health
elements, it might be convenient to retain some flexibility in how we
handle it, and to consider at some later stage whether Gill Morgan and
the NHS Confederation might come along.</div>

							<b class="B">Michael
Fabricant</b> (Lichfield) (Con): The Chairman of Ways of Means
has also made that recommendation to the Leader of the House. I think
it is a good idea, and it follows on from what my hon. Friend was
saying, although I am not sure, with the new procedure, whether I can
say Alistair Burt, or whether I am supposed to refer to my hon. Friend.
Perhaps Mr. Benton will give us a lead on the
matter.</div>

the new procedure, I point out that, on Select Committees, we refer to
each other by name.
</div>
					<a name="07013092000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon. Friend made a
point about the delay. The Chairman of Ways and Means, in a letter to
the Leader of the House said that it would be a good idea to have at
least two weekends&#146; gap between the Programming Sub-Committee
and the first Committee sitting. That would have enabled us to have
time to invite more people along, and to have a fuller discussion in
the Programming Sub-Committee about who can come along to give
evidence. I agree with my hon. Friend that, although it is a good idea,
things that get done in a rush are not always
satisfactory.</div>
					
					<a name="07013092000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07013092000251"></a>Alistair
Burt:
						</b> I thank my hon. Friend for his intervention. That is
the reason why we are raising this procedural point. The House agrees
that the innovation is important, and we want to get it right. I hope
that, in future, notice is taken of the timing
issues.</div>
					<a name="07013092000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">In his note,
Lord Cope makes reference to the need to think ahead. He
states:</div>
					<a name="07013092000170"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
timing will be very tight, particularly between second reading and
decisions about who is to give evidence and for how long. Lobbyists and
MPs involved will have to think
ahead.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07013092000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">We make those
points because the rush that my hon. Friend described suggests that the
Committee might not have thought ahead quite as much as it should have
done. Notwithstanding that, and although we have our complaints, the
Committee should proceed in the way in which the Government have
suggested. However, if the Government note our concerns and pass them
back through the usual channels, problems can be avoided in the
future.</div>
					<a name="07013092000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
programming of the Committee, we asked for 22 sittings. However, after
evidence is taken, we will have 16 sittings. The broad split that the
Government have in mind for discussing the Bill is fine, and we will
accommodate it&#151;it is pretty much in line with our thinking.
There may be a little bit of flexibility either way, but we intend to
take the measure through Committee as the Government have suggested.
That gives us plenty of time to examine the Bill as we would wish, and
to make our objections. We hope that the spirit that we are taking
towards the Committee shows that when we divide the Committee, the
concerns we raise are genuine and serious. We will not play games in
the Committee. We will put forward the issues that matter and vote on
them accordingly. Within that framework, we are looking forward to
dealing with the witnesses and the substance of the Bill in the right
spirit.</div>
					
					<a name="07013092000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">

							<b class="B">Andrew
Stunell</b> (Hazel Grove) (LD): I start by welcoming you to
the Chair, Mr. Benton. We are looking forward to working
with you and other members of the Committee over the next few
weeks.</div>
					<a name="07013092000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the new
process, the Liberal Democrats strongly support the additional element
of procedure in the Committee. We hope that it will turn out to be a
profitable process for this Committee, and that it can be developed on
future occasions to be still more 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column6" />Column number: 7</div>effective. It is clearly sensible that we have access to expert and
practitioner advice on some of the key elements of the Bill, and we are
looking forward to working through that
process.</div>
				
					
					<a name="07013092000213"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.45
am</div>
					<a name="07013092000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Conservative spokesman said that we on this Committee are pioneers, but
I think that perhaps we are more like guinea pigs. The Government have
tried hard, but if we are to be guinea pigs, can we have a bit more
lettuce and a bit less grit next time? There is scope to improve the
process. I do not blame anybody. We are pioneers&#151;there were no
protocols or process and we have had to make the best of things.
Nevertheless, I hope that the opportunity will be taken, behind the
scenes, to consider the lessons learned by all those involved on how
the new process should be commissioned and initiated.</div>
					<a name="07013092000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">I support the point made by the
Chairman of Ways and Means in his initial proposal that there should be
two weekends-worth of thinking time&#151;a clear week&#151;between
Second Reading and plunging into the process. The speed with which we
have begun the Committee stage is the reason why my third colleague, my
hon. Friend the Member for Southport, is not here. He is away on a
parliamentary visit and it was not possible for him to reorganise his
schedule in the time available.</div>
					<a name="07013092000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">My party looks forward to
working on the Bill with other colleagues in the Committee. We have
some major issues that we shall bring to the attention of the
Committee, but I echo the words of the Conservative Front-Bench
spokesman&#151;we do not intend either to waste the
Committee&#146;s time or to involve ourselves in unnecessary
controversy. We want to see a much improved Bill, and we shall work
constructively to achieve that.</div>
					
					<a name="07013092000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07013092000253"></a>
							<b class="B">Patrick
Hall</b> (Bedford) (Lab): I too welcome the new procedure, but
I have one or two questions about the decisions that have been
made&#151;including on how they have been made&#151;which I ask in
the spirit of wishing to improve the process. For example, how were the
witnesses selected, and why was not the Committee involved in
that?</div>
					<a name="07013092000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">It might be
difficult for the Committee to be involved, and some organisation in
advance might be needed, but I should like to know how the selection
was made. Today, for example, the Local Government Association will
appear before us, quite rightly. The LGA represents all strands of
local government, yet we will have a part repeat in respect of district
councils, and a further repeat in respect of another part of local
government with London Councils, so we have three bites of the same
cherry taking up witness time today. The hon. Member for North-East
Bedfordshire said that he had a huge list of possible witnesses, yet
time will be taken up considering LGA work in those three separate
bites. This evening we shall hear from Health Link, but we do not have
time for the Commission for Patient and Public Involvement in Health.
That was the body that set up patients forums, so it would have been
reasonable to hear from it. We need to learn some lessons on
that.</div>
					<a name="07013092000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is
another important point to do with administration. There has been
little time to prepare 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column7" />Column number: 8</div>and to read the brief. We shall do our best, but I rescued my papers
from the post room at 8 o&#146;clock yesterday evening; they were
about to be posted to Bedford. Without the co-operation of the post
service in the House that would not have helped me a great
deal.</div>
					<a name="07013092000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">I mention those
points not in a negative, critical manner but in a constructive one, in
the hope that we shall do better in
future.</div>
					
					<a name="07013092000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07013092000254"></a>The
Chairman:
						</b> The points that the hon. Gentleman makes are
well taken. We are all on a learning curve. His remarks are duly noted
and I am sure that they will be taken on board. That is far as I can go
at the moment.</div>
					
					<a name="07013092000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07013092000255"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> I thank all those who have commented, including
the hon. Member for North-East Bedfordshire. Perhaps in the future he
could be not quite so kind and
flattering.</div>
					<a name="07013092000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government take the procedures seriously. We have proposed a number of
modernisation steps in relation to the way in which we legislate, and
inevitably changes cause problems and difficulties, but they bed in
over time. I think that the House consensus is that the changes we have
made have been improvements. I know that the Opposition have some
principled objections to programming, which I understand. For our part,
the Executive have to bear in mind some real-world issues, including
those to do with financial years. It is a question of
balance.</div>
					<a name="07013092000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
Bill&#146;s First Reading was on 12 December, so we moved quickly
from White Paper to Bill. We also published a White Paper
implementation plan. We did that deliberately because local government
had asked us to move ahead quickly after an exhaustive period of
genuine consultation. I hope that the LGA, when it gives evidence, will
acknowledge that. By the end of the period, we were criticised for
having too much consultation. To reiterate the point made by the
Modernisation Committee, the witnesses appearing before the Committee
are not the only evidence givers available. All of us who have served
on Bill Committees know that there is sometimes an exhaustive amount of
briefing and lobbying. Nowadays such communications tend to come by
e-mail, but people used to come to our weekend advice surgeries to
lobby. It would not be fair to give the impression that anybody has
been excluded from access to the Committee. A number of organisations
have been mentioned. We have had the Bill since before December. I
understand the point about the two weekends&#146; gap, but, to be
fair to the Government, the Bill has been published for a number of
weeks.</div>
					<a name="07013092000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">Specifically
on the timing, we have tried to balance time and the necessity of
making progress. I appreciate that the Opposition asked for slightly
more sittings, but as a member of the ex-Whips union, I think that the
Whips on both sides have been sensible in their approach and that we
have a good schedule. As for the list of organisations, my hon. Friend
the Member for Bedford made a very sensible point about involving the
Committee in inviting and deciding on witnesses. Obviously the timing
of this Committee&#151;it being the first one to use the new
procedure&#151;has made that difficult. The House voted that Bills
introduced after 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column8" />Column number: 9</div>Christmas 2006 should be subject to the new procedure. This Bill was
introduced before Christmas 2006 but it is the first to be subject to
the procedure. I am not sure whether we are guinea pigs or pilots, but
the Government are using the new procedure now as a gesture of goodwill
and transparency. We did not have to under the resolution of the House,
so I hope that the Committee will bear with us.</div>
					<a name="07013092000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">The list of organisations and
individuals that we have to consult in local government is exhaustive.
It is perhaps unfortunate from my point of view that the Local
Government and Public Involvement in Health Bill should be the first to
be subject to such scrutiny. The organisations that my colleagues and I
meet in consultation over local government would fill a telephone
directory&#151;I mean that literally. We have to strike a
balance.</div>
					<a name="07013092000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">The usual
channels are the answer to the question put by my hon. Friend the
Member for Bedford, who made some suggestions. I understand that the
Opposition have proposed an on the whole distinguished list of people
to give evidence. I have read and seen submissions from all of them
apart from Christopher Booker, whose cuttings I read on Monday morning.
To be fair, I can often learn things from him, although he is perhaps
one of the more zealous
commentators.</div>
					<a name="07013092000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Hazel Grove questioned whether we were guinea pigs or
pilots. I suppose that we are both. Is it possible to be both a guinea
pig and a pilot? I would not get on a plane being flown by a guinea
pig, but we would be lucky if we could get on any plane
tomorrow.</div>

					<a name="07013092000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should like to
draw Committee members&#146; attention to an important passage in the
Members&#146; guidance on the new Public Bill Committees, published
by the Library. The Modernisation Committee&#146;s report,
&#147;The Legislative Process&#148;, which proposed evidence-taking
powers, says that those are
intended</div>
					<a name="07013092000171"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to enable the
Members who will be going through the bill in detail to inform
themselves about its contents and to give the Minister a chance to
respond to questions from the Committee, a process which is likely to
be more fruitful that a series of debates on &#145;probing&#146;
amendments.&#148;</div>

						<a name="07013092000258"></a>
							<b class="B">Alison
Seabeck</b> (Plymouth, Devonport) (Lab): I wish to ask a
question through you, Mr. Benton, because I am not quite
sure how probing amendments will e dealt with. Clearly, the idea is
potentially to reduce the number of probing amendments. I assume that
you have the power, when amendments are tabled, to determine whether
their substance has already been extensively discussed during the
evidence-taking process.</div>

contrary, the usual protocol will be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column9" />Column number: 10</div>observed. In other words, if there has been adequate discussion and
coverage of any given matter, the Chairman has discretion to say,
&#147;This has been adequately discussed,&#148; as, for example,
when dealing with clause stand part, and it is felt that the whole
clause has, in general, been adequately discussed. I imagine that the
same flexibility will be available, subject to any legal advice to the
contrary.</div>

Burt:
						</b> Will the Minister consider again the good point made
by the hon. Member for Bedford, about how to involve the majority of
Committee members in decisions on witnesses? Either we recommend that
it is not the Programming Sub-Committee that makes the decisions on
witnesses, but the Committee as a whole&#151;which might be
uncomfortable&#151;or the usual channels give a commitment that,
before the Programming Sub-Committee meets, discussions will be held
with those who are anticipated to be Committee members so that their
expertise may be brought in. Although the process was designed to
ensure that the usual channels and the hon. Members leading on Bills
for their parties would contribute to the selection of witnesses, that
excludes the expertise of hon. Members brought on to the Committee
because they are interested in and have knowledge about the area.
Either that should be formally recognised in the process of involving
witnesses&#151;it could be accommodated if there were two weekends
between the decision being made and asking them&#151;or, if that
cannot be done, the usual channels should give a commitment to involve
Committee members in the

should be limited in terms of both time and object. We understand from
the Minister&#146;s speech at the LGA&#146;s assembly that the
intention of the clause was to allow for a direction to be given in the
present context when an authority makes a proposal that might not
necessarily be acceded to by other authorities in the same area. Our
view is that the power of direction should not extend beyond the
current round of consideration of reorganisation. As for the criteria,
our view is that there should be support across the area in which a
unitary authority might be proposed and that there should be
demonstrable efficiency savings that would accrue to the area&#146;s
taxpayers.</div>

						</i> To take that further, if you want the evidence,
you need to go back to the last round of unitary creation. None of the
unitaries created as much savings as quickly as was forecast when they
were created. That is not to say that savings did not come eventually,
or that there may not be other reasons for doing it. However, cost
savings were not realised in the short-term before, and I cannot see
why they should be now.</div>

						</i> The only thing that I would add is that all
local authorities are currently expected to make very significant
efficiency savings. We are about to be given 3 per cent. cashable
savings targets, which will be a considerable increase on the previous
efficiency targets. We are all looking for shared services and
procurement efficiencies, so there is already a great movement towards
cost reduction in local authorities. Restructuring will actually set
back a lot of that work, through diversion of the limited capacity of
any council to engage with big change programmes of any
kind.</div>

							<b class="B">Tom
Levitt</b> (High Peak) (Lab): I should like to turn to part 2
of the Bill. You say in your brief that electoral and warding
arrangements should be a matter for local discretion and therefore you
support them, but in fact the Bill contains an irrevocable move towards
all-out elections. Clearly, all-out elections on a four-year basis
support the model of an elected mayor or an elected cabinet with a
four-year term. Some might argue, however, that the present system used
by some district councils of almost annual elections engages more
electors over a four-year period, holds the council accountable each
year and militates against catastrophic change. Are you as relaxed
about the move to all-out arrangements as your brief
suggests?</div>

								Sir Jeremy
Beecham:
							</b>
						</i> With respect, I do not read the Bill in
quite the same way in terms of requiring all-out elections every four
years for everyone. I am open to correction, but my reading is that, if
that decision is made, it will become a permanent decision, but you are
not required to make that
decision.</div>
					<a name="07013092000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I recall,
the Bill provides for when you do not make the decision. For example,
the term of an indirectly elected leader and executive would coincide
with whatever period is unexpired of his or her current four-year term.
It may be in some people&#146;s minds to move to all-out elections
across the country, but that is not the LGA&#146;s position. We think
that it should remain a matter for local discretion. There are mixed
views about it. I concur with the view that district councils have put
to Mr. Levitt and prefer the system of election by thirds.
Other people will have a different view. My colleagues and others are
used to four-year terms and may well prefer them. We think that it
should be a matter for local
decision.</div>

						</i> The serious point is that it is a one-way trade
at the moment. If there is to be true local discretion, there must be a
two-way trade and, with mayors, it is difficult to reverse a mayoral
vote. I believe that, if you try something that does not work, it is
ridiculous to keep flogging a dead horse. Personally, I am in favour of
regular elections because that refreshes the political parties, as much
as anything. I go to a lot of two-tier areas where the political
parties&#151;this is true of all parties&#151;tend to go to sleep
for a period and then suddenly, six months before a local election,
they think, &#147;Oh, we want to start doing something.&#148; A
regular refreshment is better than an all-up
situation.</div>

focus on one of three models of executive arrangements set out in the
Bill&#151;that of elected leader with a four-year term. What are your
views on the circumstances in which you think that a council might
remove a leader by resolution and whether, in practice, when a leader
loses the confidence of his or her 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column16" />Column number: 17</div>political group, they might be removed so that there might in fact be
little difference from the present

							<b class="B">
								Sir

						</i> That is probably true. The intention
of the Bill is to create or promote a somewhat different culture. I do
not think that it will lead necessarily to people automatically lasting
the four-year course in every case. It would be wrong if it did so. I
think the structure would encourage that and perhaps the political
parties&#146; guidance and rules, where political parties are
involved, might also facilitate that. Certainly, the Labour party rules
allow for a longer period than one year at the moment, although I am
not aware of many Labour groups that have adopted that model, but it
could a matter for the political parties to promote. The important
safeguard is that there must be the capacity to
change.</div>

overall control. For example, in the council in the constituency of the
Chair there has been a three-party controlling cabinet for a
considerable period, and in Leeds there is a four-party one. I am not
quite sure how a single leader with the executive functions proposed in
this Bill could cope in such a situation, as coalitions move around for
various reasons. It is not just a question of confidence in the leader,
but of confidence in the parties. I do not think that the proposals
reflect the three-party, and in some cases four-party, nature of local
government these
days.</div>

councillors&#151;I am sure I am not the only one to hear it&#151;is
that they feel unloved. If councillors are not on the executive or
cabinet, they feel that they are not sufficiently appreciated and that
the scrutiny role is not satisfying. I have heard that from quite a few
councillors. May I ask you all how the executive arrangements set out
in part 3 of the Bill might change the position of non-executive
councillors, if at all? Do you see the proposals in part 3 as having
the potential to increase the interest in standing for election to a
local council and to draw new people
in?</div>
					<a name="0701312000013"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								Sir
Jeremy Beecham:
							</b>
						</i> Yes, I think so. We strongly support
the enhanced role given to what the Bill describes as the front-line
councillor in a constituency capacity. I am referring to the proposal
to facilitate devolution or delegation of powers to ward councillors so
that they can act as community champions and take some executive
decisions and have an enhanced scrutiny role. A mythology has developed
over the years about how influential back-bench councillors were under
the previous committee system. There is the illusion of influence over,
and control of, the leadership that was not justified by the processes
that were actually involved.</div>
					<a name="0701312000014"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the other hand, if the system
is to work, scrutiny has to be adequately supported and supplemented by
the engagement of people from the community, private and third-sector
interests and so on. The scrutiny role 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column18" />Column number: 19</div>needs to be more rigorous and developed than it has been. That is a way
in which people might be encouraged; people who do not necessarily want
to spend all their time sitting in committees in which they might, on
average, make a four-minute contribution to the deliberations at the
town hall. One of the great virtues of the scrutiny system is&#151;or
should be&#151;that councillors are not whipped; they are called upon
to exercise their own judgment in a process that is not predetermined
by the group whip.</div>

						</i> There is no doubt that councillors who
experienced the old system dislike the new system and have not adjusted
to it. In my view, the executive arrangements in the Bill will not make
a great deal of impact on that. Jeremy is right to say that the sense
of getting things done, influencing decisions and making things happen
is what makes a councillor who is not in the executive feel that they
are doing a worthwhile job. Therefore, I am trying in my own authority
to enhance the role, powers and influence of the non-executive
councillor in a range of ways to try to put back what they think they
have lost, even if Jeremy is right in saying that they did not in the
past have as much influence as they thought. It is about ensuring that
a council&#146;s constitution empowers and enables back benchers, so
that getting elected means that they can make a difference on their own
and make things happen for people.</div>

								Sir
Simon Milton:

						</i> In Westminster, we have done a lot of
research with members about what frustrates them, and about where they
think the gaps are. A lot of the problem boils down to lack of
information. Members feel that they are out of the loop because they do
not see the papers that go across the desk of the executive members,
and they are often consulted far too late in the process. It is about
ensuring that members are there at the beginning of the process, when
decisions need to be taken.</div>
					<a name="0701312000018"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are having some good area
integration meetings in which councillors from one area will sit down

								Sir Jeremy
Beecham:
							</b>
						</i> May I add one further comment in relation to
the elected executives? There is one respect in which the Bill in its
present form might exacerbate the problem to which Mr. Hall
referred. If it occurs, the election of executives will then
precipitate by-elections for any member of the elected executive who
was also elected as a councillor at the same time. There is perhaps a
question as to why it is necessary for the executive not to be
drawn&#151;albeit elected on a slate on the same day&#151;from
elected councillors? Why do you have to treat them, as it were, as a
class apart within the council? That might be something that the
Committee would wish to
consider.</div>
					<a name="0701312000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								Richard
Kemp:
							</b>
						</i> I certainly support that view. To my mind, one
of the weaknesses of the mayoral system is that the mayor and the group
are quite divorced. If you then have 10 people who are quite divorced,
that would damage the unity of political parties, which in terms of big
councils, is actually quite important.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column19" />Column number: 20</div>
					<a name="0701312000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">To go back to the original
question, I have been a cabinet member under the new system, a
committee chair under the old system and a back-bencher under both. I
must say that I get a great deal of satisfaction out of being a
back-bencher. I enjoy the work in my ward and perhaps, because I have
been around a long time, I can pull people together. I enjoy an element
of scrutiny, although I must admit that I do not go to a lot of what we
call in Liverpool select committees because, by and large, they do not
function very well. I enjoy being able to stand up in council and say
everything that I think without being bounded by cabinet
responsibility.</div>
					<a name="0701312000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
need, however, to address the point about council members&#146;
perception that you are either a sheep or a goat; you are either in the
cabinet or shadow cabinet or not very important. That is how the
current power structure looks. It is does not matter how good the
initiatives are&#151;and we all try to do things to involve all the
council&#151;in the old system, you were there when the decisions
were taking place, you could hear the arguments and you understood
them. Getting a seminar, the appropriate report, the appropriate
information on the website is not the same as being part of that
debate, even if the reality was that you stuck your hand up when your
spokesman or your chair told you to.</div>
					<a name="0701312000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore, I think there are
real issues about how back benchers obtain knowledge. There are issues
that need to be addressed by almost every council about how we support
ward members, front-line councillors&#151;whatever we call
them&#151;in doing the job that I define as being the cabinet member
for their ward. There is a long way to
go.</div>

[<i class="I">Interruption.</i>] Well, you have been leader; you are the
leadership cadre of the LGA. It was noticeable during the debate that
many Members on both sides were concerned about just the issues that
Councillor Kemp has been mentioning. Why should not local authorities
have the choice? Why should not this Bill not offer an option for
councillors to go back to committees, if that is what they wish to do?
In that way, by allowing that opportunity, you involve all the
councillors, once again, in making a decision about the leadership
arrangements for their council. That might enable negotiation to take
place on the sort of powers that they might have.</div>
					<a name="0701312000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore, I would submit that
it is very easy for the leadership to say, &#147;This works for us;
it is new; we can find lots of ways in which they can be involved in
their wards and that will keep them all busy&#148; and all that sort
of thing. However, they do not want that. They want to be, as
Councillor Kemp said, in the loop. Why should we not simply offer them
the additional option of being in the loop through this Bill? Would you

						</i> I would not. That is because I base
my view on my experience, not as a leader of a committee chair but as a
back bencher. It was my time on the back benches, which was a very
small period in my length of service on the council, that persuaded me
that the committee system really did not deliver for back-bench
members. I think that the present system&#151; 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column20" />Column number: 21</div>for all the dissatisfaction among old hands like me, although in this
case, I do not share it&#151;is a better system. In my view, it
promotes greater accountability of the leadership of local authorities
to their communities. It would not be desirable to seek to overturn
those changes, but rather to strengthen the scrutiny side and make that
work better. However, I am not sure that the association has a view on
that, so that is my personal

sub-committees reporting to two lots of committees who in turn reported
to human resources and policy and finance. If one of them did not like
anything, they went back to the task group to start again. I do not
think that anyone pines for that system, but an enhanced committee
system, based on the experience that we have now, would be possible.

						</b> Which parish councils should be eligible to receive
the power to promote well-being? You said that you want to be involved
in deciding the criteria. Have you discussed that with the Government?
While we are on the subject of parishes and devolved powers, my own
researches with the parish councils in my constituency reveal mixed
opinions. A number of councils are keen to take on extra powers, but
they are all worried about more pressure being put on them. Cardington
parish council says, &#147;concern was also expressed that at this
time it is already difficult to get people willing to volunteer to
become parish councillors&#148; due to &#147;the volume of
consultation documents received for comments&#148;. Stevington parish
council said, &#147;we foresee difficulty in encouraging residents to
stand for the parish council in the future if the role becomes more
onerous.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0701312000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
a genuinely difficult to balance to strike, and I am not sure how far
things should go. What is your feeling about the capacity and
willingness of parish councils to take more on, not only in relation to
well-being but on devolution of powers generally? Are we achieving the
right balance, or should there be flexibility, so that not too much is
placed on the shoulders of the extraordinary people who serve on parish
councils?</div>

						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								Richard
Kemp:

						</i> We support the proposals in the Bill, because
we believe that the Bill is enabling, rather than mandatory. I am sure
that there are parish councils that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column22" />Column number: 23</div>are up for it and capable of moving forward. It is a great exercise in
democracy. Elections are not held in some half of parish councils in
the country, and at any one time there is a considerable number of
vacancies that are filled by co-option. On the one hand there are the
types of parish council that you have described. On the other hand
there are those of the type adjacent to Mr. Benton&#146;s
constituency, in Maghull, which now represents a very big urban area. I
think that there are some 40,000 electors there, and the budget is
&#163;3 million. That parish is probably up to the challenge of
dealing with its well-being issues, but we must distinguish between the
two types.</div>
					<a name="0701312000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">In my own
city of Liverpool there are no parish councils, but that does not mean
that a lot is not done at the equivalent of parish level. For example,
we run&#151;through the Government&#151;a &#147;new deal for
communities&#148; programme, and that will continue. There are no
tax-raising powers, however, and nor would they be wanted. There are no
parish councils in wards such as my own, which is a middle-class ward
with very few problems, but we do have a neighbourhood management
system that enables local decision making to occur at the lowest
possible level, in the hands of staff who work with front-line
councillors. </div>
					<a name="0701312000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is
no simple answer. We should examine localised arrangements that work
across the spectrum of different neighbourhoods and localities. We
support the Bill in so far as it is enabling, but we recognise that
there are other mechanisms for public involvement, public consultation
and public decision making which already exist in different parts of
the country. Indeed, within some cities there may be different
mechanisms applying in different parts, depending on the opportunities
in the relevant

anywhere. My gut feeling, knowing cities better than rural areas, is
that if there is a move toward parish councils it is more likely to
come in middle-class areas than in the Toxteths and Vauxhalls of this
world. It is already a problem that we have to deal with. There are a
number of groups that claim to be representative in any one area.
Residents&#146; associations can claim to be representative despite
representing, say, the six people who turn up to the annual meeting or
the seven people in total who support the association. The issue would
enter a new dimension if there were a statutory parish council,
however.</div>
					<a name="0701312000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">If there is a
desire in any area for a parish council, the question will be how we,

for local people, the fault would be partly ours, collectively, rather
than of any particular local government system. That can be said to
some extent of principal councils in which the BNP has already

						</i> There are concerns on the issue,
particularly in London, where the proposal to permit parishing and
reinvent the Victorian vestries has less than enthusiastic agreement,
as I think Simon will confirm, from most of London local government.
That is partly for the reasons that Ms Seabeck mentioned. However, I
understand that the Bill contains provision for review of community
governance and for the principal authority, if need be, to create a
parish council or indeed to remove it once it is introduced. That might
be some safeguard, but there is another issue, particularly in larger
urban areas, of the volatility of the population. It is one thing to
have a settled community with a representative body at the parish or
community level; it is another where you have a large population
turnover, as in London or the core of great conurbations, where there
is not that stability and where the concept of a small local
representative body is perhaps less
persuasive.</div>

Levitt:
						</b> Parts 4 and 5 of the Bill are quite closely
related. The Government have spoken on many occasions of parish
councils&#146; potential to give people a stronger voice, greater
citizen engagement and so on, notwithstanding the failings to which
Councillor Kemp drew our attention just now. Bearing that in mind, do
you think that the process of parishing encourages the development of
sustainable local area agreements and roles for parishes within them?
Conversely, should local area agreements and their needs be taken into
account when considering whether to parish an
area?</div>

Kemp:
							</b>
						</i> If I looked at an LSP and LAA and saw that all
the people, the chief executives and the leaders had signed up to
something, at city level in my case, and could not work out that in the
neighbourhoods they were delivering&#151;in a different way, jointly
and together&#151;agreed neighbourhood objectives that followed from
the big principles, I would be extremely worried about that. The
question is not whether cohesion from the LAA should take place at the
lowest possible level, particularly in areas of greater stress; it
should. The question is what governance mechanisms are required for
that. The governance mechanism might well be a parish council, but I
can think of four or five others that would be better or at least as
adequate.</div>
					<a name="0701312000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">We must not
confuse governance and delivery. Perhaps one of the most important
things that we do as councillors is to devolve to our local area
managers the ability to manage jointly with other managers at that
level. That is certainly what happens in my ward, where we
have no governance mechanisms for dealing with the
neighbourhood management agenda. In Liverpool 8, we have
governance mechanisms, because we are reshaping the neighbourhood
there. I do not think that the precise structure matters too much. The
principle is that the LAA works only if it is working together in the
areas of most
stress.</div>

						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								Sir
Simon Milton:
							</b>
						</i> I strongly endorse that by reference to
my own council, which has an LAA highly regarded by our Government
office. We have explicitly local neighbourhood arrangements through our
local area renewal partnerships. They tend to be in the deprived parts
of the borough. We have a very polarised city, and very wealthy wards
as well as the most deprived in London are in Westminster. We need 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column24" />Column number: 25</div>to ensure that our local area agreements are expressed at a local level.
Otherwise, they are not really worth having, because they are not going
to get the outcomes that we desire.</div>
					<a name="0701312000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a danger of getting too
hung up about the mechanics. Councils will make it happen in their
areas based on local knowledge, local traditions and local people. We
have neighbourhood arrangements in six areas, but we do not have them
in the other 14 wards of Westminster, because they are not needed. That
is where we have different mechanisms to ensure that we are engaging
with local people. In those six areas, we now have elected
neighbourhood forums. For one of them, the turnout was equivalent to
the turnout for ward council elections. People are getting involved and
taking them
seriously.</div>

							<b class="B">Tom
Brake</b> (Carshalton and Wallington) (LD): There is a welcome
focus in the Bill on LAAs and partnership issues. Possibly less well
covered are the proposed designated targets for LAAs. You suggested a
specific upper limit, and I am wondering what it might be. What is a
manageable number of targets with which to work, and what sort of
issues would they
cover?</div>
					<a name="0701312000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								Sir
Simon Milton:
							</b>
						</i> The Bill is a very welcome step, and we
have been working closely with Government for some time in discussing
what we wanted to see. Essentially, the LGA started out wanting 30
national outcomes, with a significantly reduced number of targets to
govern those. We have ended up slightly higher than 30 and the number
of targets has come down from some 1,200 to 200, so we are pleased with
that and would welcome
it.</div>
					<a name="0701312000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our concerns over
making LAAs work were always going be centred around two things: first,
the performance management framework, which is about the targets. We
would like to see an upper limit expressed in the Bill, because there
is a tendency, we suspect, despite the best wishes of Ministers at the
Department for Communities and Local Government, to have target-creep
over time. Therefore, we would rather have an upper limit in the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="0701312000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, the
other thing that was very important to us was the duty to co-operate.
There is one area in which the Bill has gone backwards from our
understanding of the White Paper, in that local area agreements were
originally conceived as an agreement between centre and local&#151;a
partnership between the two. However, in the Bill it is expressed
differently, whereby the agreement is between the council and its local
partners, and central Government becomes the approver of our agreement,
rather than a partner to it. It is more than a semantic point. One
thing that we have been concerned about throughout is ensuring that the
big spending Departments are tied into the whole agreement process,
from target setting to providing the powers, freedoms and flexibilities
to enable us to meet stretch targets and perform better. We are worried
that the way the relationship is now expressed moves Government on to a
different level from local government. That is not what was in the
White Paper.</div>

have always seen their role, as Simon has described it, as being full
partners in a process that engages both sides working towards agreed
goals, rather than one signing off the other. But the Bill does not
reflect that. That is, presumably, accidental, but it would be helpful
if it were looked at

								Sir

						</i> There is another specific point I
should like to make, if I may, while we are speaking about partners and
the duty to co-operate. Again, some partners that we were expecting to
see listed as part of the duty to co-operate have not been listed. I
understand that, for example, NHS foundation health trusts were
omitted, possibly in error, but we would welcome hearing some
reassurance about that. But there are also some other names missing
that I would like to suggest your Committee considers. For example, in
London the Metropolitan Police Authority and the London Fire and
Emergency Planning Authority are part of the partnership and are
expected to co-operate, but Transport for London and the GLA are not. I
think that that was probably an oversight, but we would welcome your
looking at that.</div>
					<a name="0701312000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will
you also look at whether registered social landlords should be included
in the duty to co-operate, because they can be important? I have 50
RSLs operating in my borough and being able to co-ordinate all their
activities around sustainable communities issues is important. We hope
that those bodies will co-operate voluntarily, but if there is a duty
to co-operate on all the other partners and agencies, we do not see a
good reason why they should be
excluded.</div>

capacity with the partners who are supposed to co-operate with it. We
spoke before about some of the capacity-building issues for councillors
but, as it happens, I chair a housing association. When we are checked
for governance, we are not checked for how we are good partners. We are
not checked for our understanding of the strategic housing role of the
local authority. There is no training programme for members of PCT
boards or RSL boards to enable us to be good partners to the local
authority. Having the means to do it is one thing, but having the will
to do it is another and there certainly needs to be capacity building
around all the parts of government that are supposed to come into the

complaints with which I deal in my ward are jointly for the police and

In many ways, we are not talking about a new

councillor&#151;I see from your biographies that many of you
have&#151;will know, when someone comes to your advice centre, they
expect you to deal with matters. The fact is that you have only powers

want to shoo it down another route. I hope that that is short-term

place and the police work very closely with the ward councillors but,
under the next area commander, they do not. This is really a help and I
would not over-regulate it. If there are problems, one hopes there is

consultation process, to which this might be a final end. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column29" />Column number: 30</div>You referred to the pathfinder consultation. That did not take place
over six or 12 months; it took place over four years. There was meeting
after meeting; people were visited in their own homes; there was
consultation about the area; and there was consultation about the
individual. Then, at the end of it, 80 per cent. of the people in the
area supported the proposals and 20 per cent. did not. Nothing is going
to change that.</div>
					<a name="0701312000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">If as
you are suggesting the 20 per cent. believe that they can be
re-empowered for the executive to take different decisions after a
strong period of such consultation, they will be wrong. But there are
places where consultation from both central and local government is
fatuous and where people consult when they have already taken a
decision, so there needs to be a further safeguard and a check on the
process. We need to consider what we mean by consultation, how we do it
and particularly how we get information on day-to-day services. We
still go out and consult on whether people would like their area to be
clean or dirty, and then we are surprised that they say, &#147;Oh,
we&#146;d absolutely like this area to be clean please&#148;. I am
afraid that that sounds fatuous, but it happens in some of the

								Sir Simon

						</i> The reality is that, as with everything else,
there is a variance between councils and authorities about how well
they conduct consultations. If everyone accepts that we are never going
to please everyone, someone is ultimately going to have to make a
decision and some people will have to be disappointed. What is
important is that people feel that they have been able to have their
say and to influence things. MORI carries out interesting research on
behalf of the Government when it asks people to what extent they feel
that they are able to have their voices heard, to what extent they are
able to influence decisions and whether they want more influence over
decisions.</div>
					<a name="0701312000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again there
is a variance in pattern. In my authority, I look for the results
because I am looking to hear that people feel they can influence things
and they do not feel that they want more power. That is generally the
result that is obtained, but it varies between authorities. Within
local government, part of the raising-our-game requirement is about
trying to raise the quality of consultation of the least good to the
levels of those who do it well. There are some councils around the
country of all political persuasions who consult effectively.</div>

Clause 131 allows councillors to be suspended for actions taken in
their private lives as well as their public lives and moves the law
back to perhaps where people thought it was. What impact will that have
on people seeking a hold in public office?</div>

						</i> I do not think that this is a major issue
for people seeking public office. Some of those who attain public
office have had unfortunate experiences, to put it mildly. I do not
detect any concerns among those aspiring to office. The Bill&#146;s
main thrust in repatriating decisions to a local level rather than
leaving them as they have been with the Standards Board is to be
welcomed. It is better that most of those matters are dealt with at
local level. Recent Standards Board decisions confirm the desirability
of that.</div>

the codes. I go to some places and I see decisions made that I think
are just about officers trying to keep members quiet, particularly in
planning matters. I think that you should not be able to be a
monitoring officer unless you have a qualification and been on a
course. Similar advice should be given to planning officers who give
quite arbitrary rulings in many
cases.</div>

Burt:
						</b> We did not want you to feel that we were completely
missing out the issues relating to inspection and audits. There was
just an oversight as we went through the questions earlier. This whole
business about the extraordinarily rigorous auditing of councils has
come up again and again over many years as a source of frustration from
local authorities. The LGA makes a specific request in terms of
inspection 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column31" />Column number: 32</div>and audit, in which it says that it would &#147;would have preferred a
more forward looking approach with the Audit Commission working with
the other inspectorates to set out a forward programme of inspections
for a locality over a two to three year
period.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0701312000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">With
all the pressures upon you, do you think a chance is being missed to
relieve you and those who work in local government of some of these
pressures and to get this on to some sort of sensible basis so that
they can get on with their job of providing services to the public
without being over-regulated to
death?</div>
					<a name="0701312000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								Sir
Simon Milton:
							</b>
						</i> Our starting point has been that the
regulation of local councils costs Government around &#163;2.5
billion&#151;a massive cost, and much of that is over-burdensome,
collecting information for no particular purpose. The Government have
recognised that and wish to move away from that, which we
welcome.</div>
					<a name="0701312000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">The thing that
councils find particularly irksome, or have done, is when a number of
different inspectorates all want to come and inspect the council and to
inspect it to quite ridiculous degrees. For example, in services that
are not high risk, this results in 10 or 12 inspectors coming in and
looking at something like the library service or adult learning. That
does not seem proportionate.</div>
					<a name="0701312000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore we wanted two things.
We wanted more proportionate inspection, but also better co-ordinated
inspection and a gatekeeper who would control and hold back the other
inspectorates. The Audit Commission has been identified in the Bill as
that key gatekeeper, which we welcome. We want to make sure that it is
not just a traffic controller, in terms of waving in the different
inspectorates, but actually forms a view as to what is needed and that
unnecessary inspection of services that are not high risk does not take
place and, moreover, that there is not a high price of
failure.</div>
					<a name="0701312000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clearly, some
services should be inspected rigorously and regularly&#151;those to
do with child protection, vulnerable adults and so on. However, many
other services that have been subject to inspection in the past do not
need it. We welcome a more risk-based proportionate approach and want
to ensure that the Audit Commission has the necessary teeth to say to
the other inspectorates, &#147;No, it is not appropriate or necessary
for you to go into that local
authority.&#148;</div>

							<a name="0701312000172"></a>Patrick
Hall:
						</b> The LGA has welcomed what the Government have said
on local involvement networks coming under the umbrella of local
government. I have three questions on the matter.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column32" />Column number: 33</div>
					<a name="0701312000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">My first question concerns the
requirement for councils to contract with a host organisation and to
set up the LINK within its territory. There will be 152 such
organisations, so I should like to ask whether you have considered
that. I guess that there will not necessarily be 152 organisations
ready to act as hosts to contract with local councils to set up
separate LINKs. There may well be national or regional organisations
that councils will find it convenient to go to. How do you think the
local and particular characteristics of the different councils will be
reflected and guaranteed in a system that may use an organisation that
lays down a national or a standard model to set up LINKs? The
Government do not want to prescribe in detail what the LINKs should be
like; they want to allow them to develop according to local conditions.
Local government will be quite keen to see that happen, but how will it
happen through the contracting method that has been
suggested?</div>
					<a name="0701312000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, a
question that members of patients forums have raised a great deal with
regard to a new system is: how would one guarantee the independence of
the LINK, if it is part of local government? How could one ensure that
LINKs will not be captured by a political group, or be unduly
influenced by the senior officers of the
council?</div>
					<a name="0701312000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">Lastly, LINKs
are trying to do something that we have not really attempted before in
this country. The idea is to try to reach out to the tens of thousands
of individuals who are not the sort of people who volunteer to be on
committees. That is a challenging task indeed. If we are to achieve
that through LINKs, how do you think local government can assist and
what level of resources will be
required?</div>
					<a name="0701312000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								Richard
Kemp:
							</b>
						</i> You enter into difficult ground for us to deal
with, because we are dealing with an entirely new system. We start off,
however, from an assumption that we welcome LINKs, because we are aware
that there is a democratic deficit in the current system. For example,
research has been conducted recently about the number of people who
have gone on to the electoral register for foundation hospitals, how
many voted, the quality of the people who stood. It was not an exercise
in democracy, perhaps for the reasons that you just
mentioned.</div>
					<a name="0701312000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">We support
the concept of LINKs in the context of the wider discussions that we
have been having about, for example, overview and scrutiny, and the
effective scrutiny of the health service. Clearly, a local authority
that does not have the general power of health well-being, which was in
White Paper but has not been contained in the Bill&#151;we would
regret that and think it an opportunity missed&#151;will not be as
powerful as it otherwise could
be.</div>
					<a name="0701312000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">The local authority
and the LINKs must work together. That is one way to answer your
question. To look at some of the existing mechanisms, by itself a
patients forum will tend to deal with narrow interests and with
particular diseases, illnesses and problems. I think that it is the
role of the local authority to help the LINKs to shape the debate, so
that people who have a genuine grievance with a part of the health
service can
						<div class="Column"><a name="Column33" />Column number: 34</div>relate that problem to the wider problems of the health service. That is
where there must be the link between the LINKs and the local authority,
in looking at the well-being picture and the overview. However, these
are early days. We would look for more guidance, and we have offered to
contribute to that, to deal with some of the
problems.</div>

						</b>
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0701312000173"></a>Alistair
Burt:
						</b> Is not what you have just mentioned the whole point?
Is it not the awkwardness of some people on patients forum, their
doggedness in picking up a single issue and running with it, that can
make change and make things happen? Surely what you have described is
part of a centralising process to diminish criticism&#151;to make
sure that the problem is always seen in a wider context, as part of a
whole, so that one can say to someone, &#147;You must understand
this, that and the other.&#148; That the way to patronise a
complainant and make sure that they do not stick with their concerns or
get support. Is that not part of the process that we are seeing? Again,
because of your conflicted responsibilities here, you will not see it
the way patients do, which is why their independence should be
protected. The measure is not a clever move for patients and their
concerns, but it will help administration enormously.</div>

						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								Richard
Kemp:
							</b>
						</i> You underrate the willingness of the council to
scrutinise service delivery effectively. There are some very good
examples of local government scrutiny of the health service. If a
individual has a problem, and that problem is linked to the oncology
department of the hospital, and that department is not doing things
right, it is entirely proper that a council or the LINKs should deal
with it as an individual issue. The attempt to bring issues together is
an attempt to sidetrack not those people who have a rightful case, but
people who can be obsessive about their individual case to the
detriment of all others. However, the change should not stop genuine
problems being dealt with effectively, even at a micro level.</div>

						</i> I would not dismiss what Mr. Burt
says&#151;he raises a real point. From my personal experience, some
of the most dogged monitors of the performance of local hospitals are
local councillors. Back-bench councillors are the ones who really get
the bit between their teeth, who will nag away on an issue. I do not
think that that would not be done effectively under the new system, but
I think that Mr. Burt raised an important
point.</div>

relationship between local authorities and health bodies where services
are delivered within a local authority area. Do you anticipate that
LINKs would also work with acute trusts that are based outside a local
authority area but serve people within that area? Does that not make
for a potentially very complex 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column34" />Column number: 35</div>relationship in which hospitals would relate to many local authorities

a children&#146;s hospital, 95 per cent. of whose work is done for
two or three local councils, but in some very acute cases people are
helicoptered in from, say, Carlisle. Local government is used to
working across boundaries. When we scrutinise the police service, which
operates across five boundaries, we usually look at its local,
neighbourhood or city operations. I do not see that as a big problem.
If Carlisle really had a problem with the way in which people are
treated, it could easily get in touch with Liverpool, Sefton or
Knowsley councils or another host council. There are complexities, but
