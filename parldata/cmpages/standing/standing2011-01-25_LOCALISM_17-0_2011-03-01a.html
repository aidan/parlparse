                           </span> As I made clear in
our last debate, in this group of amendments, we are returning to a
common theme for this part of the Bill: the democratic legitimacy of
the process through which neighbourhood plans and neighbourhood
development orders are made. It is perhaps important for me to start by
once again strongly restating our support for the principle of
neighbourhood planning. We welcome any proposals that genuinely
increase local participation in the shaping of communities. However, we
have very real concerns about the representative nature and democratic
legitimacy of the framework presented in the Bill. We also have real
concerns about the economic and social ramifications of the proposals.
I will touch on the ramifications when I speak to amendment 142, which
is on the equality duty, and if the Chair permits, I will return to the
issues in the clause stand part
debate.<a class="bkMark" name="11030140000065">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Along
with many of the organisations that gave oral evidence and that we have
met, we believe that the Government are creating a two-tier planning
system at the local level, economically, socially and democratically.
We do not believe that our amendments would solve the problems that I
will raise, but they would improve the Bill. We would impress on the
Government that a better way of proceeding would be for Ministers to go
away and rethink the proposals in their
entirety.<a class="bkMark" name="11030140000066">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendments
137 to 139 would improve the democratic legitimacy of the
Government’s proposed neighbourhood forums. We want the number
of citizens required to constitute a neighbourhood forum to be
increased from three to 20, and we want a requirement for at least one
of those citizens to be an elected councillor. Amendment 142 would
apply the Equality Act 2010 to neighbourhood forums. Amendments 191 to
193 would ensure that local authorities were able to rule on the
appropriateness of a local area for neighbourhood forums and on the
appropriateness of the forums
themselves.<a class="bkMark" name="11030140000067">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
cannot have escaped the Government’s notice that their proposals
will create significantly different systems in different parts of the
country. There is no intrinsic problem with such flexibility in the
creation of different systems, provided that they pass certain
fundamental tests. Do the proposals create systems that are genuinely
representative, that are transparent and open, that are accountable to
the community in which they are based, that are financially accountable
and that allow equal access, regardless of background, geography or
resources, whether financial or otherwise? On all counts, the proposals
do not meet any of those tests.<a class="bkMark" name="11030140000068">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">It is clear to
us, having analysed the proposals and having heard the evidence
presented to the Committee by a wide range of organisations, that the
proposals risk being fundamentally unfair. The proposals will create a
two-tier system in more ways than one. There will be a two-tier system
for parish councils and neighbourhood forums. There will also be a
two-tier system for those who have the resources and skills required to
access the system, and those who do
not.<a class="bkMark" name="11030140000069">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
proposals outlined in the Bill will create a Rolls-Royce system, which
is fine for those who can afford it. The Government launched the Bill
with a fanfare of rhetoric about empowering communities and giving
power away. I look forward to hearing from the Minister how the
bureaucratic, complex and fundamentally undemocratic neighbourhood
planning processes will empower communities in the way that has been
suggested.<a class="bkMark" name="11030140000070">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I will expand
on our concern about there being a two-tier system for parish councils
and neighbourhood forums. Parish councils have the advantage of a
statutory framework; they have the ability to raise their own money
through the precept; and they have legal and other advice through the
National Association of Local Councils and the county association. The
neighbourhood forums will not benefit from any of those. Parish
councils also benefit from elections every four years. While in some
cases they are moribund, they at least benefit from a democratic
framework. They have democratic legitimacy. Under the proposals,
neighbourhood forums will have no democratic legitimacy.<a class="bkMark" name="11030140000071">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Dr Hugh Ellis
of the Town and Country Planning Association told us in the evidence
sessions:<a class="bkMark" name="11030140000072">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“It
is very difficult to see how the neighbourhood forum in urban areas
passes the test of individuals being democratically accountable, or
being placed under any requirement to disclose particular interests
that might be driving their issues. That means that there is a
particular danger that the process is open to abuse. It means that in
rural areas, at least, there is a lower form of local government at
work, and that seems like a sensible unit. In urban areas, I really
think that has to change.”<em>––</em>[<em>Official

‘No, that is not a sensible planning unit. It should encompass
that area.’ Similarly, we have worries about the low level.

result of the proposals would be that the 35% of the population who
live in areas with a parish council would benefit from one system, and
the majority of people—mainly, but not exclusively, in urban
areas—will be faced with a system that is completely deficient.

                        <p class="tabbed">Our
amendments seek to address the clear democratic deficit that arises
from the proposals in the Bill. Under the current proposals,
neighbourhood forums can constitute just three people. We do not wish
to impose unreasonable restrictions on local communities getting
involved in the neighbourhood planning process, but that is simply too
low. It permits three men or women and a dog to get together in the Dog
and Duck and constitute themselves as a neighbourhood forum.<a class="bkMark" name="11030140000077">&#160;</a>

Government to these proposals—the Dog and Duck proposals, as
they will henceforth be known. The Minister of State has, in his
Tunbridge Wells constituency, a Dog and Duck at 8 Goods Station road. I
do not know whether it is appropriate to plug a pub in Parliament, but
apparently it is in “The Good Pub Guide”. I am sure the
hon. Member for Henley regularly frequents the Dog and Duck in
Highmoor, Henley-on-Thames. I am sure that the hon. Member for North
Herefordshire is a regular drinker at the Dog and Duck, White House

proposed arrangements to have legitimacy, they have to be seen
genuinely to engage all sections of society. It cannot be right to have
exclusion from participation as a consequence of gender, ethnicity or
class. What will the Government do about that? Will they, as we believe
is appropriate, apply the Equality Act 2010 to neighbourhood forums? We
very much hope that Ministers will join us in saying that if
neighbourhood forums are to be legitimate, they have to be truly
representative of all sections of

illustrates the absurdity of the proposals. Where does it end? One
could envisage Del Boy and Rodney sitting in the Nag’s Head when
that pillar of Peckham society, Trigger, comes in and says,
“’Ere, Del, I hear that if the three of us get together
we could form the Peckham neighbourhood forum.” I suspect that
Del’s initial reaction would be to say, “Rodney, Trigger,
you plonkers. No one could be that daft.” Actually, somebody is
proposing the capacity for a Peckham neighbourhood forum with Trigger
at its heart. We propose a higher trigger of at least 20 people. For
all the reasons that have been rehearsed, we believe that that would be
a useful first step towards greater
legitimacy.<a class="bkMark" name="11030140000086">&#160;</a>

serious questions remain, however, regarding representation and

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendments
191 and 193 would empower local authorities to apply common sense to
the neighbourhood forums. Some urban areas such as London do not have a
parish council structure that clearly delineates the size of a
neighbourhood area. Under the proposals, any request by a neighbourhood
forum to designate an area as a neighbourhood area must be accepted by
a local authority. That means that areas covered by neighbourhood plans
might have disproportionate variation in size, with a knock-on increase
in the costs borne by local authorities. Our amendments would allow the
local authority to choose between the competing groups that may submit
applications to become neighbourhood forums.<a class="bkMark" name="11030140000089">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendments will not stand in the way of greater engagement of local
communities in the planning process, and they will not codify in law a
minimum size of neighbourhood area; for example, they will not say that
a ward area is the minimum size. Local authorities must surely have the
power reasonably to refuse to designate a neighbourhood area as such if
there is significant conflict with local development plans or the
practicalities of local ward structures. The amendments seek to provide
the opportunity for reasonable consideration by the local authority,
protecting it from undue cost burdens without putting in place
prescriptive legislation that might be contrary to the spirit of
localism.<a class="bkMark" name="11030140000090">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendments would also provide a safeguard, of which there are few in
the Bill, against neighbourhood forums that are no longer fit for
purpose or that have become dominated by an unrepresentative group of
individuals. Amendment 192 would create a provision for local
authorities to investigate the governance arrangements of neighbourhood
forums that they believed had become dysfunctional, and to disband them
if the local authority is satisfied that the forum is no longer fit for
purpose. Of course, a local authority would have to act reasonably in
discharging that duty.<a class="bkMark" name="11030140000091">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The other
amendment in the group would apply the Equality Act 2010 to
neighbourhood forums. The Government claim that the Bill will provide
bottom-up power, but the proposals risk excluding members of the
community who may, for a number of social and economic reasons, be
unable to engage in a time-consuming and often technical process. The
Bill risks increasing environmental injustice, because those who can
afford to plan are able to improve and safeguard their environment, and
those who are unable to pay may suffer increased bad neighbour
developments. Let me give an example of what might happen: the
replacement of a historical market with a supermarket and luxury tower
block housing. There may be a loss of cultural amenity, a loss of
access to affordable food, a loss of stallholders’ businesses
and an increase in property prices. That would have a negative impact
on poorer members of the community and could not be said to further
their economic and social
well-being.<a class="bkMark" name="11030140000092">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Let
me give a second example. A wealthy area puts together a neighbourhood
plan or neighbourhood development order, while a neighbouring area
cannot afford to plan. The result would be increased bad neighbour
developments in the area without a neighbourhood plan. The fact that
the Government have failed to apply the Equality Act 2010 to
neighbourhood forums, which would protect minority and disadvantaged
communities, symbolises the lack of thinking that has gone into the
design of the neighbourhood planning
process.<a class="bkMark" name="11030140000093">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">What
do we know about that process? Problem one: there will be a clear
democratic deficit. According to the 2001 census, the population of
England is some 49 million people. Neighbourhood forums will
cover 65% of that population, which is nearly 32 million people. In
their impact assessment, the Government estimate that there are 7,618
neighbourhoods. In each one, there could be only three people
representing the community. That means that in each neighbourhood,
three unelected people could be making decisions for more than 4,200
members of the community. That is not democracy. Parish councils are a
vast improvement on those arrangements, but there are also problems
about how representative they
are.<a class="bkMark" name="11030140000094">&#160;</a>

coming to a point that I am greatly concerned about in my locality. In
the borough of Gateshead, we had one parish council and one town

ago, however, the town council had a referendum and abolished itself.
It did not want to pay the additional precept and could not understand
what it was for in that context. The parish council, which is in the

remains.<a class="bkMark" name="11030140000095">&#160;</a>

a few pubs in my constituency where having two ears is out of the
ordinary. There are 22 wards, 10 of which are in my constituency, and
we have determined that the borough of Gateshead has 46 or
47 neighbourhood management areas, based on trying to draw communities
together to create a useful area. They are not, however, the same as
the Office for National Statistics super-output areas, for example, so
it is difficult to see how those particular configurations are going to
work in the

councils are a vast improvement, but there are problems of how
representative they are. I am grateful to the Minister of State,
Department for Communities and Local Government for his letter, which
informs me that the Government have provided information, as requested,
but they have not made any assessment of current participation in
parish councils. He has, however, provided me with some historical
information—I thought that only I was interested in history.
That information does not quite stretch back to the Greeks and Romans,
but it tells us that from 1987 to 1990, 56% of seats were uncontested
and 18% of parish councils did not have sufficient candidates. That is
a clear sign that the valuable role of parish councils needs to be
promoted, so it is a shame that the Government have decided to repeal
the duty to promote democracy.<a class="bkMark" name="11030140000098">&#160;</a>

the proposals will empower the few with deep pockets and loud voices,
and they run the risk of abandoning whole communities. According to the
Government’s impact assessment, neighbourhood plans will cost
“as little as £17,000”. I hardly think that
£17,000 can be described as a little sum of money, but the
assessment also suggests that they could cost up to £200,000.
How will deprived communities, such as those in my constituency of
Erdington, be able to afford £200,000? The short answer is that
they will not.<a class="bkMark" name="11030140000099">&#160;</a>

not accept the amendments, but only if they then told the Committee
that they will go away and fundamentally rethink their proposals. The
proposals should empower the many, not the few, and they should
increase democracy, not undermine it. If Ministers will not agree to a
fundamental rethink, the amendments are essential for us to make sense
of what is a dog’s breakfast—if the Committee will excuse
that rather bad pun.<a class="bkMark" name="11030140000105">&#160;</a>

those points and the fact that we might see narrow sectional interests
skewing the making of neighbourhood plans. I will not repeat those

housing development and economic regeneration in Lewisham, I did not
closet myself away in the town hall; I spent hours and hours in
community centres, in church halls and out on the pavement talking to
people about the sort of place they would like their area to be. I
listened to what people were saying, and I responded, whether it was by
persuading the council to find money to produce supplementary planning
guidance for an area where there was a particular concern, or by
finding innovative ways to consult local people on the core strategy in
Lewisham’s local development framework. I have made the case for
unpopular housing developments, I have made the case for an unpopular
homeless hostel, I have made the case for a new Gypsy and Traveller
site, and I have the scars. After a couple of years of making such
cases in Lewisham, and arguing with members of the community about the
positives and the negatives, I can tell hon. Members that standing up

stymie large-scale developments. I am concerned that they will stoke up
huge expectations about stopping development, and I am concerned that
the Bill signals the death knell for any form of small infill

space and a new home for the City mission. It is one of two or three
large-scale developments at varying stages of completion in the town
centre. People who live within five minutes’ walking distance of

would. They would not be living in the so-called neighbourhood. It
depends how “neighbourhood” is defined; we come back to
the problem we talked about earlier. However, as I have said before,
they have other things to do. They are living their lives: going to
work or picking up their kids from school. The football or

understand that that is the case, but is it not completely
disempowering for that community? Those people would look at the
proposals and say, “Okay. We’re a group of people who
want to get together to form a neighbourhood plan,” and they
follow that process. At the moment, in the Bill as drafted, the council
is not even involved in the neighbourhood forum, so they need to pay
someone, or to do the research themselves, which involves going online
and finding out what the core strategy says for their particular area,
and busily get on with defining the vision for their core area. Then
somebody might say to them, “Sorry. That doesn’t conform
to the strategic level plans. It’s not going to happen.”
Some of those core strategies and local development plans already
exist, and we are going to see more conflict, not collaboration, built

the largest disused site on the River Thames. It is a 40-acre site,
which was used by News International to store newsprint. It is now
owned by Hutchison Whampoa and stands completely empty apart from the
derelict buildings. There is no other site in the London borough of
Lewisham that comes close to it in size. Is it right that some people
in the local neighbourhood could hold the wider area to ransom by
saying that they want only a certain type of development in that
location, when the wider interest may be better served by something
else? In developing a neighbourhood plan, is it right that individuals
could spread a huge amount of misinformation about what is and is not
possible on the site and what is and is not needed to meet the economic
and social needs of that corner of south-east London? Where do the
discussions about commercial viability take place? It is all very well
for the community to say, “No. We don’t want 3,000 new
homes. We don’t want 30-storey tower blocks,” What
happens when the owner of the land says, “We paid x million
pounds for it, and for us to make any profit, we need to realise y
million pounds from property sales”? Does the site simply remain
derelict?<a class="bkMark" name="11030140000132">&#160;</a>

asset of community value—perhaps the proposed scheme is not
popular with local people—will that have any impact on the
planning process? Will it be deemed a material consideration?<a class="bkMark" name="11030140000133">&#160;</a>

Committee’s advice and suggestions on all these planning
measures. We have proceeded, as we ought to do on planning issues, by
trying to find a way that makes the best of a complex and technical
area of policy. The progress we made on regional planning and the duty
to co-operate reflects a maturity of debate that we can build on. The

difference between us on the desirability of the end. The question is
how we can design it in a way that is fit for purpose. Just to
anticipate some later discussions, I note the amendments on the reform
to the major infrastructure planning regime, which are offered in that
same spirit. My response will therefore be consistent with the tone of
his amendments and contributions.<a class="bkMark" name="11030140000141">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The hon.
Gentleman made the point himself that the Opposition’s
amendments do not necessarily address their concerns in totality. Even
if we were to accept them all, they would not address those concerns
perhaps in the way that we did on the duty to co-operate, where we got
a clearer understanding of what was needed. We will reflect seriously
on the measures and the amendments. The hon. Lady also came up with
some suggestions. In general, we will ask the Committee to support our
proposals because they represent a better regime than that in which the
amendments would result. That is not to say that other possible
amendments might not make improvements, but I have not seen
anything—bar one or two exceptions, which I will
mention—that solves hon. Members’ anxieties about the
matter.<a class="bkMark" name="11030140000142">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
essence, it seems to me, is this. When we talk about neighbourhood
planning—we agree that having a possibility for neighbourhoods
to come together to express a plan is desirable—we encounter
what hon. Members have referred to as a two-tier or Rolls-Royce system,
where parts of the country already have democratic arrangements such as
parish councils or town councils in place. I infer from the amendments
a degree of consensus across the Committee that they constitute a
ready-made vehicle for those arrangements to be vested in. The question
that arises is whether we content ourselves with having a two-tier
system and neighbourhood planning arrangements whereby democratic
institutions such as parish or town councils already exist, or whether
we extend the opportunity to have a neighbourhood plan to other parts
of the country. It would have been easier to give those rights only to
parish and town councils, but in doing so we would fall into the trap
that hon. Members have suggested, namely that the provisions would not
cover the whole country. In drafting the provisions, we were determined
to find a way to make neighbourhood planning available in areas that do
not have a pre-existing democratic set of institutions.<a class="bkMark" name="11030140000143">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Once we get
into that discussion, there are two broad possibilities. We could
require those areas without a parish council or a town council to have
one; they would have to go through the process of parishing and set up
a level of local government that would bring them on a par with other
areas of the country. That is a perfectly rigorous and consistent
approach but, as the hon. Member for Gateshead has said, some areas
have consciously decided that they do not want to do that. They are
content with their existing governance arrangements and they do not
want the ongoing expense of a parish council, which other areas quite
legitimately want.<a class="bkMark" name="11030140000144">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">On
reflection, and we thought about it carefully, it seemed to us that
requiring people to have a parish council or a town council in order to
have a neighbourhood plan would constrain them to act in a perverse
way. If all that they want is to come together for the purposes of
adopting a neighbourhood plan without having a permanent set of elected
representatives, it seemed reasonable that they should be able to do so
without adopting that level of local government. If one accepts the
logic of that, it is necessary to have an arrangement in areas that do
not have democratic bottom-tier institutions and that do not want
them—it is, of course, always open to people to follow the
parishing procedures to form a council if they want to—that
allows people locally to come together advisedly to form a
neighbourhood plan.<a class="bkMark" name="11030140000145">&#160;</a>

is an area about which hon. Members have asked many
questions—perfectly reasonably, since this is a new
approach—which were quite appropriate to ensure that we are
doing this in the best possible way for those circumstances. The fact
that the discussion in Committee today has concentrated on
neighbourhood forums suggests that that is the right area of focus, and
that we are concentrating on the area that is new and
innovative.<a class="bkMark" name="11030140000146">&#160;</a>

where—by agreement with the local authority—a local
neighbourhood can form a discussion body to take things forward, some
geographical areas, being relatively small, might be excluded from the

logically be part of one area or another and they might end up being
part of no one’s determination in terms of what happens in the
nearby estates or villages.<a class="bkMark" name="11030140000147">&#160;</a>

                        </strong> I understand the hon. Gentleman’s point. It
illustrates a theme in our drafting of this section of the Bill, which
is not to prescribe from the centre exactly what a neighbourhood should
look like. I was going to say that that was fraught with difficulties,
but it is actually impossible. He is absolutely right that all
neighbourhoods differ, so the only people who can make such an
assessment are those on the ground, who know the natural set of
connections between people locally. It is impossible to design that in
the Bill or to say that every neighbourhood is a local authority ward,
for example, or a county division. That is why we have allowed
flexibility for the determination of what a neighbourhood should be,
and we have given a crucial role to the local authority in determining
that.
<p>The question of whether
a neighbourhood is right for the purposes of a neighbourhood forum is
vested in the local authority. It will have the final decision, and the
Bill refers in various ways to related requirements. It requires that
the local authority has the final say on designating the appropriate
area, which will be subject to criteria for what local authorities
should take into account. Those criteria will be set out and as the
Bill progresses, we will share what we have in mind with Parliament. It
is clear, however, that local planning authorities will have the final
say in designating the areas. That is absolutely right, because such
bodies are the most consistent and democratically accountable
organisations to determine that, and proposed new section 61G to the
Town and Country Planning Act 1990 makes it clear that the
local planning authority has the final say in designating neighbourhood
areas.<a class="bkMark" name="11030140000148">&#160;</a>

                           </div>to co-operate between authorities, which carries over from our earlier
discussions on the duty to co-operate, is adequate to allow an area

powers to local authorities to determine the appropriate designation in
areas where there is no pre-existing democratic body—and bear in
mind that it is always possible for people to go through the parishing
procedures if they want to create one—returns to the question of
what happens if an authority is determined to suppress the aspirations
of a neighbourhood to form in this way, although I hope that that will
be rare. However, some local authorities may want to preserve the
status quo of the local planning authority’s being the sole
arbiter of any neighbourhood decision making and planning matters, and
they may want to thwart our intentions. I have had many discussions
with colleagues of all parties in the Local Government Association, and
I am satisfied that such authorities will be in the minority. Just as
many developers recognise that dealing openly and collaboratively with
communities is good practice, district councillors, borough councillors
and county councillors recognise that taking local people along and
finding ways to involve them is the best way to proceed. Even more than
that, I completely agree with what the hon. Lady said, which is that
one thing that can be said for every area of the country is that there
is an elected councillor or an elected Member of
Parliament.<a class="bkMark" name="11030140000151">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Far
from seeing these arrangements as alternatives to that organisation and
the elected members there, I absolutely share the spirit of some of the
Opposition amendments. We need to ensure—I expect this to be the
case and have told local government audiences this—that the
local member is the lynchpin in putting forward the aspirations of the
people who have, after all, elected them in their ward or division to
produce a neighbourhood plan. It is absolutely essential not only that
they should not be excluded from that, but that they should have a very
prominent role in the process. That is very much our
aspiration.<a class="bkMark" name="11030140000152">&#160;</a>

about how some of the amendments would deal with those aspirations, let
me finish my point about those few—I hope—councils that
might want to use these powers to frustrate the ambitions of a
neighbourhood. It is important that we provide protections in the Bill,
as we have done through the right to challenge, to ensure that if a
neighbourhood forms itself in a reasonable way—it is a
reasonable reflection of its community—and produces a plan that
in due course is examined and found to be responsible, that cannot be
unfairly and arbitrarily frustrated by the local authority. Some of the
provisions require the local authority to act in a reasonable way, and
the guidance that we will produce on the aspects of authorisation that
a local authority gives a neighbourhood will set out what is reasonable
and unreasonable. Our sole purpose is to prevent the abuse of
provisions to frustrate local communities.<a class="bkMark" name="11030140000153">&#160;</a>

us consider some of the amendments. Amendment 137, in the name of the
hon. Member for Worsley and Eccles South and her colleagues, would
restrict the membership of neighbourhood forums, so that they are open
only to those resident in the neighbourhood. That would have the effect
of frustrating what I think is the Committee’s joint ambition
for elected members to play a role in the forums, because many elected
members do not strictly live in the ward that they represent. It is
important that elected members have the right to participate in the
forums. I understand the thought behind the amendment—that the
forums should be genuinely about the neighbourhood, rather than about
people from the other end of the country—but we cannot accept
it, although we will reflect on the thinking behind it. The amendment
would be perverse in its consequences of thwarting the participation of
elected members in that

be helpful. However, how does talking about elected members living
outside the area link to people wanting to live in the area and be part
of the forum? Clearly, thinking is starting to change a bit on how that

                           </strong> We have cast the provision to allow people to
participate without having the rigid delineation of saying that someone
must live in a particular area. People involved in local businesses are
another example of those who would be frustrated by the prescription in
the amendment. As my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon Central
mentioned earlier, if someone is trading in the high street of an area
and they are absolutely part of the community—they are probably
a pillar of the community—it would be against the intentions of
everyone on the Committee for such a trader, who might trade from
particular premises but live in the town next door, to be excluded from
participating in discussions about the production of a neighbourhood
plan that might affect their high street. The intention is to be open
and flexible in who can participate, bearing in mind that neighbourhood
forums will only produce a plan that goes forward to the local
authority. There is no ongoing responsibility for decision making, and
they are not deciding planning applications or anything like that. The
local authority will judge whether the plan is consistent with the
strategic aspects and whether it is sound. The plan will then go to a
referendum of the residents of the area. At that time the residents
will make the decision. There are various stages, so all we are talking
about is access to the discussions that might produce the neighbourhood
plans.<a class="bkMark" name="11030140000158">&#160;</a>

in general, if people want to have those permanent arrangements, it is
good. I should say that one of the possible consequences of people
coming together for the purposes of producing a neighbourhood or
community plan is that they may get the taste for neighbourhood
organisation and then apply to become a parish or town council and to

budget to spend over two years, but not once did a local ward assembly
decide to put together a neighbourhood plan, or to use the money that
was allocated to its area to pay for such a plan. Instead, it was spent
on things such as youth facilities, activities and environmental
improvements. Has the Minister reflected on the immediate concerns of
communities, especially in the current economic climate, and whether,

                           </strong> It is down to them. One of the Bill’s other
features, with which hon. Members will be familiar, is that no
mandatory requirement to have a plan is placed on every neighbourhood.
We could have required a forced parishing of the country and the
adoption of a neighbourhood plan by every area to create a completely
consistent picture, but the hon. Lady makes a good point that some
neighbourhoods may be perfectly content with their existing
arrangements with the local planning authority and would rather do
other things. I do not think that there should be
compulsion.<a class="bkMark" name="11030140000182">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
hope—we will be providing resources for this—that when
people are given the opportunity for the first time to produce a
neighbourhood plan that has force, rather than something that is,
however valuably, an expression of how the community would like its
future to be, that might provide greater interest and opportunity. I
hope that seeing neighbourhoods throughout the country producing plans
that bring the community together and provide a greater sense of what
the future may be will prove infectious. We have received a range of
applications from different parts of the country to pilot the scheme,
and we intend that areas with eager and willing neighbourhoods, as well
as a positive local authority, should be able to get on with this and
learn lessons that they can share with others. We will be absolutely
insistent about ensuring that we have a range of examples, including
some inner-urban areas as well as rural areas, to exemplify
this.<a class="bkMark" name="11030140000183">&#160;</a>

of other powers

142, 191, 192 and 209, which were tabled by the hon. Member for Worsley
and Eccles South and her colleagues, refer to the question of
representativeness and inclusiveness. It is important that our
intention is absolutely clear: neighbourhood forums should be inclusive
and open to all members of the community, and they should demonstrate
that. We will set that out in guidance, which will determine whether a
local authority approves or declines to approve a neighbourhood as
designated. We are absolutely insistent that the local authority will
make that decision.<a class="bkMark" name="11030140000185">&#160;</a>

hon. Member for Birmingham, Erdington—perhaps in the spirit of
his opening remarks—not to press his amendments to a Division.
He will have the opportunity later in the Bill’s passage to
reflect on whether our suggestions meet his purposes. A degree of
volition exists across the Committee to ensure that people are given
the opportunity to have neighbourhood plans. The narrow area that we
are dealing with is the trickiest to get right, as we have no existing
arrangements and are therefore designing something new. We have made a
pretty good job of capturing the essence of a new system, but that is
not to say that tweaks cannot be made. I do not think that the
amendments would quite achieve that, but we have heard some
suggestions.<a class="bkMark" name="11030140000186">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
conclude by referring to one of the points that the hon. Member for
Lewisham East made about safeguards. I hope that I have already assured
her that significant housing and economic developments have to be
consistent with the larger-than-neighbourhood ambitions set out in the
local authority’s plan. It is legitimate to ask whether that
would come as a disappointment to members deep within neighbourhoods
who feel that they have complete carte blanche to say yes or no to
anything that happens in that area. However, it is right that there is
a question of responsibility here and that there is a
larger-than-neighbourhood aspect to planning.<a class="bkMark" name="11030140000187">&#160;</a>

incumbent on all of us, as we explain the provisions to people, who are
intelligent folks, to say, “You have to reflect on the needs of
an area that goes beyond your particular street.” My experience
is that however much people might initially think that it would be nice
to be the complete determinant of everything that happens in their
neighbourhood, they decide on reflection that such safeguards are
necessary. It is up to all of us, as community leaders, to explain the
reason for that, why we need housing and growth, and that these
decisions have to be consistent with the equally democratically
expressed will of their elected local authority representatives who
deal with the local planning authority as a
whole.<a class="bkMark" name="11030140000188">&#160;</a>

he, his colleagues and the Secretary of State are discussing these
proposals, it is their responsibility to consider how realistic the
powers for neighbourhoods will be. Many people in the country believe
that these proposals will give them a huge amount of power to say no to
developments and to housing, so the thoughtful comments that the
Minister has just set out should be conveyed to people when the
proposals are publicly

and outside this House that this is a balanced set of arrangements that
needs properly to reflect the larger-than-local aspect. A system that
did not reflect the different levels of decision making—or
subsidiarity—would not be workable or desirable. That message is
getting out. During the further weeks that the Bill is before the
House, and during the time when these provisions will be enacted and
communicated to people, it is important that people make judgments
about what they will be capable

points about managing expectations made by my hon. Friend the Member
for Lewisham East. There is a real danger that the expectations are
greater than the reality of what is on offer. What is on offer is
important and valuable, but I know from my experience of working with
town and parish councils that they are often frustrated by the process
of giving their views on a planning issue when the views in the
planning authority, which have to take account of a wider set of
circumstances, do not always go with the grain of their opinion. It is
important that expectations are managed, so I welcome the
Minister’s line on
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11030140000191">&#160;</a>

intervention. It is important that we do not manage expectations too
low. This is a step forward compared with what is currently available
to local communities. Parish councils are restricted merely to
commenting on matters before them. They do not have the ability to
produce a plan that becomes part of the local development plan. While
we need to be clear that people cannot make a unilateral declaration of
independence, and that the Tooting popular front will not take over
every aspect of plan making in Tooting, there is nevertheless the
opportunity for people to have much greater expression and be able to
rely on its having greater effect. That balances what we are coming to
in all our discussions about planning in this Committee, and it is
important that we reflect that in the
country.<a class="bkMark" name="11030140000192">&#160;</a>

response. The starting point is: do all parties support the concept of
the neighbourhood plan, and communities being able to engage in a
neighbourhood planning process? My answer is yes, without hesitation.
Do we all agree that there should not be two-tier arrangements to the
disadvantage of so many communities around Britain? I hope we are all
agreed. All communities should be able to benefit from the potential.
We do not want a two-tier system in any sense.<a class="bkMark" name="11030140000193">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The powerful
contribution made by my hon. Friend the Member for Lewisham East should
not be misunderstood. In my constituency, the Castle Vale Community
Housing Association—a product of the good society and good
Government working in partnership—has a formidable capacity to
engage in neighbourhood planning. More recently, in Perry common, a
remarkable community hall opened—another product of the good
society and good Government—with half the money raised by the
community and half from Advantage West Midlands. That community, again,
has a formidable capacity to shape events. I know there are

                           </div>other parts of my constituency—one of the 10 poorest in
Britain—where that capacity does not exist. My hon.
Friend’s earlier point about all citizens having equal access to
the potential offered is of the highest importance, and we will return
to those issues later in the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11030140000194">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
Minister rightly pointed out the options if a two-tier set of
arrangements is not wanted. Should there be universal parish councils,
or the proposals set out in the Bill? We do not disagree with the
conclusion he has arrived at, because it would not be appropriate to
roll out parish councils nationwide. Conversely, arrangements are
needed where parish councils do not exist. The key thing is, how to get
that right at the next stages.<a class="bkMark" name="11030140000195">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I will
comment on points raised by the Minister. There needs to be absolute
clarity about the powers of the local authority to maintain democratic
overview and, where a neighbourhood forum becomes dysfunctional, to act
accordingly. It is therefore crucial that such issues be properly
teased out during the next stages. The Minister agreed that he will
share with us Government thinking as to what is reasonable and
unreasonable, and which is to be included in regulations. We hope that
that will enable us to have the necessary debate, so that we can say
with confidence that, in practice, the spirit of our two amendments was
realised in the Government’s proposals.<a class="bkMark" name="11030140000196">&#160;</a>

the Minister also said that those regulations will address issues such
as diversity, representativeness, inclusion and inclusiveness. We
welcome that, and we can have that debate during the next stages. On
the amendment that deals with living in the area, we are at one on the
principle, which is that by definition a local plan is for local
people. We can have an intelligent debate about the issue of
councillors—some of the good councillors in my own constituency
do not live there—but we do not want the door to be opened for
the Tooting popular front to liberate Sloane square or Belgravia,
however attractive that concept might be in other

wished.”<a class="bkMark" name="11030140000314">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>That
has caused the council some confusion. It looks at the notion of parish
plans and says:<a class="bkMark" name="11030140000210">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“Many
objectives and proposals coming out of current Parish Plans are not
land use in nature, and commit other public or private bodies to
actions and investment which may not be currently set out in their work
programmes.”<a class="bkMark" name="11030140000315">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>Clearly,
the council is interested in the notion that neighbourhood development
plans might go further than land use, but it finds it confusing. We do
not know who has suggested that to the council, but it has asked the
Committee whether the intention is for neighbourhood development plans
to go beyond what is specified in the Bill and relate to matters other
than land use planning. I would like to put that question to the
Minister.<a class="bkMark" name="11030140000211">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I wish to make two brief points. First, a number
of business organisations have expressed concern, because they feel
they are excluded from the process. They believe that they should be
able to participate in a meaningful way, particularly where the
business community makes up a substantial part of a locality. I am
aware of the difficulties inherent in the debate regarding the right to
vote, but that is different from a standing enabling participation. We
would be grateful, therefore, if the Minister clarified the
Government’s thinking on that.<a class="bkMark" name="11030140000212">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Secondly,
various organisations with whom we have had dialogue have suggested
that without, in the spirit of localism, imposing a model constitution
on a neighbourhood forum, there is merit in the notion of a model of
what the forum might look like, which gets that balance right between
what it is and what it is not—the potential that it
offers—without arousing false expectations. We believe there is
merit in that and, again, we seek the Minister’s
comments.<a class="bkMark" name="11030140000213">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am grateful for the chance to comment on these
matters. On the East Lindsey point—I confess that I have not
seen the council’s submission— clearly, parish plans are
promoted by parish organisations generally, and they can continue to do
that. The provisions we are considering are land use planning matters.
They do not give any rights to non-planning issues. If a body such as a
parish wants to consider other matters, it can do so. There are no
changes to the arrangements for that.<a class="bkMark" name="11030140000214">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I am grateful
to the hon. Member for Birmingham, Erdington for both the points he has
made. On the participation of business—we have touched on this
in our earlier discussion—one of the reasons why we do not want
to be overly prescriptive on participation is to allow business owners
who may live outside an area to participate. No amendments have been
suggested to me that would improve the Bill on that basis, which has
led me to consider that the way we have drafted it allows businesses to
participate. That is certainly my intention. If it becomes apparent
during the weeks ahead that certain tweaks might be considered, we have
the opportunity either here or in the other place to do that in order
to strengthen or clarify the Bill. It is helpful that I have had the
opportunity to say for the record that I regard the participation of
business as very desirable, especially in areas—for example, a
town with a high street or an industrial district—where
employers are
significant.<a class="bkMark" name="11030140000215">&#160;</a>

suggestion? In light of the earlier helpful exchanges we have had and
the other issue we have agreed should be addressed, it is important
that the matter become an agenda item in the next-stage discussions
before Report, because where there is a will, there is a way. I think
there is a common will among all parties that the business community
should have a legitimate voice in this process. We now need to discuss
how best we give effect to
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11030140000216">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I entirely agree with the hon. Gentleman’s
suggestion and I am very happy to agree to that. On the point about
having a model constitution for neighbourhood forums, I can think of a
number of bodies who may well be able to provide a service to
them—perhaps Civic Voice can be one of those. In the spirit of
not reinventing the wheel, it might be helpful for these forums to have
access to a suggested way of proceeding. In relation to our discussions
with organisations outside the Committee, that is a helpful suggestion.
I am sure that he and those organisations—I will certainly
reinforce that with them—might want to give some thought to
starting work on that

arrangements that should apply in those neighbourhoods that cross

local authority for the neighbourhood in which the neighbourhood plan
has been developed that should consider that plan. They clearly do not
give effect to considering the cross-borough boundaries matter, so I
simply ask him to undertake further reflection. I am not seeking an
amendment to this, but clearly the measure goes in one direction and
what he said earlier pointed in a slightly different direction. I
therefore hope that this is not the last word on the
issue.<a class="bkMark" name="11030140000223">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> These amendments—about which we are all
clear—seek to ensure that neighbourhood plans are built on a
robust, up-to-date evidence base and enable effective participation and
involvement by all parties at all stages. However crucial neighbourhood
planning is, it must be guided by strategic and national planning, for
all the reasons that we have discussed at length. It must enable both
national and international obligations, such as those concerning
sustainable housing and renewable energy, to be properly delivered at
the local level. Neighbourhood plans must be prepared under and be
consistent with the strategic frameworks established in national and
local plans, and be subject to the requirement to achieve sustainable
development. The Bill does not include sufficient mechanisms to ensure
consistency between plans at all levels, and the amendments seek to
address that by requiring that plans at all levels be
compatible.<a class="bkMark" name="11030140000241">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendments also express our concern that the processes for
neighbourhood development orders and plans do not include a mechanism
for the full and proper consideration of environmental impacts. The
Bill includes a provision to guide local authorities in relation to the
proposed community right-to-build orders, where the proposals in the
draft order would create unacceptable environmental impacts. We would
like that provision to apply more widely to all neighbourhood
development orders, and in the spirit of consistency in the Bill we
hope the Minister is prepared to accept that. The amendments are
familiar territory to the Committee—regarding the need to
achieve sustainable development at every level of the planning
process—and I do not propose to go over old ground, but I would
welcome the Minister’s views and any clarification he is able to
offer.<a class="bkMark" name="11030140000242">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
149 raises a vital issue. It seeks to ensure that parts of our local
and national heritage are not lost or damaged by the removal of key
protections in law. That issue has been drawn to the Committee’s
attention by evidence from across the heritage sector, which is
concerned that the Bill seriously reduces protection for our most
important historic buildings and their settings, and for the character
of conservation areas, in a way that is entirely unnecessary, not least
because of the framework already in place to defend our national
heritage. This issue should be above party politics because it affects
not only the places where our constituents live, but how they are able
to care for that which we all cherish: our great national
heritage—what it has meant to us in the past and what it will
mean to us in the future. Our heritage assets include our great Norman
castles, medieval market towns, ancient ports and prehistoric
landscape, which are national assets but are local to the communities
around them, forming part of their history and their future.<a class="bkMark" name="11030140000243">&#160;</a>

                        </div>
                        <p class="tabbed">Many other
places could also be badly affected by the Bill. Our ancient
archaeological sites, world heritage sites and registered parks,
gardens and battlefields all rely solely on the planning system for
their protection. Until now, the balance between local and national
responsibility for the care of our historic buildings and places has
been set out in a clear national framework of legislation involving the
designation of places and buildings of special importance. However,
people are not inspired by buildings alone or in isolation; they are
equally inspired by where those buildings belong and how they are
settled within the local landscape. The look and feel of the whole
setting is crucial—imagine Wells cathedral in the middle of a
light industrial estate. Likewise, our conservation areas, rural or
urban, are so designated precisely because they represent such beauty
and distinctiveness that we want to conserve them, which is why we have
historically provided them with special protection from casual
development.<a class="bkMark" name="11030140000244">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The Bill,
however, proposes to remove the statutory obligations that protect the
setting of listed buildings and conservation areas in respect of
neighbourhood development plans and orders. A neighbourhood development
group need not, as local authorities must, pay special regard to the
desirability of preserving the setting of listed buildings or the
character of conservation areas when making planning decisions. We
argue strongly that there is no need to remove those specific
protections, which date from 1990 and have been regarded as a mainstay
of our
heritage.<a class="bkMark" name="11030140000245">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
practice, the provisions could allow a neighbourhood development order
to propose housing, commercial or retail development right up to the
boundary of a listed historic house or registered park without
statutory consideration for the damage that that would cause. Likewise,
the character of a conservation area could be ruined by the development
of a major retail outlet in the middle of a green space within the
conservation area. The integrity of the conservation area could be
wrecked by all householders being able to build on their back gardens,
or industrial development could grow up to and within the boundaries,
all without a legal requirement to consider the consequences for the
character of the
area.<a class="bkMark" name="11030140000246">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
hope the Minister will agree that there is a wider issue of democracy
for our country. The assets I am describing have a significance well
beyond local boundaries. They are, in one sense, in the guardianship of
local people, but they belong to the nation, which is why they have
historically been protected by national legislation. I am thinking, for
example, of the conservation areas of York, Cambridge, Chester, Bath,
Durham or Winchester. A decision that threatened to wreck the heart of
those ancient cities would hardly be a local matter; it would be a
matter of national outrage. The Bill as drafted allows decisions that
could ruin or compromise the setting of our most beautiful buildings
and places to be taken by as few as 20
people.<a class="bkMark" name="11030140000247">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Minister might say, “Don’t you worry, Jack; that will all
be put right by the national policy planning framework,” but I
am bound to say that that will not be sufficient. Given the vital
importance of our national heritage, the following points would help:
if it were statutory; if we knew what level of detail would be
included; if we knew clearly how it would relate to local and
neighbourhood development plans; or, if we knew

                           </div>that planning policy statement 5, which is the vitally important
planning guidance that protects our historical environment, would be
incorporated fully. As it stands, we do not know any such things, but
in any case that would not fill the gap left by the loss of statutory
protection.<a class="bkMark" name="11030140000248">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We
are told that this part of the Bill is about transferring planning
decisions to local neighbourhoods. Although nothing has been said about
reducing heritage protection, I do not think for one moment that the
Government intend to reduce that. Having said that, the current framing
of the Bill means that we must ask the Minister about the
Government’s intentions. Can he give us clear assurances that
the Government do not intend to reduce heritage protections? Our
communities care about the heritage they live with and they are
assiduous guardians of it, but a robust, national statutory framework
is of the highest importance. Grave concerns have been expressed by
heritage organisations, and I hope that the Minister will listen to
their voices and agree with the wisdom of our
proposals.<a class="bkMark" name="11030140000249">&#160;</a>

                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Two sets of
amendments have been proposed and they reflect different themes. The
first, in effect, is about the examination of neighbourhood plans to
make sure that they are consistent with EU standards, environmental
standards, and the rest. The second relates to the heritage
aspect.<a class="bkMark" name="11030140000251">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">On the first
set, it was clear from our extensive discussions that the national
planning policy framework and its responsibility for lower-tier plans
should be explicit and in the Bill. It is absolutely our intention that
everything conforms to that, so that there is a trickle-down through
the whole process. One test of the soundness of a neighbourhood
plan—as the hon. Gentleman knows, that is a requirement for it
even to go to a referendum—is that it has to be consistent with
the local plan, which itself has to be consistent with national policy.
We are clear, therefore, that that thread needs to run through
everything, and the examination arrangements need to reflect
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11030140000252">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">If the hon.
Gentleman is content for us to do so, when we consider the discussions
that we had about reflecting our intentions for the national policy
framework throughout the planning system, we will do so for the
neighbourhood planning aspect. To be clear, however, we absolutely
intend that the relevant environmental and other EU standards should
apply to neighbourhood plans, and we will present the system to
Parliament to ensure that hon. Members are satisfied.<a class="bkMark" name="11030140000253">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">On the
question of heritage, the hon. Gentleman anticipated my response, and
it is certainly not the Government’s intention to weaken the
protection for heritage assets. Although English Heritage has suggested
that planning policy statement 5 should be revised and made simpler,
that is very different from suggesting it 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 701<a class="bkMark" name="Column701">&#160;</a>
                           </div>should be weakened or dispensed with. The hon. Gentleman is right: as
drafted, the Bill gives rise to understandable concerns on the part of
the heritage community, not least the hon. Gentleman with his penchant
for history. We want to make it absolutely clear that those concerns
are not diminished in any way, but, in the usual course of things,
although we are sympathetic to his amendment, the normal practice is
for us to take it away and check with the lawyers whether any tweaks
need to be made to it. We will come back at a later stage with
something that reflects the amendment’s
intention.<a class="bkMark" name="11030140000254">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Once again, I welcome the Minister’s
constructive response. I want briefly to respond to the two points he
raised. First, it is helpful that he has clearly stated that the
Government intend for there to be consistency. It is now simply about
how they give effect to that, both in the Bill and through regulations.
On that basis, we are happy for our dialogue with the Government to
proceed, so we will not be pressing the amendment to a
Division.<a class="bkMark" name="11030140000255">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Secondly,
it is also very welcome that we have agreed on the principle of the
amendment. In those circumstances, I have no problem with the Minister
checking on the appropriateness of the wording. I think he will find
that it is pretty sound, but, given that we are agreed on the
principle, it is about giving effect to that principle. So on that
basis, too, I am more than content not to press the amendment to a
Division, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11030140000256">&#160;</a>

                        <p>That

                        <p class="tabbed">Those
provisions are very sensible, but sub-paragraph (6)(b) is not. The
exclusion of employees of the Crown and employees of other local
authorities essentially takes out the two groups of people who are
probably best qualified and experienced to consider such neighbourhood
plans: local government officers from other areas and planning
inspectors. I cannot for the life of me understand why the Government
wish to be so restrictive as to exclude those two groups from
consideration. Why have they been excluded? It cannot be because they
might be considered to be not independent, because the principle of
independence is established by sub-paragraph (6)(a). In any case
planning inspectors have a well developed culture of impartiality and
independence, so it cannot be that. What is the possible logic for
excluding these people? It is not conflict of interest, because that is
covered by the provisions, and it presumably cannot be that the
Government want to exclude people with expertise because they say very
clearly that the examiner must be someone who<a class="bkMark" name="11030140000265">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
provision seems perverse. The only possible explanation is that the
Government want to ensure that the examination is relatively informal
and is not surrounded by a panoply of legal expertise, as can happen in
a planning inquiry. I have attended a number of planning inquiries over
the years, so I have seen the extremes. I have seen inquiries dominated
by lawyers—big, formal, legalistic events—and local
inquiries handled very sensitively by planning inspectors who
understand the need to make people feel at ease so that they can come
forward to put their case and who therefore avoid any sense of
excessive formality other than proper procedure.<a class="bkMark" name="11030140000266">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I cannot for
the life of me understand the reason for the exclusion of planning
inspectors and local government officers. The exclusion would have a
curious and perverse result: the people then most likely to have the
necessary qualifications and experience would be lawyers. If the
Minister wants to have legalistic local examinations, this is the right
way to go about it, as it will ultimately be a lawyer or possibly an
independent planning consultant who will be consulted—the latter
are not known for charging modest fees. If the Minister wants, as I
suspect we all want, a procedure that is well-run, efficient, not
over-legalistic and not unduly expensive, he will find that
sub-paragraph (6)(b) is very unhelpful. If the provision remains, it is
almost inevitable that the people likely to handle such inquiries will
be lawyers—with the greatest respect to the Under-Secretary of
State for Communities and Local Government, the hon. Member for Bromley
and Chislehurst, they are also inclined to charge rather fat fees for
their services—and independent planning consultants.<a class="bkMark" name="11030140000267">&#160;</a>

shall speak briefly to amendment 236. At present, the default position
for neighbourhood development orders and neighbourhood development
plans is that the examination will be by way of written
representations. Amendment 236 is a probing amendment that we tabled to
find out whether the Government believe that written representations
allow for proper examination and the testing of evidence by local
people. There is a need to ensure that local people’s views are
properly heard and not subject to the discretion of an examiner who
could undermine the bottom-up process. The amendment would therefore
allow an oral hearing to take place if that was requested by an
interested party in the area. I hope that the Minister will clarify his
thinking on this. I stress that the amendment is probing, but it raises
important issues about
process.<a class="bkMark" name="11030140000270">&#160;</a>

particularly those of my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham,
Erdington about his probing amendment. We must ensure that the approach
really is bottom up and that we do not accidentally expunge
people’s voices, because some views are better presented orally
than in

                           </strong> First, I should say that one of the reasons why we
take amendments away for checking, even when we agree with the thrust
of them, is that words have a certain legal meaning. I have said that
the intention is that there should be consistency in all the plans, but
it was pointed out to me that “consistency” has a
particular legal meaning. As the right hon. Member for Greenwich and
Woolwich knows, “have regard to” is a normal phrase to
use. I should clarify that I was not indicating the legal use of
“consistency” when I made my point, although that does
not alter the thrust of the commitment that I made to the hon. Member
for Birmingham,
Erdington.<a class="bkMark" name="11030140000272">&#160;</a>

straightforward instead of a great festival of QCs locking horns with
each other. He is on to something when he says that we might be
inadvertently excluding people who may have the skills but might not be
inclined to proceed in that way. I agree with the thrust of his
amendment, and when local authority officers or other Crown employees,
such as planning inspectors, have something to offer, they should be
available. In the spirit of the approach that we need to take with such
things, we will reflect on his words and return with something that
reflects that

that it is necessary for the Government to take away amendments and

provision—will he explain why he has to take it
away?<a class="bkMark" name="11030140000275">&#160;</a>

236, which we heard was a probing amendment, allows us to consider the
perfectly reasonable question as to whether people should have the
right to request—and, by implication, to be granted—a
hearing. The Government intend that it should be possible for the
examiner to take oral evidence, if they wish. If they consider the
written representations to be sufficient, however, there should be no
obligation. Again, that is a safeguard so that if a minority were
determined unnecessarily to engage the examiner in lengthy and perhaps
costly activity, the examiner would have some discretion to exercise
their judgment. We are not opposed to the possibility of people giving
evidence in public. However, in many cases, it will be appropriate for
expressions to be put in writing and then
considered.<a class="bkMark" name="11030140000277">&#160;</a>

thinking. In earlier discussions, we established that it should be open
to communities that do not want a parish council nevertheless to have a
neighbourhood plan, which is why we have neighbourhood forums.
Similarly, if a local community or neighbourhood simply wants a
small-scale housing development, but does not want a broader plan for
the neighbourhood, that should be possible. Hence, we have the narrower
and more specific opportunities. This depends on the sequencing, but if
there is a neighbourhood plan, there will be the duty to co-operate and
there will need to be consistency between those things. We expect that
the community right to build will apply in areas and circumstances
where there is no intention to have a neighbourhood
plan.<a class="bkMark" name="11030140000287">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Labour Members are very concerned about the lack
of financial assistance that the Government will provide for
neighbourhood planning. We are also deeply concerned by the decision to
end the funding regime for Planning Aid England on 31 March.<a class="bkMark" name="11030140000292">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">In December
2010, the Royal Town Planning Institute president, Ann Skippers, said
the decision to cut Government funding for Planning Aid would leave
communities “high and dry”. That decision goes directly
against the Government’s claim about wanting to empower local
communities. Planning Aid could have provided

                           </div>much-needed assistance to communities that want to get involved in the
planning process in their areas.<a class="bkMark" name="11030140000293">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Will the
Minister therefore clarify a number of points? We are aware that
discussions have been taking place on the arrangements from 1 April
onwards, so will he share with the Committee what progress has been
made? Secondly, will he clarify who will be provided with financial
assistance? Thirdly, how much have the Government set aside for that
assistance?<a class="bkMark" name="11030140000294">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Finally, are
the Government satisfied that the financial assistance will be
sufficient, particularly in light of many organisations’
concerns about the huge potential for inequality throughout the system?
In asking that question, I refer to two points. On the one hand, there
is the excellent contribution made by my hon. Friend the Member for
Lewisham East, whose concern is widely shared. As she said, if the
Government mean what they say, they should empower all to take
advantage of the proposals. I know from my own experience the excellent
work that Planning Aid has done in communities up and down the country.
On the other hand, I am mindful of what the Town and Country Planning
Association said about the dangers of institutionalising inequality.
Support, capacity, help and advice will be central if communities
without the necessary capacity are to take advantage of what is on
offer in the Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11030140000295">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I support the comments made by my hon. Friend
the Member for Birmingham, Erdington. The impact assessment on
neighbourhood plans refers to estimated costs of between £17,000
and £63,000, while some external estimates are even higher. The
impact assessment refers to the costs being met partly by the local
authority and partly by the plans’ promoters. However, local
authority planning services are hugely stretched. Yesterday, I spoke
with the head of planning in Lewisham, who told me that he has had to
make 25% savings in his revenue budget in the section he is
responsible for, which includes planning and economic development. I
simply do not know where the people and resource will come from in
local authorities to facilitate some of these plans, although some will
be produced externally and other organisations will be paid to produce
them.<a class="bkMark" name="11030140000296">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I make a plea
that Ministers think hard about how much these documents will cost. Let
me give three examples from my time on Lewisham council, during which I
produced documents that were similar to, although not exactly the same
as, the ones proposed. In response to community concerns, the council
produced the Bromley road supplementary planning document. It was not
included as one of the initial development planning documents when we
looked at our local development framework, but we decided to carry out
that piece of localised neighbourhood consultation in response to
community concerns. It cost £50,000 to produce. The Deptford and
New Cross master plan cost £75,000 to produce, while another
document, “Guidance for Hither Green”, cost
£50,000.<a class="bkMark" name="11030140000297">&#160;</a>
