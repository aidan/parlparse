Amendment proposed, [this day]: No. 52, in page 39, line 29, after `person', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`other than a relevant person'.--[Mr. Edward Davey.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<H5>4.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Question again proposed, That the amendment be made.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that with this we are taking amendment No. 53, in page 39, line 44, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(5D) For the purposes of subsection (5A) a relevant person is a company whose relevant accounting period is a period ending on 31st March;
<P>
 (5E) For the purposes of subsection (5D) ``relevant accounting period'' means the accounting period of the company in which the capital expenditure referred to in subsection (5A) is incurred.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Damian Green </B>(Ashford): As I said this morning, the problem with the clause and my reason for supporting the amendment is that the proposal not only represents a disproportionate response to the problem of undue tax avoidance perceived by the Government but actively places finance leasing at a positive disadvantage. The reason is set out admirably in a letter to the Financial Secretary from the director general of the Finance and Leasing Association, who writes:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``while any tax-paying company acquiring equipment for its own use would be entitled to the full 25 per cent. allowance, and to any benefit of `acceleration' which might arrive from acquiring assets later in its financial year, a leasing company would always be obliged to pro-rate allowances.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ivor Caplin </B>(Hove): Is the hon. Gentleman speaking for all his colleagues this afternoon, because they seem to have disappeared?
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I certainly am. My colleagues are now returning--
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Boswell </B>(Daventry): On a point of order, Mrs. Winterton. It occurs to me and is worth recording that, had my hon. Friend not been on his feet, the Committee would have been inquorate a few moments ago. It is not incumbent on the Government to maintain an adequate number of their troops in the Room in support of their own legislation? Does their failure to do so not suggest a lack of seriousness about the conduct of our proceedings and a gross discourtesy to my hon. Friend?
<P>
<B>Mr. Caplin:</B> Further to that point of order, Mrs. Winterton. As we saw today in the House, such gesture politics are no longer needed in Britain in 1997.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> In response to both Members, it is for the Chairman to decide whether the Committee is quorate and at no time was it inquorate. The second matter was not a point of order.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I shall return to the important point made by the Finance and Leasing Association to the Financial Secretary. The finance leasing industry has traditionally been the instrument by which companies that are not profitable but which in most instances are growing and have large investment needs can invest at comparable costs to profitable ones. Those companies, many of which are small, growing companies, are major creators of jobs. Both sides of the Committee will agree that small businesses are the main engine of job creation and have been in successful and flexible economies such as ours has been for the past 18 years and that measures that damage any class of small business, even one that is temporarily unprofitable, should be regarded with hostility. The thrust of my argument is that that is precisely what the measure is.
<P>
Mr. Hall of the Finance and Leasing Association continued by saying that ``this measure places'' such companies
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``at a permanent disadvantage. It also makes finance leasing fundamentally uncompetitive with straight purchase or hire purchase by profitable companies.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
When the Financial Secretary replies to the debate, perhaps she will say whether that is the intention. I cannot believe that she intends to make one class of small business uncompetitive compared with others.
<P>
As the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey) said when he introduced the amendment, the clause represents a disproportionate response to the problem of tax avoidance. The amendment would permit the abolition of schemes that would be regarded by most people as artificial methods of tax avoidance. Creating a common year end would allow those companies that genuinely wish to take advantage of finance leasing as a way of enabling their business to grow and using their assets profitably to continue to do so.
<P>
Instead of creating a level playing field, the Government have identitifed a bump in the playing field and created a larger bump at the other end, leaving it unlevel and more damaging than it was before.
<P>
<B>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Dawn Primarolo):</B> Let me explain why I do not believe that the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton would achieve its objective.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman began by saying that he accepted the general thrust of Government policy in dealing with the problem but, to paraphrase his remarks, felt that we had tilted the level playing field too far against finance leasing. Unfortunately, the amendments would significantly undermine the action that the Government want to take to block tax leakage through finance leasing.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick Gibb </B>(Bognor Regis and Littlehampton): Will the Financial Secretary give way?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I have barely started.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I am grateful to the Financial Secretary for giving way so early in her summation. I want to refer to what she said about tax leakage. The clause does not really deal with tax leakage but relates more to the issue of cash flow. The timing of claims for capital allowances is more a question of cash flow for the Government than of total tax revenue.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I know that the underlying reason for the amendment is an alleged unfairness in clause 44 because of its effect on finance lessors, not only those who exploit the differing accounting periods to accelerate their capital allowances. But the amendment fails to restrict the application of clause 44 to those companies that use differing accounting periods to achieve that acceleration.
<P>
Non-finance lessors in the same group as a finance lessor could still have any accounting year that they chose--that would not change--and the problem of defining the accounting period would still remain if we accepted the amendment. The proposal to use time apportionment for finance leases is necessary to ensure neutrality between finance lessors. Otherwise, prospective lessees would seek out a lessor to whom the measure did not apply and whose accounting period was shortly to terminate after the business was written. That is the sort of activity with which we are trying to deal, and the amendment would undermine our efforts to do so.
<P>
The new rules in clause 44 also help to remove the distortion between finance leasing and direct purchase. They provide the best possible fit on the timing of capital allowances, short of applying time apportionment to all taxpayers. That would be excessive and the compliance costs on business would be substantial. The combination of provisions in clauses 41 and 44 is the right way to block the acceleration of capital allowances by finance lessors. It is only fair to apply those rules equally to all finance lessors.
<P>
The 37 per cent. mentioned by the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton includes leasing and hire purchase, although there may be some rebalancing of those as a result of the changes. As for this point about benefits for finance leasing, the lessor will still be better off than other companies as a result of the change. The leasing group will pay corporation tax at the new top rate of 31 per cent., but many of the lessees are liable for the lower rate. A level playing field would mean that if a direct buyer is taxable at the smaller companies rate of 21 per cent., a lessor would get relief at only 21 per cent. The clauses leave in place the ability to claim relief at 31 per cent., which is an advantage. The lessors will retain the ability to use multiple companies with different accounting dates. The ability has only been moderated--not removed--by clause 41.
<P>
Even after the changes, finance lessors will use capital allowances at a higher effective rate than many direct purchase companies. Group relief means that they will get relief earlier than direct purchase companies. When those important tax advantages are taken into account, it is clear that finance leasing still has an advantage over hire purchase, and that far from the playing field being tipped away from finance leasing, it is very much tipped in its favour even with the tax loopholes plugged.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey </B>(Kingston and Surbiton): I am sure that the industry will read the Financial Secretary's comments with great care, and no doubt it will want to comment. I am concerned that her confidence that the finance leasing industry will not be adversely affected by the clause is misplaced.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I explained that the hon. Gentleman's information that the level playing field had been tilted against finance leasing was not correct. I met the Finance and Leasing Association to discuss its concerns and I carefully considered what it said. I still believe that the benefits to finance leasing outweigh the benefits to hire purchase. Finance leasing continues to be supported.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> With respect, that is not the information that I received from the FLA, which feels that the measures tilt the playing fields against writing-down allowances. Only time will tell who is correct but it will be interesting to see whether the amount of investment that is funded by leasing falls in the next 12 months. When the Committee meets next year, we may have before us evidence that will enable us to decide whether the hon. Lady is correct or whether my interpretation of what members of the industry have told me is correct. I am pleased, however, that we have had an opportunity to discuss those issues and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The clause seeks to end the use of quarter-end leasing companies, although it does not directly outlaw their use. The concept of quarter-end leasing companies is that a financing group or bank establishes a series of subsidiary companies--either quarter-end leasing companies with a year end of March, June, September and December or, if it goes one stage further, 12 year-end companies to cover every month, from January to December. A leasing company buys the asset on the customer's behalf by borrowing the money from its parent company--usually a bank or finance company--and rents or lends the asset to the customer in return for a rental income. That means that the leasing company has a stream of rental income and interest expense, and a tax allowance for the depreciation of capital allowances at 25 per cent. As a result, most leasing companies at the start of finance leases have a large taxable loss. That loss eventually unwinds as the lease goes through its term.
<P>
That loss is group relieved by the parent company against its profits and, therefore, the group as a whole obtains a benefit from the capital allowances. Leasing is often used because the customer has no capacity to use capital allowances. Either the customer is loss making and, therefore, claiming capital allowances would merely add to its losses and would not generate a benefit, or the customer does not pay taxes and so cannot take advantage of capital allowances. If the capital allowances remain with the leasing and banking company, their advantages can be passed on to the customer through a lower rental stream than if the company had merely bought an asset and rented it to the customer.
<P>
There are two principal benefits of using quarter-end leasing companies: first, whoever buys an asset half way through the year obtains an allowance for the whole year. The clause aims to get rid of that benefit. For example, the leasing company would have an asset bought in March purchased by the subsidiary leasing company with a March year-end. That March leasing company would obtain capital allowances for the full year until 31 March, notwithstanding the fact that the asset was only purchased in the last month of the year.
<P>
Secondly, there is a group-relieved advantage in having four quarter year-end companies in that the coterminous accounting period rules come into play. That means that the group will benefit from that group relief earlier than if the assets and tax relief had been obtained in the banking and leasing company itself.
<P>
I want to give an example of how that system works in practice. If a banking and leasing group with a 31 December 1996 year end had a subsidiary leasing company with a 31 March year end, and an asset was purchased by that company on 30 March, that leasing company would generate a loss in the year ending 31 March 1997. Three quarters of that loss--representing nine of the 12 months--would be offset against the profits of the banking group for the year ending 31 December 1996. The tax would be payable nine months after that date, on 1 October 1997, only six months after the leasing company had purchased the asset.
<P>
In effect, relief is obtained on the purchase only six months after the purchase, which is considerably earlier than would normally be the case. Normally, a company only pays its tax nine months after the year end--assuming, of course, that the assets were purchased right at the end of the year. The advantages of that system were referred to by the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton--the current quarter-end regimes mean that companies obtain relief, on average, after ten and a half months, whereas the clause will extend that period, on average, to 21 months. That is a considerable reduction in the time between expenditure on an asset and obtaining relief for tax purposes.
<P>
Leasing enables companies with losses to recover benefit from capital allowances that they would not otherwise have, and it allows those losses to be passed on through lower rentals. Another advantage, commercially, of leasing as opposed to outright ownership of an asset is the fact that the risks of ownership remain with the lessor. A maintenance or repair contract is often tacked on to a leasing contract. The classic example is that of care leases--a monthly rental of &#163;300 or &#163;400 a month is paid, and all the servicing arrangements and all other matters are brought into one contractual arrangement with the lessees.
<P>
The clause will end what the Inland Revenue regards as a loophole. A loophole is involved--technically--but it has been in existence for many years. The arrangements that leasing companies follow have been in existence for some time and a whole industry has built up around the ability to claim capital allowances for the whole year although an asset may be purchased only towards the end of that year. Indeed, the leasing industry arose from the fact that there were high capital allowances--of 100 per cent. in some instances--and high tax rates during the 1970s, which meant that many manufacturing companies had large taxable losses. They were making profits for accounting purposes, but they had 100 per cent. or 75 per cent. write-offs on their plant and machinery. That meant that for tax purposes, companies--especially manufacturing companies that purchased large quantities of plant and machinery--would often have large tax losses, which they would carry forward, or accumulate, from one year to the next. The leasing industry sprang up because the banks saw that large profits were being made on which tax was paid and that the manufacturing companies had large tax losses.
<P>
The leasing industry mushroomed because some clever person worked out that the benefit of those capital allowances could be shifted from the manufacturing companies to the banks through leasing. Since then, the leasing industry has become part and parcel of commercial activity in this country. Seeking to close that loophole is probably, on balance, a good thing, but it is not the sort of loophole that gives me any real cause for concern--it does not result in a genuine leakage of tax; it merely involves cash flow. However, the Government and industry see the lack of cash flow as a genuine cost because it has to be financed by borrowing, either through gilts, if the Government borrow it, or through commercial debt, if the private sector borrows it.
<P>
The clause will reduce the benefits that leasing companies have long expected and long enjoyed, and rentals will rise as a result because the margins in the leasing industry are fine, and the sector is competitive. New and non-profitable companies tend to be the ones that take advantage of finance leases. A profitable company can get better borrowing rates from a bank than are obtainable from a finance leasing company and can then buy assets and obtain capital allowances. That said, one great advantage of leasing companies is that their loans are more secure than simple loans. The lender--the lessor--retains ownership of the assets and that is an attractive feature of leasing companies.
<P>
Ending use of quarter-end leasing companies will damage the very companies that the Government claim to be trying to support in other Budget measures. Small and medium-sized companies and companies that are still expanding--and therefore making losses in their early years--are most likely to use leasing companies to acquire capital assets. The very companies that the Government help in clauses 42 and 43 are being wiped out by clause 44. That is another example of the Government giving with one hand and taking away with the other.
<P>
The Financial Secretary said that the playing field was not being tilted away from the finance leasing industry, but the clause does not change hire purchase rules, which allow ownership to go to the user of an asset straight away. The asset user is the technical owner and can claim capital allowances immediately and for the whole year, regardless of when, in an accounting period, the assets were purchased.
<P>
As a result of clause 44, if a company obtains an asset through finance leasing a month or three months before the year end, the finance lessor will obtain writing-down allowances equal only to the remaining part of the accounting period. For example, a leasing company with a March year-end that purchased an asset in February could claim only one twelfth of the 25 per cent. writing down allowance on the cost of that asset. But if the company was using the asset or had obtained it by hire purchase, it could obtain the full 25 per cent. no matter when it was purchased. Clearly an unfair advantage is being given to hire purchase arrangements, and direct ownership and leasing companies are being disadvantaged.
<P>
The Finance and Leasing Association believes that that will damage the industry. In a letter to the Financial Secretary, the director general states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``It . . . makes finance leasing fundamentally uncompetitive with straight purchase or hire purchase by profitable companies.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>He goes on to say that exclusion of all leased assets from double first-year allowances will have similar effects.
<P>
The Finance Bill brings in great new benefits in clauses 42 and 43, in the shape of 50 per cent. first-year allowances for small and medium-sized companies with &#163;11 million turnover, assets of &#163;5.6 million or 215 employees. But those are the kind of companies that generally use finance leasing. The Government have gone to the trouble of giving such companies a special one-year period in which to obtain a double first-year allowance, while penalising them by making acquisition of those assets difficult; leasing companies are specifically excluded from obtaining double first-year allowances.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
It is as though someone in Government or in the Inland Revenue realised what was happening and deliberately tried to do down what the Government were trying to achieve. Such companies--the less-than-profitable small and medium-size enterprises--benefit from finance leasing and were hoping to benefit from the double first-year allowances. That was the second point referred to in the letter from Mr. Hall, the director general of the Finance and Leasing Association, who states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The asset finance industry funds 37 per cent. of all UK fixed capital investment of which, taking one year with another, approximately half is provided through leasing.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>The Financial Secretary pointed that out earlier. Therefore 18.5 per cent. of all fixed capital investment is accounted for through the finance leasing industry. That is a colossal amount of fixed capital investment. We have a Government whose purported aim is to increase the amount of investment by companies. The Government complain frequently about the lack of investment while seeking to attack the one sector of industry which finances and supplies 18.5 per cent. of all fixed capital investment in this country. I challenge the Financial Secretary to dispute that as a result of clause 44, the rental payments charged by the finance leasing industry to industry will rise. I also challenge her to tell the Committee how she thinks that increasing rentals from the finance leasing industry to industry will help to increase capital investment. A simple supply and demand curve will show that if the Government increase the price, demand will fall and, as a result of the clause, companies will not be able to afford sufficient fixed-capital investment.
<P>
The final paragraph of Mr. Hall's letter to the Financial Secretary states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``I hope you will understand why this industry feels that the presentation of the particular anti-avoidance measure in Clause 44 was misleading, and far from creating a true level playing field. We have proposed to the Inland Revenue simple amendments to redress this problem''.
<P>
</UL></FONT>However, the Government has just rejected them.

<P>

<B>Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown </B>(Cotswold): I have listened carefully to my hon. Friend, especially to his remarks about the likelihood of clause 44 increasing the cost of lease rental payments. Does he not think it bizarre, therefore, that this morning we debated a clause that would enable small companies to accelerate capital allowances--the logical way of financing that measure would be a lease arrangement--while only two clauses later the Government try to make the whole financing operation more expensive?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> My hon. Friend is right. It seems paradoxical that the Government exclude leasing companies from enjoying the benefits of clauses 42 and 43. I understand fully what clause 44 attempts to achieve: the Government are trying to close a loophole, although I do not believe that it is an urgent problem. But why have they specifically excluded leasing companies from the benefits of clauses 42 and 43? It does not make sense because, as I have said, it is small and medium-size enterprises that are most likely to benefit from clauses 42 and 43; it is those companies that, typically, find that they have to use finance leasing if they are to afford to buy the assets in question. Now they will be unable to obtain the advantage of clauses 42 and 43.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Is there not a further point on account of the present economic cycle? Just as interest rates are beginning to rise, would not it make a great deal of sense for many companies to think about leasing arrangements to fix some of their borrowings at today's prevailing circumstances--and, under the present economic regime, is there not likely to be a further considerable rise in interest rates?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> My hon. Friend is right. Leasing companies are fully aware of the likely fluctuations in interest rates. Indeed, leasing rental payments will always reflect prevailing interest rates.
<P>
As Labour Members have told us time and again, industry needs stability. It can achieve stability if expenditure on interest payments is fixed by entering into finance leasing arrangements, which will fix such payments for many years ahead and throughout the period of the lease. Of course, leasing companies will take into account expected or potential rises in interest rates, but they have the expertise and the economies of scale to hedge their risks through derivatives and other instruments in the City. Small enterprises are often not able to do that.
<P>
The finance leasing industry supplies a necessary and valuable service to small and medium-sized enterprises. It is wrong for the Labour party to regard the leasing industry as a spiv financial industry that exists merely because it takes advantage of hugh tax loopholes. The industry does not do that: it is a genuine part of this country's banking and financial sector and provides a necessary and valuable service. To some extent, the clause may result in the demise of that industry.
<P>
I wish to refer to some of the comments made by the professional and other groups that the Government should have consulted before they published the Bill. The Confederation of British Industry is very critical of the clause. Paragraphs 2 and 3 of its briefing note state:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Research suggests that leasing has proved a popular and valuable tool in a range of cases, including smaller and growing firms.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
	Whilst the changes to the law on these clauses are broadly aimed at preventing tax leakage their detailed effect may be to hamper legitimate investment financing, contrary to the Budget aim of encouraging investment.''
<P>
That proves the correctness of my comments even though we are now told that the CBI is cosy with the Labour party and that it supports many Government measures.
<P>
The fifth paragraph of the CBI's briefing note clearly disputes what the Financial Secretary said in her closing remarks on the amendment. It states that the clause:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``does not provide a level playing field between lessors of machinery and plant and outright purchaser-users of such equipment.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
What does the Financial Secretary say about that? The CBI adds:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Whatever the merits of Clause 44 in tackling perceived exploitation it would be bad law to enact a new provision which itself would create distortions in the availability of the relevant allowances.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This is yet another clause in which the hapless Government have tried to sort out a distortion. They will, however, create another distortion. The distortions that we have seen elsewhere in the Bill are mirrored in this clause.
<P>
In its representations, the Institute of Directors states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``This limitation is wrong in principle because it would not apply if the lessee had bought the asset on hire purchase or by borrowing money to fund an outright purchase.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There we are: there is no level playing field. No doubt, the Financial Secretary has received that representation from the Institute of Directors. It continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``at the moment leasing is a valuable option which can offer the cheapest form of financing not for any tax reason, but simply because the lessor retains ownership of the assets and therefore has excellent security for the loan which he is effectively making. This action against leasing seems to fit ill with the Chancellor's declared intention of encouraging investment.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Institute of Directors then adds:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``There is a huge administrative problem.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Of course there is. The leasing industry purchases tens of thousands of assets. It is not a small corner shop buying a grasscutting machine, which my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford (Mr. Davies) would find useful, or indeed a new tractor, which my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) would find useful.
<P>
This is an industry which purchases assets in their tens of thousands. One can imagine the computational difficulties of having to calculate the writing-down allowances on the basis of the precise date on which assets were purchased; there could be many different dates in a year. Every asset will require its date to be entered into the computer, with a separate calculation for each asset based on the number of days in the year multiplied by 25 per cent. It will be an enormously cumbersome administrative procedure, which again will add to British industry's compliance costs.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> It occurs to me that one of the perverse effects of the clause will be to drive leasing operations offshore to cheaper tax regimes where these provisions will not apply. Larger international companies may deliberately put part of their operations offshore to take advantage of offshore leasing arrangements. Will my hon. Friend comment on that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> My hon. Friend makes a valuable point. I am sure that calculations are being made even now of the post-tax effect of moving operations offshore, compared to the position while they remain onshore. It would be another tragedy if the Government were to drive such activities out of the British jurisdiction, thereby creating an absense of jobs.
<P>
I return to the administration of the leasing industry as a result of the clause. The Institute of Directors says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``It would be impractical for...a company to feed the purchase date of each asset into its capital allowances computation.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It suggests using averaging--for example, assuming that all assets are purchased halfway through a company's accounting period--or using a rate of 12&#183;5 per cent., which is the suggestion of the Chartered Institute of Taxation.
<P>
Industry is crying out for simplicity in tax regimes, but is faced with yet another measure that will add an enormous burden. The argument is always, ``It's just one clause. It's just one measure. It's not that difficult to calculate it--just another five minutes per asset.'' But these additional complications, from this clause here and another clause there, soon add up. That is why British industry is spending so much of its resourses administering its activities and its tax affairs. That is the view of the Institute of Directors.
<P>
I move on to the views of the Chartered Institute of Taxation, another organisation which is highly scathing of clause 44. It says that further time spent now on the Bill may save time later, and it recommends a deferral of these provisions. I put that point to the Financial Secretary: will she consider deferring these provisions? The Institute also refers to the enormous compliance costs that will result from having to compute the allowances on the basis of the date on which the asset was purchased. It suggests using averaging by taking 12&#183;5 per cent. as the writing-down allowance instead of the 25 per cent. in the Capital Allowances Act 1990.
<P>
I turn finally to the comments of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales. It says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``We are unclear why the clause should restrict the writing-down allowance in the year of purchase even where group relief is not involved.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>The institute makes a valid point, because the loophole which the Government seek to close is the advantage given to groups of companies, mainly banking and financial groups, by group relief. One advantage of using varying accounting period ends is the timing of the group relief. Surely these draconian provisions should not apply to a bank or leasing company which does not use quarter-end companies and which therefore does not take advantage of group relief. If a bank or a leasing company were to acquire an asset and then lease it on to its customers, surely these measures should not apply to it, as it would not use the group relief provisions.
<P>
It is sought to close a long-existing loophole, but I doubt whether that loophole is as severe and damaging as the Government claim. It is simply a cash-flow measure rather than a genuine tax leakage.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I contend that there will be damage to small and medium-sized enterprises--the most productive sectors of industry--whose costs of capital will be more expensive, and who will find it harder to obtain finance. This could result in lower corporation tax yields in the medium and longer term than the Government will save by closing the loophole. I urge the Government to consider other measures that would help the leasing industry, and small and medium-sized enterprises.

<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I have not previously intervened because I wanted to listen carefully to the arguments deployed by hon. Members in this highly technical area. I was sorry that the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton did not press his amendment.
<P>
The speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb) has persuaded me to invite my colleagues to oppose the clause. I think--[Interruption.] I say that genuinely--I regret the cynical laughter of Labour Members. I think that he has produced a compelling argument that the Government should consider the matter further, in consultation with the industry.
<P>
I emphasise that Conservative Members believe that tax avoidance that can be reasonably practicably remedied should not continue. We undestand why the Government proposed the clause, but we contend--reinforced by the expertise of my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton--that there may be damage to the finance leasing industry disproportionate to any tax advantage gained under the present arrangements.
<P>
Given that there is no immediate danger of the dyke collapsing, and a flooding in--or out--of revenue, it should not be beyond the wit of man to ensure that the Financial Secretary, the industry and the experts take nine months to discuss the matter and get it right.
<P>
I advise my hon. Friends to resist the clause, unless the Financial Secretary can convince us otherwise.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> At times today I have felt that I was in a private conversation with the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, while the rest of the Committee listened in.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton made some interesting, but contradictory, points. He began by agreeing with us that there is a loophole--he said ``technically'', and I am not sure what he means, as presumably a loophole that is not technically there is not a loophole--
<P>
<B>Mr. Neil Gerrard </B>(Walthamstow): It is a Tory one.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I shall leave that point.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman agreed that the provision is narrowly targeted. He has repeated comments from various organisations, but the clause will not mean the demise of finance leasing as we know it. When I met the Finance and Leasing Association, it was not keen, understandably, on the Government removing a tax relief to which we thought finance lessors should not have access. Even the Finance and Leasing Association, however, did not forecast that this clause would spell the end of finance leasing.
<P>
Finance leasing still has substantial advantages over direct purchase. I listed those advantages twice this afternoon. This morning, Mr. McWilliam told us not to engage in repetition: I will not repeat the advantages, but they are clear. I have also heard the argument that the Inland Revenue is persecuting the finance leasing industry, and that a struggle of the Titans is in progress. That is not so: finance leasing has its place and its own reliefs, which the Government support.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I am fascinated to hear that the Finance and Leasing Association is entirely happy with the Government's policy. This afternoon, I was faxed a leaflet published by the Finance and Leasing Association which states that the 1997 Finance Bill will cut inward investment, damage businesses, destroy jobs and jeopardise essential improvements to our schools, universities and hospitals. The impression that the Minister is giving of the FLA's attitude to the Budget is rather at odds with what the association says.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> Perhaps my voice is not carrying to the back of the Committee, but I made it clear that the Finance and Leasing Association would prefer us not to remove this unintentional--or as the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton calls it, technical--loophole. Even though the association would prefer the loophole to remain, its arguments about a level playing field--and its contention that the finance leasing industry does not have advantages over direct purchase--are incorrect.
<P>
Although the association does not like clause 44, it does not mean the end of finance leasing. Barclays bank will not go down the tubes because of clause 44. The association will continue to argue that the Government should not remove this relief, and we will continue to argue that we will remove it because the relief is unintentional. Direct purchase and finance leasing are not on a level playing field.
<P>
There was a point about excessive compliance costs. Finance lessors generally have very sophisticated computer systems, and adjusting those systems to this rule, while undoubtedly extra work, is not, in the Government's view, excessive.
<P>
The next point was that the clause would force finance leasing offshore, but that would not be possible unless another country were foolish enough to permit lessors to utilise allowances against profits arising in that country. In that case, a country would be subsidising investment here in Britain, and I do not believe that other countries would want to do that.
<P>
The final point, about averaging, was made by the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton. That is a matter for discussion between the lessor and the inspectors. If averaging would give a fair and reasonable result, such an arrangement may be negotiated. We want what is fair and reasonable.
<P>
I ask the Committee to support the Government's moves to close a loophole in the sure knowledge that finance leasing still has substantial tax advantages against direct purchase.

<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 56, in page 41, line 7, after `machinery or plant', insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`which is not new machinery or plant.'<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss amendment No. 57, in page 41, line 26, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> .`(2A) For the purposes of this section, new machinery or plant means machinery or plant that has not before the relevant sale, making of contract, or assignment, be used for the purposes of a trade or for any non-trading acitivities by the seller, the person making the contract, or the assignor respectively, or any person connected with him.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I rise with a degree of trepidation as I seem to be intruding on a private conversation and a burgeoning relationship between the Financial Secretary and my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton. Committee members on both sides of the Committee look forward to that relationship growing and flowering in the years ahead, until the two Members eventually exchange Benches.
<P>
I move the amendment in an attempt to be helpful to the Government because some of the clause's effects may be unintentional. I have been convinced by the many representations that I have received that the damage that will be done to the leasing industry--which we have discussed at some length this afternoon--and, more widely, to equally important sectors of the British manufacturing industry, far outweighs any gains that may result from the loophole's being plugged. We have discussed in detail this afternoon the balance of advantage between plugging loopholes--whether technical or non-technical--and the damage that will be caused by the creation of the sometimes spurious level playing fields that the Treasury want to impose.
<P>
The long-term effects of the clause are probably the most serious of all those of the clauses that we have considered today--that is partly because they are not what the Treasury's explanatory notes say they are. The clause's purpose is to restrict capital allowances that are available to lessors on machinery or plant--which are sold and leased back. Under the finance lease--to the notional written-down value of that machinery or plant to the seller. In other words, the clause aims at old machinery and at traders who have raised no new finance because substantially older proceeds are used to provide cash security--directly or indirectly--to the lessor.
<P>
As I understand the notes on clauses, the clause is not designed to have an effect on new investment. That is the key: it is designed to stop lessees selling on the allowances to lessors when no underlying new investment, as it were, is being encouraged. Indeed, the notes on clauses say that the sale of future allowances will not be affected and will not interfere with the common commercial practice of sale and leaseback immediately after the delivery of new equipment. Those arrangements are designed to remove the lessor's risks.
<P>
My central contention is that that is not the case: the clause will have an effect on that type of transaction because many larger assets take several years to build. Those assets that require leasing finance--including building new manufacturing facilities or ships, and perhaps the leasing of aircraft--make some of the most important contributions to industrial and economic growth. It is a common practice among those who engage in such construction projects to pay instalments during the construction period but not to make a decision to use leasing finance until close to the eventual delivery of the completed project.
<P>
One of the clause's intended or unintended effects is that if instalments that were paid at that early stage of the manufacturing process fell in earlier accounting periods, the lessor's allowances would be reduced. One has only to work out how long it takes to build a manufacturing facility to realise that that would be a common occurrence. It may take up to five years to build a motor manufacturing facility and, therefore, a significant chunk of the investment would not be available to gain previous tax advantages.
<P>
The Financial Secretary has had a long correspondence with various practitioners on the subject, in which she says that the main practical effects of the rules will be on older equipment. As a possible answer to my query as to whether this is intentional or not, she has commented that the result is intended to be the same whether unused past allowances are attributable to payment of instalments during the construction of an asset or attributable to the purchase of a completed asset. That is where the central danger lies: people will be discouraged from setting out on the lengthy process of constructing manufacturing facilities if they are unsure about tax effects or, worse, if they are certain that they will be at a tax disadvantage--as will happen if the clause is unamended. The amendment's purpose is to allow new equipment--which has not been used because it is still being built--to retain previous tax advantages.
<P>
Many financiers would not want directly to be involved in projects--with a Korean or Japanese shipyard for example--in assessing a risk because they might not be competent to do so. Perhaps even more seriously, much inward investment into the UK involves lengthy construction periods and the inward investor wants directly to deal with equipment suppliers. Those involved in the finance leasing industry know that sales and lease-back provisions have been used when no genuinely new finance is being raised. They accept the argument for removing those privileges in such cases. The Financial Secretary raises her eyebrows, and we would all agree that there is a difference between a technical loophole and a non-technical one. The example that I have given would clearly be a non-technical, genuine loophole. The industry is happy for legislation to change in that respect. It makes the point, however, that that is not the case where a company is refinancing short- term, construction-phase finance with long-term arrangements linked to the projected life of the asset.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Is that not in essence the advantage of lease financing? In my contribution on clause 44 I said that finance leasing is popular because it enables the risk to remain with the other party. By trying to clamp down on sale and lease-backs the Government are interfering with the commercial analysis and possession of risk.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B>My hon. Friend sums up the point well--there is a wider implication for the whole industry. Another factor is that many inward investors will not have enough of a UK tax base to absorb and take advantage of all the available capital allowances. For such companies, leasing is the obvious mechanism. It enables them to compete on equal terms with existing profitable enterprises and may tip the balance as to whether they can justify the investment.
<P>
Many investment decisions are taken on a knife edge, and many countries offer similar industrial and education skills. Attracting inward investment, which has done much to regenerate our industry over the past 10 or 15 years, is an extremely competitive market. For a Government to endanger that is one of the most serious moves that they could make. The change is out of all proportion to the effect. By plugging a relatively minor loophole, they will make Britain a less attractive haven for inward investment. Surely that will not be to the advantage of the people of this country or, in the long term, of the Revenue. The more profitable enterprise we can attract to this country, the more revenue will be generated. Seeking to plug loopholes may be shooting ourselves in the foot. The proposed changes will create a damaging climate of uncertainty.
<P>
The Government's correspondence with the Finance and Leasing Association and others shows no sign of them wishing to give way. It is important to put the change into perspective. It is not one of the technical changes that we have discussed so lovingly during our proceedings, because of the size of the figures involved. In 1996, of the &#163;5.4 billion-worth of big-ticket leasing, by which I mean those leasing projects of more than &#163;20 million, just under half--&#163;2.5 billion--was inward investment. It would be to our national disadvantage to jeopardise that level of inward investment, which covers car plants at Nissan and Toyota, and high-tech plants such as the Siemens semi-conductor plant--all of which used lease finance. I am not making a theoretical point. Some of the big projects that the world's best companies brought to this country, which we were all delighted to see come here instead of the many other countries that competed for them, came about using lease finance. The great danger is that the clause will put all of that in jeopardy.
<P>
The Financial Secretary said that finance leasing will not disappear, and that Barclays bank is not going to go belly up. It is not enough to say that a set of tax changes will at least not destroy our banking system. A great deal more could be said. If one agrees with the FLA that the measures will cut inward investment, damage businesses, destroy jobs and jeopardise essential improvements, then whether or not the banking system is going to go belly up seems irrelevant. The net effect of the clause unamended will be to inflict immense damage on British industry.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Is this not characteristic of the Labour party's Budget? It is a matter not of what advantage the clause may give to industry but of how little is the damage. That is always the worry with a Labour Government--how much damage will they inflict on the country. The Finance Bill provides example after example of how they are damaging industry. The Paymaster General smiles, but yesterday we heard his response to the foreign income dividend catastrophe and the enormous damage that that will do. Clause 46 will also damage British industry, like everything else the Labour party touches.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> My hon. Friend makes an excellent point. I am fascinated to hear Labour Members chuntering about recessions. They have been in power for two months, and the expectation is that this Paliament will last up to five years. If they think they have abolished the trade cycle, good luck to them, but everyone who has thought that in the past has been proved wrong. The more humbris they show, the more surely nemesis will follow. I advise them in all conscience to desist from that line of argument--whether they advance it on their feet or from a sedentary position--because it would be damaging.
<P>
One factor that causes recessions--the Government have not yet had to suffer a recession because of the enormous strength and vibrancy of the economy that they inherited from the previous Government--is the sort of ill-thought-out measure before us. It may have been lying on the stock of the Revenue for a long time as a means for closing another loophole. I do not blame the Revenue for that. Its purpose is to close loopholes if a tax advantage is damaging to the economy and it would be better if it were removed, but it is the job of Ministers to consider the effect and to decide whether, on balance, it is better to close a loophole or to do what the tax experts suggest.
<P>
My amendment would give Ministers a decent way out. They need not withdraw the clause, but could include the amendment so that big, important projects would not be affected and the playing field would not be tilted against inward investment. The amendment would enable them to retain the clause, which everyone would then agree was small and useful. As it stands, it will cause far more damage than it is worth and I urge the Government to accept my amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Loughton </B>(East Worthing and Shoreham): I want to add a few comments in support of the amendment. I must declare an interest, which may be of interest to the Economic Secretary to the Treasury, who said that I seem to have many interests to disclose. I am treasurer of the all-party parliamentary maritime committee and the proposal will affect the future of shipbuilding and ship leasing, to which my hon. Friend the Member for Ashford (Mr. Green) alluded.
<P>
With your indulgence, Mrs. Winterton, I shall quote from a letter from Mr. Hall, director general of the Finance and Leasing Association. Despite the earlier comments of the Financial Secretary, it is yet another example of blatant steamrollering. Mr. Hall states that his letter
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``follows wholly unsatisfactory discussions with officials of the Inland Revenue. We have also been in close touch with your office but have as yet had no response to my request for a meeting.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> May I tell the hon. Gentleman that I met Mr. Hall last Friday with representatives from the Finance and Leasing Association.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Lady, but it would have been better if such bodies had been consulted before legislative proposals were formulated. As with so many other parts of the Budget, proposals are made and may be followed by a vague token attempt at consultation with outside professional bodies. I gather from correspondence subsequent to the hon. Lady's meeting that that meeting was far from satisfactory and did not address the problems that yet another professional body has experienced.
<P>
The letter from the Finance and Leasing Association also states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The asset finance industry funds 37 per cent. of all UK fixed capital investment''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That point was slightly misconstrued by the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton earlier. The industry is important and the amendment would remedy the effect of the provisions; that will, in turn, affect transactions in which an asset is sold and leased back immediately on delivery before it has been put to any commercial use. Contrary to the normal intentions stated by the Inland Revenue, it will especially affect many large capital spend projects, which take several years to complete. I shall refer to four such projects that are germane to my constituency.
<P>
First, power stations are likely to be prejudiced by the proposals because they take several years to build and are expensive investments. At Shoreham harbour, which is in my constituency and that of the hon. Member for Hove (Mr. Caplin)--we may have different views as to what the future of that important part of the Sussex coastline should be--there is potential for rebuilding a power station, which could provide an important source of employment. Changes to the financing of a leasing arrangement for its building will have an impact on that.
<P>
Secondly, we have heard examples of manufacturing facilities where large factories are being built, and they will also be affected. There are several such examples in my constituency--large multinational employers, such as SmithKline Beecham, Daewoo, B and W Loudspeakers and Edwards High Vacuum, an important part of BOC. Every day, all those companies are considering financing arrangements for building new factories that will provide much-needed employment in the part of the south coast that I represent.
<P>
Thirdly--this is perhaps more germane to my opening disclosures of interest--Shoreham harbour is keen to expand its shipping interests, which may be contrary to the wishes of the hon. Member for Hove, but we shall have that argument another day. When companies are ordering ships, whether from the far east, Scandinavia or the north-east of England, typically, they enter into three-year contracts. Incidentally, we might construe from the haste with which the Government are happy to bulldoze the Bill through that it is becoming even less likely that practical financing measures will be found to make possible the replacement of the Royal yacht Britannia.
<P>
Fourthly, as my hon. Friend the Member for Ashford mentioned, the proposed legislation will have an impact on the aircraft industry. Shoreham airport in my constituency is the oldest commercial airport in the country. As long ago as 1911, the first commercial freight flights anywhere in the world took place between Shoreham airport and Hove, carrying a consignment of Osram light bulbs. It was a flagship consignment.
<P>
I am keenly interested in the impact of these financing provisions because, typically, a commissioning body involved in any of the projects that I have mentioned pays instalments during the construction period but does not decide how to finance the project until, or near to, delivery of the power station, ship, aircraft or whatever.
<P>
I want to quote another expert on the subject, a major City house that specialises in this sort of finance. A letter that I have received from a Mr. Osborne reads:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``We believe that the provision as drafted will make it more difficult for companies investing in capital equipment where there is a long build period e.g. ships and factories to reach a decision concerning the appropriate method of finance. The provision as drafted would force them to enter into an agreement with a finance lessor contemporaneous with placing contracts for the provision of capital goods. This would be contrary to the normal commercial practice recognised by the Revenue of entering into the sale and lease back at completion.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>Prevailing interest rates are another commercial factor in the equation. What with interest rates currently taking off, not helped by the surge in the value of the pound and the likely surge in inflation, much could happen during a one, two or three-year period. Obviously, companies commissioning such products would not wish to obligate themselves to interest rates until later in the period, if it was commercially imprudent to do so.
<P>
We have also received a briefing from the CBI, which again raises concerns about the clause. The CBI states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Whilst Clause 46 may be designed to prevent tax leakage CBI Members with shipping interests have raised concerns that it may have an unintended''--
<P>
</UL></FONT>we hope unintended--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``damaging impact.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>That is the reason for my interest through the all-party parliamentary maritime group.
<P>
Slightly prematurely, because the matter is much more germane to an amendment in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Ashford, many members of the Committee received a letter from Mr. Newman, a director of the South Yorkshire Passenger Transport Executive, whom I have met, regarding the dire problems that it will now face with future funding of the supertram project. As I said earlier while your co-Chairman was in the Chair, Mrs. Winterton, my time as a prospective parliamentary candidate in Sheffield in the previous election coincided with the time when the supertram project was first put into play. It has proved a worthwhile project for many aspects of Sheffield life, not least for connections between the Meadowhall shopping centre, one of the largest shopping centres in the country, and other parts of Sheffield, which were previously completely clogged up with traffic, providing an almost eternal menace to the centre of Sheffield city.
<P>
The advantages brought about by the supertram are environmental. Consistent with the apparent new policy that has been leaked through the press this week, the Government have done a U-turn on out-of-town shopping centres and will therefore apparently be in favour of shopping centres such as Meadowhall in the future and will want them to be linked to environmentally friendly and transport-efficient systems such as the Sheffield supertram. That is another reason why the Government should encourage it.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will bring his remarks quickly back to the substance of the amendment to clause 46 that we are supposed to be debating.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I am grateful, Mrs. Winterton. That was to be the point of my next sentence.
<P>
I conclude by agreeing with my hon. Friend the Member for Ashford that it makes commercial sense for the Government to adopt this sensible and practical amendment. After all, even members of the Government do not use half a factory, half a ship, half a plane or even half a supertram. It is therefore only right that the industrial concerns that are responsible for making large, long-term, capital investments should be given the leeway to make the decisions about financing them when they are near completion and delivery. There is yet another inconsistency. Contrary to the claim that we hear day in and day out from the Labour Benches that the Government are interested in promoting long-term capital investment in UK plc, in fewer than three months they are endeavouring to effect a measure that would seriously damage the large, long-term, capital investment projects that they supposedly support. Therefore, I support my hon. Friend's amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> My hon. Friends have together made a cogent argument in support of their amendment and they may well wish to press it to a vote. I was particularly interested in the remarks that we have just heard about the South Yorkshire supertram. At least one member of the Committee, the hon. Member for Pontefract and Castleford (Yvette Cooper), might have been able to comment on the way in which the issue would affect her constituency. She is not, however, in her place this afternoon. Therefore, we shall not hear her views, as we appear not to be hearing the views of any Labour Members on this matter.
<P>
Mr. Newman has clearly written a blistering letter on the matter. He writes that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``as far as the specific case of Supertram and its funding is concerned, these proposed measures are totally against the public interest in South Yorkshire.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>I fear from my hon. Friends' remarks that that is not the only case of a large project falling foul of the Government's premature and hasty action. For that reason I echo their concern.
<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I am conscious of your comments a moment ago, Mrs. Winterton. As I am on my feet and it is not necessary to debate these matters further on clause stand part, perhaps I may take the opportunity to invite the Financial Secretary to observe a remark from the Arthur Andersen tax group in relation to clause 46, subsection (6), which concerns guarantees. The group expresses concern and would like an assurance that the provision is not intended to extend to guarantees from manufacturers or third parties. That has not been qualified. There may be a problem with tied lessors who are related to a manufacturing concern. As there seems to be potential for a small problem, perhaps the Financial Secretary will address the subject in her comments on the amendment or will undertake to look into it.
<P>
I see that, dead on cue, the hon. Member for Pontefract and Castleford has entered the Room. I appreciate that she may need a moment or two to catch her breath, but as the debate has been about south Yorkshire passenger transport and as she too will have seen the letter from Mr. Newman and I think, though I am prepared to stand corrected, the matter relates to her constituency, I hope that she will join us in expressing some concern about the impact of the clause, because we are all anxious to get it right.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> As I suspect from the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry that we may not be moving to a clause stand part debate, I want to make two quick points. The first relates to film leasing, which we shall come to in clause 48. I should be interested to hear from the Financial Secretary whether clause 46 damages the sale and leaseback arrangements that film-makers frequently use in the production of films. I am not sufficiently au fait with the clause to understand whether the amendment will have an impact on the film financing industry, but I should be grateful for confirmation from the Financial Secretary that it does not damage that industry in this country.
<P>
My second point echoes the one made by my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry about subsection (6). The essence of sale and leaseback anti-avoidance measures, of which there are countless volumes, is to try to highlight situations where the risk is entirely removed from the lessor. Subsection (6) seeks to do that. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Subsection (7) below applies where, in a case falling within paragraphs (a) and (b) of subsection (2)... makes provision... the effect of which... is to remove the whole, or the greater part, of any non-compliance risk which... would fall directly or indirectly on the lessor.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The first part of that paragraph contains in parentheses
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``otherwise than by means of guarantees from persons connected with the lessee''.
<P>
</UL></FONT>Therefore, it clearly excludes guarantees from persons connected with the lessee.
<P>
The question that the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales seeks to have answered is whether the Subsection applies to guarantees from a manufacturer who is not connected with a lessee. In a way that removes the risk of ownership from the lessor, because the manufacturer is giving some form of guarantee as to the safety or continuation of repair of the asset that is being leased. It would be helpful if the Financial Secretary could confirm that the giving of guarantees by manufacturers will not lead to the risk being regarded by the Inland Revenue as not resting with the lessor.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I believe that Mr. Newman, of the South Yorkshire passenger transport executive, has done the Committee a favour by drawing our attention to the effects of the clause. I hope, Mrs. Winterton, that you will allow me a little latitude in my remarks because I understand that you will not have a clause stand part debate. I shall therefore address my remarks to a wider interpretation of the clause. If that is not your intention, I give notice that I should like to speak on clause stand part.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> As we have gone fairly wide, it might help to save time if hon. Members who wanted to speak on clause stand part made their remarks now rather than later.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> That is extremely helpful, Mrs. Winterton.
<P>
The combined effects of the anti-avoidance provisions in clauses 41, 44 and 46 will cause a considerable amount of head-scratching by a great number of financial experts in this country. As I understand it, many of these leasing arrangements revolve around the fact that a trading company which may not have trading profits sufficient to utilise the capital allowances on the value of the plant and machinery that it wishes to acquire can strike a deal with a financial institution which has profits that can utilise those allowances. The anti-avoidance provisions in the clause seek to restrict that.
<P>
On a purist basis, I suppose that cannot be faulted, but these clauses will have a very damaging effect on financial leasing in the private finance initiative, for which there is an increasing need. The tax consequences which these anti-avoidance clauses seek to exclude will also exclude many commercially sound leasing deals which take place in the public interest.
<P>
We are breaking new ground all the time under the public finance initiative. One can imagine many areas of public activity where, when the Government find themselves in a tight financial situation, they may wish to turn to the financial institutions for help. A health authority wishing to purchase a resonance imaging scanner or some as yet uninvented and very expensive equipment for the health service would be a classic example of how a Government and a health trust might wish to turn to the leasing industry for help.
<P>
Would the Financial Secretary look at the combined effect of the clauses 41, 44 and 46 to see whether there is not a case for making a special exception for financial institutions that wish to enter into these leasing arrangements on the PFI, and to see whether the current tax incentives would be retained? It would be a great pity if future PFI money through this route were blocked off specifically because of this clause. I hope that she will be able to consider that idea.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> A number of questions have been raised in this debate. I should first like to make a general point. Opposition Members have got a little carried away about the likely impact of the clauses.
<P>
<B>Mr. Shaun Woodward </B>(Witney): Throughout the Committee, Labour Members have often resorted to the tactic, perhaps even ploy, of suggesting that our comments can be explained by overexcitement. The other day I was reprimanded by the Economic Secretary for my excitement. I should like to put the record straight. I crave the Committee's indulgence, Mrs. Winterton, because I was reprimanded.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman will get another reprimand if he goes on for too long. In chairing this Committee I have failed to ensure that new Members understand that an intervention is meant to be relatively brief.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> I am grateful, Mrs. Winterton. Perhaps I can ask for clarification, because in the course of that reprimand it was suggested that I had referred to a relationship between the chairman of Lloyd's and the Economic Secretary. I made no reference to the chairman of Lloyd's. I am only saying this because the Economic Secretary wanted to invite her civil service officials to become involved in this, and I would not wish to involve them in a matter which did not exist. I am simply saying that hon. Members on the Government Benches tend--it may even be a strategy--to suggest that we are overexcited; and I suggest that if they were given hearing aids it would be of assistance.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I suggest that we hear no more.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I am not following the hon. Gentleman down that path. It has been a long, hot day. That was nice try, but I have never accused the hon. Gentleman of being overexcited. I was suggesting that Opposition Members had rather overstated in their case. I ask them to cast their minds back to the first Finance Bill this year, under the previous Government, which contained a large number of clauses on tax avoidance. Every member of the Committee was subjected to a great deal of lobbying by organisations and companies which did not want to see those loopholes closed, arguing passionately that their representations were central to the future survival of the British economy.
<P>
In pursuing these clauses we are building on the strategy started by the previous Government, on which we all agreed, which is that avoidance, tax leakage and the exploitation of loopholes should be prevented. Nothing that I am saying, however, writes off, undermines or ignores the contribution that financial leasing clearly makes to the British economy.
<P>
I should like to deal first with some general points. The hon. Member for Daventry asked me about the guarantee with regard to Arthur Andersen. A guarantee from a manufacturer will not normally be part of the leasing arrangements and will therefore not trigger the anti-avoidance subsection. I will recheck the position, but that is my understanding and it deals with the point raised.
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Questions were asked about the film industry, but I do not intend to discuss that because we shall come to it on a subsequent clause. The clause, however, does not apply to the new provisions for the film industry.
<P>
Points were made about this country's competitiveness and about our ability to attract inward investment. Rates of corporation tax play a key role in attracting inward investment, and the Government have reduced those rates for large and small companies. That will definitely assist the Government's strategy for investment.
<P>
On long-term investments, I inform the Committee that the clause contains two strands. I cannot agree with Opposition Members who have argued that we should allow capital allowances to lessors who provide no real new finance and are not involved in risk. Not allowing them is the first strand. The other strand is prevention of the sale of past allowances. The Government do not see why it should be right to sell past allowances on new equipment while denying them on used equipment.
<P>
The position of Supertram and the South Yorkshire passenger transport executive is far more complex than Opposition Members have led us to believe. When the company was set up with advice and guidance from the previous Government, it was agreed that there would be no costs to local authorities. I understand that the company is now subject to judicial review, so I shall not discuss it. However, the issue is not as straightforward as hon. Members have made out.
<P>
Clause 46 is designed to block tax leakage. The Government think that it is unacceptable that such an avoidance process continues. The amendments would allow finance lessors to claim capital allowances in no-risk sales and leaseback deals. The Government believe that allowances should be given only when the lessor genuinely incurs expenditure on the assets. We do not believe that allowances are due when the lessor is merely selling the value of the allowance and does not provide real finance.
<P>
The sale of taxable attributes, such as those blocked by the clause, cannot be justified. It is on that basis that I ask the Committee to reject the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Would the Financial Secretary at least give us the assurance that she is prepared to keep an open mind about keeping some of the tax provisions purely for public finance initiative projects? That would be very much in the country's interest.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I apologise to the hon. Gentleman he raised the point about private finance initiatives and I did not deal with it. The Government's commitment to PFIs means that my hon. Friend the Paymaster General is steering through our policies for them. We shall not undermine the essential principles that we have laid out for public-private partnerships, which will be developed. The prevention of tax leakage is a principle on which the Government are not prepared to give way. I ask the Committee to reject the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> First, in responding to the Financial Secretary, I can assure her that I did not move the amendment with a sense of over-excitement or a particular sense of excitement. If the hon. Lady thinks that I wish to speak about finance leasing in order to feel a sense of excitement, her idea of a good time is not mine.
<P>
It is important that we get the Bill right. The amendment is designed to improve the clause by allowing it to stop tax leakages, with which the Financial Secretary is so rightly concerned, without it doing collateral damage to sections of British industry. During the debate we have heard specific examples of the damage that will be caused.
<P>
We have referred to South Yorkshire passenger transport executive's complaint about the Supertram. [Interruption.] I was about to say that it was regrettable that the hon. Member for Pontefract and Castleford disappeared after that subject had been briefly mentioned. The hon. Lady has now returned, however, and I hope that she has been consulting about the local position and about the letter from Mr. Newman that all members of the Committee, including the hon. Lady, have received. Mr. Newman makes the point starkly that 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``these proposed measures are totally against the public interest in South Yorkshire.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am not an expert on transport in south Yorkshire, which is a long way from my constituency. [Hon. Members: ``Pontefract and Castleford are in west Yorkshire.''] The hon. Lady's constituency is the nearest one that I could find. If she says that she has no knowledge of passenger transport in south Yorkshire, I shall happily accept that and excuse her. I merely ask her to urge her colleagues in the relevant regional Labour group to take notice of the problem. It is all very well for Labour Members to tell us why we lost the election, but if they are so insouciant--[Hon. Members: ``Ooh!''] I regret such an outburst.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am most grateful to my hon. Friend, who is making a powerful case. However, in view of the word that he has just used --I suspect that the Chairman did not hear it and that it might be out of order--does he feel that the influence of his constituency's proximity to our neighbour across the channel is important? Will he confirm that the Pas de Calais is now widely described as lower Kent?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I suggest that the hon. Member for Ashford does not go down that path.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I was going to make the point, Mrs. Winterton, that, as the Committee was very happy to hear my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford use the phrase ``timeo Danaos et dona ferentis'' with no problem, the word ``insouciant'' was capable of being understood even by Labour Members, who seem to take an overtly nationalistic view of the use of the English language.
<P>
Labour Members also seem to take an overtly regional view of the damage being done to public transport. We have heard much about the importance of public transport from Labour Members--whether they are from south or west Yorkshire or other points west, east and north. The clause directly damages an extremely important public transport project, and the director of that project says that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``these proposed measures are totally against the public interest''.
<P>
</UL></FONT>However, we have not heard a single serious contribution from those on the Government Benches that defends the clause against that charge. It is--[Interruption.]
<P>
If Labour Members want to sit and barrack, that is fine. However, the next time that they make a speech about the importance of public transport, they will have to explain to their constituents why they all sat completely mute when an important public transport project was discussed and when the people who are involved in it--not Conservative Members--
<P>
<B>Lorna Fitzsimons </B>(Rochdale): I would be interested in what the hon. Gentleman knows about the previous Government's record on public transport, especially on bus deregulation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> Bus deregulation increased mileage by 16 per cent. There are many extremely good bus services. I invite the hon. Lady to enjoy the many excellent Kent bus services.
<P>
<B>Lorna Fitzsimons:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> May I reply to the hon. Lady's first intervention before she is provoked into making another? The hon. Lady is welcome to visit Kent to enjoy its many excellent public transport facilities. Most of them were set up under the previous Government. The Government, through the careless use of the clause, will make it less likely that authorities will use the private finance initiative or any other initiative for public transport projects. If the hon. Lady cares about public transport, she should support the amendment.
<P>
<B>Lorna Fitzsimons:</B> In terms of the record on public transport--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I hope that the hon. Lady will relate her remarks to the clause and amendments that we are debating.
<P>
<B>Lorna Fitzsimons:</B> I am seeking merely to challenge the hon. Gentleman's comments, which pertain to the amendment. The hon. Gentleman seems to have been converted to the cause of public transport. Given his other conversion to championing Welsh connections in hon. Members' family trees, did he know that, since bus deregulation, 33 million journeys a year in Wales no longer occur?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I suggest to you, Mr. Green, that you do not pursue that point. It has nothing to do with the subject of our debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> The hon. Lady's comments combine irrelevance with idiocy. Labour Members can bluster as much as they like, but they cannot avoid the point that those involved in public transport in south Yorkshire believe that the Government will damage their interests. The point does not come directly from Conservative Members. We are simply presenting the views of those who run an important public transport project in south Yorkshire. The hon. Lady may quote irrelevant figures from Wales, but Labour Members have no answer to the central point. The people of south Yorkshire will hold them to account for the damage that they inflict and for being unable to make a relevant point to support their action.

<P>

<B>Kali Mountford </B>(Colne Valley): The south Yorkshire deal for Supertram predates 2 July. The contract was signed on 31 March.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> That is precisely the point. An extremely successful project has been developing for some time. It will be damaged by the Finance Bill. We have all received the same letter. The project was succeeding until the Government devised clause 46. If Labour Members care about the project's future, they should support the amendment.
<P>
The Financial Secretary said that she wanted to close loopholes. We have tabled an amendment instead of opposing the clause outright to allow the Government to close loopholes while preventing the damage that the measure could create in various parts of British industry. The provision will affect other industries as well as transport.
<P>
The Financial Secretary claimed that she was worried about the future of the finance leasing industry, and paid tribute to its good work. However, her words ring hollow because provisions in the Bill will damage the finance leasing industry and, therefore, many other British industries, which take advantage of it to develop their businesses. Warm words combined with cold actions will not go down well with those industries.
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>

We have discussed long-term new developments. The lessors provide new finance to allow new investments to develop. They will be caught in an attempt to plug a loophole, and that is not worth the candle. The clause inflicts more damage than it is worth. I shall press the amendment to a Division.

Clause 46 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 47</center></H4>
<H4><center>Meaning of ``finance lease''</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I shall be brief--I do not often intervene to consider the technical definition of clauses. However, I shall present two points that the Arthur Andersen tax group made to us.
<P>
First, the group questioned whether it was sensible to devise a new definition of ``finance lease'' rather than adapting the existing definition in schedule 12(30(i) of the Finance Act 1997.
<P>
The second point relates to proposed new subsection 82A(1)(b) and whether it is confined to United Kingdom companies. Do all parties have to be UK companies? The clause is ambiguous. I do not ask the Financial Secretary to respond definitively now if she will undertake to re-examine the clause with experts and those who raised the queries, to ensure that we get it right.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I want to make a couple of general points that arise from the clause. Clause 47(1) inserts a new section 82A into the Capital Allowances Act 1990. Proposed new section 82A(1)(b) states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``in cases where the lessor and persons connected with the lessor are all UK companies . . . the arrangements . . . fall, in accordance with normal accountancy practice''.
<P>
</UL></FONT>The use of the term ``finance lease'' with
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``in accordance with normal accountancy practice''
<P>
</UL></FONT>should be welcomed. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford that the move towards an accountancy-based tax system is welcome. It avoids the enormous complexity and expense of preparing two sets of accounts--one for accounting purposes, and then a computation based on that, so that the accounts are in accordance with tax legislation. Is not it better to try to go along, as the clause to some extent would--at least with respect to definitions--with the accountancy definitions and accountancy basis of determining the profits that are chargeable to corporation tax? I have always perceived leasing as almost a vanguard in such a move. The relevant statement of practice for the first time made accountancy depreciation deductible for tax purposes. That is the only area, as far as I am aware, in which that applies, instead of the statutory-based capital allowances. It is to be welcomed that there is another element of leasing tax law that introduces an accountancy basis to the calculation of profit.
<P>
New section 82A(2) that clause 47 will insert into the Capital Allowances Act 1990 deals with the definition of accounts. It states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``accounts', in relation to a company, includes any consolidated group accounts relating to two or more companies of which that company is one''.
<P>
</UL></FONT>That causes me more concern than does the previous definition of accountancy. The use of group accounts is another growing trend in Inland Revenue dealings with the taxpayer. The representations from the Institute of Directors also expressed concern about that. I know of two examples of the Inland Revenue's beginning to use group accounts. The first concerns transfer pricing and the second concerns the debt equity provisions. The Inland Revenue is trying to limit the amount of interest deduction that can be obtained for debt. In examining the debt to equity ratios, the Inland Revenue concerns itself with the group account, rather than individual company accounts. That takes taxation quite far along a different road from the one along which it has been going in the past decades--that of taxation on a company-by-company basis.
<P>
The growing use of group accounts is a move towards the American system, in which accounts are filed on a consolidated basis. That is not our present basis for taxation, and I deprecate any insidious change of policy in the matter. If the Inland Revenue wants to change United Kingdom corporation tax to one based on group accounts, a debate should take place in the House of Commons, so that hon. Members could discuss the merits and demerits of the move. There should not be an attempt to sneak it in. I remember that the Keith committee took a long-term view about how the future of taxation should be approached.
<P>
I should prefer a full and frank debate. My view is that the current system works fine. Every change to the system adds to the complexity and expense and to difficulty in understanding matters, among the accountancy profession and among the Inland Revenue officials. The more complex the tax system becomes, the less the rule of law applies. When complexities overwhelm the accountancy profession and Inland Revenue officials, there is a tendency for them to reach a deal. Tax should be paid not on the basis of a deal, but on the basis of a statute.
<P>
The use of group accounts is not welcome to me or to the Institute of Directors. If we are to attempt to develop such an approach, let us debate the matter before legislating on it.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> New section 82A that clause 47 would insert into the Capital Allowances Act 1990 provides that the meaning of the term ``finance lease'' accords with that in United Kingdom accounting practice. The hon. Member for Daventry asked whether the definition is the same as that in the Finance Act 1997.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> More precisely, why is that definition being modified? Why is the concept in the previous legislation being made slighty different--presumably for the same effect?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The definition in the previous legislation was included with meausres to stop forms of tax avoidance. The reason for our not using the earlier definition is that it would have involved complexities unnecessary to the present Bill. We though that use of the entire definition would be unhelpful.
<P>
The answer to the question of the hon. Member for Daventry about proposed new section 82A(1)(b) is yes--as I am advised by the nearby parliamentary counsel. I hope that that clarifies the matter for the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I do not wish to trap the Financial Secretary, becuase the issue is very complicated and technical. She has answered me yes. My question concerned the fact that, from the technical submissions made to me, the matter appeared to be ambiguous. I am sure that the Financial Secretary did not mean that the Government's answer was that the matter was ambiguous. I presume she intended to convey that the Government's answer was full and sufficiently clear. I would ask her--not under the pressure of the present Committee sitting--to reflect again on the point before Report, and, in the spirit of the Committee, to consider further, if it appears that there is any element that is ambiguous or capable of improvement.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I understood the hon. Member for Daventry to have been asking whether proposed new section 82A(1)(b) of the Capital Allowances Act 1990 would include arrangements entered into by non-United Kingdom companies, and the answer to that question was yes. If there has been a misunderstanding, perhaps the hon. Gentleman would write to me for clarification.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton asked about group accounts. That rule is needed to prevent lessors from getting round the rules by fragmenting the leasing arrangements so that, from the point of view of the leasing company, the lease is an operational lease, but from the point of view of the group as a whole, it is a finance lease. That is very specific to the provisions in the group of clauses that we are now considering.
<P>
Question put and agreed to:
<P>
Clause 47 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 48</center></H4>
<H4><center>Relief for expenditure on production and acquisition</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>The Paymaster General (Mr. Geoffrey Robsinson):</B> I am sure that the clause will be acclaimed in Committee. It will also be a welcome relief from some of the arcane technicalities in the clauses immeidately preceding it. After all, the world of film is one into which we can all enter with great enjoyment, and it is in that spirit that we approach the clause this evening.
<P>
There are many grounds for my commending the clause to the Committee--including the world-wide currency of and the cultural advantage furnished by our language; the outstanding array of talent in our acting profession; the great range of skills in our studios among technicians and producers and, not least, the support of Lord Attenborough and Sir David Puttnam, who are great supporters of our parliamentary institutions, as Opposition Members will know. We welcome their support for the measure, and that of the acting profession, producers and related professions.
<P>
In simple terms, the clause provides for a 100 per cent. write-off against taxable profits once the film is completed for production and acquisition expenditure on British qualifying films--that can be defined with great exactitude if that would be for the convenience of the Committee; at this stage, we cannot take it as read--which cost &#163;15 million or less to make. The relief will be time-limited to costs incurred during the three years from Budget day and will apply to production and acquisition costs of films completed after Budget day.
<P>
<H5>6.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
This is a defined and limited measure; it is to encourage films that meet the criteria to be made in Britain to contribute to our output in a sector that is growing very quickly. For example, I am informed--I believe that it is a reliable estimate, although as a Member representing a west midlands constituency it gives me no pleasure to repeat it--that the film industry in Britain now employs more people, and is growing faster, than the motor industry and related engineering sectors.
<P>
For that broad combination of reasons I commend the clause to the Committee. I hope that it will be accepted with the acclamation that it deserves and certainly without a Division.

<P>

<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> This is an important clause. By and large, because we wish the film industry well, we welcome it, but with some qualifications and questions.
<P>
I understand why some Labour Members are excited--dare I say over-excited?--by the clause. It is not only because it has a tendency to attract the interest of lovable individuals such as Lord Attenborough and Sir David Puttnam but because it is a source of inspiration to hon. Gentlemans. However, judging by the performance of Members on the Government Benches, I have to say that it might have been more appropriate if the clause had been strictly confined to silent movies, or gave a special subsidy for films such as ``Dumb and Dumber''.
<P>
As I considered why Labour Members were so excited by the clause, I thought of the sort of films that the Prime Minister might enjoy during weekends at his country retreat, Chequers. Films such as ``The First Great Train Robbery'', the 1903 version in which a ruthless crook picks up a front bench gang to help him to rob the people, and the 1968 classic ``Pretty Poison'', an everyday story about a psychotic arsonist came to mind. There are others: all hon. Members must have seen films such as the 1943 classic, ``The More the Merrier''.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. It may be the more the merrier, but it must relate to tax and the hon. Gentleman should think about that before he rises again.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> Indeed, Mrs. Winterton. That is why I was not going to mention that famous 1941 film, ``Never Give a Sucker an Even Break''. Glancing quickly through my notes on films such as ``Trouble in Paradise'', ``Touch of Evil'', and ``You Can't Take it with You'', which may be a reference to future inheritance tax, I find myself wanting to speak specifically about the matter.
<P>
<B>Liz Blackman </B>(Erewash): Perhaps the reason why so many Labour Members sit silently is that we feel unable to respond to the unmitigated twaddle that we have heard, of which the hon. Gentleman's contribution is an example.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> I am grateful for the hon. Lady's intervention which has raised the standard of debate no end and reveals the level of political dialogue of which members of the Labour party are capable.
<P>
There are five important reasons why the clause should receive our consideration. The first problem is that the clause defines a film as being ``completed'' when it is first ready for presentation to the public. That is open to interpretation, as films often run through a series of stages and may thus fall outside the three-year period.
<P>
The second reason relates to the definition of a British film, about which, having studied work on the British film industry in detail, I know there is genuine debate. Although I do not want to delay the Committee on the matter, I know that hon. Members would welcome a clear definition from the Paymaster General, either in the Committee or subsequently.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> This is an extremely important issue for film finance, as it has always been. Regardless of the terms of the clause, I understand that many of the films that we regard as British, such as ``Four Weddings and a Funeral'' are not British films and would not qualify as such under the terms of the clause. Other films, such as the Terminator series, are technically British because of their financing arrangements. Those who have hailed the mesasure as a way to promote specifically British films and thereby to encourage British culture may be misleading themselves. If the terms of the clause are not drawn correctly it could lead to the British taxpayer subsidising what, by any other name, are simply Hollywood blockbusters.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend. I am sure that the Paymaster General will wish to take note of his comments.
<P>
The third reason relates to the figure of &#163;15 million. I want to know why that figure was alighted upon.
<P>
The fourth reason concerns the three-year period from Budget day. Why three years? Why only films in production after Budget day?
<P>
Although the help that the measure provides for the film industry is welcome, my fifth reason relates to the proposal's lack of coherence and rationale. Why have the Government seen fit to create such a distortion when they are anxious to remove distortions from other tax sectors?
<P>
I declare my interest in the matter: I am a regular film goer, like the hon. Member for Daventry's mother, with whom I have not had the pleasure of attending the cinema, although I look forward to that prospect very soon. [Interruption.] I am not sure whether the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Murphy) wants to intervene.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jim Murphy </B>(Eastwood): No, it was a sneeze.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> I think that that passes for an intervention. My interest dates back to when I was a child and had my first super 8mm camera, later progressing to a video camera. I spent a number of years working at the BBC. I confess that my honeymoon was not embellished by my confusing the on and off buttons on our video camera and recording many happy moments which I did not intend to film and which provided much interest.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> This is an important point. Can my hon. Friend tell us whether he filmed enough material to qualify for a grant under the terms of the clause? Perhaps the Paymaster General could consider whether, if there are golden British rushes lying in the archives, they may, under the clause, qualify for tax relief.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> I am grateful for my hon. Friend's intervention. Let me just say that my mother would not have enjoyed the film, by Andy Warhol would. I attended a film course given by the British Film Institute which was a considerable source of education. I pay tribute to the work of the BFI in the film industry generally because it has been a serious institution during difficult years for the British film industry.
<P>
The clause is doubtless well intended, but I am not sure that it has been entirely thought through. Labour's rhetoric will tell us that the clause puts right the terrible boom-bust years of the Conservative Government; Labour will give us much more of the claptrap that we have heard over the past few days. But the British film industry is in a good state after 18 years of Conservative Government. One of Labour's many inheritances is an extremely successful film industry.
<P>
Investment in the British film industry is at record levels. All major UK film studios are in full production. Pinewood recently shot ``Mission: Impossible'' and is currently shooting ``The Day of the Jackal''. Pinewood has a backlog. Shepperton is also busy: ``Richard III'' was made there recently, as were ``101 Dalmations'' and ``Evita''. It may interest the Labour party to know that ``The Borrowers'' is also a production there. Elstree is making ``Watch That Man'', which is not a reference to the hon. Member for Hartlepool (Mr. Mandelson). Under the lottery--[Interruption.] I will happily give way if anyone wishes.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Would the hon. Member for Croydon, Central (Mr. Davies) like to make an intervention?
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies</b>--indicated dissent<P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> I am grateful, Mrs. Winterton. It is difficult to make sense of the grunts of Labour Members and your clarification of an extended ejection from the throat of a Labour Member was useful.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> My hon. Friend is surely aware of method acting. Does not he feel that it has been exemplified here today?
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> I understand that such acting will feature in ``Dumb and Dumber 2'', which will shortly go into production.
<P>
Help has also been given to the film industry by the lottery. Some 109 productions were awarded funds and 58 received funding for capital and equipment. That has done much to boost the industry. Under the Conservative Government, the green light fund and British screen finance were organised to make &#163;5 million of lottery money available.
<P>
The film industry is in good shape, with production at the highest level for 40 years. Last year, 127 films were made, which compares with about 10 films in 1986. British films are also taking a higher share of box office receipts than in many years. Indeed, 1997 will be seen as one of the most successful years the British film industry has had. There were 30 Oscar nominations for British films, including 12 for ``The English Patient''. Labour may be keen to note that ``Secrets and Lies'' won the Palme D'Or at Cannes.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Wittingdale </B>(Maldon and Chelmsford, East): I hate to correct my hon. Friend's knowledgeable and informative address, but I regret to inform him that ``The English Patient'', under the definition employed by the clause, is not a British film.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that intervention. He may know that we have not only been successful in our films, but with some of the songs written for films, such as ``You must love me'', which the Prime Minister so likes, in ``Evita''.
<P>
I have established the inheritance that we left in the film industry. The central question underlying the clause is how the British film industry can take a substantial share of the world film market. Will the clause allow the industry to benefit and increase its market share.?
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies </B>(Croydon, Central): I do not want to propose new films, which might include ``Dial M for Mortgage'' or ``Carry on Talking''. You mentioned 146 new films--how many of them had a production budget of less than &#163;15 million? The whole point of our debate is to inject new vigour into small productions and new films rather than simply to sit back and say that ``Evita'' was filmed here. We want home-grown culture and success, which generates jobs and prosperity for Britain. Do you know the answer to my question or were we simply hearing verbiage?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman should not use the word ``you''; he should have asked his question of the hon. Member for Witney (Mr. Woodward), who will now respond.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his intervention and I welcome the opportunity to respond. Most of the films that I mentioned--with the exception of ``Dumb and Dumber'', which might be appropriate in this context, and ``Mission Impossible''--had a budget of much less than &#163;15 million. If the hon. Gentleman were to take home with him later this evening a copy of that excellent book ``Halliwell's''--which I am sure he is anxious to do--he would realise that most of those films were made well before the 1950s and for much less than &#163;15 million. If they had had a budget of that sum, that would have been a considerable achievement.
<P>
<B>Mr Geraint Davies:</B> The hon. Gentleman mentioned recently produces films--I think that he quoted the figure of 146 films in recent times; in fact, I thought that he was referring to the number of films made last year. Of those films, how many were produced for a budget of less than &#163;15 million? We are obviously not interested in old films.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> Now that the hon. Gentleman has been precise in his question--which he was not before--I can tell him that an answer can easily be obtained--[Laughter.] This is a very important clause. I have already signalled the fact that I want to discuss why the figure of &#163;15 million was selected. The hon. Member for Croydon, Central asked how many successful films last year were made for a budget of less than &#163;15 million. That is the only time that he has contributed to our debate. If he wants to make a proper contribution to our debate he should make a speech, and we look forward to hearing a positive contribution from him. However, we all know that if he were to do so he would be off-message and paged into oblivion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> The simple fact that the hon. Gentleman is incapable of saying how many recently produces films were made for less than &#163;15 million shows that he does not have a clear grasp of the clause, about which he is attempting to deliver a speech, or of the fact that it will help to generate new films. A very small proportion of the films that he mentioned was made for less than that sum. The clause is about generating new opportunities.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman--
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> Perhaps I can help my hon. Friend. It is patently clear that Labour Members have no knowledge about or grasp of the relevant figures. In 1995--which is the latest year for which figures are available--the average cost of a major UK film was &#163;5.19 million, which suggests that many of the films that my hon. Friend mentioned were made for less than &#163;15 million. The additional help is supposedly designed to assist in the production of such films, but they managed to cope without it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend. I wonder whether the hon. Member for Croydon, Central can make any intelligent use of those figures. I should be happy to give way to him at this point if he wants to make an intervention and is able to add something useful to our debate. I notice that a message is coming through on his paper; no, it seems that nothing has come through--[Interruption.] I give way--no, he was merely grunting.
<P>
The central question is whether the British film industry will take a substantial share of the world's film market as a result of the changes. The clause does not deal with distribution and exhibition, and I must ask whether it should have done. Although the clause provides help for film production, and I would question that, the figures that I quoted for the number of films made last year--which the hon. Member for Croydon, Central tried, but failed, to make such clever use of--demonstrate that film production is healthy but distribution and exhibition are not. So it is distribution and exhibition that need help.
<P>
Distribution and exhibition throughout the United Kingdom are dominated by multinational media companies. Conservative Members have no problem with multinational media companies, which is why we put in place policies to welcome multinational media companies and why, yesterday, when we were discussing multinationals, we made clear our objections to the Government's proposals in the Finance Bill.
<P>
We are concerned that the film industry needs help with distribution, but clause 48 does not provide that help. In the United States, film is one of the largest industries. Hollywood Studios integrates production, distribution and overseas exhibition and, therefore, has total control. The Hollywood industry has done so well as a money-making and film production apparatus because of the way in which it has embraced distribution.
<P>
I see that the hon. Member for Croydon, Central looks dubious about what I am saying, so to save him rising to intervene, let me tell him that the US dominance of the UK cinema market is somewhere between 85 per cent. and 90 per cent. That is the heart of the problem. We need not only to make more cheap films--most of us would agree that &#163;15 million is a lot of money, but it is not in terms of making films--but to consider how to distribute them worldwide and break the lock that multinational media companies have on the distribution and exhibition industry in this country.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I invite my hon. Friend to consider the situation in other European countries, where the dominance of American-made films is almost as great as it is in the United Kingdom, despite the fact that those countries must contend with language barriers that do not apply here. Even more pertinent to the clause, some of those countries, particularly France, operate an even more generous system of subsidy than the Government propose in the clause. The result is a stockpile of unwatched French films because French viewers still want to see Hollywood productions. The problem identified by the hon. Member for Woodward is not unique to this country; it is universally true. The combination of distribution and the product's attractiveness is more important than the direct subsidy for production.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> My hon. Friend makes an important point. One of my concerns is that the provisions will lead to the stockpiling of films which will not be properly distributed in the UK. With the growth of Channel 5, digital broadcasting and cable channels, those companies may be desperate for a product to show and may screen those films without the industry making large amounts of money. I wonder whether the provision is the most effective way in which to proceed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> The purpose of the clause is to focus money effectively on generating quality products for delivery to the domestic and international market. Many multiplex cinema opportunities are emerging throughout Britain. For example, in Croydon, one multiplex cinema with 10 or 12 screens is already being built, two are in the pipeline and there are planning applications for more. Multiplex cinemas with perhaps 12 screens offer an opportunity to test the market for marginal films that may be domestically produced to decide whther they are commercially viable. The prospect of the Government trying to take on multinational distribution companies such as Warner Bros, which is based in the United States, would be a farcical use of Government money. Any attempt to tackle the might of such companies head on would be wrong and I am surprised--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I hope that the hon. Member for Croydon, Central will bring his comments to an end. They are too long for an intervention.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> I am grateful to you, Mrs. Winterton.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Following that rather long intervention, may I ask my hon. Friend briefly to confirm that there is no reference in the clause to the quality of the product and that it would be open to any film-maker to produce average rubbish--we all have different ideas about quality. Even smut or pornography would not be precluded by the clause if it was within the laws covering obscenity.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> My hon. Friend makes a fair point about the observations of the hon. member for Croydon, Central. It would be farcical to suggest the sort of intervention that he proposed and we are not doing so. We are observing that, effectively, a closed shop operates in America and controls not only the production, but the distribution and exhibition. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman's constituents are grateful for the sort of multiplexes to which he referred, but the reality is that they will see American-made films. I do not know who owns the multiplex in Croydon, Central, but many are owned by companies such as Warner Bros, which want to show American-made films because they are part of an overall chain. There is a legitimate question to be asked about how to break up that closed shop. That is not the same as suggesting the sort of intervention to which the hon. Gentleman referred.
<P>
Last year, the Middleton committee considered the subject of film finance and I have no doubt that the Paymaster General and his Treasury team took note of the committee's report. That report informs much of the rationale of the clause, which is welcome. The report is important and much of it provides ready justification for the clause. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Committee identified three types of barriers that were impeding the growth of the British film industry: structural problems concerning the way in which the industry is organised; financial problems reflecting the unique nature of film investment; and perceptual difficulties attributable at least in part to the lack of effective communication between the worlds of film and finance.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I quoted that because it identifies three areas, but the clause, which seeks to help the film industry, addresses only one of those issues. Is that the right place to target help?
<P>
<H5>7.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Middleton committee rightly considered distribution. Its report said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``British producers are generally under-capitalised and raise money for their productions on a film-by-film basis. This places them in a weak negotiating position with distributors who usually acquire the valuable rights in the films they distribute, giving them the opportunity to exploit their long-term potential. As a consequence, those films which are successful benefit exhibitors and distributors before the producer realises any profit. It also means that producers are unable to spread risk across a slate of films, offer proven financial management and produce a recognisable track record to attract investors.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
To redress that problem, the committee recommended a new industry structure to focus on achieving effective distribution of British-produced films and on harnessing the distribution effort to the benefit of producers and financial backers. The model favoured by the Middleton committee is a distribution-led studio approach--albeit without the physical production facilities--which would bring institutional and trade investment together in a film company capitalised at a higher level than ever seen in the UK. The aim would be to create a structure within which investors could cross-collateralise their risks over a portfolio of films, offsetting any losses against profits made on the studio's successes.

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. On that point, I shall suspend the Committee for the dinner break. I shall take the Chair again at 9 o'clock when the hon. Gentleman will have the opportunity to finish his speech.

<H5>7.17 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Sitting suspended.
<P>
<H5>9 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
On resuming--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Before I call Mr. Woodward to speak, may I say again that interventions should be relatively brief; they should not be speeches in their own right? Any hon. Member who wishes to speak may be fortunate enough to catch my eye. Perhaps in the final few hours [Hon. Members: ``Hour.'']--sorry, in the final hour of the debate we can conform.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> Mrs. Winterton, what a pleasure it is to return to this tour of Halliwell's film guide. I accept your ruling about not discussing individual films so I shall not discuss ``Dark Victory'' or ``The More the Merrier''--a film which Halliwell refers to as having no more substance that a water melon: I shall instead return to the subject in hand, distribution.
<P>
Before we adjourned for dinner, we were discussing the importance of focusing on distribution in order to help the British film industry. I note that to encourage film investment in the United Kingdom, the Middleton committee, whose report we discussed earlier, thought that the most effective way of doing so would be to allow film makers to write off 100 per cent. of production costs in the year that they are incurred. This is close to the Government's proposal in the clause, but the distinction is in the phrase ``in the year incurred''.
<P>
The Middleton committee identified the way in which writing off helped the United States film industry, and the way that it could help in the UK. I have a couple of questions that I should like the Minister to answer. First, why have the Government decided to allow the write-off only when a film has been completed, rather than in the year in which costs are incurred, as the committee recommends.
<P>
My second question relates to the definition of a British film. My hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Mr. Loughton) also has a number of questions on this issue. The Middleton inquiry looked at this issue, and stated in chapter 7(16) of its report:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``If the British film industry is to benefit from the range of measures described above, it is important to have a clear idea of what constitutes a British film. The existing definition of a British film included in Schedule 1 of the Films Act 1985 is held by many in the industry to be complex, restrictive and a deterrent to potential investors. The Committee proposes an alternative definition based on a straightforward economic test of where the bulk of the expenditure on each film takes place. The Committee recommends that the Government should consult the industry on the revised definition before seeking secondary legislation to implement the change.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
My questions to the Government are as follows: did those consultations take place when the clause was being drafted to incorporate the change; did the Government adopt the committee's recommendations?
<P>
A third point relates to the ceiling of &#163;15 million. It is worth nothing that of the 121 feature films produced in the UK in 1966, 53 were low-budget--which may be of interest to my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, Central. Of course, ``low-budget'' can mean ``high-earning''. ``Four Weddings and a Funeral'', which I am sure all hon. Members have seen, cost only &#163;3 million, yet it took more than &#163;200 million world-wide: it was a highly successful film. One point arising here is whether the Government's proposals in the Bill would assist the making of more such films. As I understand it--I shall come to this point later--one of the important aspects of that film, for which they produced funding, was its marketing. Again I question whether what the Government propose is the best way of helping the British film industry given that the time at which its film is being marketed, after completion, is often the most useful time for an injection of funds.
<P>
Sir Sydney Samuelson, the head of the British Film Commission, has noted:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``It is still unbelievably difficult to get the finances together to make a British film even though it may have only an eighth or tenth of the budget of an American film.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is clearly a basic problem, which is why the Government have been persuaded to introduce some of these legislative proposals.
<P>
However, the proposal is that only British films costing less than &#163;15 million can be written off against tax liability. Why have the Government chosen &#163;15 million? Why not &#163;10 million of &#163;20 million? We seek clarification on that, as we do on the question why write-off is available only when a film has been completed.
<P>
Our debate has touched on many matters relating to distribution. There is no question but that the clause's proposals overall are welcome. But they do not address the distribution issue. I readily acknowledge that in 1985 a Conservative Government scrapped the 75 per cent. tax break, but at that time only few films were being made. Since the scrapping of the 75 per cent. relief, the number of British films produced has risen dramatically. Again, it may be helpful if the Paymaster General clarifies the Government's objectives and the way in which the proposal can be measured, so that we may have some idea whether this is a sensible use of public money at a time when large numbers of British films are being made.
<P>
As 127 films were made last year, do the Government have some yardstick for future years by which to judge the value of using this public money? Perhaps the Paymaster General will give an idea of what figure he seeks as a barometer of success. It will not be good enough for him simply to say that more people go to cinemas now. Last year, cinema audiences were sold 120 million tickets--double the number for 1985 when the 75 per cent. tax break applied. Again we must question what effect the present proposal for more cash will have.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I do not know whether my hon. Friend has seen the Red Book, which shows that this measure will cost &#163;20 milion in the coming two years--not a huge sum. With his great knowledge of the subject, has he undertaken any research into how the money might be used more effectively in the industry, or research into what its effect will be under clause 48?
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> My hon. Friend asks an important question. I have asked around, but it does not seem clear what impact the money, given its intended use, will have. Remembering the observations of my hon. Friend the Member for Ashford, the danger is that it will simply mean that although the films that will be made will be worthy, memorable films of the kind and quality of ``Last Year in Marienbad'' may be made again but will have their outing only at exhibition centres with very small screens such as those used at my British Film Institute film classes. There is no question but that ``Last Year in Mariendbad'' is a sensationally interesting film, provided one is not looking for entertainment value. It has enormous merits and I learnt a great deal about such films from my course at the British Film Institute. I cannot imagine however, that hon. Members' mothers, fathers or other relatives will be flocking to the multiplex cinemas throughout the country to take the opportunity to see it. The lesson is that to get the British film industry going we need to start making inroads on the distributor-exhibitor relationship.
<P>
American studios operate a closed shop. They work exclusively with their own distribution arms in the UK. In turn, those have close relationships with American-owned cinemas such as Warner Brothers. Cinema audiences have increased dramatically in the UK--the public have returned in their millions--but the problem is that they are watching American films. There is nothing wrong with American films as such: I welcome them. If however, the object of the clause is to promote the British film industry, there is a danger that it will not achieve that. It may help more films to be made, but that will not necessarily contribute to more films being shown to wider audiences.
<P>
A new cinema complex is being constructed at Battersea, and I welcome the work of Victor Lang and others who have helped to construct such a sensational new complex--it may have 32 cinemas. That is welcome: it will provide many jobs and opportunities for people to pursue their leisure interests in the cinema industry. However, the question is who will be the distributor-exhibitor in this new operation. If it will continue the practice of a closed shop, more British films may be made but there will not necessarily be more British films shown on the wide screen.
<P>
That brings me to the importance of marketing. I mentioned earlier that much of the budget for ``Four Weddings and a Funeral'' had been directed to marketing. From their experience at the last general election--I say this with due deference--the Government know a great deal about marketing. It would be interesting to hear from the Paymaster General how much the budget to help the British film industry will allow for improvements in marketing.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for giving way so early in his speech. Does he agree that the central economic fact about successful film making in the 1990s is that major films make more money from spin-off products than from the film itself? It is an economic fact of life that the dolls, the toys, the videos--all the marketing paraphernalia that used to be the subset of the money made by the major studios--are now the main revenue generator. Indeed, films are planned and made specifically with those marketing products in mind. Will my hon. Friend assess the chances of this relatively modest subsidy breaking substantially into that sort of market?
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> There is no question that the merchandising and branding of films--one thinks of the ``Batman'' and the ``Star Wars'' series--is crucial, and I should like to provide some more perspective about that.
<P>
The average American studio will spend up to &#163;30 million merely on marketing a big blockbuster movie. It may be helpful for the hon. Member for Croydon, Central, who asked such penetrating questions about the amount of money spent on film production, to take note of the amount of money spent on marketing alone in America.

<P>

<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman suggesting that in a fixed budget we take all the money and spend it on marketing films that we do not make? The point here is to make films--if the product is good, the marketing and distribution will surely follow.
<P>
<H5>9.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes an interesting observation. I am not sure that anyone has proposed that one should market the invisible film. Indeed, no one is suggesting that before the product is put together we should even consider marketing it.
<P>
I have a feeling that we are not targeting the point where the problem occurs. We do not have a problem with film production--that is why there has been a 12-fold increase in the number of films being made in this country since 1986. The problem is in getting the films distributed and exhibited. Marketing is a crucial ploy in breaking through the closed shop. It was a very clever use of marketing that allowed the makers of ``Four Weddings and a Funeral'' to break through that closed shop in America and then subsequently.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> Perhaps there is a case for some film title product mis-selling to be investigated by the hon. Member for Croydon, Central. It sounds as though he has been suckered into buying the memorabilia for ``Three Weddings and a Funeral'', ``Jurassic Lawn'' or ``Mission Slightly Unfeasible''.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> I am grateful for that intervention. Another problem in the film industry is the shortage of skilled people. That problem bears scrutiny if we are considering where subsidy--if, indeed, that is a good idea--should be placed.
<P>
What encouragement does this clause give to invest in good technicians? There is no question that the United Kingdom film industry has many camera operators, cinematographers, production managers, and so on, many of whom have come from the television industry. That is an area of which I can speak with some knowledge. When I left university, after a brief time pursuing one or two other careers, I settled at the BBC, where I spent 10 years. When I went there in 1981 it could veritably have been described as a cottage industry of sorts. People went there because they felt vocationally drawn to making films, documentaries and television programmes. We were trained there. We effectively had scholarships there. Some people were trained to work in sound, some in cameras, some in lighting, some in make-up, some in research, right the way across the board.
<P>
One thing that has happened at the BBC--it happened before at ITV--is that such training has disappeared. I do not necessarily condemn the BBC for allowing that to happen, but it is true that the training ground that the post-Reithian BBC provided has gone.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I should like the hon. Gentleman to bring his remarks back to the clause that we are debating. There is so much background noise that it is difficult to hear what the hon. Gentleman is saying anyway--it would be courteous if members of the Committee would listen.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> I am grateful to you, Mrs. Winterton. The relevance of the discussion is to focus on the clause and to find out where the money is being directed. We need to know whether the substantial amounts of public money that will be spent under the clause will be put to good use. As one identifies the problems in the British film industry--of distribution and exhibition, and pending skills shortages--one has to ask whether the money will be well spent and therefore whether the clause should stand part of the Bill. Again, I cite Roy Lockett, the deputy general secretary of the Broadcasting, Entertainment and Cinematograph Technicians' Union--BECTU--who himself said that there is a growing skills crisis in the film industry.
<P>
I hope that my support for film making has been crystal clear throughout the debate. There is no question that the proposals will help, but how much will they help, and are they the right way in which to help?
<P>
There is a final, crucial question, which relates to the problem of the Government's rationale--a problem that we have explored in almost every clause of the Bill. The Government have said repeatedly that the purpose behind many of their changes to the corporate tax system is to remove distortions and create a simplified tax system, yet we see the film industry being singled out for special treatment.
<P>
Personally, I am delighted that the Government have shown special treatment to the film industry, but they are doing it at a time when they are imposing dramatic changes on charitable grant-making trusts. The argument in favour of those changes is that the Government want to remove a distortion. I want to understand the rationale or philosophy that says, ``Let us have a special case for films. Let us argue that a drive towards a so-called neutral tax system should not apply in this case, and let us provide incentives.'' Who will benefit? I am afraid that the clause's beneficiaries will not necessarily be in the film industry, but they could well be the banks and financial institutions that will enter into various deals--even if they are sale and leaseback, or whatever--with film producers.
<P>
That, in turn, raises the question of whether the Government have fully considered the nature of film production costs. I ask that in relation to the clause because, as I understand it, clause 48 is necessary only because the Inland Revenue insists that film production costs should be treated as analogous to capital costs. If they were treated in the same way as other industries treat wage costs, they could be written off in the first year without the need for the current intricate rules.
<P>
In summary, investment in the British film industry is at record levels. The fact that it is doing better than it has for decades is an inheritance that the Conservative Government have passed to the Labour Government. Another industry has a thirst for the kind of films that may be made--the television stations, including the new digital stations on the BBC, cable, Channel 5 and so on.There will unquestionably be a demand for those low-budget films, but will the provision ensure that the films reach the cinemas?
<P>
In the past, one of the attractions for Hollywood studios of relocating to the United Kingdom has been that the UK has had a flexible labour market. It has been said, and I acknowledge, that up to 1 May, there was potential for using the changes proposed in the Bill to increase jobs in the film industry in the short term. But that potential existed because of the flexible labour market. The social chapter, however, which has been introduced since 1 May, may change much of the climate that has made making films in the UK attractive to Hollywood film producers and others. In citing the evidence of former Committees that said, ``Take this route--it will create jobs'', we must remember that that was said in a climate in which the UK, under my right hon. Friend the Member for Huntingdon (Mr. Major) as Prime Minister, had opted out of the social chapter and all the problems of the regulated labour market that come with it.
<P>
Is the measure well targeted and, if not, should not we ensure that it is targeted at the bottleneck? What is the rationale behind giving money to a part of the industry which, compared with, for example, 1986, shows no sign of needing it?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I believe that the Committee is finding that the clause is more congenial territory than schedule 7. We have enjoyed listening to the observations of my hon. Friend the Member for Witney, which are informed by wisdom and a great knowledge of and passion for the film industry.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Do I infer from what my hon. Friend's remarks that he did not enjoy my speech on schedule 7 yesterday?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I accept the implied correction. I can only say to my hon. Friends, perish the thought. I may not have come to the Committee to enjoy schedule 7, but I learnt to do so while listening to his speech. In the same way I appreciated the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Witney.
<P>
I was particularly pleased that my hon. Friend referred to ``L'annee Derniere a Marienbad'' because I enjoyed that film as a student, although I was not a film student. In the back of my mind still resonate those marvellous tracking and panning shots and those magical words, which my French, at least, does run to--Lelong des couloirs a travers les salles.
<P>
<B>Liz Blackman:</B> Did the hon. Gentleman take his mother with him?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I think I did rather better than that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> Would my hon. Friend care to tell the Committee how much of ``Last Year in Marienbad'' he was able to see on that fortuitous occasion?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> As I recall, having seen the film about three nights running--I will not talk about my companion on each occasion because I do not recall them--I can say that I formed no lasting impression of the film or those with whom I saw it.
<P>
We are all interested in film matters and, as I said on Second Reading, we do not oppose the clause or contend with what the Government are doing. I shall be brief because I want to hear from other cineastes, but a distinction must be drawn between accepting the clause because the Government are offering something to the industry and being certain that that is the right vehicle. My hon. Friend the Member for Witney has exposed those points. We do not want to oppose the clause, but, if time permits, we should like an explanation from the Paymaster General of the rationale for the vehicle he has chosen.
<P>
This is a short-run-relief--it is concentrated--so it should be possible to measure the output and success of the policy. Given that this country has an expanding and buoyant film industry, despite the constraints to which my hon. Friend referred, it should be possible to ascertain whether we improve on making 121 films a year--I hope that we do--and therefore whether the Government can in due course claim success for a policy that, admittedly, involves a distortion. The relief is not necessarily available to other sorts of enterprise, but is well intended. We shall not oppose it.

<P>

<B>Mr. John Whittingdale </B>(Maldon and East Chelmsford): As we are in the home stretch, I thought that it would be appropriate for the talking whip to have another outing. [Hon. Members: ``Hear, hear.''] I have, of course, followed the debate over the five days that we have spent in this Room with considerable pleasure. I have found our discussions on advance corporation tax and finance leases very exciting, but I have a particular interest in tonight's subject. During the last Parliament I was Secretary of the all-party film group. I should make an admission: during my time in that post I lobbied the Government to bring in--[Interruption.]
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Is it not the case that if Whips can talk, so can mobile telephones?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I do not think that it was a case of ``For Whom the Bell Tolls''.
<P>
<B>Mr. Whittingdale:</B> As I was saying, I lobbied the previous Government to introduce the measure. Therefore, I could not in all honesty oppose it. However, I want to expand on two points which my hon. Friend the Member for Whitney has already discussed.
<P>
It is true that the film industry is doing incredibly well. Last year, 124 million tickets were sold in cinemas, compared with 54 million in 1984. Box office takings last year were &#163;440 million, an increase of 15 per cent. on the previous year. As my hon. Friend the Member for Ashford said, that is not a measure of the full extent of the industry's economic contribution: in total, &#163;2.36 billion accrued as a result of video sales and sales to satellite television and the other distribution mechanisms.
<P>
The tragedy, as my hon. Friend the Member for Witney has explained, is that those tickets were sold for films which, in the main, were American-financed Holywood blockbusters. People choose which films they want to see, but the truth is that opportunities to see British films in the cinema are far too few, not because films are not being made but, as my hon. Friend explained, because of a bottle-neck--British films are unable to find screens on which to be shown.
<P>
A recent survey carried out by Screen Finance showed that half of the 150 British films that are expected to be completed this year will not be shown in a cinema. They are not just obscure art-house movies which the real cineaste might go to see and which the ordinary member of the public would have no interest in; they include, for example, ``Mesmer'', which has a &#163;5.6 million budget, with Alan Rickman; ``The Devil and the Deep Blue Sea'' with Stephen Rea; ``The Crows of St. Vincent'' with John Malkovitch; and ``Proteus'', which, I am told, is like ``Alien'', but set on an oil rig. It is an enormous hit in South Korea, although, sadly, we shall not have the opportunity to judge for ourselves because it is in a vault somewhere and will never be shown. That is the real tragedy of the British film industry.
<P>
The provision of incentives to make films is welcome, but the proposal worries me because I have a horrible feeling that the money may be wasted. Over the past five years, at least 70 films, with total production costs of &#163;100 million, have completely vanished and are in bank vaults somewhere. Of that &#163;100 million, at least &#163;30 million was public money. That money was spent to produce films that will never be shown, and my worry is that we are now pouring more money into producing films that will never see the light of day.
<P>
The problem afflicting the British film, industry--distribution--is not being tackled. My hon. Friend the Member for Witney referred to the Middleton committee report. It considered the problem in considerable detail and identified the structure of the British film industry as the real difficulty. We do not have integrated companies, and a film is made by one company, which is created for that purpose and which disappears when the film is made. As a result, we have no companies with a track record in the film industry or which are able to spread their risks across several films. It takes only one film not to be a commercial success for a company to be promptly bankrupted. That was the case with Goldcrest in the mid-1980s and with Palace Pictures. Whenever it seems that we have developed a company that is capable of making successful films, it goes and backs a film that is a loser and that is the end of the company. I welcome the clause and shall certainly not oppose it, but I fear that the money that we are talking about may be wasted and that it will not tackle the real problem.
<P>
In his opening remarks, the Paymaster General raised the other issue to which I want to refer, although he did not set out the real difficulty--the definition of what is a British film, which is covered in clause 48. I have a little quiz for the committee. Which of the following films is British? ``A Fish called Wanda''? [Hon. Members: ``No.'']. ``Sense and Sensibility''? [Hon. Members: ``No.'']. ``Emma''? [Hon. Members: ``No.'']. ``Hamlet''? [Hon. Members: ``No.'']. ``The English Patient''? [Hon. Members: ``No.'']. ``Judge Dredd''? [Hon. Members: ``Yes.''] My hon. Friends are clearly well informed, but I shall reiterate the point.
<P>
``A Fish called Wanda'' was made with American money and is, under definition, not a British film. Most of the post-production work on ``Sense and Sensibility'' was done in America, so it is not a British film. ``Emma'' was adapted by a US writer, starred an American Actress, Gwyneth Paltrow, and was financed with American money. It is, therefore, not a British film. Kenneth Branagh's ``Hamlet'', which is a wonderful film, was financed by Columbia pictures and is not British. ``The English Patient'', which was a great success, was financed with American money and is not a British film. The one film that is British is ``Judge Dredd''. I do not know whether members of the Committee have seen it, but I have. It stars Sylvester Stallone and is a typical blockbuster. It has many action sequences and is, in some people's eyes, gratuitously violent. It was, however, made by a British director at Shepperton studios and most of the money came from this country. It therefore qualifies as a British film.
<P>
It is appropriate, before we proceed further down the route before us, that we should re-examine the definition in the Films Act 1985 of what is a British film. I am not too hung up about whether British films are made with British money. It is a bit like the car industry. It is in a sense a tragedy that we do not have a British-owned car manufacturer, but Nissans, Hondas and Toyotas are made in this country by British workers. In my view, therefore, they are largely British products.
<P>
Let us look at some of the greatest films that have been made. All three ``Star Wars'' movies were made at Elstree. All four ``Superman'' movies were made in this country. All three ``Indiana Jones'' movies were made at Elstree. The three ``Alien'' films were made at Pinewood. The original ``Batman'', the best in my view, was made at Pinewood. ``Who Framed Roger Rabbit?'' was made at Elstree. My hon. Friend the Member for Witney (Mr. Woodward) referred to ``Mission Impossible''; it was made at Pinewood as was ``Interview with a Vampire''. The ``Avengers'' movie currently in production with Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman is being made in this country.
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> I marvel at my hon. Friend's knowledge of the movie industry. I have learned a great deal from his speech. I was struck by the list of five or six movies, some of which even I had heard of and one or two of which I have even seen, like ``Emma'' and ``Sense and Sensibility'' which seemed quintessentially British movies but which were apparently not British movies within the definition of the clause. Does my hon. Friend think that the clause would assist the matter? Would those well known successes which he listed qualify? Would their budgets have been under the &#163;15 million needed to qualify and will the Bill have any effect--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The hon. Gentleman must stop and let his hon. Friend answer his questions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Whittingdale:</B> My hon. Friend is right. I fear that I cannot tell him the precise production costs of each of the films that I named. But he is right to say that it is specifically stated that the definition spelt out in the Films Act 1985 is used to determine what is a British film for the purposes of receiving the tax relief. It is worth looking at that definition. The two principal considerations as to whether a film is defined as British are whether the maker of the film is a person ordinarily resident in a European Union member state and whether the company financing the film is registered in a European Union member state. As a result of that definition, many of the films that we regard as some of the greatest successes for the British film industry in recent years are not defined as British films.
<P>
Although I welcome the clause, I hope that it will be accompanied by a review of that point. The current definition under which we operate is crazy in that it throws up the anomalies that films that seem to most people to be foreign-made blockbusters which have no association with this country like ``Judge Dredd'' are defined as British yet many quintessentially British films that are about British culture, are based on novels by British authors and star British actors are not defined as British films simply because the money was raised in America.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson:</B> The hon. Gentleman should not be under that illusion. It has been quite good so far, but that is a bad mistake: source of finance is not one of the tests. I have the four tests here if he would like to look at them. He must not perpetuate that misconception either to himself or the Committee as a whole.
<P>
<B>Mr. Whittingdale:</B> I accept what the Paymaster General says although it is quite clear that one of the criteria on which the judgment is made is that not less that the requisite amount of labour costs, as determined in the schedule, should represent payments paid or payable in respect of the labour or services of Commonwealth citizens or citizens of an EU member state.
<P>
As I understand it, it is a case to some extent of where the money is spent and where the company making the film is registered. That is why many of the films that I have talked about have been defined as foreign rather than British films. It has already been recognised that the preset definition is inadequate and is in fundamental need of review.
<P>
I welcome the measure--I certainly would not oppose it--but, first, it must be accompanied by re-examination. Secondly, I hope that the Government will consider the real problem of distribution, which my hon. Friend the Member for Witney set out in great detail and which I shall not rehearse. That matter needs to be examined by the review committee recently established by the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, the right hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith), which I welcome, because the film industry is an important one. However, fundamental problems afflict the industry and, although the measure is welcome, I do not believe that it will tackle them.

<P>

<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> Conscious that the safety curtain is about to come down on this performance and that the popcorn-sellers will return to base, perhaps I may make my comments without mentioning any films or cineastes--I hope that the Hansard Reporter is getting that correct--or using Latin, Greek, French or that ubiquitous former Member, Norman French.
<P>
I must also mention an interest. It is a shame that the Economic Secretary to the Treasury is not here, because she seems to catalogue my interests. Shoreham Beeches in my constituency was one of the first homes of the British movie industry. The Crazy Gang was formed there many years ago, and a colony of luvvies, most of whom these days are Conservative luvvies was formed in Shoreham. While we agree with the thrust of the clause within the Budget proposals, it fails to tackle, as some of my hon. Friends have tried to pinpoint, some of the structural problems in the British film industry. As such, I would describe it as a pretty poor example of luvvy tokenism from the new Labour Government.
<P>
I want to refer, as some of my hon. Friends have, to the advisory committee on film finance chaired by Peter Middleton, which reported to the former Secretary of State for National Heritage, as the Department was called last summer. As my hon. Friend the Member for Witney said, the committee identified three problem areas, the first of which is structural, with many small producers and distribution in the hands of five multinationals. Last year UIP, Buena Vista, Fox, Warner Brothers and Columbia Tristar accounted for over 78 per cent. of British film distribution. The second is financial: the businesses in the film industry are unique because of film-by-film capital raising, having to put all their eggs in one basket to raise the finance for a single film, instead of being able to spread the risk across a portfolio of films, and having to rely on the more erratic angel financing system. The third is the lack of communication between the film industry and the financial world. That is a new area that I simply flag at this stage. The problems with FIDs and ACT that we have been discussing might arise if finance were raised through, for example, venture capital investment trusts, which will no longer qualify for the tax relief that has benefited the industry in the past.
<P>
Some of the advisory committee's proposals are interesting and, I fear, have not remotely been taken on board in the Budget proposals. It favours a new industry structure, with a focus on achieving effective distribution, harnessing the distribution effort to benefit the producers and the financial backers who take the risk. It favours a distribution-led studio approach. It also wants 100 per cent. of the production costs written off in the year that they occur, not when the film is finished. We have discussed how one qualifies when the film is finished, and that leaves a great deal to be desired. The advisory committee believes that, if these proposals had been taken on board, about &#163;175 million could have been injected into the British film industry in one year, rising to over &#163;300 million after 10 years.
<P>
The clause does little to address the problems identified by the experts, even though many of those experts were or are Labour luvvies and professionals from the industry.
<P>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Maldon and Chelmsford, East (Mr. Whittingdale) said, the previous Government did much to increase funding for the film industry, not least making available funds from the national lottery. The arts board of the national lottery will benefit by about &#163;1.8 billion over the next seven years.
<P>
In the film policy paper that was produced in June 1995, the then Department of National Heritage calculated that the film industry in England alone would benefit from &#163;70 million of lottery money. Another &#163;14 million would be spent on distribution and cinema improvement. Lottery funding for film in the UK could exceed &#163;100 million, provided that the film sector matched the funding. That represents an injection of more than &#163;200 million into the British film industry. That does not take account of the Scottish film production fund, which offers financial support to those engaged in producing films that are short, unlike this debate, and in developing feature films.
<P>
As has been said, the British film industry is in a rosy state. Some may ask why we single it out for special treatment instead of other worthy charitable causes, against which parts of the Bill discriminate. Why do not the Scottish whisky industry, which the Economic Secretary might mention, or the English wine industry, on behalf of which I made a special plea, receive special treatment? I declare another interest: I was involved in film about the English wine industry. It was produced by the late Willy Rushton, another great bon viveur who enjoyed English wine.
<P>
The definition of a British film is flawed. The Bill does not challenge the definition of what qualifies as a British film in the Films Act 1985. The panel would challenge the premise for qualification. Like the Paymaster General, I shall not go over that ground in detail, although doing that would be worth while. If we had more time, and were not subject to a guillotine, we could do that.
<P>
Another problem relates to the changes in FIDs. Many UK multinational film production and media companies are large overseas earners, which are at risk form the loss of FIDs. They may be tempted away from being UK-registered companies, which would not qualify for some of the funding. I have already mentioned two large companies--Carlton Communications and Granada.
<P>
Before the safety curtain falls, I shall conclude by saying that the clause smacks of tokenism. It does nothing to solve the strategic structural problems of the British film industry. It is out of tune with the advisory committee's detailed findings. It fails to deal with the criteria for qualifying as a British-made film. It sets a precedent of subsidising a small part of British business without considering other special cases. We should avoid over-nationalism, such as that of the French film industry. In 1993, the Academie Franccaise certified that 55 per cent. of films shown in French cinemas had to be homegrown efforts. That is why not many people go to see them. That problem could arise in this country.
<P>
The Government should do their homework better. The clause is a good first attempt, with the right thrust, but it is also an appalling example of luvvy tokenism.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> On a point of order, Mrs. Winterton. I want to put on record our concern that the guillotine will truncate the debate and leave five clauses undebated.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> That is not a matter for the Chair.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> Never have we heard so pathetic a point of order. The hon. Member for Daventry knows that as he shamefacedly leaves the Room.
<P>
Conservative Members have made a series of what in many cases were totally irrelevant speeches. When they were not irrelevant, they were inaccurate; when they were not inaccurate, they were unlistenable to.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> For the record, I should point out that I was exchanging communications with the Chairman of the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> Any suggestion I made as to cowardice on the hon. Gentleman's part was unfounded. I withdraw unconditionally the personal charge, but repeat equally unconditionally my general charge that Conservative Members have not laid a glove on the Government in our debates. Their inability to table amendments is unmatched in the history of parliamentary debates. We spend a whole day's debate on the Floor of the House without an amendment to get our teeth into. The Opposition singled out the windfall tax as their point of attack and yet we spend a day in Standing Committee--
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> Will the Paymaster General give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> There he is again, getting over-excited. If he will wait for a second, I shall willingly give way.
<P>
Conservative Members should be ashamed of their incompetence and hypocrisy. Even on this, the last clause that we shall debate, they are willing to wound but afraid to strike. They have cavilled at every little thing in the clause, but they know that, when they were in government and they received the Middleton report, they did nothing about it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> In order to save time, and given his comments about Conservative Members, will the Paymaster General give me a categorical answer--yes or no--to the effect that neither he nor his colleagues in the Treasury will come forward on Monday or Tuesday with amendments to clause 36?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> The hon. Gentleman knows very well that Conservative Members failed to table a single amendment on the windfall tax and that we had to listen to a series of filibusters. With one exception, the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford, they were not up to the task. Even the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford got the numbers the wrong way round, but he asked the one question in the debate on the windfall tax that had any substance to it.
<P>
I have attended most of the debates in Committee, and I have three or four minutes left to respond to what has in some ways been the best of them. We have heard some sort of contribution from Conservative Members, and I am pleased to respond to their questions. The hon. Member for Witney asked about the date of completion of a film. On reflection, one would conclude that presentation to the public is the obvious point at which a film is completed.
<P>
More substantially, the hon. Member for Witney asked what we were going to do about the Middleton report. As the hon. Member for Maldon and Chelmsford, East said, we have set up a committee to review the matter. The problem of distribution and the stranglehold that American companies have is serious. However, we have taken a step that will enable companies that finance British films to get together and to build portfolios so that all the eggs are not in one basket. That step sends out a good signal to the British film industry and has been widely welcomed by all elements within it. However, no one is pretending that it is anything other than a first step.
<P>
We must get to grips with all the points analysed and all the recommendations made in the Middleton report, which the previous Government, to their shame, failed to do.

<P>

<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> The hon. Member for Witney may wish to intervene, but the fact is that the previous Government did not come up with an official response. They were the Government who commissioned the report and who said how important it was, but they failed to provide a single response to it, not even giving the usual one that they were studying it.
<P>
A number of probing--and, for once, not wrecking--questions were asked about the figure of &#163;15 million a year. A moment's reflection would make one realise that the figure would be way below the sum needed to produce a blockbuster, so the measure is not designed to encourage the production of such films. However, if we could locate more of the American film-making industry in the United Kingdom, there would be a sound case for encouraging such films to be made here.
<P>
The hon. Member for Maldon and Chelmsford East said that where the film is made is more important than the proprietary ownership. I do not agree with that. Nevertheless, it is second best; if films can be made here even though the informing intelligence is not in the United Kingdom, that is a very good thing. If all the technological research and development is carried out in another country, as it is in the motor industry, it is not a healthy sign for the United Kingdom economy.
<P>
In the closing seconds of the debate, as the guillotine falls, I commend the clause to the Committee.

<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> On a point of order, Mrs. Winterton. It is appropriate, before we complete the proceedings, to thank you and Mr. McWilliam for the excellent way in which you have chaired the Committee. I speak for all members of the Committee, especially the new members, in thanking you for advising us on the intricacies of Committee procedure. We are very grateful to you for assisting us in our debates.
<P>
I thank the Clerks and parliamentary counsel, the Hansard writer, the police officers and Officers of the House, the Inland Revenue and Customs officials for supplying us with information relevant to the Bill and my hon. Friends who have sat through these proceedings and contributed at different times. I hope that they will feel enthused to be members of future Finance Bill Committees.
<P>
I deeply regret, Mrs. Winterton, that we were unable to debate all the Bill's clauses, despite having been allocated plenty of time. When people read the reports of these debates in Hansard, they will ask themselves why the Opposition spent so much time debating clauses that they agreed with the Government were in order. They were unable to table amendments, and it is they who will have to explain why they were so incompetent that they could not scrutinise the Bill, and why they were unable to use the available time properly.
<P>
Thank you, Mrs. Winterton, and Mr. McWilliam, for your patience in the Chair. I look forward to seeing you in the Chair again.

<B>Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory </B>(Wells): On a point of order, Mrs. Winterton. I echo many, though not all, of the Financial Secretary's comments. It has indeed been a somewhat unusual Finance Bill Committee--I have not been on one quite like this before. We have taken it at a tremendous rush and have not enjoyed that part of it. We regret that substantial clauses and schedules have gone entirely unscrutinised. However, this is not the time for recrimination. We shall have plenty more time for that on Report.
<P>
My pleasant task is to thank the occupants of the Government Front Bench for answering at least some of our questions. We thank them also for those that they did not answer because this demonstrates that our points have been unanswerable in a number of respects. We also thank new Members from both sides of the Committee who have contributed to these debates for the first time. We have enjoyed getting to know some of them, and although there have been sharp differences of opinion occasionally, we are all honourable Members and we respect each other's firmly held opinions.
<P>
We think that we have discovered some new contestants for the radio programme ``Just a Minute'' who can speak without hesitation, deviation or repetition on subjects about which we do not always know a great deal--due to the inadequacies of the Government's briefing.
<P>
Above all, I thank you, Mrs. Winterton, and you, Mr. McWilliam, for the firm but good-humoured way that you have presided over all our deliberations. When occasionally we strayed like lost sheep you put us back on the true path and kept the debate going. We thank also the Liberal Democrats for their occasional cameo appearance at some of our productions. Unhappily they cannot listen to this tribute to them.
<P>
Through you, Mrs. Winterton, may I also thank the Clerks for their usual professionalism, the Official Reporters, who have to make sense of our mangled phraseology, and the Police and Doorkeepers who help by shouting down the Corridor; when they do so we always hope--it is hope more than expectation--that it will summon masses more hon. Members to our side of the debate? Sadly, we have not managed to win many--indeed, any--of the Divisions but we believe that we have won the argument, which we shall rejoin at a later date. Finally, and sincerely, I thank our two Chairmen for the heavy burden that they have borne, and for the excellent and professional way in which they have discharged their duties.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> As I suspect the Committee is slightly demob happy, my remarks will be brief. I thank both the Financial Secretary and the right hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory) on behalf of John McWilliam, my co-Chairman, and myself, and all those others who were thanked--the Official Reporters, the Police and the Doorkeepers and others--for all their work to ensure that the Committee has run as it should.
<P>
It has been a great pleasure and honour to chair the first Finance Bill Committee of the new Parliament and see so many new young Members perform. I hope that John and I have picked out one or two future stars. Thank you all for ending our deliberations in such high good humour. I know that I speak for John and for the Clerks when I say that we wish you all, in due course, a happy Recess and all the best for the future.
