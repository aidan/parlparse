<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Home Office (Mr. Charles Clarke):</B> I beg to move amendment No. 26, in page 4, line 1, leave out subsections (2) to (4) and insert--
<P>

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss the following amendments: No. 52, in page 4, leave out lines 1 to 43 and insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(2) When this section applies the convicted person's conviction shall be null and void".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Government amendments Nos. 27 and 30.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> Before I explain the effect of the amendments, I must say that I do not intend to move amendment No. 28 because we have discovered that it has a technical flaw. I must also make it clear that further consequential amendments will be needed to make provision equivalent to the revised clause 7 for Scotland and Northern Ireland. I apologise to you, Mr. Stevenson, and to the Committee as a whole, for the fact that we have to do that, but I assure the Committee that all those amendments will be ready on Report. I ask the Committee's indulgence.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 26, 27 and 30 are technical and designed to ensure that the Proscribed Organisations Appeal Commission provides an effective remedy. They apply only to England and Wales. The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey (Mr. Hughes) will no doubt explain his motives later, but I understand that amendment No. 52 is intended to achieve a similar effect. I submit that it is not as clearly drafted as the Government amendments.
<P>
I am afraid that clause 7 as it stands does not ensure that the commission will provide an effective remedy in every case. The law here is difficult and complex, but we believe that the amendments clarify it sufficiently to provide adequate protection in England and Wales for individuals affected by proscription.
<P>
Part II provides for proscription of terrorist organisations and enables organisations and individuals to appeal to the commission against the Secretary of State's refusal to deproscribe. If the commission finds in an organisation's favour, clause 7 already provides that on appeal to the Crown court or Court of Appeal, certain convictions in respect of the organisation's proscribed status will be quashed.
<P>
Amendment No. 26 makes the commission's remedy fully effective by ensuring that, when clause 7 applies, the convicted person can appeal to the Court of Appeal or Crown court and can seek compensation for the conviction.
<P>
Amendment No. 27 follows from the deletion by amendment No. 26 of any reference to section 18(2) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. As I said, other consequential amendments will be needed to the Scotland and Northern Ireland provisions in subsections (5) and (6) of clause 7, and we shall table those on Report.
<P>
Amendment No. 30, which will be moved formally when the Committee considers schedule 4, ensures that the convicted person, or any other person affected, can seek compensation for any loss arising from particular restraint or forfeiture orders that have been made in connection with a conviction that has been quashed following a clause 7 appeal.
<P>
The amendments make clause 7 very long, so the motion that I shall move after we have debated them will divide the clause in two, which we hope will clarify the drafting. As I said, the amendments are essentially technical and are designed to ensure that the commission's remedy is fully effective. They will increase the level of protection afforded to individuals affected by proscription, and I hope that all hon. Members will welcome them.
<P>
Amendment No. 52, which was tabled by the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey, is presumably intended to achieve the same effect as our amendments, but by a much simpler method. I do not believe that that would be sufficient, and I ask the hon. Gentleman not to press his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes </B>(Southwark, North and Bermondsey): The Government's willingness to amend the clause at this early stage is welcome. One could easily criticise them for amending the Bill when it has just been drafted. However, it is better to deal with relatively straightforward issues as they arise, rather than to save everything up and table a great raft of amendments on Report, so I welcome their approach.
<P>
There may be other important points of substance, involving issues that Ministers and their advisers have flagged up because the Opposition have expressed their concern by tabling amendments. If so, I--and probably the hon. Members for Aylesbury (Mr. Lidington) and for Fermanagh and South Tyrone (Mr. Maginnis)--would be happy to be consulted, so that we can save the Committee's time on matters with little scope for disagreement.
<P>
In nearly 17 years in this place, I have been a member of the two longest-running Standing Committees on Bills, one of which was the Greater London Authority Bill, but I have never served on a Committee in which we had motions to divide clauses, so my excitement at the next debate knows no bounds. I am sure that it will have wonderful logic and I look forward to hearing it.
<P>
I want to probe two matters that arise from the Government amendments and my amendment No. 52. My amendment may be technically flawed, but it is certainly more straightforward than the Government amendments and if it was possible to make an amendment more like mine and less like the Government's, that would be in everybody's interest.
<P>
I want to check with the Minister that all my points are covered, because I do not pretend to recognise that the Government's amendments cover them. First, my understanding is that there is not now an automatic lapse of conviction if it is found, through the appeal system, that there should not have been proscription, or if the processes in the clauses that we have just discussed override proscription. Will the Government amendments have the same effect as my amendment--that there will be no onus on the convicted person to commence any proceedings within time limits and, therefore, that they cannot be faulted if they fail? The benefit of amendment No. 52 is that there would be an automatic pardon without the convicted person having to take action. He or she might be unaware of time limits and recent legislation.
<P>
Secondly, my understanding is that, under the Bill as originally drafted, if the commission makes an order to deproscribe, there are grounds to appeal against the conviction for belonging to the proscribed organisation or committing relevant criminal activities connected with it--provided that the offence was committed after the refusal to deproscribe was made by the Secretary of State, but before the appeal had vindicated the complainant. Clearly, the person who makes a complaint and wants his or her conviction quashed would be concerned that any conviction from the date of proscription should be annulled. As I understand it in law and equity, the proceedings are intended to return the convicted person to the position that existed before the Secretary of State's decision. Therefore, I would be content if the Bill ensured that if someone won an appeal, all convictions from the beginning were wiped out. I would not be content if convictions were wiped out only from a certain date. Will the Minister confirm that a complete slate-wiping exercise would be achieved? If so, I would be content, but if not, I would be happy to work with the Minister to achieve that.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Lidington </B>(Aylesbury): I am broadly content with the Government amendments. As the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey said, they fill a gap, and I am grateful that the Government have already reflected on that. I have only two questions about the detail. One relates to the comments that the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey has just made. Will the Minister clarify exactly when the convicted person has the opportunity to lodge an appeal? This morning we discussed the relationship between the decision by the commission or the court to allow an appeal, the Secretary of State's tabling of an order for deproscription and Parliament's decision to give effect to that order. At what point in that process may an appeal commence? Will an appeal begin after the decision by the commission or the court, or after the Secretary of State has laid an order, or after parliamentary confirmation of the Secretary of State's decision?
<P>
My second question is on a minor point. Subsection (4B) in amendment No. 26 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"A person may appeal against a conviction by virtue of subsection (4A)--
<P>
(a) whether or not he pleaded guilty,".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I understand why that measure is included in the amendment, but it does not seem to be replicated in the provisions for an appeal against a conviction on indictment under subsection (2). Is there a reason for that?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> I thank hon. Members for their comments, and I appreciate the spirit in which they were made. I shall answer the questions to the best of my ability, although I confess that I feel slightly uncertain--with all these excellent lawyers on the Committee--on some of the detail.
<P>
The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey asked whether there was an onus on the person convicted. There is an onus, in that the person must appeal. However, if he or she appeals, he or she will succeed in that appeal. It is right that the onus to appeal should exist, so that there can be a case. The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey asked whether it was an automatic thing; it is not, because there is an onus on the convicted person.
<P>
On the question raised by the hon. Member for Aylesbury, it is my understanding that the individual concerned will have the benefit of clause 7 if the activity for which he was charged took place after the refusal to deproscribe. In answer to the second point raised by the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey, the relevant time is the date of the refusal to deproscribe.
<P>
That is how we have sought to see our way through the process. I acknowledge that it is complex, but I hope that the Committee will bear with me.
<P>
 The hon. Member for Aylesbury asked at what point the person could appeal and whether he or she would have to await parliamentary approval of deproscription. Yes, he or she does have to wait, but when Parliament has approved the deproscription, he or she may appeal. That is set out in clause 7(1)(b).
<P>
I hope that I have answered the points made by hon. Gentlemen and that, on that basis, the Committee will agree to the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I have one other question. The Minister's reply was helpful. Will he reflect on just one point? The deproscription may not automatically come to the notice of the convicted person. Somebody--for example, an American citizen--may have been present at a meeting where one of the speakers professed to be a member of a proscribed organisation. That person may have committed an offence under clause 11 or clause 12. He may then go back to the USA. Is the Minister willing to consider whether there should be some follow-up mechanism for that convicted person?
<P>
I accept that that would be unusual in criminal law, but criminal law does not usually retrospectively decriminalise something that was criminal. The principle that I have outlined could apply more broadly. There could be a method of communicating to the person who learns that the offence for which he or she was convicted is no longer an offence. Otherwise, there is an injustice in requiring that person to trigger the proceedings. That may not be so difficult for someone who is resident in Northern Ireland and who reads the papers, listens to the news and is active in politics. However, the situation is clearly different for people who may come to this country.
<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> I shall be happy to look into that matter. I acknowledge the point that the hon. Gentleman is making, and I am prepared to think about the question of communication, but I am not prepared to violate the principle that to sort things out, action has to be taken within the legal system.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for being considerate, although I am not sure whether I agree with him that when we decriminalise, we should leave the onus on someone to take action. The answer may not be available now, but will the Minister, on advice, let us know where else in United Kingdom law there is a retrospective decriminalisation provision, and what the consequences for the convicted person would be? If his officials know the answer already, they will get brownie points and bonus prizes, because such a provision is certainly pretty unusual. If they can give us the answer before the end of the debate they will score 100 per cent., and even if they can do it before the end of the sitting they will score 50 per cent. However, I shall be happy to wait for the information, so long as it will be available in due course. If it turns out that the provision is irregular and contrary to other law, I shall be keen to return to the subject.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman seeking leave to withdraw the amendment?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I seek your guidance, Mr. Stevenson, but my understanding is that the Minister moved the amendment; I do not seek to oppose it, but my amendment has not been moved.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Thank you.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Amendment made: No. 27, in page 4, line 36, leave out paragraph (b).--[Mr. Charles Clarke.]
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Resolved, That Clause No. 7 be divided into two Clauses, the first consisting of subsections (1) to (4D) [Appeal: effect on conviction] and the second of subsections (5) and (6) [Section 7: Scotland and Northern Ireland].--[Mr. Charles Clarke.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Question proposed, That clause 7 [Appeal: effect on conviction] stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> Our view on whether the clause is acceptable will depend on the outcome of further advice and consultation. It would not be acceptable if it did not quash the conviction back to the beginning. If there is no precedent, it would not be acceptable, either, unless communication was made with the person affected. I shall wait to see what happens; we can always return to the matter on Report.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 7 [Appeal: effect on conviction] ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Clause 7 [Section 7: Scotland and Northern Ireland] ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 8</center></H4>
<H4><center>Human Rights Act 1998</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 39, in page 5, leave out lines 8 and 9.
<P>
The amendment would remove subsection (3). The point at issue, which is connected with our earlier debates, relates to the test that the commission would use. Before deciding to push the matter any further, I simply ask what the effect of removing subsection (3) would be.
<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> As the hon. Gentleman says, the amendment would delete subsection (3), which provides that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The Commission shall decide proceedings in accordance with the principles applicable on an application for judicial review."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
As I understand it, the commission would then take on a wider remit than the Bill provides. The effect of the amendment would be broadly similar to that of the amendments that we discussed this morning, in giving the commission wider powers so that it could--to use the phrase that I used this morning--second-guess the Secretary of State, and examine the facts and merits of the case more carefully than we currently allow. I do not want to repeat my earlier arguments, but for the reasons that I gave, I hope that the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey will withdraw the amendment; if he does not, I hope that the Committee will not accept it. However, to answer the hon. Gentleman's question directly, his amendments would have broadly the same effect as some of those that he tabled this morning.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> My understanding--the Minister did not dissent from it--is that we are talking about the same issue as we discussed under clause 5. The legal advice that I have received suggests that, at the least, similar questions may arise about a breach of the European convention--I put it no higher than that. I will set out the two paragraphs' worth of advice that I was given so that they are on the record for people to read.
<P>
Clause 8(3) will impose a restriction on the manner in which an applicant can pursue his rights before the European Commission on Human Rights under articles 10 and 11 of the convention, which the Human Rights Act 1998 incorporated into domestic law. That is despite the fact that the Act purports to enable people to bring proceedings when they believe that a public authority has acted in a manner that is incompatible with their rights under the convention. The provisions in the Bill are incompatible with the purpose and spirit of the Act. We on the Liberal Benches welcomed the Act and supported the Government in taking it through Parliament. Its purpose was to ensure that any individual could obtain an effective remedy in our courts if he believed that his convention rights had been breached.
<P>
The second point that was put to me in advice on the implication and effect of subsection (3) was that the Proscribed Organisations Appeal Commission would be put in an impossible position when considering whether an individual's convention rights had been breached if it were restricted to considering only the manner in which the Secretary of State had reached his decision, given that it must also meet its obligations under section 2 of the Human Rights Act to take into account the Grady and Smith v. United Kingdom judgment, to which the hon. Member for Basingstoke referred. Under clause 6, under which any point of law could be raised, that could lead to many further stages of appeal in the Court of Appeal.
<P>
Paragraph 5(3) of schedule 3 enables the commission to exclude applicants and their legal representatives from the hearing on their application and to withhold the reasons for the Secretary of State's decision. That is believed to constitute a breach of the right to a fair and public hearing, which is defined in article 6 of the convention. That is despite the provision for the appointment of special advocates similar to those who appear before the special Immigration Appeals Commission, as mentioned in paragraph 7 of schedule 3.
<P>
 I am sure that the Minister understands that that is a summary of the advice that we have been given. I told those who gave me advice that I would have further discussions with them. The Minister explained that he thought that the present provisions were similar in effect to those in clause 5. There is still the issue of compatibility with the European convention, but we agreed earlier that there would be a method whereby we could exchange at least evidence and possibly advice. I hope that no freedom of information legislation intervenes to prevent that. I look forward to the exchange of advice between lawyers, although I hope that it will not involve a large fee. On that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Before we proceed, I should make one point. I do not want to advise hon. Members on how to make their contributions, but it would be helpful, when they move amendments, if they actually did so. They should not wait for the Minister's reply before making their case. That would he helpful in terms of both the Minister's reply and the Committee's business.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lidington:</B> I have a brief question for the Minister. Will he explain the reasons for the exceptions to the Human Rights Act 1998 in the Bill? My understanding of clause 8 is that it disapplies the provisions of the Human Rights Act 1998, from paragraph 5(l)(a) and 5(3)(e) of schedule 3. Those paragraphs deal, respectively, with the Lord Chancellor's right to make rules regulating the exercise of the right of appeal to the commission, and with the making of rules to allow for leave to appeal to be determined by a single member of the commission. What are the Government's reasons for making exceptions to the general principle that they have incorporated into the clause?
<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> The hon. Gentleman has referred to paragraphs 5(1)(a) and 5(3)(e) on page 60. The purpose of the exceptions is to make sure that we are complying fully with human rights legislation, and that the practice that we apply minimises the chances of any violation of that legislation. There are ways of operating in these areas that otherwise, could--some might fear--do just that. That is why we have we have made the specific exceptions in the Bill. That is my understanding of the situation, but if the hon. Gentleman wants a fuller explanation, I shall be happy to write to him.
<P>
On that basis, I hope that the Committee will agree that clause 8 should stand part.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 8 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 9</center></H4>
<H4><center>Immunity</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> My understanding is that clause 9 gives immunity in certain cases and for certain offences. In the explanatory notes provided, the purpose of the clause --these are the government's words, or those of their civil servants, not mine--is set out as follows:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"An individual who seeks deproscription by way of application or appeal under Clause 4 or 5, either on behalf of the proscribed organisation or as the person affected, might be discouraged from pursuing either course, or from instituting proceedings under section 7 of the Human Rights Act, by the risk of prosecution for certain offences, for example the offence of membership of a proscribed organisation. Clause 9 therefore ensures that evidence of anything done, and any document submitted for these proceedings, cannot be relied on in criminal proceedings for such an offence except as part of the defence case.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That seems entirely sensible and reasonable, As I understand it, the immunity applies to the following offences: the clause 10 offences of membership or professed membership, the clause 11 offences of support for a proscribed organisation, the clause 12 offence relating to uniforms, the clause 14 offence relating to fundraising, the clause 15 offence of use and possession of property and money for terrorism, the clause 16 offence of entering into funding arrangements, the clause 17 offence of money laundering, the clause 18 offence of failing to disclose information, and the clause 54 offence, of directing a terrorist organisation.
<P>
Why have several offences been omitted from that list? The offences that have been omitted are weapons training, possession of articles for the purpose of commission, preparation or instigation of an act of terrorism and the collection of information that would be useful to someone who is committing or preparing an act of terrorism. I cannot understand, and need to be persuaded, why immunity should be provided for some but not others.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> The purpose of the clause is to ensure that evidence of action taken or documents submitted for proceedings presented to the commission cannot be relied on in criminal proceedings involving proscription and related offences, except as part of the defence case. That is designed to cover the possibility, which the hon. Gentleman seems to acknowledge, that people might be deterred from bringing an appeal before the commission or from instituting proceedings under section 7 of the Human Rights Act 1998 because of the risk of prosecution for the proscription membership offence or another proscription-related offence. That might occur because an individual, in order to establish his locus before the court or to argue a detailed point about how the group operated, might have to concede that he was a supporter or member of the group.
<P>
The clause does not provide general immunity, and it would be wrong to do so. If, for instance, it emerged during proceedings that an individual had been involved in a bombing attack or had incited an act of terrorism abroad, immunity in respect of criminal proceedings would not apply. That strikes the right balance.
<P>
Offences involving weapons, articles, information and so on are omitted from the immunity provided in the clause because they do not relate directly to proscription. The other offences in the other clauses that the hon. Gentleman read out relate directly to proscription. That is why we made that distinction. I hope that that is clear. On that basis, I hope that that the Committee will agree that clause 9 should stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> It is clear, but I am not sure whether it is convincing. Again, it is difficult to discuss the matter without having examined all the other relevant legislation. That is the advice that the Minister has been given, and we can return to the matter at a later stage.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 9 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 10</center></H4>
<H4><center>Membership</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 74, in page 5, line 31, leave out from "if" to end of line 39 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"he has at any time taken part in the activities of an organisation at any time while it was proscribed."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P><B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 55, in page 5, line 31, leave out "or professes to belong".
<P><B>Mr. Hughes:</B> We now reach the first debate on offences relating to proscribed organisations. Amendment No. 74 would amend the first part of clause 10. It would remove the words:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"he belongs or professes to belong"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
from the offence of membership, and substitute:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"he has at any time taken in part in the activities of an organisation at any time while it was proscribed.
<P>
Two issues are involved. The second is covered by amendment No. 55, which is more limited, and tests the words
<P>
"professes to belong to a proscribed organisation".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Why should someone who says that he is a member of an organisation--even if he is not--be guilty of an offence?
<P>
I remember from my study of criminal law that a person cannot be guilty of attempted theft if he tries to steal something that does not exist. A similar issue seems to arise in this case. It seems an odd society in which someone who does not belong to a proscribed organisation but who says that he does should be regarded as having the same criminality as someone who says that he belongs to a proscribed organisation and is a member of that organisation. I hope that the Minister will explain how in the rather Walter Mitty-type world of proscribed organisations someone can be convicted simply for saying that he is doing something illegal, even he is not.
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor </B>(Solihull): I am intrigued by the hon. Gentleman's law student memory lane. Although I cannot steal something that does not exist, might the offence conceivably be attempting to steal something that does not exist, or conspiring to steal something that does not exist?
<P><B>Mr. Hughes:</B> We are all in danger of struggling to remember what we were taught. I do not wish to assert anything, but I was probably taught more recently than the hon. Gentleman.
 The reason why this is important and has been put to me by the Human Rights Commission in Northern Ireland, about which it is troubled--[Interruption.]
<P>
<B>Mr. Ken Maginnis </B>(Fermanagh and South Tyrone): It has a problem with most things.
<P><B>Mr. Hughes:</B> That is probably is why the commission exists. Some people are particularly vulnerable. We know through the criminal justice system that people feel pressed to admit to something--for example, Derek Bentley, who was born and brought up in my constituency. His family pursued a 30 or 40-year campaign for his pardon. He had a low mental age and intelligence and it has been successfully argued that his conviction and subsequent hanging was as a consequence of a misinterpretation of what may have happened and that he may not have been fully aware of what was happening and the implications of what he may or may not have said.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Maclean </B>(Penrith and The Border): Does the hon. Gentleman agree that since those days there has been a huge change in evidence and procedure--for example recorded interviews of witnesses--and that the ideas that someone would be forced by the police to admitting falsely to membership of the IRA? Those days are long gone. The present safeguards in the collection and production of criminal evidence suggests that it is fantasy to imagine a real problem in that regard.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I am not really as trusting in the criminal justice system as is the right hon. Gentleman--not just that in Northern Ireland, but throughout the United Kingdom. I have seen it at work in close quarters in my time in this place. All the procedures laid down in the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 do not stop pressure being placed on the more vulnerable to produce statements that would not be drawn from the less vulnerable. If the right hon. Gentleman thinks that experience of recent years in London would make my view uncommon, he is miles from the truth. My views are widely shared. The police and the criminal justice system do not yet enjoy the confidence of the public that we would wish. Although the law has improved since the days of Derek Bentley's hanging and Lord Goddard, this important issue has been raised by others, who have a locus to look after the human rights of many people in Northern Ireland, and by those which have parallel and similar sister organisations on the mainland.
<P>
The benefit of amendment No. 74 would be to simplify the clause and to make it an offence only if someone has at some time taken part in the activities of an organisation while it was proscribed. Most important, it would remove the reverse burden of proof. The Bill changes the normal requirement that those who convict a person must prove beyond reasonable doubt the offence of which he is guilty. I ask the Minister to place on record whether the Government accept that legislation drawn up in the year 2000 should place burden of proof of innocence on the defendant and give him the duty to prove a negative--that he did not take part in the activities of an organisation during a particular period. That is not an acceptable way of running our legal system. I ask the Minister whether he stands by the reverse burden of proof in principle. If so, does he justify it merely in the context of the Bill, or does he believe it more widely? I and others are unhappy about the drafting of clause 10(2), which deals the defence. The clause as a whole sets out severe penalties and I believe that this dangerous part of the Bill should be amended.

<P>

<B>Mr. Steve McCabe </B>(Birmingham, Hall Green): Will the Minister explain the reasoning behind the wording of clause 10(2) as it contravenes the normal convention of British justice, which requires the onus of proof to be on the police and prosecution rather than on the individual to prove a negative? Many organisations, including the Human Rights Commission, have expressed concern that the provision may contravene Article 6 of the European convention on human rights.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Lidington </B>(Aylesbury): The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey (Mr. Hughes) raised important points on his amendments. However, I am sceptical about whether the amendments are desirable.
<P>
When we debated the principle of proscription, I think that both sides of the Committee accepted, as did both Lord Lloyd in his report and the Government in their consultation document, that there are finely balanced arguments about whether we should continue to have powers of proscription on the statute book. Given that the decision has been made, and made quite rightly, to continue to have such powers, it would weaken them significantly to incorporate the two amendments tabled by the hon. Gentleman. To replace the offence of membership of a proscribed organisation with one of taking part in the activities of a proscribed organisation would make it more difficult for the prosecution. The hon. Gentleman may wish to introduce such a safeguard, but I understand that his amendment would allow a line of defence so that an individual could say that he was a member of the organisation, but that he was only a patron or an honorary official rather than being involved in the terrorism per se. To dilute the Bill as the hon. Gentleman suggests would not be beneficial.
<P>
I have similar doubts about amendment No. 55 and the proposal to delete the phrase, "professes to belong". Let us consider what that would mean. I am sure that the Minister will explain fully, but I assume that if someone is brought to court and charged with an offence of being a member of or participating in a proscribed organisation, there would be some powerful evidence of his membership available to the prosecution at the start. A confession by the individual of his membership would quite legitimately count as a piece of evidence in the prosecution case, whereas the amendment would remove from the prosecution the opportunity to deploy the evidence--perhaps in the form of a speech or a public declaration--that the defendant was indeed a member of a terrorist organisation. The amendment would allow the defendant the defence that he was only joking, that he was pretending in his speech that he had been a member of the Provisional IRA or another of the proscribed organisations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman seriously saying that if a police officer approaches someone in a bar in Belfast and says, "I believe that you are a member of a proscribed organisation," and the fellow in question, who has had a few beers, says, "I certainly am, boss. What are you going to do about it?"--or says nothing--that is sufficient evidence to convict him? Membership lists do not have to be produced, but it seems that a police officer's evidence about a person's silence--or worse--will do instead.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Lidington:</B> No, I am not arguing that. I do not for a moment believe that that flimsy twig of evidence would persuade the police to press charges, the prosecuting authorities to take a case to court or a court to convict. I fear that the amendment would make it impossible for the authorities and the courts to take into account a public statement--a speech, pamphlet or other declaration--that an individual was a member of a proscribed organisation, and was proud of it. It should be possible for the prosecution to use such evidence in framing its case, but only if it has other evidence. Unless the hon. Gentleman makes a more persuasive argument, I shall not recommend my hon. Friends to support the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> The reason why I believe that it is important to retain the provision is that people do not appear overnight as mature terrorists. They are recruited. They are inveigled into terrorism by experienced members of the organisation. Hon. Members will forgive me if I speak from my own experience, but I know how easy it is for the experienced terrorist to say a young person of 16 years of age, "Would you like to come with us? We shall have a good weekend in Donegal. You will be able to see some AK47s, and see some of the chaps throwing hand grenades and the like."
<P>
Young people's natural inclination to seek excitement may encourage them to take up such an offer--I have known it to happen. They deceive their parents and disappear to remote areas where terrorist training is taking place. While there, those young people are under a tremendous influence. They may have contravened their parents' wishes, and the power and influence gained at that moment by those more experienced people is considerable.
<P>
The next logical step is to recruit that young man. Someone will say to him, "If you come back next weekend, we shall let you fire the AK47. We want you to do a wee job for us next month, and when we come back at Easter we shall allow you to progress in the organisation."
<P>
The clause is necessary to prevent that type of activity. It will cause such young people to think again, and to recognise that it is not innocent excitement. They should know that becoming associated in the early stages, even peripherally, with people who are known to be members of a proscribed organisation is an offence.
<P>
The provision on professing to belong to a proscribed organisation is important, because it is exceedingly difficult to prove that someone is a terrorist simply because he has committed the crime--I forget the colloquial name for it--of watching a potential victim or reporting on an individual's movements.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCabe:</B> If the hon. Gentleman's primary concern is about the impact on young people, would it not make more sense to make it an offence to lure a young person into the sort of activities that he described? That would deliver the punishment to the person who commits the offence, rather than carry the risk of seeing a youngster go to jail who thought that he was going on an activity holiday in Donegal.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I think that the hon. Gentleman must have led an innocent life, much more innocent than I and people like me have experienced during the past 30 years. The reality is that after that initiation, the young person in question will be required to carry out activities on behalf of the organisation--activities that, of themselves, are difficult to define as terrorist activities. Having been victim to it, I know that merely observing an individual and verbally conveying information about that person to the gunman or the bomber may contribute to the terrorist effort.
<P>
I do not exaggerate when I talk about my personal experiences. I do not want to dwell on them, but even a low-level operative who says, "All I did, Sir, was to tell Joe Bloggs that Ken Maginnis goes to such-and-such a club for a meeting every Monday night at 8 o'clock," is professing to belong to a terrorist organisation. We could all say, quite innocently, where we could find Joe Bloggs, but the clause will apply only when such information is knowingly supplied to a terrorist organisation. It is exceedingly important that every measure that can be employed to deter people from being sucked in to terrorism should be retained.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> The hon. Gentleman rightly says how difficult it may have been and may still be to secure a conviction for being a member of a proscribed terrorist organisation. Does he accept that it is even more difficult for people to prove that they are not members, when the burden of proof is on them? Proving a negative is much more difficult than proving membership, and it makes for dangerous law.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> If the situation was as the hon. Gentleman suggests, I would agree with him. But it is not about having to prove a negative. It is about dealing with low-level participation in terrorist activity, and applies most specifically, but not exclusively, to young people. The clause is important for dealing with the recruitment and initiation of young people in to terrorist organisations, and it should stand part of the Bill unamended.
<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> This has been an important and illuminating debate. I begin with the core of the matter. Our fundamental belief is that membership of a proscribed organisation should continue to be a crime. The amendment seeks to remove that specific provision. For the reasons so eloquently expressed by the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone, we believe that membership must continue to be a crime and that the clause should remain unamended. When debating earlier clauses, we argued about the real purpose of proscription. The core reason is deterrence--a word used by the hon. Gentleman a moment ago.
My hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Hall Green (Mr. McCabe) made an important and interesting point on youth, but the deterrence argument applies to everybody. Clause 52(3) specifically targets those who try to get people involved in training and other terrorist activities. Anyone here--I do not include my hon. Friends in this--who has experience of politically sectarian but non-terrorist organisations will recognise the description given by the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone of how people are thought to be drawn in. It is a rather elastic and unclear process that turns outside observers into core activists.
<P>
The Government put the issue of membership at the centre of the Bill because we believe that we should do all in our power to prevent people taking that key decision. We should not forget that people take a decision to become a member of an organisation; we must deter them, which is the reason for clause 10. We oppose amendment No. 74 because it would remove the key aspect of membership. I hope that 1 shall have the support of the Committee in resisting the amendment.
<P>
I come now to the point about the membership regime being part of the proscription regime as it now applies to terrorism. We believe that, for the reasons set out by the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone, the present regime in Northern Ireland should be retained in the Bill's wider definition of terrorism. The factors that apply to Northern Ireland apply more widely and more generally. That is why the Bill's provisions are the same as set out in current legislation. It is right to take it forward in a more substantial way.
<P>
I shall now answer the points raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Hall Green. I hope that I can offer him some assurance about the European convention on human rights. My hon. Friend was right to raise those matters; we have already discussed the fact that legal advice is running in all directions. I give him the strongest assurance that I can. We believe that the provisions of clause 10 are in accordance with the convention, particularly the right to a fair trial. We believe that the matter is correctly dealt with. I hope that I have reassured my hon. Friend on that point.
<P>
On the other question raised by my hon. Friend--whether people are presumed innocent before trial--I emphasise again that it is right that those who do not disassociate themselves from a group should be vulnerable to prosecution. However, in such a case we do not have a reverse burden of proof, to use the phrase used by my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Hall Green and by the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey, but a statutory defence in law against the charge. That is different from a reverse burden of proof. It is a statutory defence placed in law against a charge that is made. So the prosecution still has the burden of proof in establishing that a defendant is a member of an organisation. I hope that that reassures my hon. Friend, at least to some extent.
<P>
I acknowledge that balances of judgment and difficult questions have been involved throughout our debate on the Bill. However, I do not accept that the Bill reverses a  great practice of law. It establishes in a new context the previous and the present situations in Northern Ireland.

<P>

<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> Does the Minister accept that if someone gives someone else, or leaves in his house, a membership list of the IRA, for example, or of another proscribed organisation, which has that person's name on it, and the person is then arrested by the police for having a membership list in his possession, that would constitute prima facie evidence of membership and that, unless he could avail himself of the defence in the Bill, he or she would be convicted? Does the Minister agree with me--and I think many others--that that low burden of proof, without the need for further evidence, is hugely dangerous to civil liberty?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> The hon. Gentleman is seriously overstating his case. I have said that balances of judgment are involved, but the idea that anyone would not only hurtle down the course of proscribing an organisation but then seek to convict someone for membership of that proscribed organisation without undertaking the most severe and rigorous process of investigation is wrong. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will concede, as I think he may, that that has not happened over the years that the regime has been in operation. There have been no frivolous convictions for membership of a proscribed organisation on the basis of flimsy evidence. The hon. Gentleman is significantly overstating his case.
<P>
Amendment No. 55 would have the effect of no longer making it an offence to profess to belong to a proscribed organisation. I ask the Committee to consider the case of an individual who is prepared to state publicly that he or she is a member of an organisation proscribed by the Secretary of State. Such a person may give the genuine impression that he or she is a member, whether or not that is case; he or she may not go as far as overtly inviting support from the proscribed organisations, but the fact that he or she professes membership may be a significant factor in terms of the deterrence that we are discussing. It is reasonable to say that it is unacceptable to profess to belong to a proscribed organisation--again, someone's conscious decision; someone has to decide to make such a profession, just as he or she has to decide to be a member of a proscribed organisation.
<P>
I urge members of the Committee to reject amendment No. 74, on the fundamental grounds that membership of a proscribed organisation should be illegal and to reject amendment No. 55, on the grounds that to profess to belong to such an organisation is an offence that should be treated in the same way as the offence of belonging to such an organisation. That is what the Bill sets out and is why I hope the amendment will be withdrawn or rejected.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> This is the most illiberal and authoritarian part of the Bill and I shall not withdraw the amendment. It is at best arguable that membership itself should be a crime.
<P>
In the normal panoply of criminal law, one has to do something rather than be something to be a criminal. It harks back to the McCarthy era in America, where to be a  communist was enough. Undesirable though an organisation may be, being a member of it should not be enough. We will come to the definition of "a member".
<P>
The Minister said, "Government policy is clear: membership is enough." That trespasses as far as we would wish into criminal law. Because there are no safeguards for proving that, it goes from being risky to highly dangerous.
<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman concede that the Communist party of the United States, because it never has been a terrorist organisation, is a qualitatively different organisation? The McCarthy campaign was not designed to rout terrorism in the way we are discussing, but to create a climate within which the whole range of progressive opinion across the whole range was to be destroyed and, I contend, is qualitatively different from a terrorist organisation.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am conscious that this is an important issue, therefore the temptation to perambulate round the world and throughout history is there for us to fall into. While hon. Members make a valid point, they will take that on board.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> Of course there is a difference. The famous phrase was:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Are you, or have you ever been, a member of the Communist party?"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If an officer asks, "Are you, or have you ever been, a member of an organisation?" and someone answers yes, by the Government's stated position that will be a criminal offence.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman put himself in a more parochial position and consider how often in the past 30 years he has considered that some young people might not have been imprisoned for terrorism had it not been for incitement by more responsible people, some of whom were not terrorists?
<P>
I will be brief, Mr. Stevenson. Let me pose a question to the hon. Gentleman. If things were going badly in Northern Ireland and my party leader and I issued a statement saying, "It's time that people took the law into their own hands. We advise young people to join us as members", would he consider it an offence?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I absolutely understand that young people are, by definition, impressionable; young people with time on their hands are more impressionable and young people with time on their hands and the prospect of financial reward are even more impressionable. I do not pretend that it is a parallel, but I spent a decade or more as a youth leader on the streets of south London, where there were no terrorist organisations, but plenty of temptations to impressionable young people to participate in criminal activity. That is not the issue between us because I share the hon. Gentleman's concern to do all we can by a range of policies to limit the attraction to young people of uniform, music and the military context such as arms and rifles and, sometimes, the excitement of violence.
<P>
I want to try to stick to the steps that the Government are building to allow people to be convicted under British criminal law of being a terrorist and of a terrorist offence. If it is recorded on someone's CV that they are guilty of a terrorist offence, it puts a large blight on their future career. If it gets there by the thinnest of evidence--[Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I really do appreciate how serious the issue is, but to talk about CVs and such things might be taken as a little bit off the point. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will get back to his very important argument.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> It is interesting that the Minister said from a sedentary position, "Oh yes it is" and the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone said, "No, no, very often it is not a bar at all." I do not know who to believe. They had better talk to each other afterwards.
<P>
The second evil is the thinness of the evidence on which someone can be convicted. The Minister said that under clause 10(2) there is a statutory defence. That is a correct legal definition, but getting there has to be in two stages. There has to be some evidence to proceed with the case that someone belongs to a proscribed organisation. If sufficient evidence is laid there are only two ways out. Either the organisation was not proscribed--although for the moment let us assume that it was. It need not have anything to do with Northern Ireland; it could be Tamil Elam, an organisation in my constituency which is fighting for Tamils to have their homeland, whose members have a strongly supported and arguable case in which they believe passionately. Or it must be proved that the person has not at any time taken part in the activities of the organisation. How does a person prove that for every minute of his life from the time the organisation was proscribed he has not taken part in it? I contend that the statutory defence is a sham in criminal law, because often a person will not be able to prove it. Although there is a statutory defence, the burden is shifted from the prosecution to the defence, as in other bits of the criminal law. The prosecution does not then have to prove beyond reasonable doubt because the burden is on the defendant, who then has to prove something in return, which may be impossible to do.
<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman accept that what is provided in statute is one defence, but not the only one. There is a range of defences which people now use in all types of circumstances. We considered it right to establish a statutory defence in the Bill. But it is only one; others will be used in the usual course of events.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I understand that point. But the Minister never dealt specifically with my point about the burden of proof. My understanding is that it would be sufficient for a police officer, in this instance in Northern Ireland, but it could be in London--it could be a Kurdish, or Tamil, organisation the Pakistani Liberation Organisation or, 20 years ago, the African National Congress--to prove that an organisation proscribed because of its role on the international stage--[Interruption.]  That is not a higher authority giving instructions, Mr. Stevenson.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The last thing I want to do is interrupt the hon. Gentleman when he is in full flow, but I hope that that pager message reminds the hon. Gentleman not to repeat his earlier arguments. That would be very helpful.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> Following the Chairman's advice, would the hon. Gentleman care to give me his pager number so that I can use it occasionally in future debates?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would not do that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I certainly would not. Am I right in saying that it would be possible for an officer to say that he believed the person to be a member and to give some evidence that the person was a member--for example, stating that membership lists were found at his home, or that he was seen with others who were members? We do not have to go far to lay sufficient evidence to convict someone. That is the danger of simply having a membership test with a low threshold of conviction.
<P>
Amendment No. 55 would leave out the professing to belong. I do not fall for that argument. Let me give the Tamil example. If a constituent of mine was asked, "Are you a member of Tamil Elam?--assuming that it was a proscribed organisation--he would reply, "Of course I am". These people will not let down their mates. Often someone will say that they belong to something out of solidarity with others. People do not want to let the side down. In a group of three people, two of whom belong to a particular organisation, would the third person be willing to say, "No, I am not, but my mates are."? That is just not the real world, especially if they are adults with learning difficulties or less intellectually qualified. This provision is hugely dangerous. If a Labour Government persists in being so authoritarian on these issues they will do further damage to their reputation--which used to be for defending civil liberties. I hope that Labour members of the Committee will be sensitive to the open door that the provision presents because when the Bill is enacted it will cover anyone associated with any proscribed organisation.

<P>

<B>Mr. Mike Gapes </B>(Ilford, South): I do not wish to prolong the debate but perhaps the hon. Gentleman will answer this point. He mentioned an organisation called Tamil Elam. That is like referring to a united Ireland in the context of Ireland. He ought to have mentioned the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Elam--the people who have suicide bombers and carry out terrorist activities. Throwing around phrases such as that will really confuse the issue. No one is proposing to put on a proscribed list--for example, in Northern Ireland--expressions of support for a united Ireland. If that happened, those who voiced such views would be locked up as terrorists. Similarly, no one would include on a proscribed list the aspiration to an independent Tamil state. The issue here is the nature of organisations that carry out terrorist actions on behalf of such aspirations, and, to quote an example, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Elam are a group which carries out such activities.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I remind hon. Members of my earlier point about using justifiable examples from whatever source. A perambulation around the world and all its problems and history will generate this type of exchange. Frankly, I do not know where it is getting us. I feel sure that the hon. Gentleman will wish to conclude his argument.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I was using shorthand. The full name of that group is the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Elam, as the hon. Gentleman rightly said. That is the organisation that has the Tamil Elam campaign at its heart. I stand corrected.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gapes:</B> It is one of a swathe of organisations, many of which are involved in legitimate democratic politics. It is dangerous to use a shorthand because it slurs many other groups that do not favour terrorism, including Tamil organisations whose people have been killed by that group.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman does not want me to repeat my earlier ruling. I am in the Committee's hands, but I am charged with making progress in the debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> As the Bill relates to international, national and Irish organisations, clearly examples may be given. It is important; people read these debates. I understand the politics of Sri Lanka relatively well, having been there and having talked to people on all sides of the argument, including Tamils in all groups in the community. No one wishes to inflame difficult situations. I am merely using an example. Wherever it is, the membership issue, and the Government's belief--and, if the hon. Member for Ilford, South (Mr. Gapes) votes for the clause by voting against the amendment, his belief--that it is sufficient for someone to be guilty of an offence that makes someone a terrorist if he professes to belong to a proscribed organisation even if he does not, and never has, is a very dangerous one. If the hon. Gentleman is happy with his conscience, that is up to him. I certainly am not happy and I should be not surprised if many other people were happy either.
<P>
The amendment allows us to get away from the thin ice of conviction on the basis of membership alone. On clause stand part, it will be helpful to know how many convictions there have been so far under British law since the 1970s simply for membership of proscribed organisations. The Minister is right to say there have been very few. I hope that the Committee will realise that this is a dangerous road to go down, whatever the desire to deal with terrorism and its causes, and I hope that it will reflect that, in the end, the amendment is worth supporting.

<P><B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 40, in page 5, leave out lines 41 and 42.
<P>
This is a probing amendment which seeks to explore by suggesting that we take out the indictment conviction provision that says that one could be sentenced to a term of imprisonment not exceeding 10 years for membership of or for professing to belong to a proscribed organisation. Is it acceptable that the sentence for simply belonging--nothing else having been proved--should be up to 10 years' imprisonment with a fine? Would it not be better to have membership alone and professing membership much lower down the tariff so that convictions on activity offences--commonly understood criminal offences--can be rewarded, if necessary, by a longer term in prison. Ministers will argue that the length of the sentence is at the discretion of the court and it may not take full advantage of what the law permits. That is true, but we should not be legislating to provide one of the most severe sentences if we do not believe it to be appropriate. If the Minister could tell us how many convictions there have been so far under the two emergency Acts and what the sentence were, it would be helpful. We should have an informed debate and I hope that the Minister will at least be willing to consider that this may be far too draconian a sentence simply for membership or professing membership of a proscribed organisation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lidington:</B> My inclination is not to support the hon. Gentleman's amendment. There are two broad reasons. The first is that a charge that someone is a member of a proscribed organisation will often be one of a number of charges on the sheet. If someone is tried in the Crown court for murder, manslaughter or conspiracy, clearly it is sensible for the Crown court to dispose of the charge of membership of a proscribed organisation at the same time. That possibility would be excluded by the amendment.
<P>
As was apparent from our previous debate, the type of person who is charged with membership of a proscribed organisation could vary a great deal. It could be anyone from the sort of young man described by the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone who might merit a relatively lenient sentence, but it could also be a hardened professional killer whose sheet included a great many other criminal charges. It is, therefore, right to allow the court the option of a much more severe sentence to reflect the abhorrence with which we regard that person's career of crime.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I must express my difference of opinion with the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey. My experience is that the courts discriminate when considering the type of person who is charged with membership of an organisation. A person who is new to an organisation and is learning the trade of terrorism is, in practice, treated comparatively leniently by the courts. When membership is associated with the circumstances in which the person has come to the attention of the police in the first place, but there is not sufficient evidence for a conviction, the length of sentence provided in the clause is necessary. For example, someone who drives a vehicle to a shooting, but who does not participate in the murder, may argue that, when he drove the gunman to the scene, he did not realise that the victim was about to be murdered. In those circumstances, when membership of the organisation can be proven, but there is doubt about the peripheral activity, the judge is likely to impose the maximum sentence.
<P>
I do not like citing my own experience, but on one occasion three men wearing rubber gloves and masks were about to carry out an act of terrorism against me and my wife. When they were detained, there was a period of about eight hours before the guns that were to be used were found, which were so close to where I was that they were overlooked. It was necessary to have two charges against those individuals. There was a charge of attempted murder and one of preparing to commit a crime--I cannot remember the exact wording. Because the guns were not in the hands of those involved, the people were not convicted of attempted murder, but they were convicted, and sentenced to a considerable period for possession of weapons. The details escape me to some extent. Irrespective of my experience, it is important to have a meaningful sentence for membership of an organisation. Membership compensates for the fact that evidence for a crime of a more serious nature is not always available.
<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> The debate illustrates the significant gulf of opinion between the Government and the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey about the importance of membership of a proscribed organisation being an offence. I shall not go on about the rather insulting way in which he conducted the debate and the allegations of how he thought people felt. The six-month maximum that the amendment would impose does not reflect the seriousness with which membership of a proscribed organisation should be treated. The matter must be treated seriously for real reasons and reasons of deterrence. That is why subsection (3)(a) is in the Bill.
<P>
To answer the hon. Gentleman's specific question, in the years 1991-98, 90 people were found guilty of membership of proscribed organisations in Northern Ireland. That is not a large number, but the purpose of the proposed legislation is to drive down the number of people who might want to become members of a proscribed organisation. The sentences for doing so are an important aspect of that deterrent process.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I wonder whether the Minister has been given information about the range of sentences. If not, I should be grateful to have those some time. I said that it was a probing amendment to see whether the Government had a view on bringing down the tariff. I put the point of view at the other end of the spectrum that membership of a proscribed organisation should be at the lowest tariff of offences. I believe that the right conclusion will be something in between; it could go from six months up to 10 years. I am troubled that the Minister is still holding to the view that 10 years, which is imposed for other severe offences, is right.
<P>
The hon. Member for Aylesbury, unusually for him, was deceiving himself by persuading himself that such a sentence was justified. He prayed in aid that somebody might have a criminal past or had been a murderer, and so on. If someone is guilty of other offences, by definition of course he will be liable for huge sentences. If he is convicted of something subsequently, his previous convictions will show up, which will be taken into account when the later sentence is passed. Such actions can aggravate the sentence that would normally be passed. The hon. Gentleman did not specifically address the simple issue of the tariff for conviction of such an offence on someone with no previous conviction. We should have a tariff that relates only to the offence of membership. I should be grateful if he would suggest whether, in his view, the conviction would be for membership alone.

<P>

<B>Mr. Lidington:</B> As I said earlier, it is appropriate to give the courts the discretion that the Bill will provide. I was concerned about the case of someone convicted of membership of a proscribed organisation and of serious criminal offence at a single trial. In those circumstances, the court should have a penalty available that reflects not only membership, but the fact that the individual used that membership to help perpetrate the most heinous crimes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> That is helpful. We have had a sub-debate within the membership debate. In the previous debate, I expressed reservations about the implications of the Govemment's approach. I have flagged up the issue, but I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before I call hon. Members in the clause stand part debate, I ask them to assist me. I do not want to have to remind them that they will not be in favour if they simply repeat arguments that we have bad in the comprehensive debate.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I ask Government Members to reflect on whether they would have supported the clause, had they been in opposition. I do not think that they would have done, and I do not think that they should now. Those on the Front Bench have little choice in the matter, but the others, if they cannot bring themselves to oppose the clause publicly at the moment, might at least reflect on whether it goes too far in the context of a Bill that makes terrorism a wide offence with a wide definition.
<P>
I hope that we shall return to more considered and limited definitions, and that there will be a much tighter threshold for membership. I do not expect that there will be much support for that view, but a seed planted now may bear fruit shortly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gapes:</B> I support the clause willingly. No one has pressured me, and I do not take kindly to the implication that I am a cipher for someone else's views. I believe in fighting terrorism in this country and internationally, and to do so we must have effective legislation. I recognise that we shall deal with other issues later in the Bill that will need discussing and teasing out, but some of the language directed at us by the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey is an insult, and I hope that we do not have any more of it over the next two weeks.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lidington:</B> It is right that the Bill should contain an offence of the sort covered by clause 10, so we shall support the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> Terrorism starts with membership at the lowest level. For that reason, I am content that the clause should stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> We all face choices. The hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone raised the choice of whether to join an organisation. All members of the Committee can decide what we do for ourselves. I make the choice to say that membership of a proscribed organisation is wrong and that we ought to do all in our power to outlaw it. That is the right choice, I associate myself entirely with the comments made by my hon. Friend the Member for Ilford, South about the demeaning and unpleasant way in which the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Berfnondsey made his arguments. I heard him earlier in the Committee talking about principled abstention on a couple of points. What is the distinction between that and unprincipled, cowardly, entirely opportunist or oppositionist abstention? He needs to answer for the choices that he makes in the same way that all of us individually make ours to try to drive terrorism out by the means set out in the clause.

Clause 10 ordered to stand part of the Bill
<H4><center>Clause 11</center></H4>
<H4><center>Support</center></H4>
<P>
</FONT><B>Mr. Lidington:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 70, in page 6, line 15, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(1A) It is a defence for a person charged with an offence under subsection (1) to prove that his intention was to invite comment on an application for deproscription under section 4 or an appeal under either section 5 or section 6".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The purpose of the amendment is to allow a defence to a charge of inviting support for a proscribed organisation. That defence would be that the intention was only to invite comment upon an application or appeal for deproposition.
<P>
Representations were made to me by the Society of Editors which expressed strong concern that the Bill, as drafted, would unfairly limit the legitimate activities of reporters and editors. The society argued that even if the media wished to report an organisation's or an individual's application for deproscription under the formal procedure laid down in the Bill, it would face real problems and individual journalists might find themselves at risk of prosecution. It suggested that if the media attended and reported a press conference or public meeting given by an organisation to publicise its deproscription application, or reported a statement made at it, the journalist concerned could be considered to be inviting support, contrary to clause 11(1), even if only through the resulting publicity.
<P>
Further questions have been asked by the society, supported by other organisations representing media interests. For example, would a statement to assembled reporters outside the court where an appeal for deproscription was to be heard count as an address contrary to the provisions of clause 11? Would a reporter be in danger of a charge of inciting or aiding and abetting an offence if he invited an individual or organisation to comment on their applications? The Society of Editors pointed out that if the Commission exercised its powers under the Bill to exclude the media and the public from attending its hearings, such a meeting between a reporter and a representative of the proscribed organisation might be necessary, simply in order to obtain accurate information. Would the reporter's questioning of such a speaker at an impromptu press conference or a more formal, arranged briefing be considered an address to a meeting and therefore come within the scope of the offence described in clause 11? These are legitimate concerns, and I hope that the Government can provide some reassurance to those who try to report the news accurately.
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I hope that the Government will support these modest amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> I completely accept that these are well-intentioned amendments that positively address serious issues. I am meeting the Society of Editors to discuss these points. I have not been able to do so as yet. I am prepared to be as flexible as I can on these matters. I certainly do not want to do anything that would restrict a genuine freedom and right to report. In urging the hon. Member for Aylesbury to withdraw his amendment, I should place on record our belief that the protections given in clause 9, which are substantial on the whole issue of deproscription, provide the security that he seeks. These are serious points and I am more than prepared to discuss the matter further, but I believe that clause 9 provides an adequate defence. On those grounds I hope he will agree to withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> Like the Minister, I have deep reservations about this amendment. I regret having to hark back to my own experience, but over the years I have found that journalists have abused the right described by the hon. Member for Aylesbury. It is not so many years since it was an offence for people associated with a terrorist organisation to broadcast on radio or television. That embargo was abused by actors, and the Government were persuaded to withdraw the ban on members of a terrorist organisation appearing on television. At that time journalists reassured us that once the terrorist or the representative of the terrorist organsiation could face the microphone or the camera, they would put him to the sword and expose him for the evil peson that he is. Yet that has not happened.
<P>
Television camera crews have sought out not just spokesmen for terrorists but those dressed up and armed with weapons who want to advertise their terrorism and their terrorist organisation. That has been a curse for those who have opposed terrorism. It gives exactly the same consideration and publicity to those who are outside the law as it does to those who keep the law. I doubt whether this will happen, but anything that denies terrorist organisations the lifeblood of publicity should be included in the Bill. I will vehemently oppose anything that waters down that opportunity to deny publicity assistance to terrorist organisations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lidington:</B> I first respond to the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone. He raised a legitimate case based on the sad experience of Irish terrorist organisations. In defence of the amendment as drafted, the latitude that it would give to the media applies only in respect of deproscription applications or appeals. One is assuming, therefore, that the organisation concerned is claiming that it is no longer involved or has never been involved in terrorism, and is seeking to publicise its peaceful credentials rather than to gain publicity for terrorist objectives.
<P>
I am grateful to the Minister for his response to my remarks, and I am pleased to know that he intends to meet the Society of Editors to discuss their concerns. It was also helpful to have the reassurance that the Government's view, for the time being at least, is that the provisions of clause 9 go a long way, if not all the way, to providing journalists and reporters with the protection for their legitimate activities that they are seeking. All of us engaged in politics know that a balance that must be struck between preventing unpleasant organisations and individuals from getting access to the oxygen of publicity and allowing freedom to the media in a free society. Frequently, individual newspapers or broadcasters may abuse those freedoms. That is the price that we pay for living in a free society.
<P>
In view of the comments that the Minister has made, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 7, in page 6, line 19, leave out from "organisation" to end of line 21.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 8, in page 6, line 24, leave out from "activities" to end of line 26.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> The amendment deals with the last part of subsection (2), which is about people who address meetings when they belong, or profess to belong, to proscribed organisations. Part of it relates to the previous debate, therefore I need not elaborate. It puts the issue in a meeting context as opposed to the context of the street or wherever a person could be arrested.
Amendment No. 8 relates to the more controversial part of the clause. It specifically seeks to remove the provision that would provide for a conviction. Clause 11(3) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"A person commits an offence if he addresses a meeting and--
<P>
(b) he knows that the meeting is to be addressed by a person who belongs or professes to belong to a proscribed organisation".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The first reason that that is dangerous is that it could cover people who speak at a meeting where there are people who are not members but who claim to be. A speaker could be convicted of an offence by being on a platform with somebody who was not a member but who claimed to be one. The speaker may have no knowledge of that. It may not be possible for him to be alert to that, but just by being there he could be convicted.
<P>
Secondly, one could be at the meeting speaking in opposition to the organisation, but that would be an offence. Thirdly, because the definition of a "meeting" is a gathering of three or more persons, whether or not the public are admitted, civil servants or go-betweens--who in recent years have had meetings with proscribed organisations--would also have been guilty of an offence just by being present at a meeting of two or three people, where those two or three are members and the civil servants or go-betweens are not. There were conversations under the previous Government and this Government--and we are led to believe that such conversations are still going on between official governmental people from Ireland and the United Kingdom, and the terrorist organisations. It is the same throughout the world and has always been so. But if we leave the Bill unamended in this respect, such people would be guilty. If they were not prosecuted and others were, people would start asking serious questions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gapes:</B> I think that we have moved on a bit, but why on earth would someone at a meeting wish to claim to be a member of a proscribed terrorist organisation with which they had no association, knowing that that would make them liable to a considerable prison sentence? I find these examples bizarre.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> Not least, to test the system and see what happens. The hon. Gentleman knows perfectly well that there are people who are willing to test the sense of the legal system, perhaps seeking to become martyrs or obtain publicity. It would not be good publicity for the cause of law and order if, say, a journalist were tried and convicted under this measure. Journalists and media people are as concerned about the rest of this clause as they are about the point made by the hon. Gentleman. They themselves might be in such a position. If the hon. Gentleman is imaginative, he could come up with all sorts of examples of occasions when people might he able to be convicted under this provision.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gapes:</B> The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey seems to live in a different world. Perhaps members of the Liberal Democrat party carry out such activities to test things, but in the real world it would be a very bizarre practice.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> The hon. Gentleman may or may not accept that that may happen, but he must accept that journalists are rightfully worried. What about a journalist who goes along to a meeting to gain evidence for a story that he or she is writing about deproscription? I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman has had representations from journalists, but I have. They are very worried about the implications of this clause.
<P>
There is a range of cases. I did not draft the clause; the Government did. It provides that someone commits an offence if they address a meeting--whether or not they support the organisation that has organised it; they could oppose it--while knowing
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"that the meeting is to be addressed by a person who belongs or professes to belong to a proscribed organisation."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am troubled if the hon. Member for Ilford, South is seriously telling the Committee that he supports the idea that someone could be convicted just by going to such a meeting and speaking at it, even if they hold a directly opposite view.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> Yes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> The right hon. Gentleman says yes, but how else can there be dialogue which might seek to persuade the person in the crowd who has been attracted to a public meeting by the subject if alternative views are not put? How will journalists go about their investigative work?
<P>
<B>Helen Jones </B>(Warrington, North): I am interested in what the hon. Gentleman is saying. We are dealing not with democratic organisations but with terrorist organisations. Is he seriously arguing that anyone with an ounce of sense goes to a meeting in order to conduct a democratic argument--that I, for example, might attend an Ulster Volunteer Force meeting saying, "I am here to talk you out of your terrorist principles"? Is that, in all honesty, a serious argument that the Committee ought to consider?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I do not wish to intervene on any hon. Member's speech or to assist an hon. Member in that sense, but I cannot see the word "attended" in the clause, I see "arranges", "manages" and
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"assists in arranging or managing"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
but I cannot see the word "attended". If hon. Members disagree with the interpretation, I am willing to take points of order, but if not, I should like them to return to the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gapes:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Stevenson. I seek your clarification. The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey discussed attending meetings. Are you now saying that what we have just discussed was out of order, in which case we should move on to another amendment?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I assure the hon. Gentleman that the amendments are in order, but no point of order challenges what I have said, and I direct hon. Members along those lines.
<P>
6.30 pm
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> Amendment No. 8 relates to someone who "addresses a meeting" knowing that the meeting will be addressed by someone who belongs or professes to belong to  a proscribed organisation. The hon. Member for Warrington, North (Helen Jones) must live in a fantasy world if she believes that over the past 30 years journalists have not attended meetings of two or three people, including people who belong to proscribed organisations in Northern Ireland. She is wrong. Addressing means speaking to such people. Nothing suggests that being present at and speaking to a meeting of three or more people would not constitute addressing the meeting under the Bill, which journalists might do, regardless of whether they support those people, oppose them or are simply investigating them. We must consider the matter carefully. If "address" meant "had a preannounced, public position", it might be different, but it does not.
<P>
Other people who might be convicted of an offence under the clause include the school caretaker, the school premises officer and the building premises officer, if they were to assist in the arrangement or management of a meeting. [Interruption.] The hon. Member for Warrington, North keeps saying "a terrorist organisation?". Yes, a terrorist organisation. Someone who is pressured to provide a facility in which people meet merely to discuss such activity has, as in the point that the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone made, an aiding and abetting role. If the hon. Lady believes that such people should be swept in and regarded as of the same criminal type as active criminals, I am happy for her to defend that position. However, it is dangerous law to sweep in people who are peripheral to the organisation.
<P>
Amendment No. 8, in particular, is designed to meet anxieties that were not dreamed up by me but were expressed by others who are worried that the provision is another example of the Bill going too far. I should be interested to discover whether the Minister agrees that it goes as far as has been suggested, and to hear his response to the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCabe:</B> I promise that I shall be quick and shall not let my imagination wander into the realm of infinite possibility that was opened earlier. I should like the Minister to consider the unintended possible consequences of the wording of subsection (3)(b), which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"A person commits an offence if he addresses a meeting and . . . he knows that the meeting is to be addressed by a person who belongs or professes to belong to a proscribed organisation."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Fairly recently and in the past, under both this Government and the previous Government, we have used go-betweens and negotiators when we have had no alternative. What would happen to someone like the hon. Member for Foyle (Mr. Hume), who has taken several brave risks in trying to edge forward the peace process in Northern Ireland), including addressing the sort of meetings referred to in the clause? The intention is clear, but the unintended consequence could be to trap people who were never intended to be captured by the provision. Will the Minister reflect on whether additional safeguards could be provided to avoid that possibility?
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> I made the mistake of listening momentarily to the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey and failed to anaesthetise myself to some of his ideas. As I listened, I became increasingly concerned that the debate and his views were becoming ever more surrealistic--a cross between Monty Python, Sir Humphrey and a Liberal party conference. The idea that it is perfectly legitimate to engage in a dialogue--at public or private meetings--with terrorist organisations is nonsense. Nothing in the clause would prevent go-betweens in the limited circumstances of meeting terrorists of whatever description in order to advance a peace process. On my reading--I look forward to hearing the Minister's reply--organising such meetings would not be captured by the provisions.
<P>
Anyone foolish enough to address terrorist organisations at a public or private meeting to persuade them to give up their terrorist ways deserves the penalties in the clause for giving respect, credence and authority to a proscribed organisation. We are not talking about a debate at a fringe meeting of the Liberal party conference--or any party conference for that matter--where one person takes one view and another argues against it. We are talking about meetings organised, arranged and facilitated by proscribed organisations--those that have satisfied the Minister's quality threshold and ought to be proscribed as dangerous terrorist organisations. Everyone falling within the scope of clause 11 should be guilty of an offence if they aid and abet, provide support or attend any meetings at which people speak in support of terrorism.
<P>
If the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey wants to persuade terrorists to give up their arms or change their cause, he can write articles in many newspapers in this country and Northern Ireland. He can express his views on his own web page--or, indeed, on the IRA or Sinn Fein web pages--and engage in dialogue that way if he wishes. However, it would be nonsensical to accept the hon. Gentleman's amendment and exempt people foolish enough to give moral support--for whatever nave purpose--to terrorist organisations by attending one of their meetings.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> Will the right hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> I have concluded.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I find no merit whatever in amendment No. 7, which deals with arranging, managing and assisting meetings of proscribed organisations. One might be tempted to see something in amendment No. 8 and assume that there could be a legitimate purpose in attending meetings in order to advance a peace-making point of view. However, we must recognise lessons from experience. We have spoken of the person known as the mountain climber, who uses the name Oatley and writes extensively on a subject about which he is no longer familiar. In fact, he deliberately perverted the Government line on dealing with terrorism. If amendment No. 8 is intended to cater for such a person, I would be deeply prejudiced against it. The other type of person who was mentioned as possibly attending a meeting was a journalist--but a journalist would have no reason to address a meeting. A journalist would not be prevented, in a literal interpretation of the provision, from doing his work or speaking to individuals to obtain information, but addressing a meeting would fall outwith his responsibilities. It would therefore be foolish to weaken that safeguard for society by accepting the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lidington:</B> The amendments contain the germ of a serious point because there is a difficult balance to strike between ensuring that we have laws to punish people who aid and abet terrorism while also ensuring that we do not inadvertently, as the hon. Members for Southwark, North and Bermondsey and for Birmingham, Hall Green said, sweep innocent parties into the criminal net. I am not persuaded that the amendments are the right way of addressing that difficult balance and I have tabled other amendments, to which we shall come later, that explore the problem slightly differently. From the Minister's response to amendment No. 70, I am convinced that the Government are alive to those issues.
<P>
The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey slightly over-egged the pudding in discussing amendment No. 7 and the question of school caretakers, because even if subsection 2(c) were deleted, such individuals would still be caught by paragraphs (a) and (b). On amendment No. 8, I am not convinced that we should strike from the Bill the offence of addressing a meeting, knowing that the meeting is to be addressed by a person who belongs or professes to belong to a proscribed Organisation. As my hon. Friend the Member for Penrith and The Border said, someone who is not a member of a terrorist organisation, but who speaks at a meeting in the full knowledge that terrorists will also be speaking there, confers spurious legitimacy and respectability on that terrorist Organisation. For that reason, I believe that we do need an offence of the sort described in subsection (3)(b).
<P>
<B>Mr. Gapes:</B> I think it was Mao Tse-Tung who said that fish need water to survive. Clearly, there will be important issues of balance. I agree with the hon. Member for Aylesbury that we need to judge carefully how far to go; we do not want to create a situation in which civil society is sympathetic to a terrorist organisation, even though it questions some of its tactics, and people are driven to support such organisations. On the other hand, one does not want a situation in which terrorist organisations can easily use public meetings, and what Communists used to call useful idiots, to recruit. We need to get the balance on those difficult issues. On balance, I think that the clause is justified, although I share the concerns of my hon. Friend the Member for Hall Green about such matters as journalists attending meetings. Perhaps we can return to those later.
<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> Again, the debate has been helpful, and there is a profound point at its core on which my hon. Friend the Member for Warrington, North touched. However, it has not been elaborated sufficiently. Proscription is designed to signal that organisations are outside the bounds of democratic activity, and that they have put themselves in that situation through their behaviour and intentions. The consequence of that, as described in the Bill, is profound. One cannot be a member of a proscribed organisation,  use the violent terrorist tactics that membership implies and at the same time claim the privileges of democracy.
<P>

</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> Spot on.
<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> I appreciate that remark, but I am aware that the official Opposition's warming tone will not help me with the Liberal Democrats.
<P>
I need to address some of the specific fears that have been raised. On Second Reading, the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey raised the question of support for democratic freedom struggles and other issues of that ilk. The offences would not apply to supporters of a freedom struggle in a democratic country so long as they were not associated with a proscribed organisation.
<P>
Earlier this afternoon, the hon. Gentleman said that people might have no knowledge that someone speaking to a meeting was a member of a proscribed organisation. Clause 11(3)(b) says that an offence is committed only if an individual addresses a meeting and
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"knows that the meeting is to be addressed by a person who belongs or professes to belong to a proscribed organisation".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Bill therefore explicitly excludes the possibility of such a person being caught by the clause.
<P>
It is important to remember that if someone organises a meeting in good faith and a speaker then professes to belong to a proscribed organisation, the organiser has not committed an offence. The proscription is clear.
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> Does the Minister concede that there could be another component, in that the prosecuting authority might use an element of common sense?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> It is possible, but I would not necessarily rely on it. I do not want to return to the issue of lawyers and how they operate, but the hon. Gentleman's point has weight.
<P>
The Bill is tightly drawn, which contrasts fundamentally with what the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey says about it. The offences referred to are arranging a meeting, managing a meeting, assisting people in those processes and addressing a meeting. The Bill does not refer to attending a meeting. It refers not to speaking but to addressing a meeting--making a speech.
<P>
A reporter would not be excluded from attending a meeting, as he would not be involved in arranging, managing or addressing it. To take the role of an interlocutor between organisations, as the hon. Member for Foyle does, is not to arrange, manage or address in the sense of the Bill at all. It is to speak and discuss, which is a different state of affairs. Civil servants who have been involved in contact in the past would not be caught by the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCabe:</B> I want to make sure that I understand properly. I acknowledge the distinction that my hon. Friend the Minister makes between addressing and speaking, but at what point can the distinction be made at gatherings of four or five people?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> We carefully considered the difficult question of the language used in the Bill, but we used the word "address" rather than "seek" precisely to deal with the point that the hon. Gentleman makes. As with every piece of legislation the courts will make their interpretation at the end about what has happened. I hope that my reassurance about our choice of "address" rather than "speak" focuses on the oxygen of publicity points raised earlier by the hon, Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone.
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for giving way. I am beginning to be very sympathetic to the point raised by my neighbour, the hon. Member for Birmingham, Hall Green. Could the Minister give this one reassurance: would he between now and Report get out his thesaurus and take another look at the difference between speaking and addressing? I am sure that his Department has clever people with lexicons at their disposal. I am a bit bothered about where the boundary falls: I am addressing the Committee, presumably, but if I turn to my hon. Friend the Member for Aylesbury to ask him what time dinner is, perhaps I am speaking.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> We deliberately chose the word "address", but we are prepared to see whether other words might fit the bill better. The word "address" was chosen quite carefully in contrast to "speak" or whatever and the intention is specifically focused on the oxygen of publicity point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> The Minister is being helpful in his answers. May I put it to him that the Bill, as drafted, leaving aside the definition of "address" or "speak", allows an offence to be committed by someone who addresses a meeting that could be as small as three people, including the person doing the addressing? The meeting could be in private and in a place that was not in any way advertised as a venue for a public meeting. A meeting of three people in total, in a corner in a pub, a bar or a house and would qualify if the address point was met. Do we not therefore need to be particularly careful not to risk the courts defining something that clearly was far beyond anything that any of us intended?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> Again, we have practice with us here. The courts have not gone down that path. As I have acknowledged to other hon. Members, I am prepared to see where we are with "address" and "speak". We have considered whether a better word than "address" might solve the problem, but the concept of the word is about proclaiming, making statements and so on, rather than, as the hon. Member for Solihull (Mr. Taylor) suggested, asking about the time of dinner. My mind is not closed. I am prepared to see whether there is a better way to deal with the situation. I would not want to mislead members of the Committee by implying that I have a better word in my back pocket. I have not. But I am trying to convey a clear meaning.
<P>
It is important to reinforce the point that proscription is about organisations that are outside the bounds of democratic society--organisations, by the way, that want debate in various ways to gain publicity. I hope that we can use language in our discussion of the issue that focuses on what the Bill says, rather than wilder flights of fantasy about what it might cover in certain circumstances. It is perfectly legitimate to raise questions--the discussion about "address" and "speak" is one such point--but it is important not to suggest that the Bill could be used to inhibit genuine support for democratic freedom fighters or whatever. It is important to conduct ourselves in that way. The Government intend to do just that. I urge hon. Members to oppose the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for making it clear--I had never believed otherwise--that support for a freedom fighting organisation, by itself, is not an offence. It comes within the Bill only if it is a proscribed organisation. I apologise if I gave the impression that I thought that the Bill made it an offence simply to attend: it does not: one needs to become more active. I understand the Minister's position.
<P>
The Minister has been helpful with the most crucial point of the two amendments. As I said at the beginning, amendment No. 8 is the more important, because it addresses the issue of participation in a gathering of people in a manner that was giving cause for concern. I am happy that, without misrepresenting him, the Minister said that this part of the Bill could be looked at: those who read our debates will be alert that that is so. Both sides of the Committee have agreed that there is--rightly--a matter on the agenda.
<P>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lidington:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 31, in page 6, line 21, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>", and the purpose of that address is to encourage support for that organisation and to further its activities".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, it will be convenient to take amendment No. 32, in page 6, line 26, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>", and the purpose of that address is to encourage support for that organisation and to further its activities".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Lidington:</B> The amendments qualify the offences set out in clause 11(2)(c) and (3)(b) and would make it a criminal offence, first, if a defendant
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"arranges, manages or assists in arranging or managing a meeting"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and, secondly, addresses a meeting, knowing that the meeting was to be addressed by a person belonging, or professing to belong, to a proscribed organisation and where the purpose of the address by that member was to encourage support for terrorism.
<P>
This is another amendment that is based on concerns raised with me by the Society of Editors and others. My concern centres on people who are attending perfectly legitimate public meetings that have nothing to do with terrorism, but at which members of terrorist organisations may be present. The hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone (Mr. Maginnis) will have copious experience of such events, but the point has been put to me that one could hold a public meeting of a residents' association, a parents' meeting at a school or a public inquiry, public meetings called by a local authority or health authority and, sadly--especially in Northern Ireland--there could be present at those meetings someone who is known to be a member of a proscribed organisation, but is legitimately there as a local resident, the parent of a child at the school and so on. We need to make sure that those legitimate meetings can go ahead and that the law draws a distinction between a meeting designed to encourage or confer respectability upon terrorism and other public meetings at which members of proscribed organisations may be present and which they may wish to address on subjects that have nothing to do with terrorism.
<P>
I hope that the Minister replies he will be able to reassure me or will agree to reflect on the matter further in the light of the comments he has made in response to debates on earlier amendments to clause 11.
<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> I do not have a great deal to add to what I said in response to the previous debate. I hope that, on consideration, the hon. Gentleman will withdraw his amendment.
<P>
I repeat what I said about proscribed organisations being outside the democratic framework. Amendment No. 31 describes how, at a legitimate meeting, a member of a proscribed organisation makes a case for that organisation and someone on the other side says, "No. You shouldn't do that kind of thing." The purpose of the amendment is to prevent the person who said no to the proscribed organisation from being caught by the clause.
<P>
In the society that is evolving, even now--it has been true for a long time, but becomes ever truer--some proscribed organisations might seek positively a political theatre to generate awareness of and publicity for what they are doing. I will not be as cruel as my hon. Friend the Member for Ilford, South (Mr. Gapes) and use the phrase "useful idiot", but people who might genuinely believe that it is their duty to stand up in a public meeting to oppose the proscribed organisation, by their conduct have the effect of encouraging awareness of the organisation. They thus make it more interesting, glamorous and exciting than it would be otherwise.
<P>
The fundamental principle behind the Bill is that if there is a proscribed organisation, our aim should be to drive it down, drive it down, drive it down and not permit any kind of wider debate that gives it a greater role than it might seek. So, while I understand the purpose of the amendment that the hon. Gentleman has moved, I hope that he will accept the weight of my points and consider withdrawing his amendment.
<P>
<H5>7 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I should like to ask a question before the hon. Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Lidington) winds up the debate. The presumption one has to draw from the Minister's statement is that the Government do not think that there is any circumstance in which a dialogue in a group as small as three people between those on one side of an argument and those on another is appropriate. I have to ask him whether he believes that the process of dissuading people from belonging to proscribed organisations, which in recent history have been only in Northern Ireland, could not have benefited from some engagement of people in the process and not just have a legislative structure that says one cannot belong. The evidence is not with him. The evidence is that the dialogue has been more useful than the proscription of the law.
<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> I do not want to go too far down this argument, but I do not agree with the historical description that the hon. Gentleman has offered. I will not pursue that discussion. I do not think that the Bill excludes dialogue in areas where dialogue can make a difference. Dialogue, however, is not debate. The issue we are talking about is debate. I am aware that it is legitimate to discuss what precise forms of language one uses in particular circumstances. That is why the Bill does not include any reference to debate, dialogue or anything similar, as that would add further confusion to the linguistic discussion we were exploring when we talked about "address" and "speak". It would be wrong to draw from anything I have said the conclusion that we are against any kind of dialogue as a means of resolving political situations. However, organisations that are proscribed may sometimes seek publicity in debate for what they are doing. We should seek to exclude that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I understand that the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone (Mr. Maginnis)  has more experience, but my personal experience in a non-proscribed organisation context, dealing with people who are up to no good and criminal activity, is that meetings to try and sort things out do not take place on a one-to-one basis unless one is very brave indeed. This is normally because if one is going to meet someone "on the other side" one will meet somebody who will usually have someone with them. One is then illegally into a grouping that is bigger than two and normally it is into a grouping that has at least four people--for security reasons--because those sorts of meetings do not happen otherwise. I put that into the debate since we have to take account of the reality that dialogue, conversation, engaging with people, seeking to dissuade people from criminal and terrorist activity, will often be unable to be done simply on a one-to-one basis. Therefore the hon. Member for Aylesbury is right to get us and the Government to think about how to achieve a correct definition, which I think we do not have as yet. I think that we are still in danger of precluding what would be useful processes in a democracy between those in proscribed organisations and those not in them. If we shut down that avenue of communication, we shall be in trouble.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lidington:</B> I remain somewhat concerned about the position of legitimate public meetings where people might find themselves straying inadvertently into criminal offences. However, in view of the Minister's comments, not just in response to this short debate, but earlier in today's sitting, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I advise the Committee that we shall adjourn until 8.30 for a dinner break.
<P>
<H5>7.4 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Sitting suspended.
