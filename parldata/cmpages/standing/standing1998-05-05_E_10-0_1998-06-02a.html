</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael Fallon </B>(Sevenoaks): On a point of order, 
Mr. Butterfill. I welcome you to the Committee and hope 
that you enjoyed the recess. We are rapidly approaching 
clause 87, which deals with personal portfolio bonds. I 
and other members of the Committee have not received a 
copy of the draft regulations to be made under the clause. 
The Government have helpfully published draft 
regulations in time for us to consider other clauses. It is 
especially important that we receive them for clause 87 
because they define personal portfolio bonds.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> That is not a point of order for the 
Chair. However, the Minister may wish to catch my eye 
at some point.
<P>
Schedule 10 agreed to.
<P>
Clause 62 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Schedule 11 agreed to.
<H4><center>Clause 63</center></H4>
<H4><center>Withdrawal except in relation to seafarers</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory (Wells):</B> I beg to move 
amendment No. 62, in page 46, leave out lines 2 to 46.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss the 
following amendments: No. 38, in page 46, line 3 at end

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`for earnings in excess of £100,000'.<P>

(b) any of those duties are performed in the course of a

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr Heathcoat-Amory:</B> May I, through you,
Mr. Butterfill, present our new Front-Bench spokesman, 
my hon. Friend the Member for Maldon and East 
Chelmsford (Mr. Whittingdale), from whom we will hear a 
good deal more? His masterly speech on the film industry, 
which spread quickly through the House, got him the job. 
His new duties are in addition to his functions as a Whip.
<P>
During our scrutiny of the Bill we have become used 
to some badly thought out tax measures, but clause 63 
must take a prize. It is undoubtedly designed to hit the 
rich tax avoider, but instead it will hit the ordinary person 
working abroad, probably on a long-term contract, such 
as a nurse, engineer or consultant. Those people, who are 
earning money for this country, have been able to set 
against the tax liability a concession known as foreign 
earnings deduction, which has allowed them to pay no tax 
if they have remained out of this country for more than 
365 days.
<P>
Although the concession is not quite that simple, that 
definition will do for the purposes of the debate. Indeed, 
it was introduced in that form by a previous Labour 
Chancellor, Denis Healey, who was doing all he could to 
promote export earnings in the face of a severe balance 
of payments difficulty.
<P>
<B>Mr. Barry Gardiner (Brent, North):</B> I am grateful for 
the history lesson, but does the right hon. Gentleman 
remember that in 1984 his Government abolished the
25 per cent. rule for those who stayed out of the country 
for 30 days at a time? Did he vote for that measure, or 
did he have the same qualms that he is expressing now?
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> Yes, the hon. Gentleman 
helpfully anticipates my speech. There have been changes 
to the concessions and we are not against further changes. 
If abuses are identified, let us collectively, deal with them, 
but that is not an argument for the overnight abolition of 
the foreign earnings deduction concession, as I shall make 
clear. The very people who bring in the earnings on which 
the Government are increasingly dependent will be hit by 
the clause. They contribute foreign earnings not only 
directly through their contracts, but frequently indirectly. 
For example, when a consultant is working in another 
country, that often leads to the subsequent export of 
British goods. Their activities abroad are part of the entire 
British export effort. We understood that the Government 
wanted to promote exports that is certainly what we 
have heard from the lips of the President of the Board of 
Trade from time to time but, as usual with the 
Government, there is a massive gap between rhetoric 
and reality.
<P>
<B>Yvette Cooper (Pontefract and Castleford):</B> Will the 
right hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I shall give way in a moment.
<P>
The Department of Trade and Industry is doing its best 
to promote exports, but it is being undermined by the 
Budget. The left hand does not know what the right hand 
is trying to do.
<P>
<B>Yvette Cooper:</B> Does the right hon. Gentleman agree 
that the subsidy is just as helpful for people who are 
promoting imports into the country?
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> It is interesting that the hon. 
Lady refers to a subsidy. I suppose that, in her eyes, all 
tax concessions are a form of subsidy. I shall give 
examples later that contradict her view that the measure 
promotes invisible imports as much as it promotes 
invisible exports. That is not the view of practitioners in 
tax firms and consultants and others working abroad.
<P>
I am dwelling on the conflict between what the 
Government said they are promoting and what they are 
doing in the clause. The danger is clear from the Red 
Book, which was published on Budget day. In a 
masterpiece of understatement, page 95 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the outlook for the traded goods sector is difficult".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The difficulties faced by UK traded goods producers translate 
into improved opportunities for overseas competitors in the 
domestic market."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Page 97 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The current account as a whole is forecast to move from a 
surplus of £4.5 billion last year to a deficit of £6.5 billion this year."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Those figures are confirmed by the latest statistics, which 
show a steady deterioration in the current account. The 
need to do something to promote British exports and 
overseas earnings is beyond doubt, but the clause will 
have the opposite effect. Economic illiteracy on such a 
scale should worry the Committee. I know that some of 
the people and firms who will be affected have written to 
Labour Members, so we look forward to their speaking 
on behalf of their constituents and firms in their 
constituencies.
<P>
It is particularly stupid that the alleged target of clause 
63 will probably escape entirely. The purpose of the 
measure is to counter tax avoidance by the so-called 
media and entertainment personalities those exponents 
of cool Britannia who are supposed to be avoiding tax 
to an unacceptable extent. Some of them avail themselves 
of the foreign earnings deduction concession or, as some 
people outside the Treasury have pointed out, they can 
make themselves foreign resident for an entire tax year, 
which runs from April to April. If they do so, and if they 
keep moving from country to country, they will not 
establish tax residency in another state, and they will 
avoid tax completely. The well advised and the well off 
will find another way to achieve what they currently 
realise under the foreign earnings deduction concession.
<P>
Many media and entertainment personalities have the 
flexibility to act in that way they can, at least to some 
extent, plan their schedules so that their tax liability fits 
into a full tax year. Nurses, doctors, consultants, engineers 
and people who work on contract cannot do so to anything 
like a similar extent. If a bridge is being built in Turkey 
or Tanzania, a civil engineering firm in this country cannot say, "Please will you ensure that the bridge is built 
so that our workers can fit their earnings into the British 
tax year, which runs from April to April?" If it could do 
so, such workers would be regarded, under Inland 
Revenue rules, as non-residents, which is the only 
alternative to the foreign earnings deduction concession.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gardiner:</B> Does the right hon. Gentleman agree 
that if the proposals can be avoided by the alleged 
abusers the high-earning, high-rolling people who can 
flit from country to country that would make a nonsense 
of any amendment that has been proposed by the various 
organisations of accountants that made representations to 
Committee members about the imposition of a capped 
ceiling of, under two different proposals, £100,000 or of 
£86,000? The right hon. Gentleman's argument shows the 
complete insanity of a capping ceiling, which would in 
theory allow better-off tax avoiders to continue their tax 
avoidance.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> The hon. Gentleman is half 
way to our position. He is beginning to understand that the 
Government proposal is unworkable and misconceived. 
Several of my hon. Friends want to contribute to the 
debate, so we shall work on him a little more. I agree that 
if there is an abuse and unacceptable tax avoidance, a 
precisely targeted measure would have been preferable.
<P>
As I explained earlier, the Government's proposal will 
allow the fat cat entertainers if such people exist to 
escape by using alternative parts of the tax Acts. 
Meanwhile, ordinary overseas workers will not be able to 
avail themselves of the alternative of becoming non-tax 
residents. The proposal hits the wrong people.
<P>
As I shall discuss later, the Government's proposal will 
detonate a bomb in the relevant firms by requiring a huge 
paper-chase. If the Government's aim was to mess up 
various overseas contracts, they have certainly succeeded. 
They dropped that bomb in the middle of those contracts, 
many of which were planned years ago. Workers signed 
contracts in good faith and are now working abroad. They 
understood that their remuneration was based on not 
having to pay UK tax, but the Government's policy, 
which took effect on Budget day, brought them into the 
tax net without any warning or consultation.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The measure affected media and entertainment 
personalities such as the Rolling Stones, whom we 
remember from our lost youth, and who are currently on 
a world tour. They will presumably have to make 
alternative arrangements if they can. As has been pointed 
out to Committee members, it is not just the Rolling 
Stones who are affected, but those who travel with them. 
The organisation of a tour of five continents is an 
enormous undertaking. The group's representatives have 
written to us saying:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Entertainers and their staff employed on a tour of this magnitude 
have had to plan for the dislocation involved for some two years in 
advance. The tour stretches over five continents, requiring contracts 
to be laid months ahead. All the crew stage hands, hairdressers, 
electricians, musicians, etc. have had the goalposts moved and the 
bulk of their legal tax relief eliminated mid way through their 
employment."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
They also point out that the so-called concession whereby 
payments made to them before Budget day will still attract 
foreign earnings deductions is not a concession at all. A 
substantial part of the crew's earnings will be calculated 
after the tour has finished, when the profit can be 
computed and distributed. Suddenly, those earnings will 
incur retrospective UK taxation. It is the retrospective 
element to which they particularly object.
<P>
We have been contacted not only by those in the 
entertainment world but by a number of engineering 
firms, including the British Consultants Bureau, which 
comprises 270 member firms. Last year, its fee earnings 
for this country amounted to some £2.4 billion. It points 
out that tax concessions, which in some cases are more 
generous than those that the Government seek to abolish, 
will continue in other European countries. The bureau 
states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"We had already been pushing the Government to ease, not 
harden, the tax regime in which we seek to work. The tax advantages 
that many of our EU rivals and others enjoy are enabling them to 
quote lower feesThe result of all this is that the capability of UK 
consultants to quote competitively for projects is being rapidly 
eroded."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Along with a number of member firms, the bureau 
points out that the Netherlands gives tax concessions after 
just two weeks' involvement in overseas projects. British 
firms are therefore struggling pitilessly to compete 
internationally. Cost comparisons are constantly made, 
and in many ways Britain has a competitive advantage, 
although the Budget is eroding that advantage, as we have 
discussed in earlier debates.
<P>
The Netherlands is not going to remove its tax 
advantages because it knows that it must export or die. It 
is an outward-looking trading nation whose tax system 
helps, and will continue to help, its consultants and 
overseas workers, just as ours used to help our workers. 
Why are the Government, who supposedly want to assist 
the export drive, cutting such people off at the knees?
<P>
I shall give some more examples of member firms' 
worries. I assume that all Committee members have heard 
of Halcrow, which is an extremely famous firm. In 1996, 
it received the Queen's award for export achievement, and 
in 1997 more than 60 per cent. of its earnings were 
secured from abroad. It points out the crazy situation that 
will arise should the clause become law. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Comparing two members of staff each with a fifteen-month 
overseas assignment, they will be treated differently for UK tax 
purposes if one assignment commences 1 March and one 1 October. 
The former will achieve non resident tax status as the assignment 
includes a complete tax year, while the latter remains fully taxable 
in the UK. The employee remaining liable to UK tax will almost 
certainly be liable to taxes in the overseas country and will initially 
pay taxes twice on the same income".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
By way of conclusion, the company says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The change will potentially mean staff salaries will need to be 
grossed up for UK tax, with the resulting increase in fees and the 
inevitable loss of work."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Either employees must suddenly suffer a retrospective 
drop in their after-tax income or, more likely, firms will 
have to gross up their salaries, with a loss of profits and 
investment, and, in future, a loss of competitiveness. The 
laws of arithmetic cannot be defied if an additional tax 
burden is imposed on foreign workers, they wil be worse 
off or their firms will be less competitive.
<P>
I could give many other examples, but I will not 
mention all of them. I must mention Mott MacDonald, 
however, as the hon. Member representing the 
constituency in which it is based is a member of the 
Committee. We shall hear from him in due course. It 
points to exactly the same difficulties, which it says are 
compounded because
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"it is usual for us to pay bonuses for any calendar year in the 
following year, generally after the end of the following March. The 
Government is therefore changing the tax treatment of these 
payments with retrospective effect."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It goes on to say:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The Group is engaged on significant activities in Pakistan, 
particularly in the water supply and irrigation sectors. Here, income 
of some £7 million per annum is generated and there are about
15 employees who would be affected in any year. The cancellation 
of the tax relief will mean that staff would be reluctant to work in, 
or return to, Pakistan and positions would be difficult to fill. This 
would have a detrimental financial effect on our contracts, not to 
mention the effect on staff morale."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This firm and its employees are doing their best to export 
goods and services abroad, and are being hit 
retrospectively by this Budget.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Gardiner:</B> I am sensitive to the right hon. 
Gentleman's arguments about the need to encourage 
export-led companies and increase exports. Will he 
explain why he believes that there should be a discrepancy 
between the concessions made by the Treasury to 
export-based companies that, because of the nature of 
their work, have a work force located predominantly in 
the UK, and those made to companies that, because of the 
nature of their work, have some workers based overseas? 
If his argument is based on the need to increase exports, 
why should the Treasury make such a distinction?
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> If the Treasury wishes to 
introduce other tax concessions to help exports, we shall 
listen to its proposals. The hon. Gentleman said nothing 
to undermine the case for continuing a long-standing tax 
concession for individuals who spend long periods away 
from the UK often in fairly disagreeable parts of the 
world selling British goods or engaging in overseas 
construction projects, many of which help the sectors 
referred to by the hon. Gentleman. The concession is 
therefore part of the overall effort to increase exports, and 
if the hon. Gentleman thinks that that is a case for 
removing it, we will allow him to dilate on the matter 
if he catches your eye, Mr. Butterfill later in the debate.
<P>
Many of the examples that have been sent to us I have 
quoted a random sample are based not only in the 
constituencies of Labour Members, but in the 
constituencies of Labour Members serving on the 
Committee, so we look forward to hearing their 
contributions. If they think that there is something wrong 
with the examples that have been brought to our notice, 
let us hear about it from those who seek to represent in 
Parliament the people mentioned in the examples.
<P>
What has really annoyed many of the firms and their 
employees is the fact that they are all being classified as 
tax avoiders. The notes on clauses for clause 63 assert that 
the existing tax concession gives an
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"unfair advantage to a few."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is true that there are comparatively few people working 
overseas at any one time, so, by definition, the tax 
advantage is well targeted and benefits comparatively few 
people. However, that is not the thought behind the 
phrase. The Government are accusing such people of 
using a tax avoidance mechanism, and they are putting 
them into the same camp as a few media and 
entertainment personalities who organise their working 
lives so as to avoid United Kingdom taxation.
<P>
The notes on clauses go on to state:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"It is a product of the Government's commitment to achieving a 
fairer tax system."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The people concerned do not think that at all; they very 
much resent the retrospective nature of the provision, and 
the implication that they go abroad simply to avoid UK 
tax. that is a kind of summary of this Labour Government: 
they hit the small people under the pretence of hitting the 
big tax avoiders. Clause 63 is an incompetent and badly 
targeted clause, which we oppose, and to which we have 
tabled several amendments.
<P>
I shall not end without emphasising another unintended 
consequence of the clause, which relates to the charity 
sector. It has been brought to our attention by the charity 
sector that people working overseas on aid projects will 
also be caught by the clause. It emphasises the fact that if 
such people wish not to pay UK tax when they are abroad 
for more than a year, it is open to them, too, to become 
non-resident for tax purposes. However, that means that 
they must be out of the country from April to April, and 
famines or disasters in the rest of the world are not exactly 
timed to coincide with the UK tax year. It is 
extraordinarily stupid and blinkered to try to squeeze aid 
workers into an inappropriate tax concession. The reality 
is that such people will not become non-UK tax residents 
but will pay UK tax, which will only put up charities's 
costs. They resent being classified as tax avoiders who are 
obtaining an unfair advantage.
<P>
One of our amendments would exempt the registered 
charity sector, and I ask the Financial Secretary, to think 
carefully about the effect of the clause on the charity 
sector. We have also tabled an amendment that would set 
an earnings limit, so if it is the Government's intention 
simply to hit very high earners, that could be done. We 
suggest a cut-off of £87,600, which coincides with the 
limit on pension payments. If the Financial Secretary can 
supply another figure, we will accept it. The Liberal 
Democrats have suggested £100,000. However the exact 
limit is less important than the principle. If the 
Government are trying to catch the very rich who go 
abroad to avoid tax, let us impose an earnings limit. But 
we should exempt those who go abroad in the normal 
course of business or as aid workers who earn well below 
that limit.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I hope that I have said enough to convince the 
Committee that the clause is misdirected and 
misconceived. It will damage our economy and it will hit 
the people whom we should be helping those who are serving overseas, often in distressing circumstances, who 
thought that they deserved better from this Labour 
Government.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I must point out that the amendment 
as proposed is incompetent. It should refer to lines 3 to 
46. I shall treat further debate on the amendment as if it 
reads correctly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I do apologise for that clerical 
error. We are following the Government's example. They 
made a similar mistake earlier in our proceedings.
<P>
<B>Dr. Vincent Cable (Twickenham):</B> Amendment No. 38 
is our attempt to provide a constructive solution to the 
problem. We appreciate that the Government are trying to 
close a genuine tax loophole. I agree that we should stop 
extremely well paid entertainers and others successfully 
evading the tax system, but the unintended consequence 
of that will be to affect adversely a significant number of 
people. We are trying to find a mechanism that allows us 
to catch the sharks while the smaller fish swim free.
<P>
I want to highlight three categories of victims of the 
change. First, the many individuals who work as aid 
workers or as freelance consultants for the Department for 
International Development will be affected by the 
measure. People take on onerous overseas technical 
assistance tasks partly in the knowledge that the foreign 
earnings deduction is available to them. It is a 
compensating benefit for taking on such work.
<P>
There is another tax complication. In some countries it 
should be possible to receive a tax deduction where there 
is a double taxation agreement. But in many countries 
where overseas technical assistance work takes place, 
especially in the middle east, there are no double taxation 
agreements. It is not possible to avoid the complications 
that arise from that. Individuals will have to enter into 
complex negotiations with Departments of finance and 
inland revenue of countries where the regimes are often 
opaque, or they will not be protected at all.
<P>
Secondly, companies will be hit by the change. We are 
talking about a highly competitive sector of the 
international economy. The bidding process for agencies 
such as the World bank has been made highly competitive 
partly because Governments, including ours, have insisted 
on value for money, resulting in fierce price competition 
in consultancy contracts. I understand that on average the 
profit margins of overseas contracts earned by consultants 
is about five per cent. it is low, but it is a sector in which 
British companies do well. We have, I think, a 30 per 
cent. share of the world market in project consultancy.
<P>
A reasonably prudent Government would have taken 
account of the fact that we should be encouraging a sector 
in which Britain has a comparative advantage. We should 
not be trying to do that through subsidies and artificial 
mechanisms but by putting British firms on the same basis 
as companies from overseas. The Netherlands is not the 
only sympathetic regime: the French and American 
regimes are much more sympathetic than ours is to 
companies working in that sector.
<P>
The change will affect companies in two ways. First, 
they will be affected retrospectively. Many of them entered into contracts that cannot now be unpicked 
without price flexibility, and they will suffer a significant 
loss in this year's contractual undertakings. Secondly, 
future contracts will become much more uncompetitive 
because of the additional costs that have to be factored in 
for foreign earnings deduction.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> The proposal will affect those who entered 
into contracts and the companies that made bids for 
contracts on the basis of the rules that applied on
17 March. Those companies will be at a disadvantage if 
they win the contract.
<P>
<B>Dr. Cable:</B> That is a valid point, and I am grateful to 
the hon. Gentleman for his intervention.
<P>
The proposal will affect freelance individuals, 
companies and charities. I received several representations 
from leading British charities that are concerned about the 
proposal's impact on their workers and on their finances. 
We have had several debates about the way in which tax 
changes over the past year have unintentionally hit the 
charities sector, and this is one more burden. Charities 
will have to compensate their workers for the increase in 
resultant costs.
<P>
To bring the threads together, we understand the 
Government's starting point and the fact that there is a 
problem with tax evasion, about which the Government 
feel that they have to do something. Our reasoned 
amendment would provide a reasonable exemption limit. 
We specified, rather arbitrarily, the figure of £100,000, 
but, the figure could be £80,000, £75,000 or even 
£50,000, what ever the Government consider to be a 
reasonable sum. What sum do they think would avoid 
problems with evasion, Treasury receipts and policing? I 
am not an expert about the technicalities.
<P>
Our amendment is intended to encourage the 
Government to come up with a constructive alternative. 
Their proposal, which is designed to prevent large-scale 
tax evasion, should be designed so as not to do significant 
injury to the many productive and often idealistic British 
citizens who work overseas.

<P>

<B>Dr. Lewis Moonie (Kirkcaldy):</B> I see absolutely 
nothing wrong with the Government's proposals about 
overseas taxation or with the principle that people should 
pay tax in this country or another. There is no question of 
applying double taxation. The proposal is simply that if 
someone is domiciled in this country 
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick St. Aubyn (Guildford):</B> On a point of order, 
Mr. Butterfill. Is it in order, during the course of another 
Committee member's speech, for a member of the Labour 
Front Bench to coach a Labour Back Bencher about what 
to say in the debate?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> That is not a point of order for me.
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> I cannot understand why such a shining 
light is still sitting on the Back Benches.
<P>
The principle that people should pay taxes in the 
country in which they are domiciled is fair, and there is 
no reason why hidden subsidies should be given through the tax system to people who work abroad, in whatever 
field they are employed. The true economic costs should 
be borne by the company concerned. If the Government 
want to realise particular objectives that they think are 
worthwhile, they should bring in specific schemes to 
compensate those whom they think are entitled to benefit.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick Gibb (Bognor Regis and Littlehampton):</B> 
Does that mean that the Government want to abolish the 
exemption that applies when an employee is abroad for 
12 months that span a complete tax year?
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> I have no objection to that at all but 
that is my personal opinion. My hon. Friend the Financial 
Secretary is entirely capable of explaining the 
Government's position. Someone who is domiciled in this 
country should pay taxes in this country, and to me 
that is the end of the matter.
<P>
There is a transitional problem that I want to discuss 
with my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary, about which 
we had several conversations. It concerns people and in 
particular teachers who are employed under the Central 
Bureau for Educational Visits and Exchanges, which is 
part of the British Council. Previously, when teachers 
were employed abroad under the scheme they were given 
a grant by the British Council to compensate for the 
higher cost of living in a country such as the United 
States. In common with many other bodies, the British 
Council discovered that through judicious use of the tax 
system it could avoid paying the grant. It naturally took 
advantage of the system and stopped the grant by allowing 
people to claim that they were non-resident, which 
allowed them to obtain a zero tax coding and, therefore, 
the additional income.
<P>
That is particularly relevant to people teaching in the 
United States, who earn their salaries here and retain 
financial commitments here but live in a country with a 
generally higher cost of living. The zero tax coding makes 
all the difference to being able to afford to live there. 
There will be a transitional problem for those who are 
employed there this year and in future years. Like 
everyone else, the British Council will have to 
compensate its employees who are going abroad.
<P>
<B>Mr. Shaun Woodward (Witney):</B> I am at something 
of a loss to understand why, given the principled 
argument being made on behalf of the Central Bureau for 
Educational Visits and Exchanges, the hon. Gentleman 
does not believe that the provision should be extended to 
charities working on famine and relief. it is extraordinary 
that he believes that a special case should be made for 
organisations such as the bureau, but not for those 
providing crucial aid elsewhere in the world where people 
are dying.
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> The fact that I am arguing for a particular 
case that I have been asked to bring to the notice of the 
Committee does not imply any view one way or another 
or reject the validity of any other case. I am arguing my 
own point. If the hon. Gentleman wishes to display his 
oratorical skills, he may do so on behalf of his own 
hobby-horse. I make no apology for arguing one case. If I argued for every case that came across my desk, I should 
be standing here for a very long time and I do not intend 
to detain the Committee any longer than necessary.
<P>
Teachers abroad, especially those in the United States 
this year, went on a specific understanding. The British 
Council, like every other public body, cannot at such short 
notice pay the extra grant necessary to compensate for tax 
liabilities incurred in that part of the current financial year 
since the Budget. Will my hon. Friend the Financial 
Secretary consider whether there is any way in which 
some form of transitional relief could be given at the 
relatively low levels necessary to compensate teachers 
who are abroad this year for the loss that they will 
otherwise incur when acting as ambassadors for their 
country?
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I applaud the efforts of my right hon. 
Friend the Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory) in 
trying to whittle down the effects of the clause, which is 
both retrospective and arbitrary. It is retrospective on 
those whose payment for work done will be made later in 
the year or next year. It is arbitrary because someone who 
goes abroad form 4 April in one year to 6 April in the 
following year and spends 90 days in this country during 
that period will not pay any tax, but someone who goes 
abroad from 4 April in one year to 4 April the following 
year, even if he does not set foot in this country during 
that period, will be subject to the full rate of tax.
<P>
Another arbitrary aspect of the clause is the token to 
the Deputy Prime Minister. We all know that before 
adopting a similar-sounding role in the ship of state, the 
Deputy Prime Minister was a left-wing bar steward on a 
merchant ship. No one is more admiring than I of those 
who work in the Merchant Navy, having done so briefly 
myself.
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> Man overboard.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> Well, there would be many men 
overboard if the clause applied to the Merchant Navy.
<P>
We admire those in the Merchant Navy who do a 
difficult job, but why are they being given a concession 
for their work environment without extending that to 
charity workers? We have heard form my right hon. 
Friend the Member for Wells how some of those who 
work abroad may, within the rules, be able to take 
advantage of the concession, but charity workers in 
particular will not be in a position to do so. Above all, 
charity workers who work abroad during their gap year 
after leaving school and before going to university will 
not be able to do so. Between the end of the school year 
in June or July and the start of their studies in October 
the following year, there is no way in which gap year 
students can arrange to be out of the country for a full 
year. Such charity workers are among the least well-paid 
charity workers and will have the burden of student 
debt so much increased by this Government on their 
shoulders, which means that they will certainly seek work 
both before they go abroad and after they come back. 
Therefore, it seems incongruous that, as well as facing all the other disadvantages of the new student system, they 
should be subject to taxation on their meagre earnings 
abroad.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
We have just heard an appeal from a Labour Member 
to extend relief to a certain group of teachers on what 
he called, I think, a transitional basis. We should welcome 
any attempt to mitigate the effects of the clause, and we 
welcome the extent to which the hon. Member for 
Kirkcaldy (Dr. Moonie) is coming round to the 
Conservative campaign on this issue. However, it would 
be incongruous to make a minor concession to a certain 
group of teachers but not to recognise the general case of 
those who go abroad on teaching projects during their gap 
year, and to extend the concession to all of them. Not to 
do so would be incongruous, unfair and would hit a group 
who will already find it especially difficult to realise their 
ambition to give something to the other nations of the 
world in their year off between school and university.
<P>
Government Members have suggested that this is a tax 
break, which raises the question whose tax it is anyway. If 
there is a lower rate of tax in the overseas country where 
someone works, that lower rate of tax applies to everyone 
working in that country under those conditions. It is not 
this country's tax break; the country in which they are 
working is primarily extending a tax break to those who 
go to work there.
<P>
The effect of the clause is to say that where third-world 
countries do not assess British workers for tax on payment 
for work undertaken in those countries as we would 
assess their nationals if they came to visit this country 
we should tax them. That is incongruous. It turns on its 
head the very thinking behind the clauses that we debated 
before the recess, which extend UK tax concessions to 
help some of the poorest countries in the world. It is 
another incongruity that, as a result of this and other 
clauses, when someone is sent abroad on a charity project 
funded by donations from UK individuals taking 
advantage of millennium aid concessions in the Finance 
Bill, what the Government give in a tax concession to one 
individual in this country they take with the other hand 
from a UK individual who is working on the ground. The 
thinking behind the clause is riddled with anomalies.
<P>
Many of the people involved contribute to the invisible 
positive balance of trade enjoyed in this country. I am 
proud of the fact that many consultancy firms in my 
constituency engineering consultancies, for example 
do a great deal of work in many parts of the world, 
including the middle east and far east. Their efforts do 
something to contain the worsening balance of payments 
deficit that has prevailed since the arrival of this Labour 
Government. If the Minister does not make the 
concessions that we have proposed, the clause will have 
a damaging effect on such firms.
<P>
Above all, one can see in the clause enormous scope 
not only for employees to remain overseas for the rest of 
the tax year but for an immense amount of bureaucratic 
work on expense claims. When such individuals go 
abroad, they quite validly have considerable expenses 
directly connected to their employment. While there is 
no requirement under the existing system to account for individual spending down to the last taxi fare, there will 
in future be a great deal of work for accountants and 
when these matters are considered by the courts and 
special commissions lawyers to debate what is and is 
not a deductible expense in computing the true taxable 
income of individuals. The more one thinks about this 
measure, the more one realises that it will take tax from 
those who can least afford it, which is why it is so 
fundamentally unjust.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown (Cotswold):</B> I wish to 
make several points relating to these amendments, but I 
rise in particular to speak in support of amendment
No. 174.
<P>
I well understand the Government's wish to prevent a 
perceived abuse. The tax base must be protected. The 
clause, however, is a sledgehammer to crack a few nuts. 
A more targeted clause, which would prevent some of the 
perceived abuses, would have been far better.
<P>
Two clear examples of abuse are given in the notes on 
clauses, and it would have been relatively straightforward 
to introduce measures to prevent them. Successive 
Governments in the 1970s Conservative and Labour 
Governments introduced tax measures to encourage 
firms to go out into the world and gain valuable export 
orders. We operate in an increasingly competitive world 
in this respect. Indeed, many firms have gone out into the 
world and been successful in obtaining export contracts, 
many of which have been priced on the basis of employee 
cost. As a result of this retrospective measure 
introduced, no less, on Budget day such firms will now 
find that their costing for such contracts has become 
uncompetitive. In many instances, however, such firms 
will be stuck with a fixed-price contract. If they are to ask 
their employees to go out into the world and fulfil those 
contracts, they will have to pay those employees extra.
<P>
Further aspects of the clause should be considered by 
the Committee. Paragraph 24 of the notes on clauses 
helpfully tells us that Britain has the largest range of 
double taxation treaties in the world, as it does. But what 
will happen to those employees sent out to countries 
where no double taxation agreement exists? I hope that 
the Financial Secretary can tell the Committee what will 
happen to employees facing a double tax bill the UK tax 
for the period during which they are abroad and the 
national tax where no double taxation agreement exists. 
Double taxation is monstrously unfair.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> My hon. Friend makes a valid point. Are 
not those countries where nurses, teachers and overseas 
aid workers are needed the less developed countries 
less likely to have double taxation treaties?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Exactly. My hon. Friend, as usual, 
makes a telling point. I want to return to the question of 
those countries when I speak about charities.
<P>
Those large taxpayers who are able to arrange their tax 
affairs in such a way that they can become non-resident 
offshore taxpayers they are principally either self-
employed or directors of their own companies will not 
be caught by this particular closing of the loophole. By 
and large, relatively low-paid people will be caught by these measures. They will have no option but to pay the 
increased tax; if they are lucky their employer will pay it 
for them.
<P>
Amendment No. 174 relates to charities. We heard that 
members of the British Council who go abroad on 
educational assignments will be hit by the measure. The 
change comes on top of the withdrawal of advance 
corporation tax relief which will hit charities from 2003 
to the tune of £400 million. That huge amount of money 
will be withdrawn from the charitable sector. The 
introduction of millennium gift aid will amount to 
between £20 million and £25 million. That in no way 
redresses the damage done to charities in last year's 
Budget.
<P>
This measure will seriously affect charities that send 
employees or assistants abroad to perform valuable work. 
It is unfortunate that people who give their hard-earned 
money to charities to support some of the most deserving 
and worthy projects in the world will find those charities 
cutting back on the work because they have to pay their 
employees or assistants more as a result of this new 
United Kingdom tax.
<P>
I hope that the Financial Secretary will announce some 
help to charities. I know from my work in the population 
sector that the UK is one of the most generous and 
effective countries in the world. We help out in some of 
the poorest areas through our charitable giving and work. 
It would not cost an enormous amount to exempt 
charitable and educational workers from the change, but 
it would help to redress the £400 million that will be 
withdrawn from the sector in 2003. I look forward to the 
Financial Secretary's response.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Ruffley (Bury St. Edmunds):</B> The notes on 
clauses make it clear that the Government are not 
targeting the right people. They include the words 
"exploitation" and "systematic exploitation". My right 
hon. and hon. Friends have explained that the clause is fundamentally misconceived. It will hit the many, not the 
few. Although relatively few people work abroad, the vast 
majority will bear the brunt of the change. The 
Government do not understand the difference between a 
perceived abuse and the commercial reality of contracts 
of employment. Amendment No. 63 would introduce a 
relief at the bottom end, equivalent to the pensions 
earning cap, for people such as consultant engineers and 
charity workers. In America, relief on earnings is given 
for those who work overseas. The amendment would 
achieve that.
<P>
Retrospection was covered by my hon. Friend the 
Member for Guildford (Mr. St. Aubyn). There is an 
anomaly. A person who goes away after 17 March, say at 
the end of March, for a whole tax year and who returns 
on 6 April 1999 will be able to claim relief on earnings. 
That person will pay no tax. If the same person left after 
the Budget at the end of May and returned in December 
1999, he would have to pay tax because, although he was 
away for a longer period, he was not away for a whole 
tax year. That is bizarre and needs to be emphasised.
<P>
As for the retrospective nature of the clause,
Mr. Fairbairn, head of tax at Ernst and Young, has argued 
that clause 63(5) will in practice render taxable bonuses paid under contracts completed in a qualifying period 
before 17 march where such bonuses are paid after that 
date. That is reputable tax advice of a high quality, which 
highlights an unconscionable level of retrospection. I 
therefore urge the hon. Lady to answer the point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gardiner rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The debate is now ranging 
quite wide of the amendments. Although I am happy to 
tolerate that, I am not now minded to allow a stand part 
debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> I am happy to give way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gardiner:</B> In the light of the hon. Gentleman's 
remarks, I seek to clarify whether he disagrees with advice 
given by the Institute of Directors. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"we recognise that instantaneous withdrawal is the obvious way to 
prevent exploitation of any period of delay".
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> I do not agree with that comment. 
However, I urge the financial Secretary to respond to the 
question of bonuses that are payable in respect of 
qualifying periods completed prior to 17 March, but 
which are paid after that date.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I have had a chance to read the end of the 
sentence from which the hon. Gentleman has just quoted. 
In full, it states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"While we recognise that instantaneous withdrawal is the obvious 
way to prevent exploitation of any period of delay, a method of 
withdrawal that does not have this unfair effect should be used."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> I am most grateful to my hon. Friend, 
who has drawn attention to a typical example of new 
Labour sleight of hand. The small print must be read in 
any comments that the Government make. One wishes 
that the British public had been as assiduous as my hon. 
Friend.
<P>
It is particularly ironic that individuals of high net 
worth who employ expensive tax advisers will be able to 
extend the periods that they spend abroad to cover a whole 
tax year. Not only rock stars but the self-employed will 
be able to take extended holidays in order to do so.
<P>
The same cannot be said of those consulting engineers 
and project managers who work typically in the middle 
east. They cannot control the amount of time that they 
spend abroad. Once the dam has been built, the project is 
finished and they must return to this country and end their 
period of non-residence. The clause will therefore have a 
greater impact on the many than on the few alleged fat 
cats. It will affect those who are least able to gerrymander 
periods of non-residence.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that 
the clause will encourage those who arrange to be 
non-resident for tax purposes, and who in doing so erode 
the tax base?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> My hon. Friend confirms my point. The 
clause's consequences need to be scrutinised. As my right 
hon. Friend the Member for Wells has eloquently pointed 
out, it will significantly damage British competitiveness. 
Employers' costs will increase because they will face the 
prospect of grossing up the pay of employees who work 
abroad.
<P>
I wonder whether the Treasury consulted the President 
of the Board of Trade before the clause was introduced. 
To judge by a conversation that took place in the second 
week of May, she had not been consulted about the clause. 
Given that it goes to the heart of British 
competitiveness they must be allowed to compete 
effectively and to win business abroad for this country 
why was she not consulted?
<P>
There are other ways in which the clause will damage 
competitiveness. We have already heard about the regime 
in Holland in respect of earnings that will not be taxed, 
two weeks is the relevant qualifying period. According to 
the information that I have received, in France the 
qualifying period is about six months, and in the United 
States it is about 12 months, which corresponds to the 
regime that applied before the Bill's introduction.
<P>
The competitiveness of exporting companies, which 
operate in all our constituencies, has been hit by the high 
pound. Consulting engineers have also been hit by the 
increase in employers' national insurance contributions, 
which was announced on 17 March. Employers at the top 
end will have to pay 12.2 per cent., which represents the 
skewing of the burden on the higher earners in corporate 
Britain. Many of the people who are affected are 
engineers and consultants who work abroad. The 
consequences are clear in the hard and fast example of 
the Crown Agents, which is engaged in an upgrading 
computerisation project of the Jamaican tax system. It 
says that the project will run at a substantial loss because 
of this retrospective legislation. Small businesses will no 
doubt be deterred from bidding for business. Why waste 
bidding costs if one knows that one will be undercut by 
foreign competitors and rivals?

<P>
I have another question for the right hon. Lady.
The information that I received from several large 
construction companies in this country is that many of the 
companies that currently operate out of the United 
Kingdom will seek to obtain a tax advantage by setting 
up offshore vehicles or consortiums to bid for projects 
and they will employ, for example, workers and engineers 
from those vehicles. That will not result in profits being 
remitted back to this country how can they be if offshore 
vehicles are involved? That will make a substantial dent 
in the tax yield that was projected in the Red Book.
<P>
As to consulting companies, the British Consultants 
Bureau estimates that many UK-based consultancy 
outfits, which are one of our great successes in terms of 
European market share, will be encouraged to relocate 
abroad, which means that they will recruit few if any UK 
residents. That is a deeply disturbing state of affairs in a 
competitive industry that generates an income of billions 
of pounds for this country.
<P>
The point about tax yield needs to be answered. Does 
the right hon. Lady have an estimate of the decrease in 
tax yields that may result from some of the practices that 
may be used to get round the clause's pernicious effects?
<P>
As to double taxation and double tax treaties, the advice 
that the Inland Revenue gave in its meetings with the 
many parties that will be affected by the clause is,
"Do not worry, boys and girls. The double tax treaty 
regime that Britain has extended across the world will 
save you." It was pointed out earlier that the Government 
do not have such treaties with some third world countries. 
Where they do, employees who are not able to satisfy 
residency for a whole tax year will be clobbered by tax in 
this country and by local tax in the jurisdiction in which 
they work. I have received extensive anecdotal and factual 
evidence from regional tax offices. The right hon. Lady 
should say whether regional tax offices believe that the 
tax system has been complicated to such an extent that 
they are overloaded and that the provision is an 
unwarranted complication to a system that worked 
perfectly well before. The pay-as-you-earn tax coding will 
have to be altered to take account of those who are paying 
tax in two jurisdictions and there will be different tax 
years for reclaiming tax paid in a foreign jurisdiction 
under a double tax treaty. That will add complication and 
mechanical difficulty to the Inland Revenue's job, 
certainly on the evidence of regional tax offices.
<P>
Reference has also been made to legitimate deductible 
business expenses in this country when benefits in kind 
are paid to a worker by a company in foreign jurisdiction. 
British taxpayers who export their skills to foreign 
countries and work abroad will be hit, not least in 
connection with double tax and because remittance of 
funds from a foreign jurisdiction can take a very long time 
with a commensurate cash flow disbenefit to taxpayers in 
this country who make a claim under a treaty. I am told 
that Italy is a particular offender and it would be 
interesting to hear from the right hon. Lady

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman has 
referred several times to the Financial Secretary as the 
right hon. Lady. She has many attributes and I am sure 
that it will not be long before she is invited to join the 
Queen's Privy Council, but she is not there yet.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> I have the highest regard for the hon. 
Lady for a variety of reasons and we all hope to speed 
her on her way to elevation to the Privy Council, but not 
yet I fear.
<P>
The cash flow disbenefits will be increased in two other 
ways. The first is when the remittance of moneys from a 
foreign jurisdiction under a treaty takes some time to 
come through. Halcrow, a distinguished consulting 
engineering company, is considering the provision of 
loans to staff who are hit by the cash flow disbenefit. If a 
loan is more than £5,000 a year, it will amount to a 
taxable benefit in kind for the employee, so he will be hit 
in another way.
<P>
With the complexity of double tax treaty reclaims, there 
could be more work for payroll departments of employers 
who, from the goodness of their hearts, decide to advise 
employees in that position. It is the responsibility of the 
employee under self-assessment to do the work, but 
employers will feel it incumbent on them to help their 
employees work their way through the morass of 
paperwork and complicated taxation law when making their claims. That may also result in a taxable benefit in 
kind for the employee for extensive tax and professional 
advice.
<P>
For all those reasons, the clause is a bad one. 
Amendment No. 63 is a sensible one to help the many, 
not the few. I hope that the hon. Lady will consider the 
concession not as an unnecessary tax break, but as 
something to help Britain abroad.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey (Kingston and Surbiton):</B> Along 
with my hon. Friend the Member for Twickenham
(Dr. Cable), I want to make a few constructive comments 
because the clause does not fulfil the Government's 
intentions in this and related areas of policy. As the 
Government realise, the Liberal Democrats keep a careful 
watch on the state of public finances and we are 
concerned that the measure will shrink rather than 
increase the war chest. We understand the attempt to 
increase revenue by closing loopholes, but we fear that it 
will prove counter-productive. The reason for that is the 
nature of consultancy and the consultant's business and 
the contribution that it makes to UK plc and to the 
Exchequer.
<P>
I speak as a former consultant. Before 1 May 1997, I 
worked for a company that conducted most of its business 
abroad, and over four years I worked and travelled in 
every continent and in nearly 30 countries. I have some 
experience of how consultancies price their contracts and 
the cost structures of a consultancy business. I have 
broken all ties with my former employers, so I have no 
vested interest to declare.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
The key characteristic of consultancies that I would like 
to draw to the Government's attention is their great 
freedom in their choice of location. Many consultancies 
are small firms that employ people from many 
countries my former company employed people from 
many countries in the European Union and beyond. Their 
smallness, fleetness of foot and reliance on an 
international work force allows such companies to choose 
their HQ or main location from among many countries. 
My former company considered relocating outside the UK 
on a number of occasions, but fortunately for me it 
chose not to move.
<P>
It is not just small consultancies that have freedom to 
choose where to locate and where to pay their main taxes. 
Large consultancy groups are now global companies and 
can move their main bases between countries within
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and 
Development with relative ease. The clause will lead them 
to use their freedom to relocate: already, a number of 
consultancies considering locating outside the UK have 
been brought to my attention.
<P>
What impact will that have on the Chancellor's war 
chest? It is likely that he will lose corporation tax receipts, 
rate receipts and national insurance contributions and that 
there will be a loss of jobs. Any consultancy currently 
located in the UK employs a lot of UK-based support 
staff as consultants in the field engaged in winning export 
contracts. The loss of those jobs will also result in a major 
loss of revenue to the Exchequer. Indeed, HQs located in the UK spend a lot of money on their buildings, and the 
tax revenue resulting from such expenditure will also be 
lost. The knock-on effect on the service industries that 
supply those HQs will be significant. In trying to take in 
revenue through Great George street, the Government will 
find that the net effect of the measure is a significant loss 
in revenue. I do not think that that is the Government's 
intention and it is in a constructive spirit to help them 
put the public finances in a healthy state that I make 
these points.



<P>
Finally, I want to speak about the impact on charities, 
which other right hon. and hon. Members have mentioned, 
and especially the impact on charities working in 
developing countries. What representations has the 
Financial Secretary received from such charities? Do they 
welcome the measure? Those that have written and 
spoken to me are aghast at the impact of the clause on 
their ability to help the world's poorest people. Has the 
Financial Secretary received representations from the 
Secretary of State for International Development? I cannot 
believe for a minute that the new support that the 
Government intend to give to developing countries, which 
is outlined in the recently published White Paper, will be 
assisted by this clause.
<P>
Will the Financial Secretary accept that the clause 
represents a cut in overseas aid? Labour Members have 
intervened in the speeches of Opposition Members to say 
that clause 63 removes an export subsidy. While they may 
want to consider it in that way, they should also consider 
that it removes an excellent way in which this country can 
provide assistance to some of the poorest in the world. I 
cannot believe that that is what the Government intend.
<P>
In conclusion, amendment No. 63, which introduces a 
cap of £100,000, would remove many of the problems 
outlined and enable the Government to meet their original 
intention in this clause without sacrificing other policy 
areas namely, the need for prudent finance and to 
increase their commitment to supporting the poorest on 
the planet.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> If there ever were a clause that required a 
Government rethink, this is it. If there ever were a clause 
that typified the Government's overkill approach to tax 
legislation, this is it. It was interesting to hear the speech 
of the hon. Member for Kirkcaldy because it is not 
often indeed, it is rare that we hear speeches from 
Labour Members. It is even rarer that we hear speeches 
urging the Government to amend their legislation. The last 
time that that occurred, it heralded a change of heart by 
the Government on dividend tax credits paid to 
non-taxpaying individuals. So I hope that the speech by 
the hon. Member for Kirkcaldy presages a change of heart 
by the Government. Indeed, however strongly he felt 
about the issue, the hon. Member for Kirkcaldy, who 
spoke on behalf of teachers employed by the British 
Council, did not see fit to table an amendment. It is 
Conservative Members who have tabled the amendments, 
and we urge the Government to accept them or pledge 
today to accept the principles behind some or all of them.
<P>
We need to be clear about what we are discussing. The 
exemption that the Government seek to abolish applies to 
a period of 12 months abroad, where those 12 months do 
not coincide with the tax year. If someone is employed abroad for a period that coincides with the tax year, he or 
she will be outside the scope of UK tax. The exemption 
applies only in the anomalous situation in which the 
period falls within the tax year, but the employee is 
abroad for more than a year. For some reason, the 
Government have decided to abolish that exemption.
<P>
The press release that announced the instant abolition 
of the exemption is headed "Countering Exploitation of 
Foreign Earnings Deductions" and says that the measure 
will raise for the Exchequer some £250 million a year. 
Paragraph 2 says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"This relief is exploited by a number of very high earning 
individuals to avoid paying tax on a signficant portion of their 
income."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It would be helpful if the Financial Secretary, in replying 
to the debate, would say how much of the £250 million 
yield is expected to come from those "very high-earning 
individuals". I hope that that will not be ignored by the 
Financial Secretary, as so many questions put by the 
Opposition during the debate have been. If it is ignored, I 
shall simply table a written question. [Interruption.] It 
would be helpful to have an answer before the Committee 
votes because we are still living in a parliamentary 
democracy, I think.
<P>
The notes on clauses say that the measure is a product 
of the Government's commitment to achieving a fairer tax 
system. How is it fair to introduce a retrospective 
provision, which will damage hundreds of companies that 
have entered into binding contracts with overseas 
purchasers of their services? Those companies cannot get 
out of providing those services, but the rug their whole 
cost basis is being pulled from under their feet. How can 
it be just or fair to abolish a relief that will result in such 
an anomaly? An individual who goes abroad on 6 April 
1998 and returns two years later, on 4 April 2000, will 
not be exempt from UK tax, but an individual who goes 
abroad for a year from 5 April to 5 April will be exempt 
from UK tax. An individual goes abroad for a year and is 
exempt; another goes abroad for two years less one day 
and is not exempt. That is absurd. How can it be regarded 
as part of a fairer tax system?

<P>

<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> Quote it in full.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I will. It says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Abolition of the foreign earnings deduction may also be 
ineffective against those who have abused it. They will be able to 
achieve a similar effect by spending a complete tax year abroad, 
thereby becoming not resident in the UK."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The change will not even affect the very people that the 
Government say it will. A high-rolling Spice Girl or 
Rolling Stone is able to move from one jurisdiction to 
another.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gardiner:</B> May I probe the logic, if there is any, 
of the hon. Gentleman's argument? He is encouraging us 
to adopt a capping system of £86,000 or £76,000 to ensure 
that the measure is better targeted on the rich. However, 
he tells us that those people will be able to avoid the 
scheme by opting for non-residency. He doubts whether 
the Exchequer will get any revenue from them. If he 
genuinely believes that non-residency is an option, how 
can he propose a capping measure as a solution?
<P>
<B> Mr. Gibb:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes my point. If the 
Government believe that the measure will deal only with 
high earners, they will accept the cap. But if they do not 
believe that it applies just to those people and that the 
majority of the £250 million of revenue that they expect 
to raise will come from nurses, engineers, consultants and 
aid workers abroad, they will not accept the cap. We wait 
to hear the Financial Secretary's response.
<P>
It will be interesting to hear how many people who 
have claimed for foreign earnings deduction were media 
and entertainment personalities with "very high incomes". 
How many people in 1996-97 claimed foreign earnings 
deduction? Of those, how many were media and 
entertainment personalities with very high incomes?
<P>
The notes on clauses say that many of the main 
beneficiaries of foreign earnings deductions
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"have been media and entertainment personalities with very high 
incomes."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
As the Government have made that statement, it should 
be easy for them to produce the figure.
<P>
The measures will create enormous administrative 
problems for employers. Some employers that I am aware 
of will have large one-off tax hits. One company will have 
to pay £16 million of tax. Another company, which has 
2,500 people abroad at any one time, will have to 
withhold tax for their employees. Most employees 
working on contracts abroad are paid from the UK. Tax 
will have to be claimed back from the Inland Revenue 
once an employer receives proof that the foreign tax has 
been paid. That will be hugely complex.
<P>
There will be enormous cash-flow problems. As one of 
my hon. Friends said, many companies will have to lend 
employees money to pay the double taxation that will be 
withheld initially. I understand from business that the 
Inland Revenue's application of non-tax codes is 
restrictive. That affects not only people who are covered 
by clause 63 but people who are abroad for more than a 
year and who should qualify under the old basis. The 
Revenue is clamping down on the use of NT codes for 
those people. The administrative burden for employees 
who have to cope with self-assessment will be huge.
<P>
The notes on clauses also state:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"there is little evidence to suggest that" <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
foreign earnings deduction 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"has succeeded in generating employment on any significant scale 
in the UK"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is absurd, because it helps UK employees to work 
abroad. They remain UK employees and to justify the 
provision by saying that it will not increase employment 
in the UK is nonsense and untrue. Those serving contracts 
abroad generate jobs in the UK, not only through profits 
coming back to the UK but in the administration of 
contracts, the design of contracts and a whole host
of administrative and high value-added jobs. The 
Government have revealed their complete ignorance of 
how business works and jobs are created.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Confederation of British Industry, which should 
know something about business, said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The proposed abolition of the Foreign Earnings Deduction...will 
create significant problems for companies which regularly send staff 
abroad for long periods."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It described at length the difficulties that will arise for 
competitiveness.
<P>
The Law Society also referred to the claim in the notes 
on clauses that the provision will have no effect on 
employment in the UK and said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"We would be interested to know how this evidence was sought, 
and whether research addressed the issue of whether business would 
be more likely to go to foreign employers if the cost of employing 
expatriate workers were radically increased as just mentioned."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Will the Financial Secretary tell the Committee what 
research has been undertaken to justify the statement in 
the notes on clauses?
<P>
The Chartered Institute of Taxation stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"We have been made aware that certain construction contracts 
overseas awarded to UK companies will suffer severe consequences 
since the terms of the contract were negotiated on the assumption 
that short term workers from the UK would qualify for the foreign 
earnings deduction." <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is first-hand evidence from business that it will suffer 
as a result of the provision. The institute continued:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"These companies have indicated that it will, in future, be almost 
impossible to recruit suitable employees from the UK and they will 
have to look elsewhere."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is a direct refutation of the statement made in the 
notes on clauses. The Chartered Institute of Taxation said 
that many employers
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"will have to look elsewhere"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
beyond the UK for people to fill jobs in contracts abroad. 
That will mean less employment for UK employees, who 
will remain in the UK and will not be sent abroad on 
contracts. That will increase unemployment.
<P>
The institute continued:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the abolition will ensure that UK companies who wish to employ 
UK resident employees on such contracts will be put at a 
competitive disadvantage to other companies from overseas when 
tendering We are aware of companies employing nurses, teachers 
and general consultants who will be in similar positions."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It went on to say that that would affect ordinary 
taxpayers not just the high rollers, as the Government 
claim.
<P>
The Association of Consulting Engineers said that the 
measure
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"will increase the disadvantage which British companies are already 
facing in comparison with their European counterparts."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Bury St. Edmunds 
gave examples of how the tax law of overseas 
jurisdictions would, when the provision had been 
abolished, be far more advantageous for employees in 
those jurisdictions working abroad than our tax law.
<P>
Amendment No. 174 deals with overseas aid workers 
and charities. There is huge concern about the effect on 
the charities sector. The Government have introduced a 
catalogue of measures that will damage charities and my 
hon. Friend the Member for Cotswold hinted at the matter 
when referring to dividend tax credits, which will cost 
charities some £400 million a year. I hope that we shall 
discuss that later.
<P>
The Charities Tax Reform group said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"It is ironic that the Chancellor generously created the Millennium 
Gift Aid Initiative to encourage giving to charities that work 
overseas, and simultaneously raised the cost of those very same 
charities by penalising their overseas employees."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It continued,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Charities should not become innocent casualties of the attempt 
to end the exploitation of foreign earnings deduction rules by high 
earners."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We could quote many examples of charities that will 
suffer as a result of the measure. At any given time the 
Save the Children Fund has between 50 and 100 
employees whose humanitarian work helps children in 
difficult and heart-rending circumstances in Sudan, 
Ethiopia, Burundi, Rwanda, Tanzania, central Asia, 
south-east Asia, indeed throughout the world. The 
measure will penalise such charities.
<P>
Charities may be unable to get exemption from the very 
high tax rates that sometimes obtain abroad, because the 
measure will make it difficult for them to send employees 
abroad at any time other than from 5 April to 5 April. 
What will happen if a famine occurs in May or June of a 
given year? Are the Government telling charities that they 
should wait until the following April before sending 
people abroad because that is the tax efficient thing to do? 
That is the absurd fiscal message that the clause sends.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Loughton (East Worthing and Shoreham):</B> 
My hon. Friend makes a good point about the clause's 
effect on emergency charity work. Is he also aware that 
the VSO, which employs more than 80 full-time workers, 
provides an additional 2,000 volunteers for crucial 
projects throughout the world? Is he further aware that the 
measure's one positive aspect may be that it will 
deservedly hit mercenaries, with whom the Government 
are familiar through recent events in Sierra Leone?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> As always my hon. Friend makes a personal 
point, and he is right. Many thousands of British people 
working abroad in charities and in industry will suffer 
as a result of what is an inhumane and administratively 
burdensome measure. I urge the Government to accept 
one or more of the Opposition's amendments, which 
would ameliorate the clause's damaging effects.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> This is a terrible clause that will 
expose yet again the Government's double standards. It 
will have a huge impact on overseas charity workers, and 
it is totally at odds with the Government's rhetoric. The 
Economic Secretary told the Committee that the 
Government want quickly and directly to aid inhabitants, 
particularly children, of those countries in need, and that 
the Government do not want to delay in any way the 
provision of the help that such people desperately need. 
However, at best the clause will delay that help; at worst, 
it may cost lives.
<P>
The right hon. Lady made much of the Government's 
use of charities' experience. One wonders how much 
experience she has drawn on in preparing the clause, and 
how much experience hon. Members may have been 
prompted to draw on when genuinely considering the 
amendments.
<P>
Hon. Members spoke this morning about a number of 
charities, including Save the Children. The clause should 
undoubtedly be re-examined in the light of such charities' 
needs. Save the Children has examined the implications 
of the extra administration that the clause will generate, 
and of the huge anomalies that it will produce among its current staff. Both the anomalies and the administration 
will have to be dealt with. Where is the money expected 
to come from? Currently, the only available source is the 
charities' own funds. The inevitable consequence will 
therefore be that charities will do less charitable work.



<P>
VSO, which has already been mentioned this morning, 
employs 80 people throughout the world, whose 
development work in countries as far away as China, 
Mozambique and South Africa is absolutely vital. For that 
work to continue, charities must be able to plan. However, 
if one asks such charities, "Do you know where you stand 
in the light of this clause?", the answer is no.
<P>
The Government must begin to learn that they are 
robbing the charitable sector through taxation, and 
creating a huge area of uncertainty in which it is forced 
to operate. Most VSO staff work on two-year minimum 
contracts. They are not fat cats, film stars or rock stars; 
they are individuals who are highly motivated and 
committed to helping poorer people overseas. They are 
crucial people, at the heart of our voluntary and charitable 
sector. Their work is life saving. What will the clause's 
impact be on that life-saving work? Ask VSO. That begs 
the question whether hon. Members and civil servants in 
the Treasury actually asked charities what the impact of 
the proposals would be. If the Financial Secretary had 
asked VSO, it would have told her that the consequences 
of having to start paying UK tax would be that it could 
not keep such people overseas. So the consequence of 
the clause is that vital development work, to which the 
Economic Secretary told us last week that the 
Government were committed, will have to end.
<P>
VSO dos not have the resources to increase salaries to 
compensate for the clause. It does not have the resources 
to start meeting the national insurance claims that will 
have to be paid. In view of the specific charities that will 
be affected, the clause will not only affect quality of life 
it is not about creating, in the Government's rhetoric, a 
fairer society but could cost life by being a tax on life.
<P>
This morning, Government Back Benchers said that 
they agreed with the principle of the clause except if 
they had been lobbied by individuals or organisations, in 
which case they are happy to seek to introduce 
exemptions to the principle; it is hard to understand what 
sort of principle that is. How can anyone genuinely agree 
with a proposition that will cost life? But that will be the 
consequence of this tax on overseas charities. If 
transitional relief can be given to teachers, as Labour Back 
Benchers argued this morning, why should not the 
exemption apply also to charities? If we give transitional 
relief to charities, why not give it also to aid workers?
<P>
The hon. Member for Brent, North said that he saw 
nothing wrong with the principle. What about the 
principle of famine aid relief? It falls to the Financial 
Secretary to tell the Committee because the Government 
have argued, again and again, in favour of public 
consultation. How much consultation with those charities 
was there? Which charities did the Financial Secretary 
consult? How much time were they given to make 
representations? Did the Financial Secretary make it clear 
to those charities what the effect of the clause would be? 
As VSO has told us, it does not know where it stands. 
The Save the Children Fund does not know what the 
consequences of the administrative charges will mean. Would it not be proper for a Government who say that 
they want to help the charity sector I respect that 
claim to go back and consult those charities and, if the 
charities believe that the clause will cost lives as a result 
of the taxation that it imposes, rethink and introduce a 
suitably amended clause on Report, so that the work of 
those charities can continue?

<P>

<B>Mr. John Burnett </B>(Torridge and West Devon): What 
is so illogical and unfair about clause 63 is that it will 
have no impact on those very wealthy individuals who are 
perceived by the Government to have abused the system. 
They can and will continue to organise their affairs so that 
they are taken out the UK tax net by spending an entire 
tax year out of the country. Those people are free agents 
who are able to run and organise their own lives, and they 
will continue to avoid tax. The change will have no effect 
on them. However, the low and middle-income earners 
charity workers and professional and technical staff who 
will be hit will be the least able to pay the tax imposed 
by the clause.
<P>
Individuals and companies on existing contracts will be 
affected. There is a retrospective element in the change. 
A post-Budget bonus paid in respect of pre-Budget 
services will be subject to tax. Individuals and companies 
entered into overseas contracts in good faith. The 25 per 
cent. foreign earnings deduction was abolished because it 
was perceived to be neutral it encouraged both imports 
and exports. But the 100 per cent. foreign earnings 
deduction greatly assists our export effort, especially in 
the consultancy and service sector.
<P>
I hope that the Government will reconsider this 
ill-judged and ill-targeted clause which will weaken our 
export effort and our ability to earn foreign exchange.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> This has been a wide-ranging debate 
thanks to your generosity, Mr. Butterfill, which has been 
justified because we have exposed one of the worst 
clauses of the Bill. The clause will damage the exports of 
large and small companies and the humanitarian exports 
provided by charities, teachers and voluntary workers. 
That is bad enough, but there is no element of transitional 
relief to help people move from the old arrangements, 
which were in place before 17 March, to the new ones. 
The new provisions take immediate effect and, in some 
cases, retrospective effect on payments arranged before 
but not paid until after 17 March. Above all, we have 
established that the clause is an overreaction to what is a 
very narrow issue.
<P>
Several hon. Members drew attention to the gratuitous 
and offensive wording of the explanatory notes. The notes 
tell us that the clause is all about "countering exploitation" 
and that the foreign earnings deduction is
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the keystone of schemes to avoid paying tax anywhere in the 
world."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We are also told:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The Inland Revenue have clear evidence of systematic 
exploitation".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is not the evidence presented to the Committee this 
morning. On the contrary, the clause has been condemned 
by every speaker in the debate, including the hon. Member for Kirkcaldy who rightly sought to establish 
transitional relief for one of the groups affected by it. The 
clause has also been condemned by outside organisations.
<P>
We began with a useful contribution from the hon. 
Member for Twickenham, who pointed out that 
individuals will be hit as much as companies. He 
advocated an earnings cut-off limit of £100,000. We are 
not tied to our figure of £87,600. If he will consider 
supporting our proposal, we shall certainly consider 
supporting his.
<P>
The hon. Member for Kirkcaldy rightly drew attention 
to the lack of transitional arrangements for those on 
teaching contracts abroad. He was asked why he did not 
seek the same transitional arrangements for those working 
for charities, and he said that he was equipped to speak 
only for teachers. However, I am sure that he accepts that 
the same point applies to those who work for charities and 
to those who undertake voluntary service overseas.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Guildford spoke of the 
absurdity of the Bill's purely arbitrary new time limits. 
My hon. Friend the Member for Cotswold
(Mr. Clifton-Brown) spoke eloquently about the 
proposal's effect on charities and on those who give up 
their earnings in this country to work in the 
humanitarian cause.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Bury St. Edmunds
(Mr. Ruffley) gave useful comparative information in 
support of the amendment, and he point out that other 
countries handled such arrangements better. By 
dismantling the deduction that was set out 20 years ago, 
we shall worsen the position of United Kingdom exports 
compared with those of our major competitors.
<P>
The hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton
(Mr. Davey) shared with the Committee his consultancy 
experience and he explained how the clause would cost 
jobs and affect our competitiveness.

<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and 
Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb) spoke of the clause's 
unfairness. He, and the hon. Member for Torridge and 
West Devon (Mr. Burnett), pointed out that the very rich 
can find ways round the provisions because high-network 
individuals rock stars, entertainers and sportsmen can 
afford to purchase and to maintain a series of residences 
around the world, which enables them to avoid the tax 
provisions.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Witney
(Mr. Woodward) spoke eloquently of the turmoil and 
uncertainty that is being created in the charities world, 
and he rightly drew our attention to the clause's 
incompatibility with clauses 47 and 48, which we 
acknowledged a couple of weeks ago.
<P>
A powerful case has been made against the clause by 
those who spoke this morning in support of the 
amendments and by many outside organisations, which 
have discussed its damaging effects. The Association of 
Consulting Engineers said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The immediate application of this change will have a serious 
effect on British consultancy engineering companies for their signed 
contracts to work overseas was calculated on the basis that the staff 
concerned would not be subject" <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
to overseas tax.
<P>
Ernst and Young pointed out that the clause would have 
ludicrous effects. Several Committee members have 
emphasised the fact that someone who is abroad from
5 April this year to 6 April next year but who spends
90 days in this country will not be taxable in this country 
whereas a colleague who left on 4 April and who returned 
on 5 April next year, having made no visits at all to this 
country, would be taxable. In what sense, Ernst and 
Young asks, would that second person be judged to be 
worthy of tax relief?
<P>
Such points are made by large management 
consultancies and big companies and by the Federation of 
Small Businesses. What is its view of the clause? It said 
that it was
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"naive in the extreme and avaricious in its application",
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and it pointed out that small businesses would be 
damaged.
<P>
Perhaps the most damning indictment comes from the 
CBI, which pointed out that the clause made no 
distinction between abuse and ordinary commercial cases, 
and emphasised the loss of competitiveness that would 
result. The British Consultants Bureau, which has already 
been quoted in these proceedings, has produced evidence 
that contracts have already been lost simply as a result of 
the publication of the clause. Damage has been done 
because companies have had to renegotiate fees to cope 
with the change to the foreign earnings deduction.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Bury St. Edmunds
(Mr. Ruffley) quoted the example of the Crown Agents, 
which has also contacted me. It has calculated that it will 
have to compensate around 40 of its employees at a total 
cost of £500,000. That may well make existing contracts 
uncompetitive and may ensure that its previous contracts 
will have to be reworked because they are unrealistic.
<P>
What effect will the clause have if it passes 
unamended? I suspect that British companies will have to 
use foreign nationals rather than UK nationals. They may 
chose to keep their existing tax exempt staff overseas 
rather than rotate them, which will also add to costs. They 
may start to send cheaper, less well qualified staff, at a 
greater risk to their chances of success in winning 
contracts. They may play the rules by maximising the 
various allowances. Most damagingly of all, they may 
tend to quote the work through overseas subsidiaries, 
thereby depriving the UK of the profits for corporation 
tax purposes.



<P>
The clause is extremely damaging. Our amendments 
attempt to mitigate that damage. First, we have suggested 
that all but the very rich should be exempted from the 
effect of the clause. As I have explained to the Committee, 
a cut-off limit of £100,000 or £87,000 would leave the 
very rich free, if they wished, to leave the United 
Kingdom altogether and move between their various 
residences. Such an amendment would mean that clause 
63 would not catch those who work for small sums 
charity workers, those on volunteer service, those on 
teaching contracts and the middle management employees 
and engineers who are bringing home the bacon in 
export terms. <P>
Secondly, we could limit the effect of the clause as a 
number of hon. Members have suggested to those 
countries that have exempted consultants from local 
taxation to keep costs down. The clause will apply to 
many countries where there are no double taxation 
treaties, including countries in the middle east where 
British engineers and consultants are doing substantial 
business. The Financial Secretary should consider the 
possibility of limiting the proposed legislation to countries 
that are not covered by double taxation treaties.
<P>
Thirdly, the problem of transition could be addressed. 
At the very least, the Financial Secretary could 
acknowledge the unfairness of introducing arrangements 
that are retrospective and have immediate effect. She 
could concede that the clause should not operate at all 
until the beginning of the new financial year or, rather 
than operating on budget day, that it should at least not 
operate until the beginning of this tax year.
<P>
Finally, if the Financial Secretary is not prepared to 
make any such concessions, she could at least accept 
amendment No. 174. As a number of my hon. Friends 
have eloquently pointed out, famine relief can never be 
fiscally driven. It is absurd that charities should have to 
wonder about the tax arrangements of their employees 
when they must urgently provide help in areas of the 
world, such as Sudan, which have been hit suddenly. If 
she does nothing else, I hope that she will at least 
undertaken to consider the special position of charity 
workers.

<B>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury </b>(Dawn Primarolo): May I begin by congratulating the hon. 
Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford on his 
promotion and, in his absence, the hon. Member for 
Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond), who I 
presume is swotting up on the national health service, as 
he is about to take up responsibility in that area.
<P>
This morning's extensive debate on clause 63 revolved 
around issues of fairness I want to ask to whom? 
Mention was made of double taxation and retrospection 
and important points were made about charities. I want to 
deal first with the issue of fairness to the taxpayer, not just 
those who seek not to pay tax through foreign earnings 
deductions, but fairness to al taxpayers in the United 
Kingdom.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
The basic question is why should UK residents not pay 
UK income tax when everyone else must. The debate was 
dressed up so that it seemed as if we were discussing 
low-paid workers. Obviously, I have a slightly different 
opinion from the Liberal Democrats of what counts as a 
low-paid worker because they want to add 1p to the 
income tax of everyone who earns more that £50,00 a 
year and lives in the UK, although their amendment 
would allow individuals who can take advantage of FED 
to earn up to £200,000 a year and not pay any tax at all. 
The hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey) 
says that he is interested in ensuring that the finances of 
Government are secure and the money well spent. There 
is a contradiction in his policy. Other hon. Members 
raised issues of fairness 
<P>
<B></B><P>
Mr. Ruffley: Will the hon. lady give way?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I am just about to deal with the 
points of the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds. I shall 
deal with his point about double taxation later, but he said 
that we should allow a cap of £87,600. We should 
examine what that would mean in practice.
<P>
If we were to accept the amendment, a well-paid 
employee working abroad would pay no tax on a salary 
of £87,600 but a pensioner in the UK, on an income one 
tenth of that £8,760 would pay more than £800 a year 
in tax. We believe that is unfair because it would allow 
high-paid workers not to be liable for tax not only in the 
UK; the FED provision protects them from paying tax 
anywhere on their substantial income. That is at the heart 
of clause 63.



<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> Is there not an inconsistency in the 
Financial Secretary's argument? If an individual makes 
himself or herself non-resident during a tax year, he or 
she will not pay tax. The hon. Lady is arguing that 
everyone should pay tax, even if they are resident abroad. 
That is not the case. Under the regime that the hon. Lady 
still supports, if one complete tax year is spent abroad, no 
tax is payable. How can she possibly explain the comment 
that she has just made in the light of that blatant fact?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The hon. Gentleman knows that the 
residency rules are very complicated, and he has spent 
time at the Treasury. In relation to FED, we are saying 
that a UK resident will be liable to pay tax, with the 
exception of the residency rules, which are unchanged by 
the clause. I know that we are not here to discuss the 
residency rules, although some Committee members have 
done so. Those rules are complicated, and there is some 
misunderstanding about whether the employees who were 
quoted earlier would come under the FED regulations 
because it is not clear whether they would be non-resident 
and therefore not liable to pay tax.
<P>
It is ridiculous and nonsensical to suggest that 
removing an immunity to pay tax on that group of 
individuals is an attack on the less well-off. It is not. Nor 
should we forget that that tax has to be paid by the rest 
of the United Kingdom's taxpaying population. The 
figures that were produced by the British Consultants 
Bureau, which was mentioned earlier, show how many 
people are working abroad under the employment of, for 
example, Crown Agents or Halcros. Salaries range from 
£35,000 to £75,000 or more a year, plus expenses and 
other support. Conservative Members are asking the 
Government not to require those people to pay tax when 
a pensioner has to pay tax, but that position is simply 
not tenable.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> What is the impact of our amendment on 
UK-arising income?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The impact of the amendment would 
be to allow people to earn up to £200,000 a year tax free, 
and it would undermine many of the clause's provisions.
<P>
The Government and the Opposition have a straight 
disagreement of principle. Does the hon. Gentleman and 
his party accept that people who are resident in the UK should pay UK tax? If they do not accept that, obviously 
they will not accept the clause. The Government's view 
is that, from the point of view of fairness, people who are 
resident in the UK or who are UK citizens should be liable 
to UK tax, although there are exceptions, which depend 
on resident or non-resident status and on the interplay of 
double taxation treaties.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> The Financial Secretary's 
remarks make no sense at all. She will leave in place an 
alternative tax exemption that is available in particular to 
the super-rich, and she will end a similar tax exemption 
that is made use of by overseas contract workers. To 
follow her own argument, why is she doing nothing about 
the non-tax residency rules, which open up that other 
avenue to precisely the people whom she is trying to hit 
in the clause?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> Residency is an international issue 
with complex international rules. FED is a UK relief for 
UK residents, and the comparison with other UK residents 
is fair.
<P>
I appreciate the fact that Conservative Members want 
to give immunity to high-earning individuals who do not 
want to pay tax in the UK, but that is not the 
Government's view. Our view is that they should pay tax. 
In the clause we are attempting to secure the tax base by 
countering the abuse of existing rules. We do not say that 
everyone is deliberately avoiding payment, but the rules 
are being used in a way that was not intended, and we 
need to close off that avenue.
<P>
I was asked why we had not given adequate warning 
about transition. We did not because to do so would open 
up other loopholes for abuse, which would allow people 
to avoid paying tax. We want to ensure that FED, which 
provides tax-free salaries and immunity from tax, does not 
continue. That is straightforward.



<P>
Opposition Members claim that companies depend on 
the subsidy and that they are incapable of being 
competitive in the world without it although they do not 
want to call it a subsidy 
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> Will the hon. Lady give way?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I wish to make some progress 
because we have had a long debate and many important 
questions have been asked about charities, teachers, 
double taxation and so on. If I can make some progress 
now, I shall be happy to give way to the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
The Government have shown that they are committed 
to supporting United Kingdom industry. Our reduction in 
corporation tax rates is just one example. Requiring 
employees to pay their tax, which might mean that 
employers must pay the rate for the job, is a matter not of 
tax but of fairness.
<P>
Double taxation treaties are in place to ensure that no 
income is taxed twice. Opposition Members know that. 
The Inland Revenue will give treaty exemption or relief 
immediately on receiving a claim. No taxpayer should 
suffer double taxation as a result of clause 63. When no 
double taxation treaty exists between the United Kingdom 
and the mother state, the United Kingdom will give 
unilateral relief. Income will not be taxed twice.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Will the hon. Lady give way?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I want to make progress.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> It is on this point.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I shall give way on the double 
taxation issue when I have finished my points.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds I have 
promoted him, but I would not want anyone to think that 
this is a mutual appreciation meeting. The hon. Member 
for Bury St. Edmunds suggested that there would be 
delays in obtaining double taxation relief. The 
responsibility for claiming double taxation treaty 
exemption or relief lies with individual employees. The 
relief or exemption may then be given in one of two ways. 
It may be claimed at the end of the tax year, or it may be 
given on a weekly or monthly basis by adjusting the 
PAYE code number. The majority do it that way. The 
Inland Revenue is currently briefing all its district offices 
to ensure that claims are dealt with speedily and, when 
requested, relief is given as salary is paid.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman referred to disagreement or 
confusion in tax offices. I am not aware of that, but if he 
will specify which districts are confused and identify the 
problem I shall be happy to ensure that they are given the 
correct information on how to deal with the matter.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman also referred to bonuses paid after 
17 March in respect of a period before 17 March. In one 
sense, that shows how any transition could have been 
avoided if the provisions were in place. The bonus will 
be liable if it is paid after 17 March, which is the effective 
date. It is the only certain way to prevent a massive flow 
of money from trying to qualify in a period before the 
relief was supposed to be given.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> The hon. Lady is very generous to give 
way and we appreciate that.
<P>
If a contract of employment specified that a bonus was 
payable on a future date and the contract was completed 
before 17 March that is, the qualifying period was 
completed before 17 March how can she say that the 
provision is an anti-avoidance measure? Clearly it is not.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The legislation specifies 17 March 
as the qualifying period. Payments made after that period 
come into the tax net. Hon. Members rightly identified 
that as the intention of the clause. Tax is paid after that 
date.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The hon. member for Bury St. Edmunds mentioned 
companies going offshore, bidding contracts and other 
issues. An employer's location does not affect the tax 
charge on the employee. The charge to tax depends on the 
resident status of the individual and where the 
employment duties are carried out. A UK resident will 
be taxed irrespective of an employer's location. The hon. 
Gentleman said that the matter was complex and that it 
made tax codes complicated. Clause 63 does not increase 
the burden on the employer. The employer will be given 
a PAYE code. Computer-based payroll systems will calculate the tax on the basis of the code number. An 
offshore employee is dealt with in the same way as a 
UK-based company. The system is simple to operate. The 
relief gave some individuals an immunity to tax. There is 
no way to decide how to phase out an immunity without 
providing an opportunity for the Exchequer to lose 
revenue. That is why the Government have acted in this 
way.
<P>
The vast majority of those who claimed the foreign 
earnings deduction were on substantial salaries. If they 
were in the UK, they would pay tax. If people in the UK 
who earn less than them pay tax, so should they.
Thirty thousand people claimed FED last year out of 
nearly 30 million taxpayers who have to make good the 
revenue that is lost. Some 20,000 will be affected by the 
measure.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton 
asked about high rollers. I am afraid that the Inland 
Revenue does not have a working definition of high 
rollers and we have not considered how to break down 
the category. I have given him the number of people 
affected. There is no problem with tax codes for PAYE 
employees. The hon. Gentleman commented on non-tax 
codes. The Inland Revenue has not changed the conditions 
for issuing NT codes other than those that were in place 
for FED claims. He explained that it was possible to table 
parliamentary questions. If he has a specific complaint 
about a constituency issue that involves someone who he 
believes has been given an unfair NT code, he should 
write to me. I will ensure that his letter is dealt with.
<P>
The hon. Member of Bognor Regis and Littlehampton 
also said that there would have to be a withholding tax 
because employers would not be able to cope with the 
administrative burden. I am aware that he knows this 
subject well. The use and operation of PAYE, which is 
what the measure requires, is not a horrendous burden 
which will lead to administrative costs or create complex 
problems for employers.



<P>
The hon. Member for Sevenoaks (Mr. Fallon) said that, 
as a result of the withdrawal of FED from 17 March, one 
company would have to compensate 40 employees at a 
cost of £500,000. That underlines well the erroneous 
notion that low-paid workers are suddenly to be faced 
with a huge tax burden. Great pains were taken to ensure 
that all those who made inquiries and representations to 
me or to the Revenue understood the residency laws, and 
whether they would be liable for tax.
<P>
The two categories that have attracted the Committee's 
attention are teachers and aid workers. My hon. Friend the 
Member for Kirkcaldy raised some points about teachers. 
Currently, 315 teachers are on placements abroad, mainly 
in the United States, Canada, New Zealand and Australia. 
The cost of living in those countries is by no means 
significantly higher than in the UK.
<P>
I understand my hon. Friend's point about grants. In 
Scotland and in Northern Ireland a small grant is still paid. 
The organisations concerned abandoned grants because 
they wanted to take advantage of FED, but they 
recognised that the policy would have to be reviewed if 
FED were to come to an end.
<P>
Teachers are not liable to pay tax in the countries to 
which they go to work, excluding the US. Some countries 
require the payment of tax on residency of more than 183 days in a calendar year, or in some cases in a 
12-month period. While abroad teachers' travel costs are 
paid; those with children continue to receive child benefit; 
their pensions continue to be paid, both into the 
occupational and the state schemes; and their contributory 
rights under the national insurance system are protected. 
However, such teachers have said that, unlike those who 
work in this country, they should not pay tax, despite the 
fact that they benefit from services paid for by taxpayers 
who are not liable to tax in another country. That is not 
fair.
<P>
I understand the point that my hon. Friend the Member 
for Kirkcaldy made about teachers who are reaching the 
end of their placements. However, teachers who were 
resident for an academic year would not qualify for FED. 
In practice, teachers' contracts enable them to qualify for 
FED by granting them an extended period during which 
they can travel the country in question. Other taxpayers 
are expected to pay for that.
<P>
It is impossible to provide teachers or aid workers 
alone with a tax exemption that is proof against 
exploitation by others. Having considered my hon. 
Friend's representations, I am not persuaded to make an 
exception of teachers' liability to pay tax on earnings paid 
by the UK, given that they retain all benefits while 
working outside the UK.



<P>
A number of hon. Members asked detailed questions 
about the position of charity workers. Considerable 
confusion exists in the charities sector and among some 
members of the Committee today about whether workers 
employed by overseas charities would be non-resident and 
therefore not liable to pay tax and not affected by any 
change to FED. Indeed, various hon. Members referred to 
two-year contracts, which would clearly qualify on the 
basis of non-residency. A continuous period spent outside 
this country by aid workers in the field they may not 
necessarily be working in the same country or for the 
same charity will be treated by the Revenue as one 
employment. Such workers may be working for different 
employers, in different countries and responding to 
different disasters, examples of which were given by hon. 
Members. Those workers would not have been using FED 
anyway: they would be non-resident.
<P>
A meeting between the Charities Tax Reform Group, a 
number of other charities and the Inland Revenue, which 
took place after the publication of the clause, addressed 
this very question. The charities themselves could not 
clearly identify how many people they thought might be 
affected by FED. When we asked the charities how long 
such workers had been in the field, what kind of contracts 
they had and where they had been, in became clear that the Revenue's advice would be that when such staff are 
continually out of the country they are non-resident and 
therefore not liable for tax. On that basis, it was agreed 
with the Charities Tax Reform Group that the Revenue 
would provide written explanation and guidance for 
charities to establish the basis on which their overseas 
workers were employed and whether they were resident 
or non-resident.
<P>
I should like to give an example of the scale of the 
problem of charities not having all the relevant 
information and needing to have discussions with the 
Revenue on the matter. Oxfam, for instance, thought that 
10 of its workers might be affected by the withdrawal of 
FED, depending on how long they were abroad and the 
nature of their contracts. The hon. Member for Bognor 
Regis and Littlehampton referred to Save the Children and 
the number of its workers who work abroad. It is 
absolutely clear from discussions with Save the 
Children this indicates the importance of developing 
clear guidance for charities that many of its workers 
qualify for non-resident status.
<P>
The hon. Member for Guildford made a point about 
students in their gap year. My son is in his gap year, and 
has been on such a placement. Such students tend to take 
part on a voluntary basis, and are not paid. They do so 
on the basis that their accommodation is provided. Many 
charities require qualified people VSO no longer takes 
students in their gap year as it wants volunteers with 
qualifications. We must therefore establish the basis on 
which people are in the field, which is not the 
Armageddon that Opposition Members claim. The 
Government are addressing an unfair relief, to make it fair 
to the general taxpayer. I am sensitive to the issues raised 
by the hon. Gentleman.

<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I do not think that the Financial

am involved in an organisation called Project Trust, which

such students will be able to afford to spend only one year
