<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062280000636"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs (Vera
Baird):</b> I had dealt with amendment No. 129 and moved on to
amendment No. 130, but I shall interpolate a comment on the
matter of the twin-track clash between clauses 70 and 78 that the hon.
Member for Hornchurch (James Brokenshire) asked me to address. If a
company is not required to change its name under one provision, that
will not affect the possibility of its being required to do so under
another. The clauses cover separate
situations.</div><a name="06062280000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Opposition&#146;s amendment No. 130 is on a difficult matter. It
probes why we have included a paragraph covering not names that were on
the register but those that should have been. Clause 752 states that
the registrar&#146;s index of company names must include names of
various bodies other than companies, including limited partnerships,
European economic interest groupings registered in the UK and
industrial and provident societies. The rules relating to the names of
such bodies are not exactly the same as those for companies, but they
still appear on the registrar&#146;s index. Whereas companies&#146;
names appear on the index immediately upon being taken, that is not the
case for the other bodies. That is becoming less of a problem thanks to
electronic communication, but the fact remains that a name may have
been adopted but not yet arrived on the index because of the different
procedures. It helps the public if the registered names of a wide range
of business organisations are unique, and if there are two very similar
ones on the index it makes searching for information difficult. If a
company takes a name very similar to one that should be on the register
but is not yet, it is in the public interest that a change of name be
required.</div> <a name="06062280000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">Such a
situation arises rarely, but it is important that the facility to
direct changes of name remains available, which is why the clause keeps
the power in the Companies Act 1985. I agree that it is a pity that we
still need that power, but removing it would make the situation worse
because there could be two bodies called Whatever Ltd. I hope it deals
with the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point to say that there is a mismatch
between the procedures for companies and those for non-companies that
have to be on the register, creating the possibility of a name that
should have been there being taken by someone
else.</div><a name="06062280000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
131 relates to whether directions given under clause 69 should be in
writing. We agree that it is better for all directions to be made in
writing and I ask the hon. Gentleman not to press the amendment on the
understanding that we will look again at the matter. Parliamentary
counsel might advise that a wrapping-up clause be included at the end
of the Bill to say that all directions must be in writing, or that the
instruction should be added to clause 69. We accept the spirit and
substance of the
amendment.</div><a name="06062280000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
amendment No. 132, we intend that it will be possible under clause 70
to object to a name that incorporates another. Subsection (1)(b) covers
the problem that the hon. Gentleman pinpointed in the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column137" />Column number: 138</div>amendment. It is true that subsection (1)(a) states that it is intended
to cover a name that
is</div><a name="06062280000557"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the same as a name
associated with the
applicant&#148;</div><a name="06062280000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">but subsection
(1)(b) makes it clear that any name is included that is
&#147;sufficiently similar&#148; that its use would be likely to
mislead. We feel that the matter is adequately covered without the
amendment, which does make a good point that needs emphasising. It need
not be exactly the same words but just to have a very close
similarity.</div><a name="06062280000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are
introducing the procedure in clauses 70 to 74 to address the problem of
opportunistic registration, referred to by Opposition Members, by which
I mean the sharp practice of registering a company in a name that the
opportunist realises is about to be used by someone else.</div>
<a name="06062280000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand that when Glaxo
and Wellcome plcs held merger negotiations someone registered a company
in the name of Glaxo Wellcome Ltd and then sought to bargain with those
plcs for the release of the name. Clearly, that was an abuse of the
registration process. It would have been equally so had the
registration been because the opportunist believed that a company big
outside the UK was about to establish itself here.</div>
<a name="06062280000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having explained the purpose of
the clauses, I shall deal with amendments Nos. 133 and 134, which
attempt to limit the application of the clauses to a name that had
goodwill in the UK only. As I said, it would be equally opportunistic
and an abuse of the procedure if someone registered the same name as
one big outside the UK because he believed that it was about to
establish itself here, under provisions in the clauses. If the owner of
the big name were able to show that the main purpose behind that choice
of name was to get money from him, or to prevent him from registering,
the adjudicator may uphold his objection and require the other company
to change its name. That is a pragmatic solution to a real
problem.</div> <a name="06062280000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have been
asked to make it plain that we are indebted to Mr. Mendelsohn, a
lawyer, who suggested that solution to the company law review. It was a
bright idea
indeed.</div><a name="06062280000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">Restricting
the grounds for an objection to goodwill in the UK, as amendments Nos.
133 and 134 would do, would reduce the usefulness of the clause for no
purpose. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not press those
amendments.</div><a name="06062280000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">I turn to
the time limit provision in amendmentNo. 135. If we set a time
limit of one year, the canny opportunist would simply not approach the
person whose goodwill he intends to exploit until the 366th day, the
367th day in a leap year. I understand that the hon. Gentleman is
concerned that the absence of a time limit might expose an innocent
company to an application under the clause. However, subsection (4)
provides the appropriate protection. If a company is operating under a
particular name, or has incurred substantial start-up costs, the
objection to the name, in order to be upheld, would have to show that
that name was chosen only to obtain money from the objector. That
protection is better than a time limit, which is fallible, so we invite
him to think that companies will be adequately protected against that
danger, and not to press the amendment.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column138" />Column number: 139</div><a name="06062280000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">I turn to amendments. Nos. 252
and 253, proposed by the hon. Member for Grantham and
Stamford(Mr. Davies), and supported in the Committee by his
hon. Friends. The Bill is not intended to address wrongs to which there
are remedies under other legislation. The amendments argue that there
might be a problem with unscrupulous persons causing public harm by
trading as a company registered in a name that misleadingly suggests a
connection to someone more reputable. We are not sure that there is a
gap or, if there was, that the amendment would be the right way to
address it. However, we think that there is something for us to look at
here.</div> <a name="06062280000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">We respectfully
invite the hon. Member for Hornchurch, on behalf of his colleague, not
to press amendments Nos. 252 and 253, which I think arrived on the
scene fairly recently anyway&#151;about a week ago&#151;and to give
us an opportunity to seek to plunge whether there is an issue, and how
to tackle it if there is. Obviously, we would appreciate any help that
Opposition Members can give us in that
process.</div><a name="06062280000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 136, 138 and 139 introduce an interim procedure to protect plcs
quoted in the amendment&#151;I think&#151;from the threat of such
opportunism if they circulate their new name to their membership. The
kind of plcs that would benefit from the amendments ought to
incorporate a company in the relevant name before they send the
circular out&#151;they could just buy a Jordan&#146;s company for
&#163;20&#151;and thereby get away from the danger that they put
themselves in by tackling it from the opposite point of view. If,
however, that is not done, we do not see the need for the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s interim procedure, which gives a final outcome,
because the whole of this section is intended to deal with the very
problem that his procedure would address. He is offering an
alternative, and we think that ours is better. The framework that we
have set up provides the extra assurance that, in order to prevent
their names from being poached companies simply need to
incorporate.</div> <a name="06062280000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
amendment No. 137, it might help if I explain the context in which
goodwill is used in clause 73. The hon. Gentleman wanted a definition,
and asked whether having a trademark would be sufficient to constitute
goodwill. I omitted over luncheon to find out the answer to that. I
shall either get one now or write to him. As it is used in clause 73,
goodwill is about what happens when an application to an adjudicator is
successful. He might order the company to change its name, but there
will be restrictions on what it can change it to, because it will not
be allowed to change to something that is just as bad, from the point
of view of the objector, as the name that has just been disallowed. The
restrictions are made by reference to, as clause 70 puts it,
the</div><a name="06062280000558"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;name associated with
the applicant in which he has
goodwill&#148;.</div><a name="06062280000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">The circle is
complete. It is evident from the legislation&#151;I cannot find an
alternative meaning&#151;that what is intended is that somebody who
is ordered to change a name because it is too close to the name
associated with the applicant in which he claims goodwill cannot change
it to something else that is associated with the applicant in which he
claims goodwill. There is no need for any further clarity. I can 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column139" />Column number: 140</div>now tell the hon. Gentleman that it is intended that a trademark should
be sufficient to trigger goodwill. I am glad that I remembered
that.</div> <a name="06062280000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
60 concerns the substantial start-up costs mentioned in clause
70(4)(b)(ii). It aims to define what substantial means in terms of
start-up costs, and seeks to link them to the assets and annual revenue
of a company. That is unlikely to be relevant to many start-ups. What
will happen, as is evident from the legislation, will be that the
adjudicator will consider whether the company in question has paid out
substantial start-up costs. It would be silly if substantial meant
&#163;10,000 or any fixed definition. It is far better for the
adjudicator to be free to look at the specific company and to say
whether he considers that the start-up costs have been substantial in
that context. The position is clear, and the Bill is long enough
without adding anything extra to it.</div>
<a name="06062280000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">The procedure is intended to
address opportunistic registration. It is not intended to be an
alternative to any existing remedy under the law on trade marks and
passing off in relation to names that people might want because of a
merger or because they are converting their business to a liability
partnership. Amendment No. 264 would create an easy means of preventing
a company from trading under a particular name in the context of
passing off, and that is not what this measure is about. I have given
clear undertakings on amendments Nos. 131, 252 and 253, and I hope that
the hon. Gentleman is satisfied with my explanations and will not press
his
amendments.</div>

Brokenshire</b> (Hornchurch) (Con): I am grateful to the
Minister for that full response, and I note what she said in relation
to clause 67 and amendment No. 129, and the fact that it is intended to
stop companies getting on the register in the first place. In some
ways, I was focusing on the word &#147;registered&#148;, which was
deemed to mean both incorporation and change of name when we debated it
earlier. I wanted to give the contextual position of it meaning both
circumstances. A little reflection on that might avoid any

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"></b><b class="B"><a name="06062280000638"></a>Vera
Baird:</b> I am sorry that I had not realised that part of the
thrust of the amendment is the same point that we debated on Tuesday.
The same answer applies as applied then; this is about becoming
registered. It is not about continuing to be
registered.</div><a name="06062280000092"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062280000639"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for that
intervention, but in our debate on Tuesday we suggested that the point
covers both circumstances. The thrust of my amendment is based on the
fact that this is not just a pre-incorporation situation. It perhaps
underlines the thrust of my original amendment, which suggested that
the word &#147;registered&#148; might need to be looked at
carefully in terms of the context in which it
arises.</div><a name="06062280000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">The same point
that I made on amendment No. 129 arises in part on clause 68: we did
not discuss the Secretary of State&#146;s power to direct a company
to change its name if it has been registered in a name that is the same
or similar. There is some crossover between 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column140" />Column number: 141</div>that and clause 70 and the twin-track approach. The Minister says that
there should not be a problem but I think it needs a further cold towel
to ensure that the interrelationship between the clause 68 regime and
the clause 70 regime works effectively and that there is no
misuse.</div><a name="06062280000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will not
press amendments Nos. 129 and 130. I hear what the Minister says about
the fact that non-companies could appear on the index and I am grateful
for her explanation. I still feel that that should be speeded up and
that any gap or potential issue is reduced as much as possible because
clearly it is not in the interest of a company seeking to register if,
having done its search of the index of names, discovered nothing, it
then finds out that there was a problem. That would be
unacceptable.</div><a name="06062280000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
grateful for the Minister&#146;s comments on amendment No. 131. I
agree that it is a matter for the parliamentary draftsmen to look at
the most effective way of dealing with the &#147;in writing&#148;
point. If later in the Bill it could be stated that directions from the
Secretary of State in all circumstances shall be in writing, it would
save us having to put &#147;in writing&#148; in each context in
which it arises. I respect the way that the Minister addressed that
amendment.</div><a name="06062280000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">I note what
the Minister said about linkage with the UK. All I would ask is that
the issue be kept under close scrutiny. I would not like to think that
this power was misused or used in a way that was not currently
anticipated and that a creditor from outside the United Kingdom could
seek to use its powers to intimidate and put pressure on the smaller
company in this country and use the sort of inequality of arms argument
to which I alluded. Again, I am grateful for her response. We will need
to keep the matter under close observation. I also note the
Minister&#146;s comments on amendments Nos. 252 and 253, which were
prompted by concerns raised by the CBI. I am grateful for her assurance
that this matter will be looked at in further detail and therefore I
look forward to receiving further information and details in that
regard.</div><a name="06062280000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">The one area
on which I am not satisfied relates to amendments Nos. 136, 138 and 139
and the proposal for an interim order. I hear what the Minister says
about a company&#146;s ability to protect its position by
incorporating a limited liability company and undertaking the name swap
that I mentioned.</div>
<a name="06062280000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">This tranche of clauses is
intended to protect against opportunistic registration in circumstances
where the respondent&#146;s main purpose in registering the name is
to obtain money from the applicant or prevent him from registering the
name. I find it extraordinary that having been presented with a serious
problem that unfortunately occurs fairly frequently, the Government are
not minded to consider the issues that I alluded to in my opening
comments. Why should they not also address the problem of opportunistic
registration instead of saying, &#147;Sorry, you&#146;ve just got
to register a limited liability company and that&#146;s
it.&#148;?</div><a name="06062280000099"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06062280000640"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Jonathan Djanogly</b> (Huntingdon) (Con): My hon. Friend makes
a persuasive argument. The Minister spoke about the ability to set up
another company and name swap, which is used daily throughout the
country. Thousands of companies, if 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column141" />Column number: 142</div>not tens of thousands, exist simply because of a name swap. That
distorts the picture of how many companies we have and for what purpose
they exist, but it is also a huge waste of resource, and indeed civil
service resource, to wind such things up when they are not
needed.</div><a name="06062280000100"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062280000641"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his
intervention. The drafting of the amendments is quite narrow and meant
to cover a specific problem. Therefore, it is surprising that the
suggestion is, &#147;You&#146;ve just got to do what you should
have been doing in the first place.&#148; It is recognised that that
is what companies could do to protect themselves, but if a company is
being opportunistic and using this as a mechanism to extort
money&#151;it does happen&#151;it is unfortunate that the
Government will not take that serious issue on board. I am therefore
minded to press the relevant amendment to a
Division.</div><a name="06062280000101"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062280000642"></a>Vera
Baird:</b> I did mention the potential that the hon. Member
for Huntingdon talked about. It is used, and it is not very resource
intensive&#151;it costs about &#163;20&#151;but he has a point
about winding up such affairs at some
stage.</div><a name="06062280000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also said
that if that has not been done and there is a challenge, whether before
or after a circular has been published, that is what the proceeding in
the statute is all about. Nothing would be added by the amendments. To
call this an interim procedure is not realistic, because if the
adjudicator is satisfied that opportunism exists, he
&#147;shall&#148; make an
order</div><a name="06062280000559"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;requiring the
respondent to change its
name&#148;.</div><a name="06062280000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is a final law,
just like the one in the statute. Why is the amendment
better?</div><a name="06062280000104"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062280000643"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for clarifying
her thoughts. The concept that this is an interim measure would have
ensured that it was shown to enable a formal challenge under the more
general clause 70 regime, so that a plc in those circumstances could
seek redress with the speed anticipated by the clause. A more
wide-ranging debate on goodwill could happen thereafter. In terms of
the balance of risk and harm, the interim order would work by
addressing the larger evil in such
circumstances.</div><a name="06062280000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">I fear
the Government&#146;s good intentions to deal with opportunistic
registration arrangements. I do not question or doubt the intent behind
the proposals, but I fear that they will not resolve the issue.
Unfortunately, deals involving brown envelopes will have to continue
because of embarrassment and the speed that I alluded to in relation to
the 21-day period. When we come to later debates on resolutions, we
might consider a shorter notice period for general meetings.</div>
<a name="06062280000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not think that the
Government&#146;s structure, even with the best of intentions, will
deal with the matter. It is a pity that opportunist registrations to
extort cash out of companies will not be addressed if the amendments
are rejected.</div>
<a name="06062280000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
137 relates to goodwill. I am grateful to the Minister for her comments
on trademarks and clarification, which are much appreciated. I hear
what she says about start-ups and the costs that have to be analysed,
and I will not press the amendment to a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column142" />Column number: 143</div>Division. However, amendments Nos. 136, 138 and 139 raise a significant
issue, and I will divide the Committee on amendment No. 136, as it is
the most important.</div><a name="06062280000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">I

source? What functions will be assigned to the chief adjudicator? To
whom will the chief adjudicator and the company names adjudicators be

the serious problem of the lack of detail about the practical
arrangements for the new adjudicator service, such as what type of

allow us to get a feel of whether we are talking about a huge

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062280000667"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I have two quick little points to make. The
clause uses the word &#147;may&#148; in relation to the rules for
adjudicators set down by the Secretary of State, and it would be better
to give some definitive context by saying that they
&#147;shall&#148; make provision for the relevant items in clause
72(2), as amendmentNo. 61 would do.</div>
<a name="06062280000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 62 raises a
slightly different issue about the publication of the decisions of
adjudicators. If we are to avoid problems arising, it is obviously as
well to ensure that decisions are publicised so that people can
understand them and avoid the need to get into such circumstances in
the future, and to share best practice for all professional advisers.
It would therefore be helpful to ensure that decisions are published to
avoid the potential for future disputes. I appreciate that hardened
individuals intent on extorting money will pay no regard to that, but
it would be helpful to have transparency for the general commercial and
corporate 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column145" />Column number: 146</div>sector. This is a probing amendment to seek to promote that idea, as
such knowledge would be in the interests of all

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062280000668"></a>Vera
Baird:</b> The hon. Gentleman has successfully promoted his
amendment No. 62. It is clear that there should be a requirement for
the adjudicators&#146; decisions to be published. One could argue
that if they contain a point of law they will be reported anyway, but
we agree with the proposal. If he withdraws the amendment, we will work
out the best way of putting that together. The deadline might not be
exactly as he has proposed, as it has to work out with other deadlines.
If he is happy to withdraw the amendment, I shall undertake to consider
it, as he makes a good point.</div>
<a name="06062280000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">On including
&#147;shall&#148; instead of &#147;may&#148;, the clause
provides a power to make rules about proceedings before the
adjudication and lists various matters that might be included in those
rules. The Patent Office has advised on the issue because it has
experience of operating similarly focused tribunals. Under the clause
as drafted, a listed matter might be omitted and an unlisted matter
might be included, so long as the clause says &#147;may&#148;.
Alternatively, a matter could be left to be determined by the chief
adjudicator. The point of putting &#147;may&#148; instead of
&#147;shall&#148; is to give maximum flexibility, which is
important because this is a new procedure and we want to make it as
cost-effective as possible for users. Obviously, we will consult on the
rules.</div> <a name="06062280000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the hon.
Gentleman is content with that, I hope he will consider not pressing
either amendment, given that he argued successfully on amendment No.
62.</div>

about amendment No. 62. That would be extremely helpful. I do not
intend to press amendment No. 61 to a vote. It is obviously a technical

clause 74, page 32, line 11, leave out subsection
(3).</div><a name="06062280000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause deals
with appeals from a company&#146;s named adjudicator to the court.
Subsection (3) deals with suspending the adjudicator&#146;s order on
appeal. The problem is highlighted by the CBI, which
says:</div><a name="06062280000560"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;There
should not be an automatic suspension of the adjudicator&#146;s order
on appeal...Otherwise this sub-clause is an encouragement to
appeal and to continue trading under an offending name, damaging the
applicant&#146;s goodwill even further.
</div><a name="06062280000561"></a><div class="hs_brev">Rather, it should be
open to the respondent to seek a court order suspending the order, as
it should be open to an applicant to seek an order preventing the
respondent company from 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column146" />Column number: 147</div>trading under the name until the questions concerning the abuse by the
respondent have been
settled.&#148;</div><a name="06062280000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
note that the matter was highlighted in another place. Lord McKenzie of
Luton was not persuaded by a similar argument. He suggested that the
concerns were unfounded, on the basis that registering a name does not
confer a right to trade. If a company were forced to change its name
immediately, someone else might take the name.</div>
<a name="06062280000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is worth considering some of
his specific comments in Grand Committee. Lord McKenzie
said:</div><a name="06062280000562"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;If a
company had to change its name immediately, its name might then be
taken by anyone else. In particular, it is likely that the applicant
would wish to register the name, if only as a precautionary measure.
This means that the company would have lost the name even if the court
were to reverse the adjudicator&#146;s
decision.&#148;</div><a name="06062280000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">He also
said:</div><a name="06062280000563"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the fact that the
company has registered a particular name does not confer a right to
trade under it.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of Lords,</i>

GC121-22.]</div><a name="06062280000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hear what the noble
Lord said, but on the point about immediate change, there is surely a
risk that that would happen in all circumstances covered by clause 70.
If an order were made, a company would clearly want to protect its
position immediately. How would that mechanism work? I was not
persuaded by his comment.</div>
<a name="06062280000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are not talking about
trading names but corporate names. There is a fundamental distinction.
For that reason, I tabled the amendment suggested by the CBI. I look

can see.</div> <a name="06062280000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment is misconceived. Its effect would be that even if a

for it to have the disputed original name as somebody else might have
taken it. That is not a fanciful idea because it would be the sensible
thing for the other party to do in the meantime. That would be wholly

recognise that we are covering ground that may have been covered before
in another place, if something is of concern it is the duty of the
Opposition to continue to highlight it in Committee. I note what the
Minister said, but it is our duty to ensure that problems are properly
highlighted. Although they have been discussed in another place, it is
still important that we have an opportunity to debate them after
reflecting on the changes that were made to the Bill there and in the
context of debates on Second Reading in this House. While I note that
the Minister is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column147" />Column number: 148</div>not prepared to give ground, it is important that we retain that
opportunity and that I do not feel fettered in raising issues that have

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062280000677"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I will not speak to amendment No. 141,
because of the assurance given by the Minister. However, amendment No.
140 is on a slightly different subject. Clause 76 provides a mechanism
whereby if a misleading indication is given as to the nature of the
activities of a company and it
is</div><a name="06062280000564"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;likely to cause harm
to the public, the Secretary of State may direct the company to change
its name.&#148;</div><a name="06062280000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
is intended to clarify the use of the words &#147;the public&#148;.
When looking through the Bill, I asked myself what would happen if only
a section of the public were harmed&#151;for example, the elderly or
another vulnerable group.</div>
<a name="06062280000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">In other companies legislation
a distinction can be drawn between the public and a section of it.
While the language in the clause repeats that in section 32(1) of the
1985 Act, the Bill gives us the opportunity to ensure that we
adequately and properly address the problem. We are considering
activities likely to cause harm, and even if harm is caused to only a
section of the public, it is still harm. I appreciate that there is a
balance to be drawn and that the amendment may not be as precise and
elegant as it would need to be, but the point is still valid and worth
further examination to ensure that we are clear as to when an order
should be given. We must ensure that a person subject to such an order
is not given the right to make a legal challenge by saying,
&#147;Well actually, we are not affecting the public. We are only
affecting a section of the public.&#148; That would clearly not be in
the public interest, so it is worth
examining.</div><a name="06062280000597"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.45

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062280000678"></a>Vera
Baird:</b> The hon. Gentleman does himself a
disservice&#151;this is an elegant amendment, except that we do not
think it necessary. I understand the underlying concern, which he set
out plainly, but the
criterion</div><a name="06062280000565"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;likely to
cause harm to the public&#148;</div>
<a name="06062280000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">does not require the whole population to
be in danger. &#147;Public&#148; means anyone not related to the
company.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column148" />Column number: 149</div><a name="06062280000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">The problem with the amendment
is that it suggests that a risk must be either to all those or to a
group&#151;a section of the public&#151;who share a characteristic,
such as the elderly or the vulnerable, for example, as he said, that
distinguishes them from the rest of the public. As the provision is
drafted, all that would be required to trigger the power in the clause
is the risk of harm to a substantial number of people, whether or not
they could be described as a section of the public, according to the
hon. Gentleman&#146;s
definition.</div><a name="06062280000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope
that the hon. Gentleman is reassured and is able to withdraw the
amendment. He is entirely right about amendment No. 141 and we will
consider it, as we offered to do in relation to an earlier
amendment.</div><a name="06062280000179"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062280000679"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I thank the Minister for her comments. My
amendment is intended not to limit scope, but to add clarity and afford
protection to, for example, a vulnerable group being misled by how a
company describes itself, and to allow the Secretary of State to act in
such circumstances.</div><a name="06062280000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hear what the Minister says about significant numbers of people.
Perhaps that underlies my concern about the meaning of a
&#147;significant&#148; number of people. It might mean a
significant number of people covering all sorts of groups from the
young to the very old. It might also mean a particular section of the
public being targeted by a misleading term. I want to be clear about
whether that is covered by the
clause.</div><a name="06062280000181"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062280000680"></a>Vera
Baird:</b> It is pretty clear that a &#147;section of the
public&#148; will not cease to be part of the public because it has a
particular characteristic. I think that that is the reassurance the
hon. Gentleman
seeks.</div><a name="06062280000182"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062280000681"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I thank the Minister for her intervention.
The amendment has been tabled because &#147;the public&#148; and
&#147;section of the public&#148; are legislative concepts; it
would cover both angles and ensure sufficient protection. It is not
fanciful, and this is a contextual use that has cropped up in other
legislation. I call to mind the securities legislation in which an
offer to &#147;the public&#148; can be made. However, a further
distinction is drawn about what &#147;the public&#148; means. In
that context, it means 50 people, potentially. I seek clarity. I see
that the Minister might have some further
information.</div><a name="06062280000183"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062280000682"></a>Vera
Baird:</b> I hope that I can help because I agree that that is
an important point. Yes, there can be a difference. In some contexts,
&#147;section of the public&#148; is the right terminology, but the
Bill is clear that the public are harmed if anybody unconnected with
the company is
harmed.</div><a name="06062280000184"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062280000686"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> We come to the change of name and the
mechanism by which a company is able to do
that.</div><a name="06062280000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">In essence,
clause 79 provides a new means by which a company can change its name,
rather than by the customary means of a special resolution passed by
the members of the company. I acknowledge that we considered a further
example during our earlier discussions of a slight change in relation
to the ability of directors to change a name where the Secretary of
State has given a direction. That is a fairly narrowly defined
arrangement, which is reflected in the 1985 Act.</div>
<a name="06062280000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill appears to establish
an entirely new mechanism that allows for a company to change its name
in other ways, however. I am concerned that if the mechanism is
allowed, the shareholders&#151;who would normally be notified by
virtue of the fact that their consent would be required through a
special resolution&#151;might be cut out of the process if, for
example, a right existed in a company&#146;s articles of association
for the directors to change the name of the company by board
resolution. Although that would give the company flexibility, it is
important that shareholders should know the name of the company of
which they are shareholders. Such a right, buried deep in a thick pile
of articles, might not be picked up on by members of the company, but I
would want to ensure that their rights were protected.</div>
<a name="06062280000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is in that context that I
seek the deletion of clause 79 and subsection (1)(b), because of the
clarification needed and the lack of real feel about what the position
of members is or precisely what situations the Government are
contemplating. A very different step change is proposed and, although I
recognise the need for flexibility and deregulation, it is also
important that the interests of shareholders should be maintained and
that they should be properly informed of any changes that might occur
to the company of which they are members. That is the underlying reason
for my amendment, which would delete subsection (1)(b), and my proposal
that clause 79 should not stand part of the
Bill.</div><a name="06062280000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
143 touches on a slightly different point. It proposes that
companies&#146; names can be changed by order of the court, under
clause 74, given that the court is given the power to make any order
that the adjudicator might have made on appeal, which could include
requiring a company to change itsname. Amendment No. 143
contemplates that circumstance&#151;it does not block it
off&#151;and would ensure that the issue was properly
addressed.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column150" />Column number: 151</div><a name="06062280000195"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062280000687"></a>Vera
Baird:</b> May I deal with amendment No. 143 first? We agree
that it would be better if the relevant clause contained a complete
statement of the various ways in which a company&#146;s registered
name can be changed. I therefore agree to consider
amendmentNo. 143, which is helpful, and we are grateful for
it.</div><a name="06062280000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 142
would limit how a company could change its name, but the point of the
provisions is to be deregulatory. The amendment would inhibit that
purpose by removing part of subsection (1)(a) and all subsection
(1)(b). Under subsection (1)(a) as drafted, a company will be able to
decide for itself how to change its name. The current
position&#151;under which a special resolution is required, except in
the circumstances that the hon. Gentleman mentioned, but which the Bill
addresses&#151;is unnecessarily regulatory. There is no statutory
control on how a company changes the name under which it trades, so why
do we need controls on how it changes its registered
name?</div><a name="06062280000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">What is
important is that the registered name enables the public to find
whatever information there is about the company on the public record,
and that they are not misled. Other provisions ensure those desired
outcomes, so there is no public need for restrictions on how the
company changes its name. I confess that I struggle to understand the
injustice that would be done to members who would not know that the
name had been changed. I am not sure how realistic that is.</div>
<a name="06062280000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">The deregulatory purpose of the
Bill is best served by the clause as drafted. I am sure the hon.
Gentleman agrees that all unnecessary regulation should be removed, so
I hope he will withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="06062280000199"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062280000688"></a>James

conditional&#151;for example, when a company seeks to be listed on
the stock exchange&#151;a company might wish to change its name
conditional on its shares being admitted to trading. Therefore, the
resolution will not become active, or bite, until that condition is
satisfied. In those circumstances, confusion might be caused with the
Registrar of Companies as to whether the resolution is valid, hence the
probable rationale for including the provision in the
Bill.</div><a name="06062280000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, when
there is an unconditional resolution&#151;for example, a simple
proposal for a special resolution that the name of the company be
changed to X Ltd.&#151;I see no need for a formal notice as well as
filing a copy of that resolution, which is the reason for tabling
amendment No.
144.</div><a name="06062280000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
145, which is consequential, would ensure that in the circumstances of
a conditional resolution, a copy of the resolution was filed, with an
appropriate
notice.</div><a name="06062280000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendments
try to be as deregulatory as possible by not requiring an additional
imposition on companies changing their names where that is not
necessary, while recognising that the Registrar of Companies might be
in difficulties in certain circumstances. Therefore, I understand where
the original thought processes came
from.</div><a name="06062280000598"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062280000692"></a>Vera
Baird:</b> We can only applaud the deregulatory purpose of
amendment No. 144, but the Bill&#146;s provision that the name change
need not be by special resolution has a far greater deregulatory
effect. The scheme of the Bill is to provide a simple system for
notifying the change of name, whether or not it is done by special
resolution. This will mean that changes of name will take effect more
quickly than at
present.</div><a name="06062280000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under the
current arrangements, Companies House needs to check every special
resolution to see whether it includes a name change. That causes delays
in processing that might lead to the mischiefs that we discussed this
morning. Last year, 143,286 special and written resolutions were filed,
of which 56,954 involved a change of name. Requiring this document to
be sent in is a useful flag for Companies House showing that the name
is being changed.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column152" />Column number: 153</div><a name="06062280000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 144 would retain
the existing arrangements for name changes by special resolution, which
causes delays in processing because invariably special resolutions
contain far more than just the change of name. It is Companies
House&#146;s experience that having to dig through a morass of other
provisions in the resolution inevitably causes delay.</div>
<a name="06062280000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that the hon. Gentleman
will withdraw his amendment because, on balance, we are even more
deregulatory than he is here, although I can see how at first sight it
does not look that way. AmendmentNo. 145 would put in a
requirement that a special resolution should be filed. I understand
that that is already in clause 29 and the amendment would duplicate
that
requirement.</div><a name="06062280000215"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062280000693"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I find the Minister&#146;s comments on
delay a little surprising in that, under the existing arrangement, it
is entirely possible to do a same-day change of name. I had the dubious
pleasure of having to do that on many occasions before I entered the
House, so I would be delighted if it is possible to do it even quicker
under this regime, but I find that surprising.</div>
<a name="06062280000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hear what the Minister says
and I look forward to the express, hour-long, pick-it-up-as-you-wait

that working in practice through the mechanisms of Companies House.
However, given her comments, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062280000694"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> The clause deals with the Secretary of
State&#146;s ability to make provisions by regulation to require
companies to display specified information, to state specified
information in certain documents and communications and to provide
relevant information on request to those they deal with in the course
of their business. To a certain degree, the provisions go further than
the Companies Act 1985 and the Business Names Act 1985 as far as
companies trading under their registered names are concerned. It is
also unclear whether the existing requirements will be added to as a
consequence of the regulations that are referred to in the clause. Will
the Minister therefore provide some guidance on whether additional
requirements not made under existing law and practice will be added to
as a consequence of the clause and the regulations that will be applied
to it?</div> <a name="06062280000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the
Minister also clarify the specified information that is to be provided
to persons with whom a company deals? Further to my earlier comments, I
think that there will be a slight extension of the requirements on
companies trading under their 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column153" />Column number: 154</div>corporate name rather than a trading name. Will she tell us why it was
felt necessary to change the ambit in relation to such
companies?</div>
<a name="06062280000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">To what
extent will there be further reviews of the regulations? The clause
could be applied in a way that would make the system more regulatory
and bureaucratic. Given the assurances on the deregulatory approach, I
am sure that that is not the intention, but I am concerned that without
some background or clarification on what the regulations are likely to
include&#151;we have not had sight of the regulations&#151;we
cannot look at the clause in much context. We need to know precisely
what is intended and whether any further steps or requirements are
being contemplated. Given the liability set out in clauses 83 and 84
for a failure to make the necessary disclosures, we must ensure that we
do not set difficult or inappropriate targets and requirements on
companies.</div><a name="06062280000224"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062280000695"></a>Vera
Baird:</b> The rules relating to trading disclosures are
complex. They are set out in chapter I, part XI of the 1985 Act,
section 693 of which applies similar rules to overseas companies. There
is a separate set of rules in the Business Names Act 1985 that refer to
a company trading under a name under than its registered name, even if
the only difference is the suffix Ltd or plc. The rules are not
identical: the information required and what premises and what
documents are involved all vary.</div>
<a name="06062280000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the company law review
recommended, we intend to use the powers conferred by the clause and
the similar power provided under clause 666 related to overseas
companies to replace all the existing disclosure rules with a single
set of regulations. We will consult on the matter and we intend to
rationalise the requirements and make compliance simpler for companies.
We will not extend the rules; we need the power to regulate in order to
replicate sections 348, 349 and 351 of the Companies Act 1985. When we
consult on the regulations, they will be subject to the affirmative
resolution procedure, so there will be scope for debate on
them.</div><a name="06062280000226"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062280000697"></a>James

clause 84, page 36, line 12, at end
insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(3) For the purpose
of this section a shadow director is treated as an officer of the
company.'.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column154" />Column number: 155</div><a name="06062280000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause deals with the
situation that arises if a company is acting in accordance with the
instructions of a person who is not a director&#151;that is to say a
shadow director&#151;and those instructions include the non-provision
of information under clause 82 on the requirement to disclose the
company name and so on. I wish to question why a shadow director should
not be liable in such circumstances.</div>
<a name="06062280000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">In my review of the Bill, I
noted that in other, similar circumstances a shadow director is liable.
Why are they not covered by the clause? It is possible that I have
missed something, but I wanted to flag up the point. The amendment
would therefore make clear that a shadow director should be treated as
an officer for the purposes of compliance and therefore of liability in
the event of failure to comply. If a shadow director of a company, who
is not stated as a director, effectively frustrates satisfaction of the
clause 82 provisions, it would be a little strange for that shadow
director not to be liable in accordance with the rest of the officers
of the company given that, in other circumstances, they would normally
be treated in the same
way.</div><a name="06062280000233"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062280000698"></a>Vera

elsewhere in the Bill, shadow directors are liable, but not here. That
struck me as odd, and that issue might apply in other parts of the
Bill. I am grateful therefore for her assurance because we might have
to examine that matter in other cases to ensure that there is not some
gap and that shadow directors cannot in some way squeak out of those
provisions. I do not think that that is the Government&#146;s
intention, however, and in the light of her assurances, I beg to ask

Djanogly:</b> We move on to part 6 of the Bill, and team No. 1
comes back into play. <i class="I">[Interruption.] </i>No, I did not mean it like
that. Before we kick off, may I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member
for Hornchurch on his professional delivery, backed up by his extensive
experience in the subject before us? That 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column155" />Column number: 156</div>really showed, and totally hid the fact that it was his first outing on
the Front Bench&#151;the first of many, I am quite
sure.</div><a name="06062280000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">We move on to
part 6 and clause 86 stand part. I would like to make a general point
on the registered offices. It is important for a company to have a
registered office, not least because it is a single registered
location, of which other companies and persons have public notice. That
is vital for deliveries, particularly of time-critical documents such
as service of court documents, which require proof of
service.</div><a name="06062280000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">Most company
documents are filed after an event, as a record of something that has
happened, such as a change of director. However, that is not the case
with a change of registered office, for which the filing of the notice
itself triggers the timing of the date of the change. So it is an
important form. The problem is that we hear more and more reports about
people impersonating company directors&#151;I brought that matter up
last Tuesday. That involves little more than signing a form and sending
it to Companies House, but once the fake directors have been
established, they can send in a change of registered office form. That
effectively means that the real directors stop getting notices of
contracts signed in the name of the company by the fake directors using
the fake registered
office.</div><a name="06062280000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">That seems to
be a growing problem. Will the Minister let us know whether she has any
details about the extent of the problem, whether she has plans for
further security measures to stop it happening or whether she thinks
that it might require further
amendments?</div><a name="06062280000599"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.15

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062280000701"></a>The
Minister for Industry and the Regions (Margaret Hodge):</b> I
thank the hon. Gentleman for his contribution. I congratulate also my
hon. and learned Friend on her valiant performance. This is her first
Committee, and may there be many
more.</div><a name="06062280000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman mentions something that has not been raised with me before.
Companies House has a system by which it can register and receive
notice by e-mail of a change of directors. I am not sure whether that
helps. If he has ideas&#151;perhaps from those with whom he has had
contact&#151;on how we can tighten the system to prevent such
problems from arising, we will consider them. However, it has not been
an issue recently and I have no plans to introduce further measures. I
accept that it is a problem, but I am not sure what we can do other
than introducing the clauses and other legislation relating to fraud
and other such matters.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062280000702"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> There is no doubt that the problem is growing.
Some schemes have been put in place. I believe that there is a system
whereby companies can register to receive notifications of when changes
are made. The notification pops up and advises them that, for example,
the registered office has been changed. If it were not the proper
directors who made the change, the company would see that. The system
is not widely used. Perhaps the Department could consider advertising
the process more widely. Other measures are also
required.</div>

Hodge:</b> I have just received a note that may help the hon.
Gentleman. It deals with another element. Under what is called

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062280000704"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 31, in clause 90,
page 38, line 11, leave out &#145;a special' and insert &#145;an
ordinary'.</div><a name="06062280000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
relates to sections 43(1) and 43(2) of the 1985 Act. I am not sure how
long it has been since a special resolution has been needed to
re-register a private company as a public company. The Minister may be
able to advise me on that. It is one of those things that is lost in
the mists of time. It is worth asking, on a probing basis, whether
anyone has considered whether it should remain the case that such
re-registration is required. I can see why minority shareholders may
need protection if a public company is re-registered as a private
company&#151;in other words, the other way around&#151;after a
takeover or the like, but that is not the case. I wonder why an
ordinary resolution should not, in the situation we are concerned with,
be good enough.</div>
<a name="06062280000252"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062280000705"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> As the hon. Gentleman rightly said, the amendment
relates to a process by which a private company can change its status
and become a public company. There is, of course, a substantial
difference between the two company types. I understand that many
companies will want to make that change at a certain point in their
lives.</div> <a name="06062280000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have no
interest in making that change unnecessarily difficult, but&#151;I
hope that this explanation satisfies the hon. Gentleman&#151;it is
important to bear in mind the position of existing shareholders in
private companies. In some cases they will have become members of the
company, whether at formation or at a later stage, with some
expectation that it might sooner or later go public, but in other cases
there may be no such expectation. A company going public has
implications for existing members. The most obvious one is that it
brings the prospect of dilution of their control, as the membership
base becomes larger and more diverse. Existing shareholders need to be
able to take a view on the matter through the special resolution
provisions. The 1985 Act therefore provides that there must be a
special resolution, which requires a 75 per cent. majority rather than
the simple majority required by an ordinary resolution.</div>
<a name="06062280000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">When it comes to significant
decisions about the company&#146;s status and future which would have
important implications for the position of individual shareholders, it
is right&#151;I have reflected on this&#151;that the bar should be
set high and that something more 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column157" />Column number: 158</div>than an ordinary resolution should be required. That is why we have
chosen to continue the existing requirement. I should add that I am not
aware of any suggestion that that will cause difficulties in
practice.</div><a name="06062280000255"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062280000706"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I have to agree with the Minister: I have not
had a huge number of representations on the matter. However, I query
what she said. The substantive point is that members might be concerned
about dilution. That is dealt with separately in section 89 of the 1985
Act which is applied more toughly for public companies than for private
companies. In fact, almost every aspect of the 1985 Act will be applied
more favourably for minority shareholders of a public company than for
those of a private company, with fewer exemptions to override
shareholders&#146; interests. Indeed, after the Bill is passed, only
public companies will have a company secretary. We shall debate that
later, but let us assume that the Bill goes through in its current
form.</div><a name="06062280000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">I repeat that
from the point of view of the minority shareholder, it can only be to
their advantage for the company to become public. I understand that the
protection of a special resolution is needed the other way around, but
not for going up, as it were. I wanted the Minister to think about it,
and on that basis I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062280000709"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> These probing amendments are designed to test
the relevance and adequacy of the clause, which is clearly a
pressure-valve clause. The situation envisaged would typically be
related to a bid for a public company. The acquirer will normally wish
to acquire at least 75 per cent. of the shares of the target, because
at that level of ownership a resolution can be passed to make the
target a private company. That in turn is important, because only
private companies can use their own assets to give bank security for
the purchase of their own shares. In other words, the purchaser uses
the assets of the target to finance the transaction.</div>
<a name="06062280000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause&#151;I appreciate
that the provision is in the 1985 Act&#151;provides holders of at
least 5 per cent. of the company with the right to apply to the court
to have the resolution to re-register capital. Does the Minister think
that the clause is still necessary? Can she provide us with details of
how often it has been invoked and whether any assessment has been made
of its effectiveness? Is 5 per cent. still considered the right number
of shareholders who need to complain? I have 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column158" />Column number: 159</div>suggested 10 per cent. on a probing basis, but maybe the figure could be
less than 5 per cent. We would be interested to hear her
views.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062280000710"></a>David
Howarth:</b> I want to add a short point in support of what
the hon. Gentleman said. Setting the number at 5 per cent. as opposed
to 10 per cent. gives rise to a temptation that it might be useful for
the law to discourage. If the limit is set at only 5 per cent., people
faced with a blocking minority of 5 per cent. might be tempted to use
section 429 of the 1985 Act, which, as I understand it, will not be
changed. There is a judicial interpretation of that section. It allows,
on takeover, those with a 90 per cent. hold of the shares compulsorily
to purchase the remaining 10 per cent. It can be used to clear
minorities of less than 10 per cent.
</div><a name="06062280000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">Case law from re
Bugle Press suggests that that provision cannot be used beyond its
original purpose. However, even given that case law, people faced with
a blocking minority of less than 10 per cent. might be tempted to use
section 429, take their chances with the case law and produce
litigation that it would be helpful for the law to avoid. That
litigation could be avoided by raising the relevant percentage to 10
per cent., as in section 429.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062280000711"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> I have been asked three questions and a
supplementary question, although as I listened to the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s exposition I saw that section 429 might be
consecutive rather than parallel to the issues that we are discussing.
I am not sure that its existence prejudges the need for this provision.
However, I shall answer the question to see whether I can satisfy
him.</div> <a name="06062280000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">When a company
is resolved to re-register from public to private, clause 98 enables
the dissenting shareholders to apply to the court to cancel the
resolution for re-registration. The application must be made within 28
days of the date on which the resolution is passed and the court will
only entertain such an application when it is made by a qualifying
number of shareholders and, when the company is not limited by shares,
a qualifying number of members or, in either case, not fewer than 50
members.</div> <a name="06062280000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">The minimum
thresholds for making such an application are set in subsections
(1)(a), (b) and (c). When the company that proposes to re-register as
private limited company has share capital, the application will be made
by a single shareholder or by shareholders with a collective holding of
at least 5 per cent. of the nominal value of the company&#146;s
issued share capital. The amendment would increase that threshold, and
I appreciate that it is a probing amendment. Both amendments leave
unchanged the 50 member option and the proposition in clause 98(1) that
the members who voted in favour of the resolution for re-registration
or consented to it do not
count.</div>
<a name="06062280000600"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.30
pm</div><a name="06062280000269"></a><div class="hs_Para">The reason
behind the clause is that, as I am sure all Members accept, the
re-registration of a company from public to private limited is a
serious matter which has implications for all the shareholders, members
and creditors of a company alike. In view of the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column159" />Column number: 160</div>significance of the change of status which will bring with it a lack of
transferability for the individual&#146;s share and the reduced
marketability that is characteristic of shares in private companies,
members should have the opportunity to object, subject, of course, to
establishing that they represent a significant interest in the company.
We accept that there is nothing magical about the thresholds that we
made: all we have done, as hon. Members understand, is mirror those in
the 1985 Act.</div>
<a name="06062280000270"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062280000712"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Can the Minister give us any idea how often the
provision has been
used?</div><a name="06062280000271"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062280000713"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> Yes, I can. The thresholds have stood the test of
time. We are not aware that they have caused companies, their
shareholders and members any difficulties. In fact, we are advised by
the registrar that only three such applications have been made in the
previous year, two of which were rejected. In the circumstances, we are
not persuaded that the amendments are either needed or helpful. The
hon. Member for Cambridge (David Howarth) asked whether clause 98 was
still necessary. The answer is yes, it is. As the hon. Gentleman said,
there are special provisions on takeovers in section 429 of the
Companies Act but the clause goes wider. Someone may have a majority
shareholding by other means and the clause provides them with
protection.</div><a name="06062280000272"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062280000714"></a>David
Howarth:</b> The point I was trying to make is that the
question is not whether the clause is necessary&#151;I think it
is&#151;but how it fits in with the existing law in section 429 of
the Companies Act. If one sets up the two statutory provisions in
different ways, the temptation will be to use one rather than the
other. If they are set up with the same number, one can preserve the
use of
each.</div><a name="06062280000273"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062280000715"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> I suppose that in the interests of protecting
minority shareholders, the correct way forward if we want that
consistency would be an amendment to section 429. I can take that away
and think about it if the hon. Gentleman so wishes. Otherwise the
provisions appear to work well. I am told they work in parallel. The
one follows from the other, rather than the two having to be consistent
overall. There is a lower threshold in section 429 because it covers a
takeover so it is a slightly different situation from the one we are
discussing. I am happy to reflect further on that and if necessary come
back on Report if the hon. Gentleman considers that
appropriate.</div> <a name="06062280000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope
that I have answered the questions that the hon. Member for Huntingdon
(Mr. Djanogly) raised and that he will withdraw his probing
amendment.</div><a name="06062280000275"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062280000716"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> As the Minister said, this was a probing
amendment. The contribution from the hon. Member for Cambridge opened
up the debate and was a helpful addition. I must admit that I wandered
into the question by looking at the Bill rather than precedent. The
existence of the case he mentioned means that we should go away and
have another look at the issue. I am not entirely convinced that the
answer 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column160" />Column number: 161</div>will be to amend section 429, particularly in relation to putting in any
kind of percentage, but it might be worth looking again at the 5 per
cent. threshold in the clause.</div>
<a name="06062280000276"></a><div class="hs_Para">I thought that the provision
would be used very little in practice, so I was not surprised to hear
that it was used three times in the last year, nor was I surprised to
hear that the majority of cases have been thrown out. I suppose that it
would typically be people having a go. I am pleased that we have had
the debate. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="06062280000277"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062280000719"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> This is a rerun of the debate in the House of
Lords. I shall not read out what Lord Hodgson said, but shall instead
quote what Lord McKenzie said and comment on it. Lord McKenzie
said:</div><a name="06062280000567"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The Bill
reflects existing companies legislation in preventing this practice,
and the Company Law Review considered carefully whether the bar should
be maintained or removed. It concluded that it should be retained to
prevent companies taking short-term advantage of a merely temporary
change of status. The Company Law Review does not seem to have believed
that this has placed any obstacle in the way of legitimate market
developments; nor are the Government aware of any evidence to that
effect. I therefore support the CLR&#146;s conclusion that the bar
should remain.</div><a name="06062280000568"></a><div class="hs_brev">I
should add that we are currently considering whether the condition in

which has re-registered as unlimited reverting to limited
status.&#148;</div><a name="06062280000285"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
people are with me so far. Lord McKenzie
continued:</div><a name="06062280000570"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;These
highly technical issues are complicated by the need to consider
possible multiple re-registrations under earlier legislation. We are
considering whether any change is needed.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official

<div class="Column"><a name="Column161" />Column number: 162</div><a name="06062280000286"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is appropriate for me to ask
whether the Minister can provide an update on the Government&#146;s
thinking on the
issue.</div><a name="06062280000287"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062280000720"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> The hon. Gentleman said that he would quote only
Lord McKenzie. I shall quote the Opposition spokesperson in the House
of Lords, Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts, who replied, &#147;I
surrender absolutely&#148;.</div>
<a name="06062280000288"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062280000721"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> That may have related to the complicated nature
of the answer as much as to its
justification.</div><a name="06062280000289"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062280000722"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> The hon. Gentleman is right to suggest that in
Grand Committee Lord Hodgson tabled a similar amendment. It was
withdrawn, but it prompted us to look again at the conditions in
subsection (2), and we put a marker down in Grand Committee that we
intended to return to the issue. We subsequently amended the subsection
on Report in the House of Lords to remove what amounted to a
superfluous condition. If people can understand this one, they will be
doing very well. The condition was that a private limited company could
not re-register as unlimited if it had previously re-registered from
unlimited to limited. Such a condition is unnecessary, as it is not
possible for that eventuality to occur, given that clause 105(2), which
is concerned with the re-registration of a company from unlimited
private to limited, prevents a company that has previously
re-registered as unlimited from reverting to limited status. However,
we left in place the condition in the amended clause 102(2) which
prevents a private limited company from re-registering as unlimited if
the company has previously re-registered as limited. The amendments
that we are debating would remove that
subsection.</div><a name="06062280000290"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection
(2), as amended, carries forward the provisions of section 49(3) of the
1985 Act. Like its predecessor, it prevents companies from changing
their status successively between limited and unlimited and back again.
As the hon. Gentleman said, the issue was examined by the company law
review, and it was concluded that it was necessary to keep the bar in
place. The company law review did not accept that in practice the bar
prevented legitimate market developments, nor are the Government aware
of any evidence to that effect. That is why we support the
review&#146;s conclusion that the bar should remain in
place.</div><a name="06062280000291"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062280000723"></a>Mr.

49(8)(b) of the 1985 Act. Could the Minister please provide the
reasoning behind
that?</div><a name="06062280000296"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062280000725"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> The clause prescribes the
contents of the application for re-registration and the documents that
must accompany it. It replaces sections 49(4) to 49(8)(a) of the 1985
Act. The current requirement for a statutory declaration made by the
directors on application for re-registration as an unlimited company is
replaced by a requirement for a statement of compliance. Unlike most
other statements of compliance made under the Bill, the one made on
application for re-registration as an unlimited company must contain a
statement by the directors confirming that the persons by whom or on
whose behalf the form of assent is authenticated constitute the whole
membership of the company, and if any of the members have not
authenticated the form themselves, that the directors have taken all
reasonable steps to satisfy themselves that each person who
authenticated it on behalf of a member was lawfully empowered to do so.
The contents of the directors&#146; statement carry forward the
provisions of section 49(8) of the 1985 Act, which requires
a</div><a name="06062280000571"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;prescribed form of

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062280000729"></a>David
Howarth:</b> The subject of the clause sounds similar to the
issues just discussed, but in fact it is fundamentally different.
Clause 105 is about the re-registration of unlimited companies as
limited. The 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column163" />Column number: 164</div>clause changes the existing law, but only in respect of public
companies. The point that I wish to raise is more
fundamental.</div><a name="06062280000305"></a><div class="hs_Para">Unlimited
companies are not very common, but they do occur in the financial
services sector. The point of an unlimited company is that its
creditors have recourse to the private wealth of the shareholders in
the event that the company cannot meet its debts, so unlimited status
is a way of attracting customers to a business in certain
circumstances, because, in effect, the shareholders are underwriting
that business. Given equivalent circumstances it makes the company a
more attractive body to deal with than a limited company in the same
circumstances.</div><a name="06062280000306"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
105 allows unlimited companies to re-register as limited companies,
thereby reducing the liability of the shareholders&#151;perhaps
dramatically&#151;without any consent from the creditors. The
fundamental issue is the balance of interests between creditors and
shareholders, and that balance is very different in an unlimited
company compared with a limited company. The amendment is therefore
intended to test the proposition that creditors&#146; interests must
be taken into account when a company moves from unlimited to limited
status.</div><a name="06062280000307"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not want
to give the impression that there is a lot of malpractice or fraud in
this area at the moment, but there is a risk. It might be argued that
the provision has been in place for a long time without any particular
problems. However, in Tuesday&#146;s sitting I mentioned the case of
Equitable Life, which was an unlimited company. The circumstances of
that case were different in that Equitable Life did not have
shareholders in the same way, so the issues did not arise in precisely
the same manner as I am suggesting today. Nevertheless, that example
shows that there are large undertakings that are unlimited companies.
There is a serious potential problem, and it would be just as well for
us to consider it and try to provide for it before it turns into a
real-life case.</div>
<a name="06062280000308"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062280000730"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I have some sympathy with the Liberal Democrat
amendments. People often deal with an unlimited company on the basis
that there is no limit to the members&#146; liability. If they
entered into the same transaction with a company that was limited, they
would want to see other elements in the transaction, such as security,
or a deposit, or a charge. If the company with which they have
transacted subsequently becomes limited it would be fair to take their
interests into
consideration.</div><a name="06062280000309"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062280000731"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> I understand the point that is being raised by the
hon. Gentlemen, in that with an unlimited company liability is not
defined&#151;although I do not entirely accept that that would give
the sort of comfort to which the hon. Member for Huntingdon
referred&#151;whereas limited companies, by definition, have a limit
on their liability. I can understand, therefore, why the hon. Member
for Cambridge believes that there might be a role for creditors when an
unlimited company re-registers as an limited company. The amendment
would ensure that they are consulted and given a role. However, I am
informed that such issues are tackled in other ways, which we believe
to be sufficient. I hope that that argument will be accepted.</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column164" />Column number: 165</div><a name="06062280000310"></a><div class="hs_Para">At the moment, the law provides
that when a company is wound up within three years of having been
re-registered as a limited company, having previously been unlimited,
the liability of its original members
remains.</div>

Farrelly</b> (Newcastle-under-Lyme) (Lab): We have seen such
situations, although more often in the US than here. Will my right hon.
Friend the Minister confirm that the amendments would allow a creditor
to blackmail a company and resist its move to limited status, even if
that was in the wider interests of the company and perhaps those of
other
creditors?</div><a name="06062280000312"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062280000733"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> I entirely accept that that would also create
difficulties and I am grateful to my hon. Friend for raising that valid
point, which had not been brought to my attention.</div>
<a name="06062280000313"></a><div class="hs_Para">Whether or not the company
changes status, liability remains on the original member of the
unlimited company, which remains unlimited in respect of any debts and
liabilities contracted up to the point of re-registration. That
provision is contained not in this complex bit of legislation, but in
section 77 of the Insolvency Act 1986. We have no plans to change it,
as it provides proper protection for creditors without the sort of
danger exposed by my hon. Friend. Arguably, it is also simpler. I hope
that, with that explanation, the hon. Member for Cambridge will
withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="06062280000314"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06062280000734"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Quentin Davies</b> (Grantham and Stamford) (Con): I seek
clarification. I have been following the debate with much interest and
the Minister has made an interesting point. Is she saying that the
details of the insolvency law to which she referred provide that if an
unlimited company changes its status to limited, the existing
shareholders retain their unlimited liability for all that
company&#146;s debts for three years?</div>
<a name="06062280000315"></a><div class="hs_Para">The implication is that at the
end of those three years, unlimited liability would fall away. Let us
suppose that a company, when unlimited, had undertaken a loan agreement
that matured after more than three years&#151;say, after five or ten
years&#151;and had done so on the basis that it could look to the
private capital of shareholders, beyond the paid-up capital of the
company. The creditor would find that that assumption had been
invalidated retrospectively. If he had been well advised, he would be
covered by some kind of covenant and loan agreement. I accept that, and
we anticipate that response. However, in making the law, we try to
defend those who are not necessarily sophisticated or well
advised.</div><a name="06062280000316"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062280000735"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> I accept the issues and complexities raised by the
hon. Gentleman. However, if a company changed from having unlimited
liability to limited liability, I would have thought that most of its
creditors would take appropriate advice to ensure that they secured
their interests over time, as the hon. Gentleman suggested. I accept
that the eventuality that he describes may arise, but that three-year
limitation runs through most of the
law.</div><a name="06062280000317"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062280000736"></a>Mr.
Davies:</b> With respect, the Minister has not satisfied my
concern at all. She has simply confirmed 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column165" />Column number: 166</div>that in my example the regime would have been changed retrospectively to
the&#151;perhaps significant&#151;disfavour of the company
creditor, who would be able to do nothing about it.</div>
<a name="06062280000318"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the creditor had been
sufficiently sophisticated and well advised in advance, he might well
have insisted on an appropriate covenant in the loan agreement.
However, if he had not, it would be too late for the creditor to
protect himself once the unlimited company had declared its intention
to go limited. The danger to which I have alluded is real and the law
should be designed to protect those who are not necessarily
sophisticated or properly and completely
advised.</div><a name="06062280000319"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062280000737"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> I do not know whether this is helpful to the hon.
Gentleman, but if the loan was unlikely to be repaid, the company,
having become limited, would presumably become
insolvent.</div>
<a name="06062280000320"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062280000738"></a>Mr.
Davies</b> <i class="I">indicated
dissent.</i></div>
<a name="06062280000321"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062280000739"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> The hon. Gentleman is shaking his head, but as I
understand it, the three-year limitation runs through most legislation
and would have an impact. I accept that, in the situation that he
describes, he has a point, but I am not sure that, in framing the law,
we can do anything that would better protect the interests of the
individual beyond that limitation. I am not sure that the creditor
having the right of veto on the change of status would be the best way
forward. Presumably that is what the hon. Gentleman would suggest if he
supports the hon. Member for Cambridge&#146;s
amendment.</div>
<a name="06062280000322"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062280000740"></a>Mr.
Davies:</b> There is another way forward that the Minister
should consider. That is to stipulate that liabilities that are in
existence and have been contracted on the assumption that shareholders
are liable on an unlimited basis would remain indefinitely, or at least
until the term of those liabilities as established in the relevant loan
agreements or other contractual terms. That would mean that it would
not be possible for someone who had made a loan or supply of credit in
good faith to an unlimited liability company would subsequently find
that the regime had been turned against them retrospectively and the
quality of the asset in their hands had been degraded because the
company decided to change its status from unlimited to limited. That
would mean for existing liabilities that the regime that applied at the
time that they were contracted would remain until the term of that
liability. All new liabilities would be contracted with the company
under its new status. That is another way forward.</div>
<a name="06062280000323"></a><div class="hs_Para">It often happens in Committee
that we come across problems that some of us had not anticipated. That
is a good thing. I have not had a chance to prepare an amendment on
this issue but, in light of the discussions taking place between the
hon. Member for Cambridge and the Minister, I think it is a point worth
pursuing. I have not just come forward with a problem; I have proposed
a possible solution.</div>
<a name="06062280000324"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062280000741"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> I appreciate the hon. Gentleman&#146;s comments.
This has been an interesting exchange. I am 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column166" />Column number: 167</div>happy to consider the idea further if that is helpful, but let me try to
reassure him. I am advised that if a creditor finds that the loan that
he made has not been repaid, that creditor could seek the winding up of
the limited company. In so doing, he would have priority over the
remaining assets to get repayment of the loan. In those circumstances,
there is a mechanism open to him.</div>
<a name="06062280000325"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the hon. Gentleman is not
happy with that explanation, I will write to him and we can have an
exchange of correspondence on the issue and return on Report if
necessary. I will copy Front Bench spokespeople into that
correspondence. It strikes me that there are other provisions that
would deal with the situation. Perhaps I am not explaining very
well.</div>
<a name="06062280000326"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062280000742"></a>Mr.
Davies:</b> I can see no provision in the text before us
providing for a creditor to seek the winding up of a company simply
because that company is proposing to change its status from unlimited
to limited. Nor should there be such a provision because it would open
up exactly the possibility of blackmail that has been raised. We do not
want that. We want merely to ensure that when a creditor and a debtor
contract with each other&#151;when two firms come together under a
certain regime and, in good faith, draw up a contract that leads to an
asset on one side and a liability on the other&#151;the quality of
that asset and liability should not be retrospectively changed in a way
that cannot be predicted by the parties to the initial contract. That
is why I suggest that the existing liabilities should continue to be
unlimited.</div>
<a name="06062280000327"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062280000743"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> I think that the hon. Gentleman misunderstands. I
was not suggesting that the point of transfer of the company from an
unlimited status to a limited status would be the point at which the
creditor would attempt to exercise their rights under a contract that
they had entered into. I was suggesting&#151;to go back to where we
were&#151;that all creditors of companies that change from being
unlimited to limited are protected for three years under the
InsolvencyAct 1986. The issue that the hon. Gentleman raised
was what would happen if the loan that the creditor gave to the
originally unlimited company only required repayment in five years. I
was trying to say that, in those circumstances, the company would have
been established as a limited company and a creditor with a claim
against it could seek the winding up of the then limited company, if
that company refused to meet the
loan.</div><a name="06062280000602"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3
pm</div><a name="06062280000328"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062280000744"></a>Mr.
Davies:</b> With respect, the Minister has not followed me.
Let me give a precise example. On day one, a creditor&#151;for
instance, a bank or supplier&#151; contracts with a company to lend
money or to deliver goods on credit. One year later, the company
decides to change its status, and three years after that, that change
of status is confirmed for all purposes, so that no liability can
return to the shareholders on an unlimited basis.</div>
<a name="06062280000329"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us suppose that the term of
the original liability is five years. In other words, the loan is not
callable 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column167" />Column number: 168</div>until one year after the end of the three-year grace period, which the
Minister has just explained. In those circumstances, at the end of the
three years, the creditor can do nothing. It cannot put the company
into insolvency because the loan has not matured. Nor can it demand the
prepayment of the loan. However, the credit status of the loan has been
degraded by virtue of the fact that the shareholders are no longer
liable for the loan on an unlimited basis.</div>
<a name="06062280000330"></a><div class="hs_Para">A year later, the loan duly
matures. The question then arises as to whether the company becomes
insolvent, but at that point the shareholders are no longer liable for
the loan on an unlimited basis. That is an enormous change and might
mean that what would have been a good asset in the hands of the
creditor has now become a bad asset, and what would have become a
liability to be fulfilled on an unlimited basis will not be fulfilled
on a limited basis a year after the end of the three-year grace
period.</div><a name="06062280000331"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062280000745"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> I understood that; clearly we are not reaching each
other in our exchange. I have been passed a note that might be more
helpful. I have not read it myself. It says that creditors will not
have to wait for five years, if the company is
insolvent.</div><a name="06062280000332"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062280000746"></a>Mr.
Davies:</b> It is not
insolvent.</div><a name="06062280000333"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062280000747"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> If a loan is due two years after a company changes
its status to a limited company, the status of that loan will
change.</div><a name="06062280000334"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062280000748"></a>Mr.

that?</div><a name="06062280000335"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062280000749"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> It does not matter&#151;the point is that it is
after three years. At that point, although the status has of course
changed from unlimited to limited, there is still a loan against that
company. If the creditor does not receive the moneys due to him at that
point, he can seek to have the company wound up. I accept that that is
not the same comfort as with an unlimited company, but it is not like
the creditor has no comfort at
all.</div><a name="06062280000336"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062280000750"></a>Paul
Farrelly:</b> I would like to raise a different point that
demonstrates why my right hon. Friend is absolutely right to resist the
Liberal Democrat amendments. Any good lawyer&#151;the hon. Member for
Cambridge is an excellent lawyer&#151;would wish to see at the end of
such an amendment, &#147;such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld&#148;. That is not
there.</div><a name="06062280000337"></a><div class="hs_Para">For example, a
good reason to move from being an unincorporated to a limited liability
company is to ease the path towards flotation. One reason to float on
the stock exchange might be to pay off loans or liabilities with
creditors. It is quite conceivable that a creditor who wished to have
part of the action from a flotation, but was denied it, could veto a
company&#146;s progress and flotation. In those circumstances,
consent would have been &#147;unreasonably withheld&#148;. Those
words are not in the
amendments.</div><a name="06062280000338"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062280000751"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> I agree entirely. I shall have one last go with the
advice that I have been given.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column168" />Column number: 169</div><a name="06062280000339"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us imagine that a creditor,
described in the terms that the hon. Gentleman described, is concerned
that a limited company is unable to repay a loan. I am advised that
that creditor, within the three years in which they are covered by the
Insolvency Act 1986, could seek to have the company dissolved on the
basis that it could become insolvent by not meeting the loan repayment
terms. That might be the answer that the hon. Gentleman is looking for.
If not, we will have to settle the matter through
correspondence.</div><a name="06062280000340"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062280000752"></a>Mr.
Davies:</b> May I ask the Minister for the reference to the
insolvency provision? Also, what criteria would need to be met for such
a petition to be
granted?</div><a name="06062280000341"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062280000753"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> The provision is section 77 of the Insolvency Act
1986, and I am told that the criteria are as in any other case. I hope
that the hon. Gentleman is happy with that. He has raised a valid
point. He can write to me, and I will let hon. Members see it. We can
return to it on Report if there is something that we have
omitted.</div>
<a name="06062280000342"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062280000754"></a>Mr.
Davies:</b> I am conscious, Mr. Illsley, that you have been
gracious in allowing me to intervene on the Minister on a number of
occasions. I hope that that exchange has been useful in clarifying the
issue. So as not to trespass too much on your patience, I thought that
I would make it clear where I am coming from.</div>
<a name="06062280000343"></a><div class="hs_Para">The exchange with the Minister
has persuaded me not only that there is a problem but that it is
probably more important than I first envisaged, and it is not
adequately dealt with by the insolvency rules that she described. I
think that the Committee would agree that it is important to provide a
mechanism for companies to change their status from private to public
without undue burdens or hindrance. An instance has already been
mentioned of a company that wants to float. That is a sensible move,
but we simply want to provide the maximum flexibility. We want not to
inhibit but to encourage and nurture the growth of companies. That is
the object of the
Bill.</div><a name="06062280000344"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill should
not provide anybody&#151;we have been conscious on many occasions of
a difficulty in this context&#151;with opportunities for greenmail or
blackmail or to exert pressure to prevent people from doing what they
seek to do in good faith and in their own rational business interests.
It should not provide them with some toehold in the law that enables
them subsequently to claim money from people engaged in ordinary
business in good faith. We do not want the measures to form a basis for
greenmail or blackmail, and we do not want to give creditors the
opportunity vexatiously, perversely or exploitatively to prevent
companies from changing their status. That is common
ground.</div><a name="06062280000345"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is where
the Minister and I disagree. We do not want to solve the problem by
creating a worse one. Above all, we do not want to create a situation
in which companies are needlessly put into or threatened with
insolvency. This is my central response to her: I do not believe that
the insolvency rules are the right answer to my question. Nor do I
think that a three-year carry-over&#151;I shall use that word rather
than the term &#147;grace period&#148;&#151;of unlimited
liability is adequate for 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column169" />Column number: 170</div>the simple reason that three years is entirely arbitrary. Some of a
company&#146;s liabilities will be for longer than three
years.</div> <a name="06062280000346"></a><div class="hs_Para">Equally, it
does not make any sense to protect new creditors&#151;that is,
creditors who contract with a company after the company has changed its
status to limited liability&#151;which would not normally be
available to the creditors of a company with limited liability. Three
years does not make any sense for either group of creditors: those who
are contracted with the company concerned before the change of status
or those who contract with the company after the change of status or
during the first three years.</div>
<a name="06062280000347"></a><div class="hs_Para">It seems to me that the simple
answer is to say that a company cannot change retrospectively its
relationship with a creditor by changing its status as a company,
changing the basis on which its suppliers, lenders or other creditors
will deal with it in future. That answer would be fair, transparent and
in accordance with a common-or-garden understanding of how things work.
It should not be possible for shareholders, simply by changing the
status of the company, to protect themselves against any liability that
they find onerous or threatening to their private wealth outside the
paid-in capital of the company in which they have
invested.</div><a name="06062280000348"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall give
some simple examples. There might well be a company with a net worth
of, let us say, &#163;1 million and liabilities of &#163;4 million.
That is quite a high leverage but creditors and suppliers may well be
happy with it because they know that the shareholders are people of
substance. They probably do not know their exact net worth but they
know that it is many tens of millions of pounds. They therefore feel
totally relaxed dealing with a company on that basis and they might
enter long-term contractual lending arrangements with the
company.</div> <a name="06062280000349"></a><div class="hs_Para">Then
suddenly one day the company announces that it will change its status.
Immediately the credit quality of all the assets in the hands of the
creditors deteriorates markedly. The creditors may then have worries
about their claims on the company once it has changed its status. There
would then only be a net worth of &#163;1 million of assets securing
their claims of &#163;4 million. Some deterioration in the
company&#146;s position could then make their claims worthless or
discountable. In those circumstances, under the Minister&#146;s
proposed arrangements, the creditors would have some protection for
three years. After that they would not, and they would be completely
done for.</div><a name="06062280000350"></a><div class="hs_Para">It may well
be that people outside the Committee following our debates will ensure
that they are thoroughly protected against such a possibility in
whatever contractual or lending arrangement they enter and ensure that
there is a contractual possibility of winding up a company in the event
of its changing its status. That is an enormously heavy-handed type of
protection to have to propose. We want protection that is fair and
deals only with the liabilities incurred by a company before its change
of status. It should also be unlimited in time, because any arbitrary
limit would not cover longer-term contractual or lending
arrangements.</div><a name="06062280000351"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have
set out the problem at slightly greater length than I intended. I hope
that, rather than expect me to send her a copy of <i class="I">Hansard</i>, the
Minister will take my 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column170" />Column number: 171</div>oral communication as an invitation to re-examine the matter and to see
whether she can return with a better
solution.</div><a name="06062280000352"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062280000755"></a>David
Howarth:</b> Having listened to the debate, I believe that it
comes down to how one sees the original deal between and unlimited
company and the person who enters a contract with it. There is a
sophisticated view of such a contract that the person lending the money
does so on the basis of the specific provisions of company law and
those in the 1986 Act. The answer to complaints would therefore be,
&#147;Well, you contracted on the basis of the existing statute
law.&#148; The powerful objection to that view is that it is too
sophisticated a way to consider the contract for an ordinary person
making a deal with a company to be forced to follow and that in reality
nobody makes contracts on such a basis. Under such a view, we would
require anyone dealing with unlimited companies to take sophisticated
legal advice to allow them do so
safely.</div><a name="06062280000353"></a><div class="hs_Para">The other
equally absolutist view of such contracts is the one expressed in the
amendment&#151;that they are agreed between the lender and the
company on the basis that the company is unlimited. A change in the
company&#146;s status, from unlimited to limited, is, in a sense, a
breach of that agreement, changing the basis on which the agreement is
reached by the
creditor.</div>
<a name="06062280000603"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.15
pm</div><a name="06062280000354"></a><div class="hs_Para">That absolutist
view gives rise to the drafting of the amendment, which I concede would
put a veto power into the hands of the creditor. If one wanted to
defend that approach, one could say that the contract was like any
other contract, and that a person who enters into a contract with
somebody else has a veto in the sense that the other side is not
allowed to change their promise unless that person says so and gives
them permission.</div><a name="06062280000355"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
accept that the view expressed by most hon. Members today has been a
third view of the contract, which is that the parties agree on the
basis that the company is an unlimited company, but that each side also
allows the other reasonable leeway to change their status or basis of
the deal, given ordinary commercial developments, including the desire
of a company to go public, for
example.</div><a name="06062280000356"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given that
that seems to be the most widespread view in the Committee, it seems
that the best thing for me to do is ask leave to withdraw the amendment
in its present form, but reserve the right to return on Report with an
amendment that does not follow the other absolutist view of the
contract, which appears to be the Government&#146;s
view.</div><a name="06062280000357"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062280000756"></a>Mr.
Davies:</b> On a point of order, Mr. Illsley. I believe that
we have made some progress this afternoon in clarifying the issue. In
the light of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s comments and his reference to
a third way and to coming back on Report, my inclination is also to
come back on Report with a third way enshrined in the form of a proper
amendment. Would it be normal practice for such an amendment to be at
least deemed acceptable&#151;I cannot ask you to undertake to ensure
that it is accepted&#151;and therefore potentially debatable 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column171" />Column number: 172</div>on Report, even though it would cover a point that we had debated
extensively in Committee? Such an amendment could advance a solution
that we have not been able to debate concretely, because we have not
had the opportunity to table an appropriate amendment or new clause in
Committee.</div><a name="06062280000358"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062280000757"></a>The
Chairman:</b> It would be for the Speaker to determine whether
that was acceptable. The question is hypothetical, so it is difficult
to make a decision, but I take on board the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
point, and we will provide him with some advice privately before the
end of the Committee stage to clarify the issue. I hope that that deals
with his point of
order.</div><a name="06062280000359"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062280000758"></a>David

Government new clause 5&#151;<i class="I">Statement of capital required where

capital.</i></div><a name="06062280000365"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062280000760"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> An issue arises here that we said we would return
to following Report in the Lords, when we amended the Bill to remove
the requirement for a statement of capital to be provided where an
unlimited company that has not previously had a share capital
re-registers as a company limited by shares. The requirement for a
statement of capital was considered unnecessary in those circumstances,
as the company will be required to make a return of allotments to the
registrar under clause 545 when it makes an allotment of shares after
its registration. That return must be accompanied by a statement of
capital. In short, we removed the potential duplication of an
information
requirement.</div><a name="06062280000366"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
indicated then that we might need to return to the question of whether
there were any circumstances in which an unlimited company should be
required to provide a statement of capital on its re-registration as a
limited company. The amendment is the outcome of our deliberations on
that point.</div><a name="06062280000367"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new
clause requires unlimited companies that already have a share capital
at the date of application for re-registration as limited to deliver a
statement of capital to the registrar within 15 days of their
re-registration as a limited company unless that information has
already been provided in some other way.</div>
<a name="06062280000368"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment is required to
ensure consistency of treatment between companies that are already
limited by shares on the one hand and unlimited companies having a
share capital that re-registers companies 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column172" />Column number: 173</div>limited by shares on the other hand. Companies limited by shares are
required to file a statement of capital whenever they make an
alteration to their share capital which affects their total subscribed
capital and whenever they make a new allotment of shares. In other
words, they are effectively required to keep the publicly accessible
statement of capital up to
date.</div><a name="06062280000369"></a><div class="hs_Para">By contrast,
unlimited companies that have a share capital are not subject to the
same requirements for real-time reporting, so to speak, of their
capital base. Instead, they must provide a statement of capital once a
year with their annual return. That means that there is often a time
lag. For example, the share capital information on an unlimited company
with a share capital that provides an annual statement in January,

Bill.</div><a name="06062280000381"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062280000766"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> We have now moved to part 8 of the Bill, which
deals with members of a company. I shall make two points, on
subsections (1) and (2).</div>
<a name="06062280000382"></a><div class="hs_Para">First, in respect of subsection
(1), Lord Hodgson tabled an amendment to the clause suggested by the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column173" />Column number: 174</div>Law Society to seek to clarify whether a specific allotment of
subscriber shares was required following the company&#146;s
registration. He proposed the amendment on the basis that there was
confusion in the 1985 Act. He felt that the clause did not make it
clear whether the shares in a company are allotted to the subscribers
on the registration of the company or whether a formal allotment and
the filing of the return of allotments was necessary, and he felt that
that should be clarified.</div>
<a name="06062280000383"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment was withdrawn as
Lord Sainsbury agreed to consider the matter further. To be frank, he
may have done so&#151;I may have missed a proposal, as we have been
swamped with Government amendments on this Bill&#151;but in any
event, I would appreciate the Minister&#146;s clarification of the
point.</div><a name="06062280000384"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
subsection (2) in many ways deals with the core of the concept of
ownership. It
states:</div><a name="06062280000572"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Every
other person who agrees to become a member of a company, and whose name
is entered in its register of members, is a member of the
company.&#148;</div><a name="06062280000385"></a><div class="hs_Para">When a share is
transferred, the person who agrees to become a member needs to have the
stock transfer form duty stamped before it can be entered in the
register of members. Without that, beneficial ownership exists, but
legal ownership cannot do so. To pay stamp duty, one would take the
stock transfer form and a cheque down to Bush house, but now that
service has been abolished and there is a postal period of supposedly
up to 10 days before stamp duty can be paid and therefore entry made in
the register under clause 11 too.</div>
<a name="06062280000386"></a><div class="hs_Para">Why did I bring up this matter?
I did so because solicitors and others who have to pay stamp duty
before they can register the transfer have been complaining about it. A
solicitor wrote to me and complained that they heard that delays of
much more than five days are occurring. One lawyer told me that he had
to chase a delayed transfer and was advised that Bush house had no
mechanism for checking the progress of forms, as apparently it was
inundated with stock transfer forms and had a huge backlog. He was told
that his best option would be to call up his bank and check to see
whether his cheque had cleared. That was not appropriate.</div>
<a name="06062280000387"></a><div class="hs_Para">I wrote to the Secretary of
State on this matter, and it was duly handed over to the Treasury,
which I found inappropriate. I am not arguing from a tax point of view;
I am arguing from the point of view of subsection (2), which relates to
people wanting to transfer their shares and be entered as members of a
company. I am not talking about whether they have paid the tax or about
how they have done so. That is a mechanical issue that should be got
out of the way as soon as possible so that people can comply with the
provision.</div>
<a name="06062280000388"></a><div class="hs_Para">Nevertheless, the matter was
handed over to the Treasury, which was not the right thing to happen,
and I received a reply from the Economic
Secretary:</div><a name="06062280000573"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Following
the introduction of stamp duty land tax, there has been a significant
reduction in the number of documents that require stamping, and the
number of personal callers at the London counter has declined over
recent years.&#148;</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column174" />Column number: 175</div><a name="06062280000389"></a><div class="hs_Para">The reply went on to explain that the
office was therefore closed on 31 March, and it
continued:</div><a name="06062280000574"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Completed
stock transfer forms, along with payment of the stamp duty, are all
sent to the London Stamp Office at Bush House. HMRC has undertaken to
process documents within its published five-day turnaround time
provided that the correct payment is made at the time. Feedback so far
under the new arrangements has been good, with customers happy with the
level of service they are receiving. There have been very few
complaints from customers affected by the counter service closure about
the speed with which documents are handled and returned. You have been
told that, in some cases, longer delays are occurring. Practitioners
may have experienced turnaround times of more than five days after the
London office counter closed, due to the unusually high volume of
prepaid forms received. However, the resulting backlog of work is now
being cleared and customers should no longer experience delays above
the published turnaround time. HMRC has also put in place contingency
plans to enable it to meet its published turnaround times for stock
transfer forms should high volumes occur in
future.&#148;</div><a name="06062280000390"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
that basis, I thought that progress was being made, until on 19 June I
received another e-mail from another solicitor, which I assure the
Minister was totally unsolicited. It
stated:</div><a name="06062280000391"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
loss of the over the counter facility at Bush House is a
nightmare&#151;we sent the form on 1 June but have had no
acknowledgment other than verbally that they &#145;have a
backlog&#146; and can&#146;t even tell us they have received the
transfer yet! I can&#146;t register the transfer and finish off
the...work.&#148;</div><a name="06062280000392"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
deleted an expletive there. It
continued:</div><a name="06062280000575"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;No
doubt they have hundreds of people answering the phones to tell all the
frustrated users similar things. Is something being done about this
example of Government
incompetence?&#148;</div><a name="06062280000393"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is
the situation. While one arm of Government&#151;in this
Committee&#151;is trying to deregulate, another arm, the Treasury, is
slowing down the whole process. In practice, this arrangement is very
inconvenient to practitioners, because it requires the buyer to have
the sellers enter into a trust deed so that before registration of the
transfer, the sellers, who remain as legal owners, promise to act as
the buyer wishes in respect of the shares. That is not good practice.
It is creating more red tape for companies and I ask the Minister to
assure us that she will address the issue so that transfers and entry
in the register can be speeded
up.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062280000767"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b><b class="B"> </b>The purport of that contribution related not
to whether the Bill is correctly drafted in the way that members of the
Committee find acceptable, but to the running of the stock transfer
system by the tax office. I assure the hon. Gentleman that he is doing
the right thing in raising matters with the Economic Secretary and that
he should continue to do so. Implementation is a matter for my hon.
Friend and HMRC, not a matter for consideration under the
Bill.</div> <a name="06062280000395"></a><div class="hs_Para">The only other
point that I want to make is that the clauses were considered in
another place andclause 16(5) now makes it clear that
subscribers become the holders of shares that are taken by them on
formation. That may sort out the position of those who have a
transfer.</div> <a name="06062280000396"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman&#146;s point seemed to be one of implementation. It has not
been raised with me, but it 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column175" />Column number: 176</div>clearly has been raised with the hon. Gentleman most recently. He should
therefore take up the matter with the relevant Departments and
Ministers.</div><a name="06062280000397"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062280000768"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I am talking about the practical implementation
of the clause. In order to be registered as members of a company,
people have to pay stamp duty before they are registered. People are
paying stamp duty, but they cannot register because their payment is
not being accepted. The Minister says that I should write to the
appropriate person. I did that. I wrote to the Secretary of State for
Trade and Industry. The fact that he took it upon himself to send my
letter to the Treasury shows me that he did not understand the point
that I was making. It is not a Treasury matter. It is a problem for the
Department of Trade and Industry. The Treasury wants to do its own
thing. I am saying that the problem is for the Minister&#146;s
Department. She must get a grip on it so that the practical
implications of the clause can be realised and so that practitioners
and those who want to be registered as members can do
so.</div><a name="06062280000398"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062280000769"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> The issue before the Committee is whether the
process as we have defined it in the Bill is appropriate. Nothing in
the hon. Gentleman&#146;s contribution suggests that the process is
anything other than correct. He described problems with implementation
that have been drawn to his attention. Because in this instance
implementation is a matter for the Treasury and HMRC, it is an issue
that he must raise with appropriate Ministers. Obviously, in relation
to the Bill we wish registration to take place as quickly as
possible.</div><a name="06062280000399"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062280000770"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> If the Minister would at least offer to approach
the Treasury and move it along a little on the issue, that may be of
great help to many companies and individuals who want to transfer their
shares and register
them.</div><a name="06062280000400"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062280000771"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> The hon. Gentleman is referring to a tax issue, and
I shall draw it to the attention of my hon. Friends who have
responsibility for such
matters.</div><a name="06062280000401"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062280000772"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> There are implications for your
Department.</div><a name="06062280000402"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062280000773"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> We want registration to take place as quickly as
possible. That is clearly in everyone&#146;s interests. It seems that
what has been drawn to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s attention is a delay
in the tax process, which, as much as I might love it to be my
responsibility in some ways, as it would give me access to some of the
revenue as well as collection responsibilities, is not a matter for my
Department. I undertake to let the relevant Ministers in the Treasury
have copies of the <i class="I">Hansard </i>report of what the hon. Gentleman has
said and see what response we receive from
them.</div><a name="06062280000403"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question put

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062280000774"></a>Mr.

of doubt, need not be a home
address)'.</div><a name="06062280000406"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause relates to section 352 of the Companies Act 1985. Later I shall
speak more fully on the problems caused by access to home addresses on
the register of members. At this point, it is worth clarifying that
there is no need to use a home address on a share transfer form or in
the register of members. A service address can be used, such as that of
a person&#146;s accountant, bank or post office. Of course, having
the name appear on the register, whatever the address, can create its
own problems, particularly if the name is a rare one, which is why the
ability to deny access is important, as we shall discuss
later.</div><a name="06062280000407"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would like to
receive the Minister&#146;s confirmation of one aspect of the matter.
The July 2002 consultation document, &#147;Regulatory Impact
Assessment on Disclosure of beneficial ownership of unlisted
companies&#148; noted that the current registration system does not
reveal any information regarding the beneficial ownership of shares.
For that reason, the document noted, attempting to establish the
ownership of the company by referring to the register has its
limitations, as there is no means of discovering who beneficial
shareholders are. To solve that problem, those responsible for the RIA
were asked to consider a proposal put forward by the DTI and HM
Treasury that a person must disclose to a private company, once their
beneficial interest in shares exceeds 3 per cent.. The company would
then be obliged to enter those details on a subsection of the register
of members. Will the Minister confirm that that proposal will not now
be proceeded with?</div> <a name="06062280000408"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would also appreciate the Minister&#146;s clarification on a slightly
different topic, which was raised in the Lords. I tabled a written
question, to which I received a reply on 2 May. I asked:</div>
<a name="06062280000576"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;How many registered companies
have issued stock?&#148;</div> <a name="06062280000409"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
response that I received from the then Minister
was:</div><a name="06062280000577"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Section
121(c) of the Companies Act 1985 permits a company to convert any or
all of its paid-up shares into stock, and reconvert that stock into
paid-up shares of any denomination. There are no available figures on
the number of existing, registered companies that have used that
procedure. However, the ability to convert shares into stock is to
believed to be obsolete.&#148; &#151;[<i class="I">Official Report</i>, 2 May

Hodge:</b> On the last point, I asked the same question in
preparation for various clauses in the Bill. I was told that while it
was obsolete, we could not guarantee that there was none still around.
We have to carry on with the provisions until we are certain that it
has all disappeared from the face of the Earth. I know, it is one of
those awful things. On the first point, I assure the hon. Gentleman
that we are not proceeding with the proposal to which he
alluded.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column177" />Column number: 178</div><a name="06062280000412"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will speak generally to
amendment No. 23, which I think is similar to one that was tabled in
another place. One way in which members of a company may wish to
protect themselves against attempts to harass or defraud them is by
giving the company a service, rather than a home, address. That is
already possible. However, on Third Reading in the other place, when a
number of amendments were made to part 8, which deals with company
members, specific provision&#151;clause 793&#151;was inserted to
draw attention to the point. As hon. Members know, clause 793 provides
that</div><a name="06062280000578"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Any

are now dealing with what is currentlysection 353 of the
Companies Act 1985, which deals with the location of registers.
Subsection (1) and allows for the register to be kept at a location
other than the company&#146;s registered office in specific
circumstances. Clause 113 requires the register to be available for
inspection at a specified location, which can be the company&#146;s
office or another place in the part of the United Kingdom in which the
company is registered.</div>
<a name="06062280000421"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment is probing. It
would change the clause to provide for the register to be kept
available for inspection where the company has its principal place of
business. The point is that that could help to prevent companies from
getting up to no good. Let me explain. It might be attractive for a
company based, say, in London that wanted to avoid inspections to use a
company that was registered in Northern Ireland, for example, which
would make access to registers a much more difficult business. The
purpose of the amendment is to prevent
that.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column178" />Column number: 179</div><a name="06062280000422"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062280000780"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> The hon. Gentleman is right to say that the clause
differs from the existing provision in that it refers to where the
register is kept available for inspection, rather than simply where it
is kept. That is because where electronic registers are kept is
debatable, and they may be updated from various locations; what matters
is where they are kept available for inspection. We hope that the new
formulation will remove any difficulty that might have arisen when, for
example, a company with its registered office in Scotland employed a
commercial registrar in England.</div>
<a name="06062280000423"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, because the courts of
a country in which a public register is kept have exclusive
jurisdiction over entries in that register, it is essential that the
jurisdiction in which a company&#146;s register of members is kept
available for inspection is not subject to change, as it would be if
the amendment were agreed. I was slightly puzzled by the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s contribution in that respect. The jurisdiction over
a company&#146;s registered office is fixed on the company&#146;s
incorporation, and clearly that jurisdiction&#146;s courts should
always apply to its register of members.</div>
<a name="06062280000424"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that that reply has
alleviated the hon. Gentleman&#146;s concerns, and that he will

clause relates to section 354 of the Companies Act 1985, which deals
with the index of members. It was debated in the Lords, where Lord
Hodgson proposed an amendment that only companies with more than 100
members, as opposed to the 50 currently specified in clause 114, need
keep an index. He pointed out
that</div><a name="06062280000579"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Fifty is
not such a large number that it requires an index. Up to 100

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062280000787"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Hon. Members can probably tell from that list
that the amendments in this group are somewhat more significant than
many of the amendments that we have discussed so far. We are moving on,
of course, to shareholders&#146; and non-members&#146; rights to
inspect and require copies of the register of members.</div>
<a name="06062280000458"></a><div class="hs_Para">It of interest that when the
matter was first discussed in Grand Committee in the Lords, the
question of denying access was not raised from the point of view of
extremist activity. That is because the Opposition took the decision
that that was a political issue that should be dealt with by this
House, not least because the topic is one on which I have corresponded
with the Government for several years in the interests of my
constituents who work at Huntingdon Life Sciences. Subsequently,
however, several thousand shareholders of GlaxoSmithKline, the
pharma-group, received threatening letters from animal rights
terrorists. Suddenly, on Report in the Lords, Lord Sainsbury, on direct
orders from above and urged on by a chorus of vocal peers, promised to
go away and reconsider the Government&#146;s position before Third
Reading, when amendments were indeed produced and added to the
Bill.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column182" />Column number: 183</div><a name="06062280000459"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having demanded increased
protection for shareholders for many years now, and the Government
having rejected my amendments to the Serious Organised Crime and Police
Bill to do that, I am pleased to see that the issue is now being
addressed. I am aware, however, that reactive and on-the-hoof law can
often turn into the worst law in practice. That is why we need to spend
some time on the clauses.</div>
<a name="06062280000460"></a><div class="hs_Para">The overriding concern of my
hon. Friends is to ensure the protection of shareholders from violence
and intimidation.</div>
<a name="06062280000461"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06062280000788"></a><b class="B">Kitty
Ussher</b> (Burnley) (Lab): Does the hon. Gentleman agree that
the violence and intimidating behaviour is the offence and that we
should deal with that, rather than restrict the centuries-old
established convention that owning a share in a company means that the
information should be
public?</div><a name="06062280000462"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062280000789"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> No, I disagree. If a person accesses the
register of members for the purposes of using it for violence, that
must be controlled.</div>
<a name="06062280000463"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062280000790"></a>Paul
Farrelly:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that any measure
that is enacted in legislation such as this has to be proportionate and
should not cause wider harm, in particular to corporate governance?
Throughout the corporate sector in the UK, we have striven for greater
disclosure and greater transparency in corporate behaviour. The danger
is that his amendments will set that back
substantially.</div>
<a name="06062280000464"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062280000791"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. There
must be a balance and proportionality between access to a register and
security for those on it. We totally accept that position. He talks
about our amendments inhibiting that access, but he will hear me say
that most of the amendments have been tabled on a probing basis, so
that we can look at the different levels that currently exist in the
world and debate them. I will not maintain that we should support all
of the amendments. If he bears with me I will certainly cover in some
depth the point that he quite rightly mentions.
</div><a name="06062280000465"></a><div class="hs_Para">My purpose is much
more than protecting companies that practise animal testing, although
that is the area directly within my experience, so I shall refer to it.
The amendments are more about the type of environment that we are to
offer people conducting business in this country. Just as the
protection of the person must be a priority for the Government, so must
be protection for companies and their shareholders. Without that
protection business will, as I will show the Committee, simply pick up
and go overseas. The other preliminary point that I make, with some
irony, is that several speakers in the Lords debate on this issue and
several journalists have made out that the GlaxoSmithKline letter
incident was a new development. I shall show the Committee that that
was not the case and that attacks on shareholders have become an
established theme of anti-corporate activism.</div>
<a name="06062280000466"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the basis that this is a
general debate on shareholders, I do not intend to address the rights
and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column183" />Column number: 184</div>wrongs of the underlying issues, much though I support animal testing,
for example. My point is that although direct action, sometimes
slipping into terrorist activity, emanates from animal rights activists
today, the same methods could be used tomorrow by other groups. If
drugs manufacturers, animal testing companies and furriers are affected
now, meat importers, road builders, handbag manufacturers, furniture
makers or mining companies could be affected
tomorrow.</div><a name="06062280000467"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062280000792"></a>Kitty
Ussher:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman not agree that under the
current legislation there is no requirement for an individual to put
their home address? They could use a post office address or an address
care of a bank or some other institution. Does that not solve the
problem he
identifies?</div><a name="06062280000468"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062280000793"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> No it does not, for a variety of reasons. First,
many small shareholders do not have service addresses that they can
use. Secondly, if an individual shareholder wants to hold through a
nominee, some companies will refuse to act as nominees. That happened
with Huntingdon Life Sciences: not a single institution in the City now
will act as nominee if someone wants to own HLS shares. The hon. Lady
makes an important point, but the problem
remains.</div><a name="06062280000469"></a><div class="hs_Para"></div><a name="06062280000470"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06062280000794"></a><b class="B">Justine
Greening</b> (Putney) (Con): We have just had an interesting
exchange. The reality is that many shareholders will, for a variety of
reasons, some of which have been outlined, put their home address. The
very act of receiving a letter at home with the implicit warning,
&#147;We now know where you live,&#148; and all the stress that may
cause to family and friends visiting the house means that this is an
important area to deal
with.</div><a name="06062280000471"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062280000795"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> My hon. Friend makes a fair point, which I was
not going to make. If someone wants to use their home address why
should they be intimidated into not doing
so?</div><a name="06062280000472"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062280000796"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> The hon. Member for Putney (Justine Greening) has
taken us off in the other direction from the direction that the hon.
Member for Huntingdon was taking us. There is no need for anyone to put
their home address on to the shareholding. His point that some people
may not have a service address is not really sufficient. If they need
to create one, they can do so without necessarily having the
shareholding held through a third party. It seems to me that the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s amendments are not just about opening up home
addresses, but about hiding names in addition to the current provision,
which can ensure that we do not have
addresses.</div><a name="06062280000473"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062280000797"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> With respect to the Minister, she mentions
names. If one&#146;s name is Smith it might not matter too much. But
with a name like Djanogly or Vara accessibility is slightly easier. It
is not just addresses; names are an issue
too.</div><a name="06062280000474"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is clear now
that farmers and animal testing companies are the weathervane for such
activity, and for too long the Government and many in the City have 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column184" />Column number: 185</div>allowed such attacks to continue while hoping that the issue would just
fade away. I have carefully followed the Government&#146;s actions on
the issue and it has been clear that the priorities of varying Home
Secretaries have differed widely. I was, therefore, very pleased to
hear the Prime Minister speak strongly against the animal rights
extremists after the GSK incident. Likewise, in an important
development, I was pleased and relieved to see the recent supportive
letter from a good number of City institutions that appeared in the
press recently. As the largest shareholders, the fact that they finally
stood up jointly against the terrorists was an important development
and they are to be congratulated on taking a stand.</div>
<a name="06062280000475"></a><div class="hs_Para">The key message is that those
terrorists are fanatics to their cause every bit as much as the
fanatics behind the challenges we face elsewhere. The problem will not
simply go away. Unless we counter it head on, it will fester, grow and
become much more of a problem in a wider range of sectors. We have no
choice but to act.</div> <a name="06062280000476"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
recognise that the number of arrests of such terrorists has increased
recently, but we must be aware that many of them wear their conviction
record as a badge of pride within their own ranks. Furthermore, their
tactics are often surreptitious in so far as they are fairly expert at
getting the maximum publicity for their stunts and crimes using a very
small number of activists. That is one of the things that is so
frightening about this topic. No one has given me an accurate
assessment of the number of extremist protestors, but we may be talking
of little more than 100 or so who have crossed the line into
out-and-out terrorism.</div>
<a name="06062280000477"></a><div class="hs_Para">The important breakthrough in
dealing with these people came about via the civil law, rather than the
criminal law, when Huntingdon Life Sciences managed to secure a civil
injunction under the Protection from Harassment Act 1997, which was
originally intended to stop stalking. The court found that the
injunction could cover all of the employees and at multiple locations,
including their homes. As different companies have subsequently applied
for injunctions, the courts have gradually extended the remit to cover
activists who continually look for new victims related to the company
who are not covered by the injunction. One granted to Oxford university
was extended to cover third-party unnamed suppliers to the proposed
research premises, and was then further extended to cover people who
live or work in Oxford who may be negatively affected by noise and so
on. Very recently GSK also used an injunction to protect its
shareholders.</div> <a name="06062280000478"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005, passed in January last
year, included provisions that made it easier to secure injunctions, as
well as instituting other valuable measures concerning harassment of
people in their own homes. That was important because when HLS
shareholders were approached by the terrorists, many of them had their
homes picketed, graffitied and so on. Injunctions tend to work quite
well because breaching them can incur criminal penalties, and for the
most part the terrorists work within or around the law, mainly saving
criminal activity for the night or for when it is difficult to catch
them. However, the use of injunctions has meant that the extremist
campaign has become wider so the number of so-called home
visits&#151;that is for protest 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column185" />Column number: 186</div>visits, not taking tea&#151;has decreased for directors and employees,
while anonymous activities such as abusive calls and hate mail has
increased and the incidence of criminal damage, which takes place
mainly at night, is high.</div>
<a name="06062280000479"></a><div class="hs_Para">Importantly, as more farm and
research companies take out injunctions, so the extremists look for
easier targets. We have seen an increase in the number of secondary and
tertiary target companies. Typically, the secondary target company will
be a small family-owned supplier, possibly in the locality of the
primary target. It will be sent a letter saying that it must sign a
document promising not to trade with, for example, HLS, and that if it
does not sign, it will be put on the Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty
website. That threat is often enough to get a capitulation, as the
extremists call it. For the brave traders who refuse to be intimidated,
being placed on the SHAC website means that their company is game for
visits from the thugs. That is when it starts to get really nasty.
Normally, it starts with protestors invading the premises. Many small
businesses in my constituency have called me about the torments they
have suffered because of such
thugs.</div><a name="06062280000480"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was a member
of the Committee that considered the Serious Organised Crime and Police
Bill. We had been pushing for some time for new criminal laws to
protect companies from economic terrorism and tabled amendments to deal
with it. We were happy when the Government accepted the point and later
introduced their own provision&#151;clause 145&#151;preventing
animal testing companies from being forced to act in a certain way if
contracts had terminated in circumstances of criminal
activity.</div>
<a name="06062280000606"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4
pm</div><a name="06062280000481"></a><div class="hs_Para">At that time,
the Conservatives wanted the provision being drafted to apply more
widely than to animal testing companies alone. As Lord Sainsbury said
in the other place, the protections given shareholders in the Bill need
to be looked at in the context of protections given under the Serious
Organised Crime and Police Act 2005. That being the case, we now think
that section 145 provisions should be extended to all companies, as
provided for in section 149 of the 2005 Act. Although the Government
are acting, it seems to be always at the last minute and at the point
of a gun. Can we please think a step ahead of the
extremists?</div><a name="06062280000482"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062280000798"></a>Paul
Farrelly:</b> I appreciate that the hon. Gentleman has
constituency concerns because of Huntingdon Life Sciences. Not far from
my constituency in my county of Staffordshire, animal rights terrorists
have attacked farmers and local people because of a guinea pig farm.
However, companies such as Huntingdon Life Sciences can set up
facilities for shareholders that do not involve giving addresses.
Facilities to help the trading of shares are set up all the time. He
says that the amendments are widely drafted and cover the whole
corporate sector, but they are not proportionate and add nothing to a
situation that can be resolved in other ways. The amendments would set
back corporate governance and transparency in this country by a long
way.</div><a name="06062280000483"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062280000799"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I explained myself to the hon. Gentleman before
and shall do so again, because he 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column186" />Column number: 187</div>obviously totally missed my point. The point of most of our amendments
is that Parliament should have a debate on the extent to which access
should be given to the register of members. Different countries and
systems treat the issue in different ways. The provisions were rushed
through by the Government in the other place, mostly on Third Reading
and without debate. The hon. Gentleman may think that the issues
therefore do not deserve debate. I am afraid that I disagree entirely;
we will have that
debate.</div><a name="06062280000484"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062280000800"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> I should like to put something straight on the
record. My noble Friend Lord Sainsbury, the Minister with prime
responsibility for many of these issues, has been responsible for
taking forward a whole raft of new legislation as the problem that we
are discussing has emerged and developed. It is unfair to assert that
that has not happened. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw his
assertion. I know from my dealings with my noble Friend that what the
hon. Gentleman says is not the
case.</div><a name="06062280000485"></a><div class="hs_Para">This Bill, as
introduced in the House of Lords, included substantial protection of
members. Further consideration was given to issues raised in the House
of Lords and in the inclusive way in which we tried to devise the Bill.
Indeed, I held a meeting with the hon. Gentleman, in which we sought to
establish whether we could develop those clauses any further. We did.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062280000804"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> No, I shall respond to the Minister and then
come back to the hon. Gentleman if he can wait. You made an important
point, Mr. Illsley. I am developing an argument, and it is not helpful
when the Minister and the hon. Gentleman pre-empt me.</div>
<a name="06062280000490"></a><div class="hs_Para">In response to the
Minister&#146;s point, I should say that I have not denied that there
is previous legislation. I have just spent five minutes talking about
recent legislation and how it has happened, so I am not denying it. I
have said nothing about what Lord Sainsbury has or has not done. In
fact, I think that he has been the pick of the bunch that the
Government have offered on this issue. He has done a lot of good and I
respect him for it. The Minister put the wrong words in my
mouth.</div><a name="06062280000491"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062280000805"></a>Paul
Farrelly:</b> I fully understood the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
previous point that these are probing amendments, so he is not
seriously considering pressing them to a Division. So far in our debate
on funding life sciences, he has attacked the Government, who have bent
over backwards to be helpful to shareholders and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column187" />Column number: 188</div>businesses, and the lead has been very well set by the Prime Minister.
The hon. Gentleman is addressingthe matter of Huntingdon Life
Sciences but not the amendment. If he were serious, he would table
amendments that would affect the position of shareholders in that
company.</div><a name="06062280000492"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062280000806"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. Once again I ask hon. Members to make
briefer interventions. There will be an opportunity to debate the whole
clause under stand
part.</div><a name="06062280000493"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062280000807"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Let me reassure the hon. Gentleman on two
points. First, I shall be developing the argument way beyond Huntingdon
Life Sciences. Secondly, I repeat that there must be a debate on the
extent to which the provisions will work in practice and whether they
are appropriate. That is a debate that we have not had and that I hope
to begin now.</div><a name="06062280000494"></a><div class="hs_Para">I return
to the relationship between civil and criminal law in the context of
shareholders. Many, if not most, of the companies that will be affected
are not the size of GlaxoSmithKline&#151;far from it. They will
normally be small family businesses for which an injunction costing
tens of thousands of pounds is unaffordable. More to the point, such
companies are asking, &#147;Is it not for the Government to defend us
against terrorist activity rather than our having to pay for
injunctions?&#148;</div>
<a name="06062280000495"></a><div class="hs_Para">Where do shareholders fit in? I
have tried to explain that this debate is multifaceted and highly
interconnected, mainly because activists will look for weak points
where, with the minimum number of people, they can inflict the maximum
damage, be it to property, people or a company&#146;s economic
prospects.</div><a name="06062280000496"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062280000808"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> I want to make a point and ask a question that my
hon. and learned Friend the Under-Secretary has just raised with me.
First, injunctions do not necessarily cost as much as he has suggested.
Secondly, he is looking at the matter simply from the point of view of
the company. If a company will not disclose its membership to an
individual with a perfectly proper and legitimate request, is it right
that that individual should incur enormous litigation costs to seek
access to its members? Would it be right and affordable by the
individual, given that the hon. Gentleman has just said that it would
not be affordable by the company?</div>
<a name="06062280000497"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062280000809"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I am not totally sure what point the Minister is
making. If it is to ask whether an individual should have a personal
right to get an injunction to defend themselves, I suppose that they
should. That is not what I am
suggesting.</div><a name="06062280000498"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062280000810"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> I can help the hon. Gentleman. In new clause 2, he
suggests that a company should apply to the Secretary of State to
withhold the information. It would then be up to an individual to
challenge that through a court process. The hon. Gentleman said that a
company cannot afford a court challenge, but when there is a perfectly
legitimate inquiry by an individual on the membership of a company, he
expects the individual to afford it. That seems
disproportionate.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column188" />Column number: 189</div><a name="06062280000499"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062280000811"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I shall come on to this in detail in a moment.
The Minister is pre-empting my argument, and if she looks a little more
closely at the new clause, she will see that it would latch on to her
existing provisions rather than remove them. I do, indeed, say that we
need to examine whether a company having to make the first move through
the courts is necessarily the right way to
go.</div><a name="06062280000500"></a><div class="hs_Para">Many companies
will fold under what can be a concerted and multi-directional attack.
Some that believe in what they are doing and refuse to be scared by
intimidation will trade on&#151;companies such as HLS and suppliers
such as builders Montpellier, which is building the Oxford labs. In
both those cases, the issue that sparked the crisis was when the
terrorists attacked the respective companies&#146; shareholders. At
that point HLS, unable to survive as a company registered in this
country because of the hate mail and death threats being sent to its
shareholders, repatriated to Maryland, USA, and re-listed on the US
NASDAQ exchange. Why Maryland? Because in that state, only holders
of5 per cent. or more of a company&#146;s shares have to be
disclosed, and then only to other shareholders. To answer the question
asked earlier by the hon. Member for Newcastle-under-Lyme, I am not
advocating the use of that approach in the UK. To that extent,
amendment No. 26 has been tabled on a probing basis, so that the
Government can put on the record their view of such a framework for
shareholders.</div> <a name="06062280000501"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
amplify the importance of the issue, let us look at the case of
Montpellier in Oxford. It bravely resisted the attacks of the
terrorists, but finally stopped work when its shareholders started
being threatened and attacked. As a relatively small listed company,
its share price was directly affected by that activity. So a direct
link could be made between access to a register of members and
impending disaster for that company.</div>
<a name="06062280000502"></a><div class="hs_Para">The importance of the attack on
GSK shareholders was of a different nature. I read the remarks of
Jean-Pierre Garnier, the GSK chief executive officer, and I think that
he should be thoroughly commended for standing up to the terrorists and
defending his industry. The tactics for the terrorist attack on GSK
shareholders were roughly the same as those on HLS and Montpellier. The
letters to GSK shareholders
stated:</div><a name="06062280000581"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
only way to hold GSK to its promise [not to use HLS] is to target its
financial vulnerability. We are therefore giving you this opportunity
to sell your shares in GSK. Over the next two weeks every shareholder
of GSK will be receiving this letter. If you have any doubts over the
effectiveness of this action then keep a close eye on the GSK share
price and watch it
plummet.&#148;</div><a name="06062280000503"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
difference between GSK, and HLS and Montpellier, is worth considering.
This is not a formal analysis, but worth considering: in the event, the
GSK share price held steady. GSK put that down to fewer than 5 per
cent. of its shares being owned by private investors, and the remainder
by institutions. Furthermore, this time, rather than cowering in the
shadows, those institutions got together and spoke out in support of
the industry. That made a big impact. At the same time, politicians
spoke out against animal rights extremism and the media took it up as a
big issue. They even conducted surveys showing that the vast majority
of the British public accepted drug testing on animals. In other words,
the terrorists were marginalised in a way that had not happened
before.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column189" />Column number: 190</div><a name="06062280000504"></a><div class="hs_Para">The GSK chief executive officer
said one thing, however, that I would like to question. He claimed that
existing laws were sufficient, and specifically mentioned the existing
option for shareholders to switch from personal to nominee accounts. To
its great credit, GSK quickly put that in place and helped out small
shareholders. I believe that that was the point that the hon. Member
for Burnley (Kitty Ussher) made earlier.
</div><a name="06062280000505"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would point out,
however, that that might be all well and good for a large company such
as GSK, but let us be frank: with the number of people that it employs,
its level of investment in British farming and the fees that it pays to
City institutions, it could demand action from Government and pay for
its own action more easily than could small companies such as HLS or
Montpellier.</div><a name="06062280000506"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having
said that, I have long said and agreed that new laws will not in
themselves be enough, and that Government time and money needs to go
into prosecuting the offenders and co-ordinating a response around the
country. At the same time, however, few City institutions are going to
refuse to act as a nominee to hold GSK shares. The same is not the case
with HLS where, in the most cowardly fashion, one institution after the
next refused to act as nominee for its shares. That was in addition to
banks refusing to do its banking and brokers refusing to handle its
insurance. That is the potential and horrendous reality, not perhaps
for GSK, but for smaller companies, particularly small listed
companies, whose bottom line and share prices will be affected by the
cost of injunctions and security arrangements, and where a concerted
attack on its shareholders will have serious
consequences.</div><a name="06062280000507"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062280000812"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> I know that the hon. Gentleman rightly feels
passionately about those issues, from his own experience, and many of
us do too. However, I do not follow how that debate has an impact on
whether a bank is prepared to lend money or companies do business with
such a company. <i class="I">[Interruption.] </i>Home addresses of the
shareholders are not necessary under provisions in the Bill.</div>
<a name="06062280000508"></a><div class="hs_Para">I put it to the hon. Gentleman
that the rest of the debate is not relevant to the consideration of
whether the names of members should be entered&#151;the issue that we
are talking about&#151;or whether the provisions in the Bill, which
enable a company
to&#151;</div><a name="06062280000509"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062280000813"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. Interventions are becoming too long. It
would be far easier to allow the hon. Gentleman, who is in order, to
move his amendments and to respond
afterwards.</div>
<a name="06062280000607"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.15
pm</div><a name="06062280000510"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062280000814"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I am not sure whether I heard the Minister
right. Is she honestly saying that if a death threat to a shareholder
is sent to their service address, rather than to their home address, it
is
okay?</div><a name="06062280000511"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062280000815"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> Of course I am not saying that. The issue is about
striking a balance between the accountability and the openness that are
the basis of company law. I urge the hon. Gentleman to think widely
about what he is proposing to the Committee. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column190" />Column number: 191</div>The issue is whether he has the balance right, given the other ways and
mechanisms in place to deal with the horrors and
unacceptability&#151;there is unanimity about that here&#151;of
such
terrorists.</div><a name="06062280000512"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062280000816"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> That is exactly what the Minister will hear from
me. Spending half an hour defending shareholders in this country is
more worthy than spending half an hour talking about Eccles cakes.
Perhaps she will give me a bit of latitude in developing my argument
and we can then give her the chance to address my
concerns.</div><a name="06062280000513"></a><div class="hs_Para">If we do not
get on top of the issue, we will see many more companies such as
Huntingdon Life Sciences repatriating to the US. We can have whatever
tax regime we like in this country, but if company shareholders are
approached and attacked, the company will be forced to consider
moving.</div><a name="06062280000514"></a><div class="hs_Para">To put just
the pharmaceutical sector in perspective, it contributes more than
&#163;6.5 billion a year to Britain&#146;s GDP. It contributes
&#163;12 billion in exports. It employs 80,000 people directly and
250,000 indirectly. That is serious stuff for UK plc. I have attempted
to explain the need to protect shareholder details and why that needs
to be put in a wider context. It constitutes one aspect of the
protection of business against extremism.
</div><a name="06062280000515"></a><div class="hs_Para">I emphasise, however,
that countering criminal activity using shareholder registers goes much
further than dealing with extremists. One other problem is the growth
in foreign-based, so-called boiler rooms, which have been approaching
individuals, whose personal details they harvest from members&#146;
registers, to persuade them to buy investments that are often worthless
and often imply a connection with the company whose register they are
misusing.</div><a name="06062280000516"></a><div class="hs_Para">A court case
recently revealed that fraudsters were using registers to steal shares
from overseas investors. The <i class="I">Financial Times</i> reported on 6 May
that the company secretary of Balfour Beatty wrote to the
company&#146;s 20,000 shareholders after receiving a significant
number of complaints. Diageo wrote to 110,000 shareholders after
similar calls to its members. Close Brothers Group, GSK, MFI and
Majestic Wine have all complained of the same
problem.</div>
<a name="06062280000517"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062280000817"></a>Kitty
Ussher:</b> The hon. Gentleman might be confusing two issues.
The first is the original offence. He mentioned the word
&#147;fraudster&#148; and talked about death threats. Those are, of
course, criminal offences. Perhaps he is confusing that issue with the
issue of where the information is obtained from. Does he agree with
that?</div><a name="06062280000518"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062280000818"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I am not sure that I take the hon. Lady&#146;s
point. I say to her this: if someone takes details of a register of
members&#151;either by using the address, whether a service address
or a home address, or by using the name, which in my case would enable
people to track me down easily as they would get a telephone number
quickly&#151;and they are used either by an extremist who wants to
send me a death threat or by a boiler-room fraudster who wants to do
illegal cold 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column191" />Column number: 192</div>calling to get me to buy shares in a company that does not exist, those
shareholders deserve protection.</div>

the provisions in the round, conceptually.</div>
<a name="06062280000530"></a><div class="hs_Para">First, as things stand, in
practical terms a coach and horses can be driven through the provisions
because details of shareholders as at the return date need to be filed

may not be accurate as at any other given moment, but it is certainly
adequate for conducting a terror campaign against

individually their members in their annual return. The formula chosen
by the Government is for the company to make the move if it objects to
a request to see the register, and I want to make various points on
that issue.</div><a name="06062280000533"></a><div class="hs_Para">First, I
want to discuss matters raised by the United Kingdom Shareholders
Association in its briefing paper dated 30 May, which
states:</div><a name="06062280000582"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;At
Third Reading amendments were brought forward by Lord Sainsbury
intended to meet the concerns expressed at the Report Stage. Lord
Hodgson, while expressing appreciation, reserved his position and
indicated that these matters would be for discussion in the Commons.
Despite all the protestations to the contrary, Lord Sainsbury
maintained his position that it is impossible to formulate a definition
of a proper or an improper purpose and that a company and a court will
instinctively know a purpose that is not proper when they see
one.</div><a name="06062280000583"></a><div class="hs_brev">This seems to be
a case where the DTI have got themselves stuck in a mindset and cannot
see an alternative way through. We still believe that it is
unreasonable to leave the definition so vague and to expect companies
to decide what the courts are likely to consider as &#145;not a
proper purpose&#146; and act accordingly. If, for example, we are
talking about animal rights activists, the company will have to decide
whether the level of communication intended is at an acceptable level,
e.g. letters to ask shareholders to press the company to change its
policy, or involves action of a more threatening or harassing nature.
Equally if there is a request on behalf of some kind of investment
organisation, the company will have to decide whether it is a
reasonable use to try to gain clients or whether it is some kind of
scam. There is no obligation on the company to contest the request by
going to court. It would be very easy for them to decide that the
trouble and cost are too much and just comply with the
request.</div> <a name="06062280000584"></a><div class="hs_brev">In practice
the lack of a clear definition will cause enormous difficulties both
for companies in deciding whether to grant access to the register, and
for organisations such as our own who occasionally request copies. We
would also risk incurring considerable legal costs because of the lack
of such clarity, and it could be very many years before legal practice
was established by case law, if
ever.</div><a name="06062280000585"></a><div class="hs_brev">We believe that
it would be quite possible to draft a clause with clear examples of an
improper purpose but still leaving the courts a wide discretion to
extend the list if they saw fit. This kind of approach has been adopted
in The Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations
1999...Another example is in Section 11(2) of the Unfair Contract
Terms Act 1977.</div><a name="06062280000586"></a><div class="hs_brev">The
only place where we have been able to find &#145;proper
purpose&#146; used in connection with a criminal offence is in the
Merchant Shipping and Fishing Vessels (Medical Stores) Regulations
1995. There, at Reg 12, it is a defence if medicines and medical stores
have been used for their &#145;proper purpose&#146;; surely a
situation where the meaning of the words is rather more
obvious.&#148;</div><a name="06062280000534"></a><div class="hs_Para">That points to
the fact that there is a great deal to be debated in relation to the
Government&#146;s proposals.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column193" />Column number: 194</div><a name="06062280000535"></a><div class="hs_Para">An article
in <i class="I">The Times </i>on 9 May begins by quoting Mr. John Roundhill of
the Institute of Chartered Secretaries and
Administrators:</div><a name="06062280000587"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;&#145;Under
the new proposals, the company is obliged to deliver the register only
if the person requesting it can prove that they require the information
for a &#147;fit and proper&#148; purpose...We would urge the
Department for Trade and Industry to look at this clause again as we
are concerned that there is no definition of &#147;fit and
proper&#148;
purpose.&#146;</div><a name="06062280000588"></a><div class="hs_brev">Mr
Roundhill is chairman of the registrars' group of the Institute of
Chartered Secretaries and Administrators, which represents 97 per cent.
of Britain&#146;s shareholders. He said that it would be fairly easy
for a person to give the impression that he intended to use the
information for a &#145;fit and proper&#146; purpose but that it
would be difficult to know whether this was
true.</div><a name="06062280000589"></a><div class="hs_brev">He is also
concerned that the company has only five days to determine whether or
not the case is &#145;fit and
proper&#146;.&#148;</div><a name="06062280000536"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062280000828"></a>Justine
Greening:</b> My hon. Friend illuminates the issue.
Unfortunately, companies will know that information has been used
improperly only after it has happened, and because the asset is
information, once it has been given it cannot be taken away again.
Therefore, it is almost impossible for companies retrospectively to
take action when something has already gone
wrong.</div><a name="06062280000537"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062280000829"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> My hon. Friend goes to the nub of the matter;
that is what the debate is about. At the time the request comes in, it
will be difficult to know whether it is valid. That is one of our main
problems with the
measure.</div><a name="06062280000538"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062280000830"></a>Paul
Farrelly:</b> I do not want to delay the Committee, but the
hon. Gentleman has been discussing Huntingdon Life Sciences without
advancing his cause and argument as he has not tabled sensible
amendments. That is the point that my right hon. Friend the Minister
was making. His amendments would set corporate governance in this
country back by 100 years. It is not a solution for Huntingdon Life
Sciences to move in the direction of Mickey Mouse tax havens with their
secrecy, which he would rightly
criticise.</div><a name="06062280000539"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062280000831"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The hon. Gentleman has said two or three times
now that I intend to set about destroying corporate governance. Will he
explain
how?</div><a name="06062280000540"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062280000832"></a>Paul
Farrelly:</b> As my right hon. Friend the Minister said,
through allowing a general presumption of secrecy, and in one of his
amendments putting the company in the place of the court as the sole
arbiter.</div><a name="06062280000541"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062280000833"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> First, the hon. Gentleman does not know that I
am suggesting a general presumption of secrecy. In fact, I specifically
did not advocate the Maryland system. He is on the wrong track; perhaps
he did not understand what I was saying. I would like to proceed with
making my points.</div><a name="06062280000542"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have an important problem in clause 115. It may be possible, at a push,
for a large company to instruct lawyers, solicitors and barristers to
take a case to court within five days, but it would be much more
inconvenient, if not wholly unrealistic, to expect a smaller company to
keep to that timetable. That is why we asked for the Minister&#146;s
comments on our amendment No. 29, which would increase the number 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column194" />Column number: 195</div>of days from five to 15. For a small company, it would still be a tall
order to go to court, particularly if it had to do so on a repeat
basis.</div><a name="06062280000543"></a><div class="hs_Para">Additionally,
we must keep it in mind that smaller companies are more likely to be
attractive targets of activism. The activists are not stupid. They will
learn from their bruising GSK experience of fighting with the big boys
and head back to the smaller and easier pickings. It has been pointed
out to us that, because the share register is statutory, the
information in it is outside the regulatory environment of the
Information Commission. If the Government have examined that point, I
would appreciate hearing the Minister&#146;s
views.</div><a name="06062280000608"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.30
pm</div><a name="06062280000544"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 115
requires people to identify the purpose for which the information is to
be used. Amendment No. 27&#151;a probing amendment&#151;proposes
that the information should be precise. My hon. Friend the Member for
Putney rightly asked what would happen if the reason given was,
&#147;To inform shareholders of an important matter for themselves,
the company, humanity and the environment,&#148; without any
statement that shareholders will be asked to sell their shares as a
protest. It could be complicated, and many complex and expensive court
cases could arise. Do the Government intend to give any guidance on
that?</div> <a name="06062280000545"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us consider
the alternatives. The first is the approach adopted in Maryland, USA,
which I have discussed previously and have discounted for this
country&#151;although I should like to hear the Minister&#146;s
views on it, because Huntingdon Life Sciences felt that it was forced
to adopt it because of terrorist activity. It would restrict access to
members holding at least 5 per
cent.</div><a name="06062280000546"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second
approach would be to define what constitutes a proper or improper
purpose, as suggested by the UK Shareholders Association, among others.
Lord Sainsbury said that he had specifically turned that down because
in his view it would be impossible satisfactorily to formulate a
definition to cover all situations. Other people have since disagreed,
and I should be interested to hear whether the Minister has reassessed
the position.</div><a name="06062280000547"></a><div class="hs_Para">A third
approach, which could be complementary to the Government&#146;s,
would be to provide companies and individuals with the right to apply
to the DTI to, in effect, close the register if the availability of the
register created, or was likely to create, a serious risk that a member
of the company, or connected parties, would be subject to violence or
intimidation.</div><a name="06062280000548"></a><div class="hs_Para">Hon.
Members will note that I am not calling for a general closure of the
register; I am talking about closure in situations where it could be
shown to the registrar that members would be subject to intimidation.
That approach suggests that companies should not all be thrown into the
same basket. Some companies or individuals may be at such risk that
they 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column195" />Column number: 196</div>should be treated on a stand-alone basis. The provisions could be tacked
on to existing provisions and could provide a further level of
protection that might be more realistic, accessible and certainly
cheaper for smaller companies that believe that their shareholders need
protection. The clause as it stands works only for a company seeking
protection in respect of all its members and does not provide for
individual members to seek to protect their details. New clauses 2 and
3 provide for
that.</div><a name="06062280000549"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Liberal
Democrats have suggested another option which is worthy of
consideration in the form of new clause 22. I shall not steal the
thunder of the hon. Member for Cambridge, but from our point of view
the proposal heads in the same direction as ours. It provides for the
company to vote to close its register by special resolution of members,
on the basis that the company would pass lawful communications on to
interested parties. I can see the attractions of that, and I look
forward to hearing his case. There are a number of approaches and the
issue is important to the future of business in this country. I am
pleased to have had the opportunity to debate it, although the debate
is one that I believe we should have had years
ago.</div><a name="06062280000550"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, on
clause 115 stand part, regulation 3(1) of the Companies (Inspection and
Copying of Registers, Indices and Documents) Regulations 1991
says:</div><a name="06062280000590"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;This
Regulation applies to an obligation to make a register, index or
document available for inspection imposed ona company by
sections 169(5)...175(6)...191(1)...219(1)...
288(3)...318(7)...356(1)...and 383(1)... of the Act, as
well as to section 325 of, and paragraph 25 of Part IV of Schedule 13
to, the Act&#148;.</div><a name="06062280000551"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Act
referred to is the Companies Act
1985.</div><a name="06062280000552"></a><div class="hs_Para">Regulation 3(2)
goes on to
say:</div><a name="06062280000591"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
company shall:</div><a name="06062280000592"></a><div class="hs_brev">(a)
make the register, index or document available for such inspection for
not less than two hours during the period between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. on
each business day;
and</div><a name="06062280000593"></a><div class="hs_brev">(b) permit a
person inspecting the register, index or document to copy any
information made available for inspection by means of the taking of
notes or the transcription of the
information.&#148;</div><a name="06062280000553"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
practical issue is that the inspector of the register will not know the
number of company members at the time of the application for
inspection. Therefore, he will not know what fee must be paid for the
copy of the register. He will need to ask the company, which could
delay in responding or in telling him, for instance, which two hours on
any business day are available for inspection. Could that not be used
as a delaying tactic in a takeover, and would it not be better to have
fixed access hours, or at least fixed
fees?</div><a name="06062280000554"></a><div class="hs_Para">Also, I
understand that the Court of Appeal in Pelling <i class="I">v. </i>Families Need
Fathers recently ruled that a court has the discretion not to order a
company to allow a member to require a copy of its register. How does
that tie in with the statutory
instrument?</div><a name="06062280000555"></a><div class="hs_Para">Debate
adjourned.&#151;<i class="I">[Steve
McCabe.]</i></div><a name="06062280000556"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Adjourned
at twenty-four minutes to Five o&#146;clock till Tuesday 27 June at
