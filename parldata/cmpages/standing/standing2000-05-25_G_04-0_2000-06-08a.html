<P>
<B>Mr. Philip Hammond </B>(Runnymede and Weybridge): I beg to move amendment No. 102, in page 3, line 31, leave out subsection (1) and insert&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(1) For the purposes of this Act&#151;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) ``Day Care Centre'' means any premises not being a hospital, independent clinic or care home, at which services are provided to persons by virtue of their age, infirmity, disability or mental or physical impairment.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss the following amendments: No. 19, in page 3, line 31, at end insert&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> (1A) ``Day Services'' means any centre or other facilities for daytime training or occupation, including arrangements for supporting people using facilities generally available to members of the public, funded or provided, directly or indirectly, by a public authority for the use of persons over pension age or persons with a physical or mental disability.
<P>
</UL></FONT>No. 109, in page 4, line 29, after `clinic', insert `a Day Care Centre'.
<P>
No. 150, in page 4, line 29, after `clinic', insert `Day Services'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Amendment No. 102 would insert a definition of a day care centre. I do not intend to speak at great length, as the relevant arguments were well rehearsed in the other place, I suspect that other hon. Members want to speak about the substantive arguments in support of the inclusion of such centres.
<P>
The Bill is primarily concerned with preventing and avoiding the risk of abuse among vulnerable people in care settings. I am sad to say that there has been ample evidence of significant abuse of vulnerable people in day care. There is a broad consensus, including in the Government, that it would be desirable to regulate day care centres. It seems illogical to exclude them from the Bill.
<P>
When the matter was discussed in the other place, the Government sought to mollify such opinion by committing to review the situation after the Bill had come into force, with a view to bringing day care centres within its ambit later. The Committee might want to explore the practical reasons why the Government are reluctant to do so now. I hope that the Minister will talk about the issues&#151;I hope that they are only practical&#151;that prevent him.
<P>
Local authorities largely still operate day care centres. However, it is fair to say from our debates that there has been a recognition, at least on the Opposition Benches, that merely because something is operated by a public authority does not mean that we can relax and assume that it will necessarily be operated properly and in the best interests of the patients, and that abuse cannot happen in such institutions.
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Department of Health (Mr. John Hutton):</B> I am glad to hear the hon. Gentleman express that view on behalf of his party. Will he explain how he would justify the exemption from the regulatory arrangements of all local authority homes? That is the legacy of his party's time in government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> As I said in Committee on Tuesday, we all seek to create a regulatory framework that will work in future. I have said in other forums in relation to social care legislation that, over the past 20 years, society has become increasingly aware of the need to secure the social care environment and the protection of children. I hope that the point will not become party political. Society has been waking up to things that have gone on for far too long, perhaps for decades or since time began. I hope that the Minister will not suggest that child abuse began in 1979, as it clearly has a deep-rooted presence in our society going back many years before that date. It has become an issue of public awareness and concern only relatively recently, but that does not mean that we should spend our time focusing on the past and asking why we did not deal with it earlier. The imperative for us all, having identified the problems, is to move forward and see that they are dealt with.
<P>
My noble Friends and others raised the issues relating to day care centres and sought to include them in the Bill. I believe that Lord Hunt, the Under-Secretary in the other place, accepted in principle the desirability of including them, but said that doing so would impose a burden on the National Care Standards Commission and suggested a deferral of a couple, perhaps three, years. Members of the Committee may want to probe the reasons for that delay. Why cannot that area of care, which is known to have harboured abuse, be dealt with more promptly? We are practical people, and if the Minister gives us practical reasons why it would be difficult to bring those establishments within the scope of the Bill any earlier, we will listen to him.
<P>
The purpose of the amendment is different, however, in that it is not dependent on the argument about how soon the centres are included. It would simply define ``day care centre'' so that the framework is already present when the Government introduce them. A definition in clause 51 relates to those centres, but it is designed specifically to refer to the training and registration of social workers. I am happy to be corrected on that point, but I understand that it is necessary to effect the inclusion of social workers in day care centres in that part of the Bill. If we are to recognise that day care centres are on a par with hospitals, care homes, independent clinics and medical agencies, and if it is appropriate to regulate them within the scope and logic of the Bill, it is sensible to insert a definition in this clause. That would maintain the symmetry of the Bill's architecture. I hope that the Minister will accept that logic, even if he tells the Committee that there are practical reasons why it will be some time before the provisions on day care centres can be activated.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paul Burstow </B>(Sutton and Cheam): This is an important area, which we are exploring further than in the Lords, although it was debated in some depth there. The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond) has outlined some of the concerns that some noble Lords expressed in Committee and on Report. I wanted to use the amendment standing in my name and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Isle of Wight (Dr. Brand) to explore a further two issues. One is timing, to which the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge has already referred, and the other is the scope of the definitions in the Bill, and whether a specific definition is necessary.
<P>
First, I shall deal with timing. When the matter was discussed on Report in another place, Lord Rix moved an amendment, which was fairly and openly debated. Lord Hunt of Kings Heath, the Under-Secretary, gave a helpful and constructive response. When I re-read the debate, I alighted on Lord Hunt's comment that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>we must be careful not to overload the commission as it takes on its considerable and vital responsibilities.&#151;[Official Report, House of Lords, 28 March 2000; Vol. 611, c. 650.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In the early days, the commission must not be so overloaded that it cannot do its real job in various care settings. Further on in the discussion, reference was made to the fact that, under clause 45, the Government signalled an intention to use the relevant power to set standards and introduce regulation in respect of day centres in due course.
<P>
Lord Hunt said in another place that the process of review would start a year after the commission came into being. However, the timing beyond that review is unclear. Will it be the same period that led to the production of ``Fit for the Future?'', and whatever might emerge from the current consultation, which is 18 months to two years? Will it be shorter or longer? Can the Minister give the Committee a glimpse of the Government's thinking on the timetable for production of day centre regulations?
<P>
On the second issue, I said during the Committee's first sitting that, because the Bill is based to such an extent on the use of regulations&#151;most of which we will not see&#151;definitions are key. Definitions are the building block from which the regulations are constructed. The absence from the Bill of a detailed definition of day centres or day services is a legitimate cause of concern to those outside this Committee. That is especially true in relation to the definition in clause 100(3), which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In this Act, the expression ``personal care'' or ``nursing or personal care'' extends to advice and encouragement, but does not include any prescribed activity.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Does that encapsulate the intention behind amendment No. 19, which I tabled, as well as the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge? Clearly, my amendment tries to broaden the definition beyond the narrow one of personal care. Organisations such as Age Concern and MENCAP are worried about the narrowness of definitions in the Bill, and the focus on personal care. People who fit the definition of personal care in terms of an assessment of their needs may, on occasions, choose to go to a facility that does not fit the definition. That raises the question whether that facility would be regulated and inspected.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I want to clarify a point in relation to amendment No. 19. It appears to exclude voluntarily run day centres, which are not reimbursed by public funds. Was that the hon. Gentleman's intention? If so, will he explain the reason behind it?
<P>
<H5>9.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I shall be up-front. It was an omission. The Opposition's job is, as much as anything, to probe the Government's intent. On many occasions, amendments are imperfect or, if necessary, imperfections will be found to ensure that they are not accepted. Nevertheless, they are suitable vehicles to encourage debate. Some members of the Committee who have sat on the Opposition Benches in the past will recognise that. We certainly do.
<P>
We want to know more about time scales. How will the Government roll out various standards? Our real worry concerns the definition. As drafted, it is too narrowly focused. As a consequence, many people&#151;in the voluntary sector, too&#151;will not have the benefit of a proper, fair regulatory regime that guarantees quality of service. Community facilities may provide day services that include support and advice, but not those concerned with personal care. The amendment was tabled to find out the Government's thinking.

<P>

<B>Caroline Flint (Don Valley):</B> I welcome the opportunity to speak about day care. I have been raising it for more than a year. In fact, it was a year ago to the day when the Bill was discussed on Second Reading that I wrote to the then Minister when we were being consulted about the White Paper. I stand to be corrected, but I cannot recall either the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge or the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam (Mr. Burstow) referring to day care on Second Reading.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow indicated assent.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Caroline Flint:</B> The hon. Gentleman says that he did, but I do not remember the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge referring to it.
<P>
I shall explain the arrangement in Doncaster as it will add to our discussion about the definition of day care. A certain matter was brought to my attention through a constituency case. We have social education centres that are run by local authority. For some years, they have offered facilities on Mondays to Fridays&#151;from 9 am to 5 pm, in some circumstances&#151;to provide stimulation and activity for vulnerable adults who have learning difficulties or other disabilities to help them and their families. Social education services provide several facilities. Some people receive up-close, personal care and attention because of the nature of their disability. In the past, local employers provided piecework for people to enable them to earn money. Sadly, those facilities lessened in recent years and the centres have had to engage in activity-based facilities to provide stimulation. For example, horticultural skills are developed. The image presented by the centres is that they care for vulnerable adults and such provisions can vary tremendously.
<P>
Apart from the nature of activities at such centres, we must consider the time that is spent at such establishments. I must say at the outset that I have not received any complaints about members of staff or how the centres are operated, but my constituents were genuinely concerned that their sons and daughters could spend considerable time at such establishments from Monday to Friday for five, six or seven hours a day, and asked whether they should not receive the same protection that we expect for children in day care centres who may be considered vulnerable. As chair of the all-party group on child care, I have a considerable interest in the matter and knowledge about the regulations that govern it. There are clear parallels with the argument we used in relation to regulating day care for children, which included the question of the hours above which regulation comes into force. We should ensure that vulnerable adults, especially those with disabilities and learning difficulties, are covered in the same way as children.
<P>
Another point worth making is that residential care or day care, especially for adults, is a movable feast. The philosophies and policies that dominated the field 20 years ago have changed: the idea that people who use these facilities should have a say in how the facilities are run and that they should be able to seek support outside if they feel they are not being treated well is part and parcel of a generational change in attitude to care and the rights of the people receiving it. The providers of care have also changed. One of those issues was brought to my attention by parents whose children used the social education centres in Donacaster: for many years the service was free, but charges have recently been applied. One should be able to demand an excellent service, even if it is free at the point of delivery, but they argue that they want to be certain about the quality of the service for which they are now paying.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I have listened carefully to the hon. Lady's interesting and well-informed contribution. Could she make it clear whether she supports the amendment?
<P>
<B>Caroline Flint:</B> I shall wait to hear my hon. Friend's comments. I paid careful attention to what happened to the Bill in the other place. I noted on Second Reading that the Lords withdrew their amendments when they received a satisfactory response from the Minister. Today provides an opportunity to seek reassurances on certain points, to probe the Government's thinking and to see whether there is any more room for development.
<P>
I would like some reassurances about the schedule for the regulations to bring day care under the auspices of the Bill. My hon. Friend the Member for Wakefield (Mr. Hinchliffe) described a situation that might arise. What is there to stop someone who is forced to close his residential care home because it does not meet the standards opening up a day care facility within months? The time scale is vital: there must be some safeguards to prevent such occurrences.
<P>
I understand that consultation may be needed. I should be interested to know what representations were received about day care during the consultation on the White Paper, and whether the Department looked into the definitions of the types of day care. I have been told that there are issues surrounding luncheon clubs for pensioners that meet for a couple of hours. The sort of day care that I am describing leaves a vulnerable person much more open to abuse if it takes place over a sustained period of time.
<P>
I should like to know how the Government feel about having a definition of day care at this stage. I do not want to tie their hands in respect of compensation, but would a definition of day care in the Bill itself lead to restriction of Government social policies in this sector.
<P>
The fact that we are discussing the issue today shows that, over the past year or so, the Government have been prepared to listen and to move forward. That is important, but I should like further reassurance about the time and the means by which the policy will be implemented. Excuse my ignorance, but if the National Care Standards Commission consults and regulates, will that mean further legislation, or can it be done without it? I would hate to have to wait for another bite of the cherry until another Queen's Speech proposes further legislation. Will the Minister provide some answers to those questions? He now has an opportunity to get this ever-changing care sector right.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jonathan Shaw </B>(Chatham and Aylesford): I should like to make a few brief comments. The ever-changing care that day centres provide for vulnerable citizens, particularly those who have left long-stay hospitals, is important. My hon. Friend the Member for Don Valley (Caroline Flint) referred to large social education centres, or adult training centres, as they are also known. Such centres are becoming increasingly diverse and are developing into, for example, small satellite gardening groups or farming outlets. Nowadays, people with learning difficulties may also help to run cafeterias, which again raises a question of definition. Could a commercial facility or shop be under the auspices of a day care centre providing personal care? We should not assume that activities take place only in day care centres. Sometimes there is a one-on-one situation similar to domiciliary care. Vulnerable citizens may be at risk if they are in hands of those who wish to abuse them.
<P>
It has been my experience that the parents of people who attend day centres value them greatly. As my hon. Friend the Member for Don Valley said, they seek the same standards and regulations as in residential and domiciliary care. The Government have at least made a commitment to listen further on domiciliary care and the Minister has accepted the amendment on residential schools.
<P>
We do not want to overload the commission in its early days or to create unnecessary anxiety. Royal British Legion Industries, which recently celebrated its 75th anniversary, is in my constituency. A care component is relevant there: many of its people are unable to work in the community at large and require some personal support, but I doubt whether it would fall under the definition of a day centre. We need to avoid anxiety, but at the same time, a serious commitment to protecting vulnerable citizens in day care centres is expected.
<P>
Following my hon. Friend's comments, about when a residential home is shut down and the person who ran it tries to set up a day centre, what would be the position if the residential home and the day centre are on the same site, principally under the same management? In that regard, I agree with the point made by my noble Friend Lord Kingsdown&#151;[Hon. Members: ``Lord Hunt of Kings Heath''.] Yes, thank you.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> He is not much of a friend!
<P>
<B>Mr. Shaw:</B> I see him all the time.
<P>
We must acknowledge that the Government have moved, but we want to offer assurance and avoid creating anxiety. The definition and the time scale are important, and I look forward to hearing from my hon. Friend the Minister.
<P>
<H5>9.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> This has been a useful debate. I congratulate hon. Members who have spoken in the past half hour.
<P>
I understand the purpose of the amendments, which are designed to extract more information from the Government about their intentions for the regulation of day centres. The hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam foresaw a barrage of technical deficiencies in amendments Nos.19 and 150; the hon. Member for Runnymeade and Weybridge also foresaw technical deficiencies in his amendments. They are right: there are many problems with the amendments. I shall identify only one or two to explain why we cannot accept them.
<P>
The amendment in the name of the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge refers simply to services that are ``provided to persons''. Under the amendment, someone's home might have to be registered as a day centre, and I am sure that that is not his intention. There are similar problems with the amendment in the name of the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam, and we should not want to accept it for the same reason. It refers to ``training or occupation'', which might require a range of colleges, schools and other educational institutions to register as day centres with the National Care Standards Commission. I am prepared to accept that that is not the hon. Gentleman's true intention. My noble Friend Lord Hunt made it clear that we accept the need to regulate day centres and that they will be brought within the remit of the National Care Standards Commission.
<P>
Concern was expressed about what we are asking the commission to do. We are establishing a new, independent body with major responsibilities for protecting vulnerable people in a variety of settings. Our first priority must be to ensure a smooth transition from the existing regulatory arrangements that apply to many care and nursing homes to the new body. In addition, for the first time, we are bringing local authority risidential care homes within the remit of regulation, and a range of children's homes&#151;some of which are small and some of which are operated by other providers&#151;within the remit of the commission.
<P>
From the outset, the commission will have the major task of taking on existing responsibilities and new and extensive powers for premises that have not previously been regulated. The National Care Standards Commission will regulate about 30,000 establishments. If we were to include the day centres of which we are aware, it would add approximately 8,500 extra premises&#151;a 25 or 30 per cent. increase in the commission's work load. For those reasons, therefore, it is perfectly appropriate to say, ``Let's get the basics right, but we have accepted in principle the need to regulate day centres and we will do so.''
<P>
I say to my hon. Friends the Members for Don Valley and for Chatham and Aylesford (Mr. Shaw) and to Opposition Members that we intend to conduct and complete the review within a year of the establishment of the commission. The commission will commence its functions in April 2002, so the review will be completed by April 2003. We shall need to take advice from the commission about a range of issues on the regulation of day centres. We have made it clear that we shall use the regulatory powers in clause 39 to extend the commission's jurisdiction to day care centres. There will be an opportunity to consult on the regulations and a set of minimum standards will be informed by that consultation. Hon. Members and those outside will have ample opportunity to be involved in developing the regulatory framework and minimum standards.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Chatham and Aylesford asked about some technical issues to do with the detail of the regulatory arrangements. I am sure that he will understand that I am not in a position to give him an answer. He asked what would happen if a residential care home were operated on the same site as a day centre&#151;perhaps by the same provider, or perhaps by a different provider&#151;and what would be the implications of one failing to meet the registration requirements. I cannot answer those questions in detail today, and I hope that he understands why.
<P>
I can say to my hon. Friend and to my hon. Friend the Member for Don Valley, to whom I pay tribute for doing much to change the Government's mind in this respect, that there is no danger of someone whose registration to run a registered care home is cancelled being allowed to run a day centre. Once we have established the regulatory arrangements for day centres, such a person will have to register with the National Care Standards Commission to operate a day centre. The commission could then take a decision under the registration powers conferred on it by the Bill.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> May I pick up on the Minister's response to the questions asked by the hon. Member for Chatham and Aylesford? Where a day care centre is operated as part of an establishment that is covered by the Bill, will all the establishment's activities, including day care activities, be regulated from the outset, or will it be regarded as divided into segments?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> The short answer is that I do not know&#151;we have not developed the detail of our thinking. Before doing so, we will want to take advice of the National Care Standards Commission. My instinct is that the two places will be registered separately. If a day centre is providing a different service to a different group of clients or residents from a residential or nursing home, a separate registration process might be necessary. I do not know the answers&#151;at present no one does. Such issues will be resolved in the consultation process. We shall have to take the advice of the commission, which will implement the new regulatory framework.
<P>
The answers to some of the questions asked by my hon. Friends the Members for Chatham and Aylesford and for Don Valley will not be known until we begin to devise the regulatory framework. There will be plenty of opportunities to discuss that as we draft the regulations and in the consultation process. Furthermore, there will be public consultation on the national minimum standards. All angles and all the aspects of the issue will be resolved as part of the process.
<P>
The hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam asked whether the Bill's definition of personal care is sufficiently broad to cover his concerns about day centres. We shall fully debate the matter when we reach clause 100, and I am sure that he will table amendments on that definition. I believe that the focus of the regulatory regime should be the personal care provided by day centres. We might have to look at the definition of that, and we will certainly have an opportunity to discuss it in Committee.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Don Valley rightly said that our focus should be the protection of vulnerable adults. The arguments for regulating luncheon clubs run by, for example, Help the Aged and Age Concern are not as strong as those for regulating services for those who have learning disabilities. The services about which the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam was concerned&#151;the provision of trainign and occupation, for example&#151;might apply to people with learning disabilities. I suspect that that is the prime context in which day centres may provide such services. If they are provided to those people, they are likely to be part of a daily care package that would include personal care, certainly within the definition in the Bill. It is likely that those centres woudl come within the future scope of any regulatory arrangements for day centres.
<P>
I am trying to avoid being prescriptive today, as we have not started the consultation and I do not want to preclude options at the moment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I have listened closely, and the Minister's final points about keeping an open mind are welcome. We shall return to the subject; at least one amendment has been tabled about personal care, and I am sure that other devices will be used to explore the matter further.
<P>
The Government are encouraging local authorities through various means to develop low-intensity care services and preventative strategies. From what the Minister said, it would seem that most of those strategies and settings would be outwith the definitions in the Bill. Is that necessarily appropriate? We are talking about non-intimate support that enables people never to need intimate support, because of prevention.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I do not think that the hon. Gentleman is right in his analysis. Much depends on exactly what we are talking about. He used the definition of low-intensity care, but that could cover a range of different situations. Care being providing in a person's home will almost certainly be covered by the regulatory requirements in relation to domiciliary care agencies, so there will be potential for regulation and proper safeguards. The hon. Gentleman has not drawn the right inference from my comments.
<P>
The purpose of the legislation, rightly identified by the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge, is to provide for the first time a comprehensive but flexible and appropriate regulatory arrangement to cover vulnerable people in a variety of different care settings, some at home, some in day centres, and some residential. We want to get everything right, so there will be consultation and an opportunity for Members of Parliament to be involved in developing the framework in all those key areas.
<P>
I should make a final point to my hon. Friends and the Committee as a whole. I have been asked when the regulatory arrangements might come into effect. We want the review to be completed by April 2003 at the latest, and we intend to have a proper system of regulation and inspection in place for day centres by the end of 2003. We do not want to hang around. We are persuaded by the arguments made by my hon. Friend and in another place that vulnerable people in day centres need to be properly protected and safeguarded. The regulatory arrangements will provide that for the first time, but they have to be made correctly and through the right process of consultation. We must be careful that the National Care Standards Commission can deliver on its existing responsibilities and its new ones, which are extensive.
<P>
We shall not tolerate a situation in which vulnerable people are exposed to the risk of abuse, which is real, as the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge made clear. Day centres will be brought within the scope of the Bill, but I shall have to ask my hon. Friends the Members for Chatham and Aylesford and for Don Valley, who asked some detailed questions, to be a little patient. We shall get round to their concerns when we start the process for developing the new regulatory framework.
<P>
For all the reasons that I have given, the amendments are not acceptable to the Government. I hope that I have reassured the Committee about our long-term intentions on the subject.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> It has certainly been helpful to hear the Minister. I am grateful to him for pointing out defects in the amendments, and I accept that he is right. The purpose has been served, however, as we have had the debate.
<P>
I am not sure that the Minister has satisfied all our concerns. It was helpful that he defined more closely the timetable for further consultation, which gave us more idea as to when day centres are likely to be included in the scope of the Bill. The Minister failed to explain why the Bill should not provide for the inclusion of day centres, or give the Secretary of State a specific power that he could implement at a later date, if needed. That would recognise that the practical burden on the commission may be such that day care centres need to be brought within the scope of the Bill later. Whether that is one or two years later can be determined by the Secretary of State, perhaps explicitly on the advice of the commission once it is up and running and able to measure its own work load and capability. By implication, the Minister is saying that, because a Bill can be amended by regulations, there is no need to bother with it now. That is legislative laziness. The attitude is, ``We can amend it later. We can have an hour and a half of debate in a Delegated Legislation Standing Committee. We can do it whenever we are ready, or whenever we feel like it.'' That is not good practice. It would be more helpful to include in the Bill as much as appears to be necessary to set up the system that is ultimately intended. If necessary, the Secretary of State would have the power to amend by regulations through the mechanisms provided by the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> The hon. Gentleman is right. I should have referred to clause 51, which I forgot to do. He is right to say that the context of that part of the Bill is different from part I. Clause 51 includes a definition of a day centre, the basis of which we would expect to use in the construction of regulations and the new regulatory framework. The hon. Gentleman is not right to accuse us of legislative laziness. There is a definition in the Bill, which we would use in developing new regulatory arrangements.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> If the Minister is satisfied with the definition in clause 51&#151;although the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam has raised concerns about it, which should be explored further&#151;why cannot be definition be brought into clause 4. In terms of the overall architecture of the Bill, that is where the definition properly belongs.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> If one reads the report of debate in Committee and on Report in another place, the amendment to clause 51, which was moved by the Under-Secretary, shows that the Government attempted to reflect on and react to the concerns expressed. With the benefit of hindsight, if the Government had been able to move the amendment earlier, they would probably have done so in relation to definitions. I suspect that the amendment had to be moved at that juncture because that was the point that had been reached.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The hon. Gentleman is right. If the Government would consider inserting the definition in clause 4, hon. Members on both sides might regard that as a clear statement of the Government's intentions to treat day care centres on the same basis as other establishments that are defined in this part of the Bill.
<P>
The hon. Member for Don Valley drew attention to another important matter&#151;the need to ensure that those who are rejected by the National Care Standards Commission because they are not suitable to run other regulated establishments are not allowed to move into the day care sector before the Bill is extended to regulate that area. The Minister assured us that that would not happen, and I waited to hear how that would be so. He then said that it would be achieved through the extension of the Bill to cover day care centres. Clearly, that is correct. However, the hon. Member for Don Valley was anxious about what might happen in the intervening period, which might be a couple of years. A clear and effective definition in the Bill would allow the Government to provide, in regulations, that a person who has managed or run an establishment that has had its registration withdrawn may not run a day care centre. I should have thought that it would be helpful for the Government to have that tool in their armoury so that regulations can refer to the definition in the Bill if necessary.
<P>
I am a little disappointed by what the Minister said, although I do not believe that we have a disagreement of principle in the Committee. I am also a little disappointed that he has not been able to take the matter a little further down the path commenced in the other place. As the amendments are technically defective, it would be appropriate to withdraw them now and return to the issue at a later stage in the Bill's consideration. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 103, in page 3, line 34, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>, where the parents are 18 years of age or over.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This is a simple probing amendment designed to inquire about the Government's intentions. A residential family centre is defined in the clause as an establishment at which
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>accommodation is provided for children and their parents,<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
at which
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the parents' capacity to respond to the children's needs and to safeguard their welfare is monitored or assessed<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and at which
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the parents are given such advice, guidance or counselling as is considered necessary.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The purpose of the amendment is simply to probe whether the Government regard the overriding consideration in defining an establishment as the relationship between the people involved or the age of the people involved. I do not claim to be a great expert on such matters&#151;other members of the Committee will have practical knowledge of such establishments&#151;but I understand that such centres often deal with teenage parents and their children.
<P>
In tabling amendment No. 103, which would define a residential family centre as an establishment in which the parents were aged 18 or over, I am merely trying to establish whether it is the Government's view that a centre in which families are accommodated and in which all members of the family are under 18 should be treated as a residential family centre or as a children's home. We need to explore that issue in order to discover whether the Government intend age or the relationship to be the defining criterion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> The amendment should not be agreed to. The argument advanced by the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge is interesting. It relates to one essential point&#151;whether such establishments should be registered as children's homes or, as we intend, residential family centres. Under the amendment, there would be a danger that such establishments might not be regulated as either a children's home or a residential family centre.
<P>
The essential issue is whether the child in such centres lives with or is accompanied by the parent or someone who has parental responsibility. If that is the case, such establishments will be different from children's homes, where the essential characteristic is that the child is not accompanied by the parent. With great respect, the argument that the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge advances about the age of the parent is not relevant. What should mark the distinction between a children's home and a residential family centre is whether the child is in the presence of or being accompanied by the person who has parental responsibility.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Does the Minister envisage that some establishments may fall to be registered as both, because they are residential family centres under the definition in the Bill but also provide accommodation wholly or mainly for children?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> The Bill is reasonably clear on that point. As there is no risk of a requirement to duplicate the registration process, we do not envisage a residential family centre also having to register as a children's home. I do not believe that that would add any substantive value to the process. The real issue is whether the child is accompanied by the parent and whether the parent lives with the child in the residential family centre.
<P>
<B>Mr. Shaw:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that the establishment must do what it is defined that it should do? The amendment might lead to inappropriate placements, which is exactly what we are trying to avoid.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> Mr hon. Friend is entirely right. We need to envisage how the regulatory arrangements will work. Although the registration process is important, it will be backed up by the national minimum required standards. Residential family centres and children's homes will have different national minimum required standards because they are different establishments. We need to ensure that there are proper safeguards and the process is properly regulated, which is not the case at the moment.
<P>
There are strong arguments in favour of not having an age-based definition of a parent for those purposes. It would add no value to the process. The crucial factor is whether children are in a centre with their parents. That makes it a different establishment from a children's home, in which children are on their own, without parental support or protection. I hope that I have reassured the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge.
<P>
The amendment would be unhelpful and run the risk of creating confusion. It would be unclear whether a centre was a children's home or a residential family centre. There is also the parallel danger that we would create the anomaly of establishments not registering as either a children's home or a residential family centre. That would be the worst of all worlds. I assure the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge that our intentions are noble. We want proper safeguards for children, but there is a difference between a children's home and a centre in which parents are with their children. The age-based distinction would add nothing of value.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I have achieved my purpose. The Minister&#151;I nearly said ``the management'', who I suspect are elsewhere&#151;clarified the Government's intentions. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 104, in page 4, line 2, leave out `disability' and insert `mental impairment'.
<P>
I must apologise to the Committee for the drafting error in the amendment which, once the Minister has spoken, I shall seek to withdraw. We did not intend to exclude disability from the definition.
<P>
The amendment returns to an issue that we raised on Tuesday in our debate on amendment No. 99. It would add ``mental impairment'' to the list of illness, infirmity or disability. The Minister told us that mental impairment is defined as an illness. That speaks for itself. No doubt he will say that amendment No. 104 is redundant because mental impairment&#151;a learning disability&#151;is covered by illness. I find that strange and disquieting. Having thought about the matter since Tuesday, I am not comfortable with the definition of illness including people with learning disabilities. I am sure that the Government intend to include people with learning disabilities, so has the Minister thought about that definition since Tuesday and is he comfortable with it?
<P>
I accepted on Tuesday, and I accept now, that because illness is defined as it is, the definition technically works because it is internally consistent. However, I am not comfortable with it, nor, I am sure, are some Labour Members who are interested in such matters.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge for spotting the technical deficiency in his amendment. That has saved me the time and trouble of pointing it out. The hon. Gentleman made a good point about the Bill's definitional provisions and his concerns are probably reflected in many quarters. In respect of the definition of domiciliary care agencies, there is a reference to agencies that provide personal care for people who, by reason of illness, infirmity or disability are unable to provide for themselves without assistance. In that context, the definition refers to disability and I hope that the hon. Gentleman is thus reassured.
<P>
Definitional clauses are, almost by definition, the most obscure part of the law-making process. Taking a circuitous route, the Bill includes the group about which the hon. Gentleman is especially concerned: those who suffer from a learning disability.
<P>
There is no argument about the Bill applying to people with a learning disability&#151;a point that the hon. Gentleman accepted in an earlier debate. I understand that he is anxious about the way in which the Bill has been put together; we have an open mind about whether it is possible to improve the way in which the Bill reads and we will think about the matter. At present, I am not persuaded that the Bill needs to be changed in that respect because the important thing is that it is inclusive.
<P>
<H5>10 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Caroline Flint:</B> Will my hon. Friend reflect on some of the terminology to which the amendment relates? In clause 100, there are interpretations of words such as ``illness'' and ``mental disorder''; the way in in which we define a person as being disabled&#151;from mental disability to mental impairment&#151;may have another definition in clause 2. There is cause for confusion in the way in which some of the terms are used. Will my hon. Friend consider how the terms might be made more coherent?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I heard myself tell the Committee that we would do that. My hon. Friend is right to raise anxieties; I made it clear that I share some of them, and those expressed by the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge. However, we should be clear before we make further progress that people with a learning disability fall within the scope of the Bill. We do not intend to be rude, to abuse or to be dismissive of those people or to misrepresent their condition in the Bill. If there is a sense in which we have done so, we shall consider the definitional clauses.
<P>
I stand to be corrected&#151;I am sure that it will be brought up later if I am wrong&#151;but I am not aware of having received representations on the matter by organisations outside the House, although I sense that I may become aware of them shortly if such representations have been made.
<P>
I hope that our proceedings are not manufacturing a problem that has not attracted the concern of outside organisations. However, we stand ready to change those parts of the Bill if the definitional clauses are not clear, if our tortuous path is a cause of confusion or if we have inadvertently offended people by the way in which we put the definitional clause together. As my hon. Friend the Member for Don Valley invited me to do in her intervention, we shall take another look at the proposal and tell the Committee or the House if the Bill needs to be changed in that respect.
<P>
I hope that the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge feels that he has made his point, that we have listened to his concerns and that he will not therefore press the amendment to a Division.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I thank the Minister for what he said. We accepted at the outset that, technically, he is right: the Bill includes the all the people that it should include, albeit, as the Minister admitted, by a tortuous route. I am not overly sensitive to the use of politically correct language but I felt very uncomfortable with the Bill's use of language, which does not accord with everyday terminology. The simple fact is that people suffering from a learning disability are not ill. As far as possible, in accordance with the rhetoric about the use of plain English in legislation, Bills should define terms as they really are and not use words such as ``illness'' when illness is not the issue.
<P>
There are parallels with the amendment tabled by Lord Rix in another place in respect of the use of the term ``suffering from'' disability. It has an unnecessarily pejorative implication which can be removed without changing the sense of the Bill. I hope, therefore, that the Minister will think about the matter, as he offered to do. Incidentally, the hon. Member for Don Valley pointed out that the Minister was not right when he said that there was a reference in the list to disability, which could also cover people who are mentally impaired. As the hon. Lady pointed out, in clause 100(2) there is a clear distinction between a person who is disabled and an adult who is mentally impaired. It is clearly not intended within the Bill's overall architectural structure that disability should embrace mental impairment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I certainly was not suggesting that the term ``disability'' included a learning disability; it clearly does not. My point was merely that the amendment would have removed the reference to disability altogether, and that would have unfortunate consequences.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> As the Minister knows, because I held my hands up earlier, that was a drafting error.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> It was quite an important one.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I accept that. It was a drafting error and, for that reason, I shall seek the Committee's leave to withdraw the amendment. I look forward to hearing from the Minister in due course whether he will address my qualms and the sense of unease of many members of the Committee about the use of language. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 20, in page 4, line 5, at end insert `, and approval of,'.
<P>
The amendment is a means of exploring how this part of the Bill will work in practice. I want to know the Government's attitude to the difference of approach to agencies such as Barnardo's when they carry out work for local authorities in respect of adoption and in respect of foster care. The matter was raised in briefing material sent to hon. Members before Second Reading and led to my tabling the amendment.
<P>
Clause 4 refers to the distinction between fostering agencies making placements under delegated powers from local authorities and voluntary organisations placing children in their own right. As I understand it, Barnardo's current fostering work is in the first category. Barnardo's has been frustrated by the problems generated by the regulations, published a couple of years ago, which cover its work. Barnardo's approves adoptive parents under the adoption agency regulations and the question is whether the Bill enables it to do the same in respect of foster carers. The amendment would ascertain whether the Government will allow such agencies to approve foster carers, within a properly regulated framework. The wording in the Bill as drafted does not seem to allow that and the amendment would widen the clause to enable them to do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam for drawing the matter to the Committee's attention. However, I remind him that the Bill is about the regulatory arrangements; it will not fundamentally change the definition of fostering agencies or any other terms and concepts about which he was concerned. It will simply provide, for the first time, a proper set of arrangements for regulating independent fostering agencies.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman made a fair point and I shall try to respond to the amendment, although it is strictly unnecessary because the current definition of the fostering agencies that are to be regulated by the commission covers what the amendment is designed to do. We support the amendment's intention, as fostering agencies that approve foster carers on behalf of local authorities need to be regulated, as they will be in future.
<P>
The amendment is not necessary because the current definition of fostering agencies, which relates to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>discharging functions of local authorities in conneciton with the placing of children with foster parents<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
includes functions relating to the approval of foster carers. There is no substance to the hon. Gentleman's concerns; the regulatory arrangements will apply to fostering agencies that approve foster carers for the purposes of fostering placements for local authorities. The regulatory arrangements are comprehensive; they include agencies that carry out either of the two functions to which he referred. Although he drew attention to an important issue, in practice I assure him that, with the Children Act 1989 and the regulations, the function falls within the definition of local authority functions and is therefore capable of being discharged by independent fostering agencies. It will therefore fall within the scope of the arrangements for regulating independent fostering agencies.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> That probably answers the question about which some outside the House were concerned. On that basis, and subject to any further feedback that I may receive, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 105, in page 4, line 9 after `Nurses', insert `and social care workers'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take the following amendments: Government amendment No. 43.
<P>
No. 3, in page 4, line 10, after `of', insert `care assistants and'.
<P>
No. 106, in page 4, line 11 at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>or of social care workers registered with the General Social Care Council or the Care Council for Wales.
<P>
No. 111, in page 4, line 34, at end insert `and social care workers'.
<P>
No. 28, in clause 51, page 24, line 22, at end insert&#151;
<P>
`(f) health care assistants registered with the United Kingdom Central Council for Nursing, Midwifery and Health Visitors.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The definition of ``nurses agency'' in subsection (5) was inserted in the Bill in the other place. Government amendment No. 43 will expand the definition of ``nurses agency'' to include health visitors and midwives. My amendments Nos. 105, 106 consequential amendment No. 111 and amendment No. 3 tabled by the hon. Members for Sutton and Cheam and for Isle of Wight would broaden the definition to include registered social care workers. That is a logical consequence of the Bill, which will create a system of registration of those engaged in social work with the General Social Care Council and its Welsh equivalent.
<P>
This will be a progressive process with a long time scale, which we shall debate in more detail later, and I do not suggest that it is appropriate to regulate an agency supplying unregistered care workers that would be impractical for all sorts of reasons. However, it is logical and internally consistent that, as a category or sub-group of care workers becomes liable to be registered, it would be appropriate to bring agencies supplying such a category or workers within the Bill. That is what the amendment is designed to achieve and the drafting of amendment No. 106, which refers specifically to care workers registered with the General Social Care Council or the Care Council for Wales, is intended to provide a self-regulating mechanism. It will not need further amendment or adjustment to the legislation as the rollout of registration of care workers progresses; it will be automatically self-regulating. As soon as a group is included within the registration requirements, agencies supplying that group or sub-group of people will automatically be included in the definition of a nurses and social care workers' agency. I cannot think of any argument against that, and I can usually think of arguments against something.
<P>
I hope that the Government will consider seriously the benefits of extending the definition of ``nurses agency'' beyond the scope of Government amendment No. 43, which we support, to embrace amendments No. 105, 106 and, in a spirit of cross-partisanship, amendment No. 3.
<P>
I am more confused by amendment No. 28; I may be misinformed, but the latest information that I have from the United Kingdom Central Council for Nursing, Midwifery and Health Visiting is that health care assistants cannot be registered with the UKCC; I am therefore not entirely sure that I understand the purpose of amendment No. 28, but no doubt the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam will explain it to the Committee. Perhaps with your permission, Mr. Gale, I will respond to the amendment when the hon. Gentleman has made his intention clear.
<P>
<H5>10.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> The hon. Gentleman says that, as part of the discipline that he applies to his amendments, he tries to game-play the possible lines of counter-attack that may be used to knock them down. The Minister has the benefit of substantial resources to carry out that exercise and identify the arguments that might be deployed; we shall undoubtedly hear some of them in a moment.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman is right; the amendments, especially amendments Nos. 106 and 105 and Government amendment No. 43, are about recognising that the definition as drafted is drawn too tightly and that it does not adequately deal with the circumstances in practice. Amendment No. 3 would add to the Bill a reference to care assistants. Many of the nursing agencies to which the definition applies use care assistants.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman gave an eloquent description of the mechanism that his amendments would put in place; once someone was included within the General Social Care Council it would automatically trigger his or her inclusion in the other part of the regulatory regime. On one level, that is an attractive argument, but on another&#151;it is my motivation for tabling amendment No. 3&#151;there may be a cause for concern that some of the people who provide care, whether it is home-based or in other settings, will be care assistant. Most care assistants are not currently trained and there is a question mark about the time scales over which the training will take place. In respect of residential care, that may take years; the Training Organisation for the Personal Social Services&#151;TOPSS&#151;strategy indicates that it is at least five years before a critical mass is reached. There is not yet a time scale for domiciliary care, so the hon. Gentleman's elegant structure will not necessarily afford protection for some years. The amendment attempts to encapsulate them now in the regulatory framework, because is it important to give confidence and reassurance to vulnerable people and those who care for them.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I understand the hon. Gentleman's argument. I drafted my amendments relatively tightly in the hope that the Minister would at least accept their principle. There are practical difficulties in including in the scope of subsection (5) people who are not required to be registered anywhere else and who thus do not have registered professional status. That would dilute the status of nursing and social care worker agencies.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I take the hon. Gentleman's point; I shall now address his question about the amendment to clause 51. When I looked again at the group of amendments, I asked why amendment No. 28 was included. I suppose that it is part of trying to ensure that the definitions are broad enough. The purpose of the amendment is to try to reflect the anxieties expressed in, I think, the briefing material from the Royal College of Nursing; I stand to be corrected on that when I refresh my memory on the briefing notes from Second Reading. My interpretation of those briefings, which led me to draft the amendment, may have been incorrect.
<P>
The purpose behind the amendment is to avoid overly burdensome duplication of different regimes of registration inspection. If someone is already registered under one system, it seems inappropriate for him to have to go through another system of registration. The amendment is designed to deal with that anxiety.
<P>
I felt that the matter would require a separate debate when we reached clause 51, but it is in that context that I tabled the amendment. If another regime provides the safeguard of registering people, it seems questionable whether, if they are shifting between social and health care, as health care assistants do, a separate General Social Care Council registration is necessary. That was the issue that I wanted to raise through the amendment.
<P>
Even if such a category is not currently registered by the United Kingdom Central Council for Nursing, Midwifery and Health Visiting, it is not inconceivable that it may be at some point. The amendment is designed to cover that eventuality and meet an anxiety about a grey area of staff who may move from providing care and support in medical health care settings to doing so in social care settings.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will allay the anxiety that motivated the amendment as well as anxieties about the absence in the clause of a reference to care assistants.
<P>
<B>Mr. Steve McCabe </B>(Birmingham, Hall Green): I should like clarification on a brief point that relates to Government amendment No. 43, under which, as I understand it, the Christian Science visiting nurse service will be caught. I wanted to check whether I am right in thinking that the service will be required to register and, if so , that despite having to register it will be able to continue its activities.
<P>
As I am sure that the Minister knows, the service is part of a benign Christian organisation that has existed for years, providing care homes and a visiting nurse service. People voluntary enter into arrangements with the organisation, which, I understand, relies exclusively on the power of prayer.
<P>
In the past, the organisation tended to be exempted from measures such as the nursing homes legislation of 1928 and the Registered Homes Act 1984. I understand that, although its care homes will be registered under the Bill, an assurance was given in the other place that separate regulation covering its care homes would be introduced to enable it to continue its activities as before. Will its visiting nurse service have similar freedom to continue its benign activities without being required to provide conventional medical treatment and the other services that will be required of other nursing agencies under the Bill?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> After I have explained to the Committee why we have tabled Government amendment No. 43, I shall refer to the comments of the hon. Members for Sutton and Cheam and for Runnymede and Weybridge and reassure my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Hall Green (Mr. McCabe) about the Christian Science nursing service to which he drew attention.
<P>
In considering the amendment and the wider debate involved, we should start from a simple proposition and recognise that the current regulatory system for nurses agencies is wholly inadequate. The Nurses Agencies Act 1957 is widely agreed to be ineffective. It offers little protection for users and none for nurses employed by nurses agencies. In addition, under the current system, regulation is patchy and inconsistent. Evidence clearly suggests that many local authorities are failing to carry out their duties effectively.
<P>
The Government originally proposed that nurses agencies should be brought within the remit of the Employment Agencies Act 1973, putting them on a level playing field with other types of employment agency, but without a system of registration and routine inspection.
<P>
We listened to worries raised about the need for effective registration to protect vulnerable people and concluded that a system that encompasses registration and routine inspection for nurses agencies was necessary. That is why the Government agreed that the National Care Standards Commission should regulate nurses agencies. Amendment No. 43 is needed to rectify a purely technical deficiency in clause 4(5), which the Government accepted when the Bill had its Third Reading in another place.
<P>
The purpose of the clause is to define nurses agencies, so that they are regulated properly by the commission. The amendment would ensure that it covers both employment agencies, as defined under the Employment Agencies Act 1973, which covers the supply of nurses and may include staff recruitment agencies or agencies providing an introduction service; it also covers employment businesses, again as defined under the 1973 Act that employ nurses who are supplied to the NHS, private hospitals, nursing homes and sometimes directly to patients in their own homes.
<P>
We shall, of course, be developing the necessary regulatory requirements and standards under which the commission will regulate nurses agencies. They will be developed in consultation with the agencies and other key stakeholders, and we fully expect qualified nurses to be involved in the commission's inspection work. I also expect the regulatory requirements applied by the commission to encompass the requirement for a qualified nurse to be in charge of the placement of nurses. That requirement is currently part of the Nurses Agencies Act 1957 and there is wide support for something similar under the new arrangements. Nurses agencies will come under the remit of the Employment Agencies Act 1973 as well as the commission. That would ensure that nurses no longer fall ouside the protections afforded to all other agency users. Although that means that nurses agencies will be subject to two separate sets of regulation, they will need to register only one with the National Care Standards Commission. We shall consider carefully the scope for dovetailing the roles of the commission and the Employment Service standards inspectorate and ensure that the two organisations work closely together under the new arrangements.
<P>
I am convinced that our proposals for nurses agencies will provide better protection for employers, for nurses engaged by agencies and vulnerable people, while also minimising the regulatory burden on businesses. The amendment would simply ensure that nurses agencies that are either employment agencies or employment businesses, as defined by the 1973 Act, are regulated by the commission. I am sure that the Committee agrees with the need to cover both types of business.
<P>
As for the specific worries raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Hall Green about the Christian Science visiting nursing services, the nurses who are currently provided by the service do not have medical training and are not registered with the UKCC. The visiting nursing service will not fall into the definition of a nurses agency and will not therefore be required to register as such with the National Care Standards Commission. Given that the Christian Science nurses provide skilled, physical care in addition to spiritual support and reassurance, it is possible that the service will fall within the definition of a domiciliary care agency. That is defined as an undertaking that consists of, or includes, arranging the provision of personal care in a person's home. I know that the Christian Science organisation is concerned about the requirement that its nurses might be compelled to provide purely medical care, which is not what they want to do. I hope that the Church of Christ Scientists will be happy with my reassurance that that will not be the case.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> As I listened to the Minister's explanation of amendment No. 43 to clause 4(5), I wondered whether clause 3 on domiciliary care agencies needed similar amending, as in some case they are employment agencies. If they are to be covered by the two regimes of the National Care Standards Commission and the Employment Service, will the Minister explain how the Government intend to ensure that they are not overburdened by such regulations?
<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> That is a fair point. The Bill does not need to be amended in the way that the hon. Gentleman suggests, because the existing legislation refers to the standards that employment agencies and businesses are required to provide under the 1973 Act. The definitions are substantially robust, so the point that he mentioned does not need tidying up.
<P>
I want to deal with amendments Nos. 3, 105, 106 and 101, which relate to nurses agencies. The four amendments would add care workers to the definition of staff supplied by those agencies. Amendment No. 3 uses the term ``care assistants'' and amendments Nos. 105, 106 and 111 the term ``social care workers'', which would cover any person who comes within the remit of the General Social Care Council. We appreciate the arguments for regulating agencies that supply care workers in a variety of settings. Subsection (5), which Government amendment No. 43 tidies up, requires nurses agencies to be regulated by the National Care Standards Commission. The Government amendment will define nurses agencies as employment agencies and as employment businesses, as both are defined in the 1973 Act for the supply of nurses. The Bill also requires domiciliary care agencies to be regulated by the commission.
<P>
Such agencies arrange the provision of personal care to people in their own homes. The staff providing that care could be described as care assistants, although that description will mean different things to different people. By that term we mean unqualified, non-professional staff; agencies supply such staff to look after people in their own homes are already covered by the legislation. Nurses agencies and domiciliary care agencies are major suppliers of staff and care for many vulnerable people. The commission will regulate them as part of a coherent policy of regulation of the mainstream care organisations. The Bill ensures that that will happen; there is considerable support for introducing the agencies from the start.
<P>
The Bill will also have the power to extend regulation to agencies supplying other groups of staff; the hon. Members for Sutton and Cheam and for Runnymede and Weybridge were concerned about that. We will do that through an amendment to clause 39, which we will table later and which will enable the commission's remit to be extended by regulations. It is not practically possible for the commission to regulate all those types of agencies straight away, or all the elements of an agency's business when they provide various types of staff.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The Minister is being slightly disingenuous. There will be no immediate additional work load on the commission because there will be no social care workers falling within the extended definition proposed by amendment No. 105. The process will be gradual, as the General Social Care Council kicks in and starts working.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I am not sure that that is the case. I will have to consider that argument in more detail, but it resembles the one that we have had about day care centres in that the functions of the commission must be developed appropriately. Before we extend the role of the commission in the way proposed by Opposition Members, we need to undertake a survey to establish the size and scope of its task. We must consider the costs involved and ensure that the commission is equipped with the necessary resources and staff to take on those potentially wide additional responsibilities.
<P>
The hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam may have been referring to the fact that some agencies operate as nurses agencies and domiciliary care agencies within the same business set-up. Those businesses may supply care assistants or other types of care workers to be employed in various settings including health care or social care. A nurses agency or a domiciliary care agency that has a wider type of operation and supplies care assistants as well as nurses or domiciliary care workers will be regulated by the commission. That regulation will, for the time being, formally apply to only that element of the business that relates to the supply of qualified nurses, midwives or domiciliary care workers&#151;whatever the case may be. The checks and assessment that the person who manages the business must undergo to achieve registration with the commission will weed out unsuitable persons from the wider operation of the business, including the supply of other care workers.
<P>
All employment agencies, supplying whatever type of staff, will come within the remit of the 1973 Act. That will apply to domiciliary care agencies. Nurses agencies have been exempt, but we are removing that exemption through clause 91. The 1973 Act provides a tough framework of protection for agency staff and those for whom they care. For example, the Act requires agencies to obtain sufficient information from workers and hirers to select suitable workers.
<P>
We are putting in place a coherent and robust yet flexible system of regulation of agencies, aimed at ensuring appropriate protection for people cared for by staff that they supply.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> Will the advisory group on the National Care Standards Commission&#151;I believe that it has been established but I do not know whether it has met&#151;be asked to report to the Minister about timetabling and the sequence in which different aspects of its remit will be brought on line? Although he is right that a comprehensive framework will be provided, it will understandably have many holes. Many people will want to know how those holes will be filled and in what order.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> In general terms, I can reassure the hon. Gentleman. The advisory group met yesterday. Its role is to advise the Government on all aspects of the commission's establishment. I am sure that it will have something to say about many issues.
<P>
I have heard some whispered comments from Opposition Members about loopholes. We should not lose sight of the fact that those gaps are in their system, not ours. We are putting in place a proper system of regulation and protection for vulnerable patients and users that was totally absent in the 18 or 20 years of Conservative government. We need some context on occasions such as this. We want to conduct our proceedings in a civilised and decent way, as I always try to do. However, many of my hon. Friends might find it cheeky to suggest that we are creating an ineffective regulatory arrangement. It is a vast improvement on the desultory efforts of the Conservatives, so let us have no more nonsense from them about that.
<P>
I hope that I have not fractured the consensus, which was cosy until now.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> You just might have done.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> Oh well. I think that we have the votes on that subject.
<P>
Amendment No. 28, which was tabled by the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam, is about health care assistants in the context of registration with the General Social Care Council. We shall have a chance to discuss that subject more later on.
<P>
The regulation of health care assistants is a subject for genuine and proper concern. The Government have repeatedly expressed our worry about the unsatisfactory state of affairs, as 80 per cent. of staff have few qualifications. The Government have commissioned a review from De Montfort university on the roles and responsibilities of support workers employed in health care settings. The review takes into account our proposals for social care staff as well; it is social care staff who lack qualifications, not health care staff, so I apologise. The review will shortly be completed, and we shall certainly consider its recommendations carefully.
<P>
Health support workers are not currently registered by the UKCC, but the amendment seems to assume that they will be in future. No decisions have yet been made about the regulation of health care assistants. We intend so far as possible, however, that the GSCC will not regulate staff such as nurses who are already regulated by other bodies. That would be unnecessary and wasteful duplication. It is likely that some health care assistants will be regulated by the GSCC when they are employed, for example, in nursing homes, which will come under the regulatory framework of the National Care Standards Commission.
<P>
I understand the concern that regulating health care assistants under a different system from that used for nurses may create difficulties in accountability. Therefore, the Bill provides for the Secretary of State to give directions to the councils on the exercise of their functions, which include co-operation with other public authorities in the United Kingdom. Close co-operation with the UKCC will be an essential part of the council's work.
<P>
I hope that I have reassured hon. Members, and that they will not press their amendments. For the sake of clarity, I should say that we intend to provide an effective and comprehensive framework of regulation to protect the public in all key areas. We are doing something original. There is therefore a coherent argument for introducing it in a proper sequence, which is what the Government have said that they will do, in the Bill and in the account they have given of our intentions in this place and elsewhere. We have set out a clear timetable and are clear in our purposes and objectives. I hope that I have made that clear this morning.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> On amendment No. 3, the Minister said&#151;in a reassuring way&#151;that those matters are encompassed within clause 4. When I have read the record, I will want to reflect further on whether that entirely addresses it. If there are any further points. I will raise them as written questions or at a later stage.
<P>
I am grateful to the Minister for going into some detail on how the Government plan to address the issues raised by amendment No. 105&#151;which I also find reassuring. He made comments that will address the concerns that have been drawn to my attention by people outside the Committee, on duplication of registration and questions of accountability between nurses and health care assistants. The Minister has gone a long way towards addressing those concerns and I hope that people are reassured.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Let us do the easy bit first. I was interested to hear what the Minister had to say about Government amendment No. 43. He gave a reassurance, which many people running registered nursing agencies will welcome, that he envisages that the regulations will require such agencies to have a qualified nurse in charge of placement. He chose his words carefully; what he said is not quite the same as saying that the person carrying on or managing an agency would have to be a qualified nurse. Can the Minister clarify that point, which is of concern outside?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> That is certainly something that we will look at as we develop the new national minimum standards. There will be consultation on the matter and if people feel strongly about it, we will obviously listen carefully to what they say.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for that. I know that bodies outside, who are concerned with those matters, will be pleased that the Committee has addressed that specific point.
<P>
On the Minister's comments about amendments Nos. 105 and 106, beneath the party political bluster there is an important point that we need to address. The Minister said that the Government are clear in their purpose that agencies providing social care workers will need, at the appropriate time&#151;which is not so far in the future&#151;to be regulated. The Minister said that there needs to be a proper sequence in introducing the National Care Standards Commission, to ensure that it is not overloaded at the outset. The Minister is essentially saying that he acknowledges that there will be a need to regulate agencies supplying social care workers, at least once they are registered, under the Bill. He knows that that requirement will be needed and yet he wants to rely on regulation-making powers to introduce the measures in due course, rather than placing that known requirement in the Bill and allowing proper parliamentary scrutiny.
<P>
That seems a million miles away from the Minister's argument at our previous sitting, in regard to clause 2(7), for a regulation-making power that would allow the Government to respond to a changing environment so that for example, we do not get stuck with a list of services in the Bill that cannot be changed without primary legislation. We all accept that, in a rapidly changing world, there has to be that flexibility, but it is a very different matter to say, ``I can now see exactly what will be required in five years' time; I know that the Bill will need a definition of a social care workers agency and I can see pretty clearly how it will work, but I will not put it in the Bill now. I will not have it scrutinised during the Bill's passage through Parliament. I will rely on a beefed-up clause 39 to give me the power to introduce those changes by regulation in the future.''
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
In response to my comment from a sedentary position, the Minister said, ``I think we have the votes.'' He does have the votes, and perhaps that breeds arrogance, because he can blast through what he likes. He can include in clause 39 the power to make regulations on any part of the Bill. However, as a matter of principle, if future need is clearly foreseen and can be covered in the Bill at this stage, that is greatly to be favoured. Amendments Nos. 105, 106 and 111 certainly would not do any harm and would provide a self-regulating mechanism for a rolling start-up, so that social care workers were automatically incorporated in the definition when they were registered. It is far preferable to keep the use of regulations for those matters on which we all acknowledge that changes mean that we cannot be certain about precisely what will be required and that the Government need flexibility, rather than delay and obfuscate on the ultimate form that is required.
<P>
There is no logical reason why the definition of a social care workers agency should not be in the Bill. I hope that the Minister will reflect on that, because in every other respect he does not disagree with the aim of the amendment. He acknowledges that there will be a need to regulate agencies that supply social care workers. From the Minister's tone, it is clear that he cannot concede the point immediately, but I hope that he will think carefully about it. I give notice that I shall try to return to the issue later to test again his reasons for rejecting such amendments. The Minister may find technical problems with the amendments, but the principle is important and we shall want to return to it. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 107, in page 4, line 12, leave out subsection (6).
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss amendment No. 18, in page 4, line 12, after `include', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>any undertaking which consists of or includes arrangements for the provision of personal care to persons receiving direct payments from local authorities, or.
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I am returning to a theme that we have discussed before. I am probing the Government by seeking to leave out subsection (6), which allows the Government by regulation to exclude from the definitions any establishment, undertaking or organisation. I instinctively dislike the ability to exclude specific establishments, enterprises and organisations from a general principle of law. I am not a lawyer, but it seems an important principle of public law not to allow too many situations in which individuals can, by regulation, be excluded from the scope of the law. That jars with me and strikes a discordant note.
<P>
Perhaps trying to rebuild consensus, I shall repeat that the Government have moved a long way in recognising the need for a level playing field, so that establishments that deliver a certain type of service are treated as equivalent, regardless of their background origins, ownership or control. I want to preserve that level playing field, so I am nervous about any provision that allows the Government to exclude specific establishments, undertakings or organisations. I would feel less comfortable if the subsection referred to any class of establishment, undertaking or organisation being excepted. In response to a similar point that I made on Tuesday, the Minister made it clear that he envisaged using a similar power to exclude not an individual organisation, but a class of organisation or establishment. If that is again his intention, why can the Bill not include such terminology? That would ensure that the regulations excluded a class of establishment rather than a specific establishment.
<P>
I cannot really comment on amendment No. 18, because I do not fully understand it. It appears to say that the Bill should not cover nurse agencies supplying care to people with disabilities who receive direct payments. I am sure that that is not the intention of the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam, so I hope that he will forgive me if I ask him questions after hearing him.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I am happy to explain amendment No. 18 to the hon. Gentleman and the rest of the Committee. I sometimes think that the Opposition should produce explanatory notes for their amendments, but we would require more resources to do that effectively. However, they might save some Committee time.
<P>
The amendment raises the issue of the role of direct payments and how they fit into a regulatory regime. Direct payments are meant to facilitate independence and empower individuals to make choices about their own lives and the tailoring of packages of care to their needs. A person might want to arrange care that a regulated agency does not provide. If that choice is not allowed, we cut into the question of what we mean by independence. Will that be constrained? Some people who advocate developing direct payments have expressed that concern to me.
<P>
If we are serious about operating direct payments and allowing the people who exercise their right to use direct payments to gain control over their lives and the way in which care is provided for them, some will feel that we cannot say to those people, ``You can have the money, but your choice is strictly limited to regulated bodies.'' I think that the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge is saying that, but I wait with bated breath to hear from him.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The hon. Gentleman seems to suggest that we should give people the money and say, ``You have the right to employ a UKCC-registered nurse from an agency that is not registered and not required to be registered under the Bill.'' I cannot believe that that is his intention.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> My intention, which I have just tried to explain to the hon. Gentleman, is to give individual service users the widest possible scope when they exercise their rights under the direct payments legislation to full control over whom to appoint. In a way, those users are their own regulators and inspectors. That is an essential element of independent living. People should knowingly be able to take an element of risk on themselves, because that is often what being independent means.
<P>
Perhaps the hon. Gentleman's interpretation of what the amendment would achieve is correct, but even if the amendment does not give full effect to my intention, it is clear in my mind, and I hope that I have explained it reasonably clearly to the Committee. The way in which the Bill operates could fetter the independence of an individual who opts for direct payments. I tabled the amendment to test the Government on that issue. Do they think that such a concern is legitimate? Will individuals' discretion in exercising their rights under the direct payments legislation be constrained? I look forward to hearing the Minister.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Now that I understand the hon. Gentleman's concerns&#151;and I know that he is well intentioned&#151;let me clarify our position. We advocate the maximum possible independence, but in health and social care matters we agree with the Government that independence must be exercised within a framework, for which the state is responsible, of ensuring the safety of available services. We review the Government's role in health and social care provision as number one&#151;ensuring the safety of services in the independent sector and the public sector, in circumstances where care is purchased for people or where they purchase it themselves.
<P>
I disagree with the hon. Gentleman that the point of promoting independent living is to require people to take on more risks. Rather, we seek an environment in which people can find a source of supply, knowing that it is properly, independently and effectively regulated, so that they can exercise their choice, taking other criteria into account, without having to worry about safety. Such is the environment that we seek, and it is the primary responsibility of the Secretary of State to deliver it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I do not want to dwell too much on amendment No. 107, which covers familiar ground. The hon. Gentleman said that he was averse to regulation-making powers. I said that even if the Bill were his, it would still have to use regulation-making powers in case of inadvertent errors in the Bill's definitions. Such powers are&#151;sad though it may be&#151;a necessary feature of effective and proper lawmaking. We must have powers to tidy up any inadvertent mistakes that may come to light in the future. Regulations provide the best way of correcting errors quickly, circumventing the problem&#151;faced by all Governments&#151;of finding time for primary legislation. In this particular sector, it is important to act quickly on unforeseen problems so that businesses do not have to face unreasonable and unnecessary burdens until Parliament can correct a mistake.
<P>
We have taken every effort to ensure that the definitions are sound, but some of the relevant establishments are being defined for the first time and there is always a risk of organisations that were not intended to be covered being brought inadvertently within the scope of the definitions. That may not be entirely satisfactory to the hon. Gentleman, but it is a justification for regulation-making powers. He and his hon. Friends are concerned about burdens on business; so are we, and this is the best way to ensure that any inadvertent burdens can be corrected quickly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Interestingly, the Minister has not repeated what he said on Tuesday&#151;that he did not envisage having to use the powers to deal with individual establishments, only with classes of establishment. That is my key concern. Does the Minister agree that it is generally inappropriate for regulations to target individual named establishments? Can he provide a reassurance that they will focus on only classes of establishment?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I was just about to give the hon. Gentleman that reassurance before he intervened. Yes, that is how we intend to use the regulation-making powers. Yes, we will have another look at the subsection to clarify that the drafting is satisfactory, but I believe that it is. I hope that the hon. Gentleman is reassured about our intentions and, more widely, about the need for the clause. It is not because we want to bypass the parliamentary process, but because we want to ensure that the legislation is effective.
<P>
Amendment No. 18 would have some pretty catastrophic consequences: I sense that the hon. Gentleman is just beginning to realise that himself. Let me spell some of them out. It would exclude from the Bill's definitions a range of organisations that we intend to regulate. Domiciliary care agencies, nursing agencies and others that had only a small contact with someone who is in receipt of a direct payment would be excluded from any regulation by the National Care Standards Commission.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I am sure that that was not the hon. Gentleman's intention in moving the amendment. He probably wanted a discussion on the relationship between direct payments and regulatory arrangements. His amendment is pretty gruesome in that sense. It would drive a coach and horses through the regulatory arrangements. I shall not develop that point. We have said what we think about that and we had better move on.
<P>
Many people who receive direct payments choose to become an employer and so employ their personal assistants directly themselves. That gives them maximum control over the support that they need. Often they will choose that option because they want to explore new ways of getting support. People in that situation will not be affected by the Bill, as regulation does not apply to individuals employed in that way. The hon. Gentleman can be assured that the Bill will not cut across the greater independence and choice that direct payments give to individuals. There will be a proper framework of regulation in relation to agencies and other establishments. Those who choose to employ personal assistants via a direct payments route will not find themselves subjected to any additional regulation as a consequence of the Bill. I hope that the hon. Gentleman is reassured by that and will not press his amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I am pleased that the Minister could reassert that the Government have no intention of using this provision to deal with individual establishments but rather to deal with classes of establishment. I am grateful to him for undertaking to look again at the phrasing of the Bill. If he could see his way to including the words ``class of'' so that the application was general rather than specific, it would relieve many of our concerns. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 44, in page 4, line 18, leave out subsections (8) and (9).
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 46 and 49.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> These amendments would introduce necessary provisions in respect of the registration of community funds provided by voluntary organisations. Before I explain why we wish to make these amendments to the Bill, it might be helpful if I provide a little background information about children's homes. The Children Act 1989 classifies children's homes as one of three main types. Private children's homes are those that are provided by private individuals or companies and run for profit. Voluntary children's homes are provided on a not-for-profit basis by voluntary organisations. The third type of home is the community home.
<P>
Community homes are the most numerous type of children's home and are classified by the Children Act as maintained, assisted, or controlled. Maintained community homes are provided by local authorities. Assisted and controlled community homes are provided by voluntary organisations but the local authority is represented on the body of managers responsible for running the home. One third of the representatives on the body of managers are provided by the local authority where the home is an assisted community home, and two thirds by the voluntary organisation that provides, manages, equips and maintains the home. The proportions are reversed when the home is a controlled community home.
<P>
We believe that anyone who sits on the body of managers should be subject to checks on their background in the same way as those who carry on, run or manage the homes from day to day. Those checks are a necessary part of ensuring that children living in such homes are safe from exposure to those whose past might indicate that they could harm a child.
<P>
The main purpose of amendment No. 49 is to bring the rather complicated management arrangements that apply to community homes provided by voluntary organisations within the new registration provisions. When those homes are required to register, the question arises as to who should be treated as ``carrying on'' the home and ``managing'' the home, to use the terminology of part II. Amendment No. 49 enables arrangements to be made&#151;if necessary on a home-by-home basis&#151;for designating who should be required to register. That provision enables the registration system to work effectively without unduly disturbing the management and governance systems that apply to community homes. Amendments Nos. 44 and 46 are simply tidying up amendments.
<P>
This is an important measure to ensure that community children's homes, like other children's homes, will be subject to the range of checks that are necessary for ensuring the safety and welfare of children. All of us must be confident that those who have a responsible role in relation to those homes are suitable persons to safeguard the interests of the vulnerable children in community homes. The amendments will ensure that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I would be grateful if the Minister would throw light on amendment No. 49, which inserts proposed new subsection (3A). If the voluntary organisation itself carries on the agency, what are the implications in law in relation to an unincorporated body? Who will be held responsible, who will be checked, whose background will be investigated and who will go to prison if one of the offences carrying a prison sentence is committed?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I will have to take proper legal advice on that matter. I am not sure that it is possible for a voluntary adoption agency to be an unincorporated body in the sense to which the hon. Gentleman refers. I think that that is covered by the regulations, and I shall check that. I am fairly sure that the regulations provide for that eventuality, as someone must be legally responsible. My understanding is that the regulations require the agency to be an incorporated entity.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Caroline Spelman </B>(Meriden): I seek a reassurance that when consortiums run a home, and several voluntary agencies are involved, the same loophole will not occur. There must be clear responsibility and accountability in such circumstances.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> Clause 15(2) may provide some reassurance. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> Regulations may provide that no application for registration under this Part may be made in respect of a fostering agency, or a voluntary adoption agency, which is an unincorporated body.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The issue is therefore addressed. The hon. Lady raised a specific point in relation to consortiums, and I shall ensure that she is provided with a technical answer.
<P>
<B>Mr. Julian Brazier </B>(Canterbury): I am anxious about volunteers who help out in ways that do not involve the direct control of the home, such as fund raising, cooking or organising treats. There is a growing tendency whereby people who give up their time on a limited basis, and who do not expect to take on significant legal responsibility, find that they are sucked into all kinds of legal duties of which they were not aware. How wide does the net of this complicated clause extend in relation to individual volunteers?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> With respect to the hon. Gentleman, who has a detailed knowledge of such matters, that is not the Government's intention. We are considering those who carry a legal responsibility for activities within homes. I am sure that the difficulty to which the hon. Gentleman refers can be avoided. The instrument of management will clearly set out who are the responsible people in a children's home. There is no danger of volunteers inadvertently being held responsible for actions over which they have no control.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Amendment made: No. 110, in page 4, line 34, leave out `nurses'' and insert `nurses'.&#151;[Mr. Hammond.]
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I wanted to raise a point that needs further exploration. In response to an intervention, the Minister touched on what I described at our previous sitting as hybrid establishments. By that, I mean ones that provided care or services that might fall into different categories. Two issues need clarification, so I should I like them to be set out clearly. If the Minister cannot give a precise response today, perhaps we could look forward to one in the not-too-distant future.
<P>
Will an establishment that provides services inside and outside the regulated scope of the Bill have all its services regulated? Will it be treated as a single entity? I imagine that the Minister will expect that the issue of two buildings on a single site will not arise because the establishment will be so defined as to include only buildings or premises that provide the registrable and regulated services. However, if the definition is not so easily made, and if regulated and unregulated services are provided side by side in the same building&#151;I have in mind an example from my constituency&#151;it will probably be necessary for all the activities to fall within the control of the National Care Standards Commission. I would be grateful if the Minister clarified that point.
<P>
A related point will arise later, but perhaps it would be sensible to make it now. Will the Minister assure us that, when an establishment clearly falls within more than one regulated category, it will be necessary for it to register only once? Surely it will not have to register three times because it happens to fall within three different definitions in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Shaw:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that one of the key aspects of dual registration for a residential home and a day centre on one site is whether non-residents&#151;people from their own homes&#151;come to the day centre? The crucial issue is about people who live in the community being cared for in the day centre by the residential home's staff.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The hon. Gentleman is right. If hon. Members think about specific examples, they will come up with all sorts of problems about precise definitions. It is tempting to think that there should be a hierarchy of registration, with heavily regulated establishments at the top and lightly regulated establishments lower down. If an establishment falls within two categories, perhaps it would be appropriate for it to register once at the higher of the applicable levels. I would not want the same establishment to have register three times, pay three fees and perhaps, absurdly, undergo three separate inspections. I am sure that that is not the Minister's intention, but I should be grateful if he would throw some light on the issue.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> This is a modest, but important, part of the Bill. It brings within the range of the services to be regulated, important new services that have not been regulated before. It will thereby begin to put in place a proper framwork of protection for people who, up until now, have not been confident that those services were properly inspected and registered. The clause should certainly form part of the Bill.
<P>
The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge raised the point about hybrid establishments and the possibility of dual registration. I will try to answer the questions briefly. It is difficult for me to predict and second-guess how the arrangements will work three, four, five or 10 years from now. These issues will always arise in any regulatory framework that the House would want to put in place. The crucial issues are partly factual, such as whether an establishment provides more than one type of service, as identified in the legislation.
<P>
Clearly, if we are talking about a registered care home that also provides a day centre that comes within the scope of the regulation, it might need to register in relation to both those services. Different national minimum required standards will be in place for those services. If the proprietor of a care home wants to provide a day centre for people such as those whom my hon. Friend the Member for Chatham and Aylesford described, who come from the local community to receive a range of services, those services should be regulated separately from the service that the proprietor provides as a registered care home owner. That is logical and sensible.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman is also trying to tease out of me some details about the national minimum required standards. That will have to be done on another occasion. We do not intend to provide an over-bureaucratic, heavy-handed form of regulation where that is not necessary. Clearly, if a person provides a range of different services, identified as separate services in the Bill, by definition a separate process of registration will be required for them. That is probably all that I can say about that today. I hope that the Committee will accept the clause. We have given reassurances this morning about our intentions and about the direction of travel. It is a modest, but nevertheless important part of the Bill.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> My brief point about the clause should be relatively uncontroversial. I note the asymmetry between the arrangements for England and Wales. In England the registration authority is a statutory body nad in Wals it is the legislature itself. That slightly odd arrangement sits rather uncomfortably with the overall architecture of the Bill. Clause 6 provides, in relation to England, that the commission shall exercise its functions in accordance with directions given by the Secretary of State. If the Welsh Assembly sought to mirror the English provisions, the registration authority would be required to exercise its functions in accordance with directions given to it by itself, which would be absurd. I cannot understand the logic of in England creating a statutory body that is at arm's length from the legislature and in Wales making the registration authority the legislature itself rather than a body created at arm's length from it. I should be grateful for an explanation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> Clause 5 is necessary because it establishes which authorities will be responsible for regulation in England and which in Wales. The hon. Gentleman is right to say that in England an independent body&#151;the National Care Standards Commission&#151;will be the registration authority. Consultation in Wales showed that a single all-Wales regulatory body should be set up as part of the Assembly rather than as an independent body. Consultation was 2 : 1 in favour of pursuing that course and, subsequently, that approach was endorsed by the National Assembly's Health and Social Services Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Was that option ever given to the people of England through consultation?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> We certainly spelled out our intentions when we published the social services White Paper in 1998, but it is a long time since I examined the responses. My recollection is that no one proposed that the Welsh arrangements should apply in England. That would be a bizarre way to proceed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I agree that that would be a bizarre way to proceed, but I do not understand why it would be bizarre in England, but not in Wales.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> Underlying the hon. Gentleman's concerns is the fact that Conservative Members do not understand what devolution is about. Devolution is about having different solutions and there is nothing wrong with that. The hon. Gentleman's proposal that the House should directly regulate care services is strange coming as it does from someone who is supposed to be against regulation and centralised government. His interpretation of events is itself bizarre. The answer to his question is simple: people in Wales want the system to be run in conformity to their different approach, and we should ensure that they are able to do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCabe:</B> I fully accept my hon. Friend's arguments about devolution, but has he considered the possibility of a dramatic shift in party power in Wales, which might enable the Welsh body to introduce a range of standards? What would be the position if the body in Wales dismembered the regulatory functions and standards, so that the Welsh circumstances were completely different from the English?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> Again, I would say that we live in a democracy. The people choose their representatives who, in turn, take decisions on the basis of their mandate from the people and are accountable to them for it. We cannot use legislation to bind future Parliaments. Doing so in the case of the National Assembly for Wales would be wholly outside the spirit of our devolution settlement, which is about improving democracy in all parts of the United Kingdom. Devolution is a fact of life and we all have to live with it, but it does not undermine the direction of travel that we shall take, our reason for doing so or the particular mechanisms that we put in place to deliver it.
<P>
The clause provides for different approaches in England and Wales, but only in terms of the constitution of the regulatory authority. The Bill's provisions&#151;regarding the scope and robustness of regulatory powers&#151;are otherwise entirely consistent in both countries. The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge made a legitimate point about devolution, but his concerns are underpinned by his dissatisfaction with our approach to it. The Bill allows for a different approach in Wales, as I have explained, and it is a matter for the hon. Gentleman to sort out his problems with it. Government Members are clear about where they stand.

<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 112, in page 5, line 1, leave out `a' and insert `an independent'.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> I am conscious of the fact that we have only a further minute. An important principle is at stake: we want to debate it, although not at unreasonable length. We want the Bill to proceed at the right pace.
<P>
I must make it clear from the outset that we are not opposed to the establishment of the National Care Standards Commission, but we want to debate the nature of that statutory body. We welcome the fact that some hitherto unregulated services, including local authorities' own care homes, children's homes and domiciliary care agencies will, as a result of the new commission, be regulated for the first time.
