Motion made, and Question proposed,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> That, during proceedings on the Commonwealth Development Corporation Bill [Lords], the Committee do meet on Tuesdays at half-past Ten o'clock and at half-past Four o'clock and on Thursdays at Nine o'clock and at half-past Four o'clock.&#151;[Clare Short.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Gary Streeter </B>(South-West Devon): May I begin by warmly welcoming you to the Chair, Mr. Maxton. It is the first time that I have been a member of a Committee under your chairmanship, and I look forward to your jurisdiction over the next few weeks. I am sorry that you will have such a troublesome Government Front Bench team, but I know that Conservative Members will be extremely well behaved and courteous throughout our proceedings.
<P>
It is important that we pass the sittings motion and are prepared to sit on Tuesdays and Thursdays to discuss the Bill, line by line. This is the first time since 1 May 1997 that I have been a member of a Standing Committee, but there seems to be a lot of them over there and not many of us over here. I wonder if the Committee Clerk has the numbers right; perhaps you can look into that, Mr. Maxton.
<P>
We must have ample time in which to scrutinise the Bill. At first sight, it appears to be a technical Bill. It is, in one sense, but what it will put in place causes us considerable concern. The measure has huge ramifications, and it is important that Parliament has the opportunity to study it. I am delighted that my hon. Friend the Member for Hertford and Stortford (Mr. Wells), the distinguished Chairman of the International Development Select Committee, is in our midst, because the Select Committee has taken a great interest in the privatisation of the Commonwealth Development Corporation. His wisdom and input into our proceedings will be important.
<P>
We are concerned about two key issues. As we said on Second Reading, we strongly support the Commonwealth Development Corporation and agree profoundly with its objectives when it was set up in 1948. Its purpose was to promote economic development in the countries in which it operated&#151;which then were mainly in the Commonwealth, but it has now spread its wings a little. We are worried that, under the Bill, the developmental objectives of the corporation&#151;[Interruption]&#151;a word from No. 10, I think&#151;might be left behind. The CDC, in its new guise, might slip the moorings of those important developmental objectives and its vital role of investing in pre-emerging markets that the whole House has supported for 50 years. We must have enough time to explore whether the Secretary of State, in putting together the Bill, has adequately secured the developmental objectives of the CDC that we want to see continued into the 21st century.
<P>
Our second concern is, as we lawyers say, in the alternative; it is an equal but opposite concern to that which I have already expressed. The step has been taken to create a third way company&#151;a public, private partnership. It is a Companies Act company and 75 per cent. of its shares will be owned by the private sector. It will be burdened with many regulations, obligations and Government controls. We want to examine whether the new creation will be of interest to the private sector. We want to explore who will invest in it and, given its strange make up, whether the Government are likely to get a fair price for it. It will be neither one thing nor the other. It will not be a private sector, fully fledged company, nor will it any longer be in the public sector. We want to probe whether taxpayers will receive a fair return on their investments over the past 50 years. We need adequate time to explore whether the Government have successfully found a third way for the Commonwealth Development Corporation. I do not think that they have, or that such a third way exists. I fear that the new CDC may be the worst of all worlds: it will attract little interest from the private sector and will therefore be undersold, but will be moved away from its developmental objectives over the next few years by shareholder pressure.
<P>
Having seen the tax amendments, I shall require the Government to assure us that the Bill has been considered carefully for hybridity. There must be sufficient time for us to be satisfied that a clear legal opinion on the Bill's hybrid status has been given to the Government, and that we find that opinion satisfactory. This a public sector Bill creating a private company that retains elements of public sector control but has a unique tax status. We shall need time to explore that issue over the coming weeks and months, as the Bill is complicated and technical. The fact that the tax amendments on which the Bill stands and falls were tabled only two days ago is not good enough. We are getting specialist advice on them, but it has left us short of time to do an adequate job.
<P>
There are a whole host of other issues that we want time to consider, such as what happens to existing guarantees and whether the Government intend to produce fresh ones, either when the CDC is a Companies Act company or when it has investors. Also, has risk passed from the public sector to the private sector under the Bill? Of course, we hope that the company succeeds, but if it goes horribly wrong in five or 10 years' time, do the Government intend to bail out private investors? We do not know such things at the moment, so a statement on risk would be extremely helpful. Is the Bill simply a way for the Chancellor to break his own spending rules, or is it a genuine attempt to find a new way forward on public-private partnerships?
<P>
We should like to hear more from the Government about when they intend to float the company, what their plans are about going to the market, and what advice they have received from experts on that subject. What price do they expect to achieve? We know that in their financial plans for the Department for International Development for the next few years, a sum of money has been allocated for the sale of the CDC, and we should like to hear what figures they have in mind.
<P>
How will the golden share be used? How does the Secretary of State intend to exercise her control in relation to the company? What will happen if it does something that she does not agree with, such as makes an investment that she profoundly feels is a mistake? Will she intervene, and what will happen if the other shareholders disagree with that? Have the Government considered the opportunity for litigation in that arena?
<P>
Some supporting documents suggest that the company will be able to borrow in the private capital markets after the Bill goes through. It can currently borrow from the Treasury at zero rates. We need to know more about its future borrowing intentions. As I suggested, we will have to examine in great detail the tax implications of the company. It is strange to take the significant step of suddenly producing amendments two days before a Standing Committee that will create, for the first time that I am aware of, a special tax status for one private-sector company that will make it unique in this country's legal history.
<P>
We shall also need to explore how the company will increase its return for investors from 7 per cent. or 8 per cent.&#151;or, in the past year, 0 per cent.&#151;to the sort of levels&#151;15 per cent. or 18 per cent.&#151;that private investors will expect.
<P>
If we can be satisfied on all those points, of course we shall support the Bill. We want the CDC to succeed, and we want private-sector investment in this important arena. We believe in the CDC and its vital role in investment in emerging and pre-emerging markets. We are worried, however, that the Government have not done their homework, that their thinking on the matter is not adequate and that they might not have found a new, third way forward but might achieve the worst of both worlds. As we proceed in exploring the Bill over the next few sittings, we hope that the Government will satisfy us that all our anxieties can be alleviated. We very much look forward to that.
<P>
I also hope that it will not only be Opposition Members and hon. Members on the Labour Front Bench who speak, but that contributions from some of the wise and experienced Labour Back-Benchers who are members of the Committee will help to enhance our proceedings. I know that you have no discretion in the matter, Mr. Maxton, but I hope that you will encourage them to make their own contributions as we proceed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bowen Wells </B>(Hertford and Stortford): It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Maxton, not only for personal reasons, because of your reputation as a strict and able Chairman and as a well-balanced and pleasant friend, but for a technical reason. I want to speak to the sittings motion to point out that you chaired one of the first Special Standing Committees&#151;a pre-legislative procedure with which we have been experimenting&#151;considering the Immigration and Asylum Bill, and the Select Committee on International Development recommended that this Bill be submitted through that procedure. Regrettably, the Government ignored that recommendation. The Bill lends itself to that procedure because it is not a political Bill in any sense of the word. I hope that we shall not conduct the Committee on a political basis, because our objective is to find the way forward for the CDC to succeed.
<P>
The Bill is rather technical and, in many ways unique, as my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Devon (Mr. Streeter) said. It contains unique tax provisions, and some onerous conditions attach to its articles of association and to the golden share. We must not approach the Bill as though the Committee were merely a cipher with no function. The Committee has a role to play&#151;to analyse the minutiae.
<P>
I am delighted that two other members of the International Development Committee are present. Like my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Devon, I hope that Labour Members will participate fully in the discussion. We all want to get the Bill right.
<P>
We must consider the Bill's unique features sensibly and line by line, and see how it fits together. If the Government feel that it will not work as they had hoped, I hope that they will feel able to introduce amendments to change it. We want the Bill to work properly.
<P>
The Bill was born out of the problem of the reducing aid budget under the previous Government, whom I supported. It was born because the development budget was shrinking, which created competition for funds between the CDC and the aid budget of the Overseas Development Agency, now the Department for International Development. The CDC was prevented from receiving any further funds from the aid budget, which raised the question of how it could borrow more money to continue its work. Under existing conditions, it could borrow only from the Treasury. Having to borrow in that way added to the great mythology of the statistical figure in which the Treasury enshrined the public sector borrowing requirement. If the Commonwealth Development Corporation had to borrow money from the PSBR, somehow the Government's macro-economic policy would fall apart. That is economic nonsense, but it is what we have had to put up with from economists who have been trained in this country and who get into the Treasury.
<P>
<H5>9.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The birth of the Bill came about in an effort to find a way in which the CDC could borrow from the private sector, which is outside Government official circles. More of the very excellent work of the CDC could be carried out in politically high-risk situations. Money could be borrowed and invested in capital and equity.
<P>
It will take us a great deal more time to examine the Bill than perhaps you, and the Clerk sitting beside you, have allowed in your diary, Mr. Maxton. The proposed legislation must be dealt with sensibly. If we are to release the CDC into the private sector, we must ensure that it can get the extra resources to expand into high-risk emerging markets and create in those markets something that has never been created before.
<P>
With those few opening remarks, I commend the sittings motion and the serious consideration that the Bill needs on Tuesday and Thursday mornings and afternoons for the foreseeable future.

<P>

<B>Dr. Jenny Tonge </B>(Richmond Park): I want to speak briefly on the Bill, but before doing so, I must protest&#151;not altogether mildly. I strongly support the hon. Member for South-West Devon who spoke about the tax proposals being tabled so late in the day. That aspect of the Bill is almost incomprehensible in any case&#151;it is not my background to consider such matters&#151;and two days is insufficient. I hope that we shall not have to discuss these proposals for a few days yet, so that we have time to consult and receive advice from colleagues.
<P>
There is a danger, if I speak for too long, of repeating my speech on Second Reading. I merely want to re-emphasise that I am still extremely concerned about whether the business principles of the CDC, which are excellent, and the investment policy, which seems to be excellent, are strongly enough bound into the Bill, so that they will always be adhered to. I am worried that the development principles of the CDC will be lost in the financial markets and the desire to get a good return for shareholders. We examined that aspect, in particular, in the Select Committee on International Development.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Cheryl Gillan </B>(Chesham and Amersham): I echo my hon. Friend's welcome to you as Chairman, Mr. Maxton, and I hope that the Committee behaves itself. I also welcome the Secretary of State to the Committee. It is a mark of the Bill's importance that she is here, and she is to be praised for that. I hope that she will stay throughout the Committee's sittings, apart from attending Cabinet meetings&#151;we can let her off for that&#151;when her hon. Friend the Under-Secretary will acquit himself ably&#151;[Interruption.] Damned with faint praise.
<P>
It is a serious point. I hope that the right hon. Lady will stay in Committee as much as she can because the Bill is significant. It has not escaped our notice that the Government have had a great deal of difficulty with it and that it has had a long gestation period&#151;since 7 December last year. As has been said by my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Devon and the hon. Member for Richmond Park (Dr. Tonge), who leads for the Liberal Democrats on this subject, eleventh hour amendments have been tabled, which is appalling. The Bill has been delayed and delayed.
<P>
Considering the history, as outlined by my hon. Friend the Member for Hertford and Stortford in his brief remarks on the sittings motion, it has become obvious that the position has changed radically since 1993, which I believe was the year of the last quinquennial review on the CDC. In the evidence given by the then Foreign Secretary, privatisation of any sort of the CDC was considered to be detrimental to its development, aims and objectives.
<P>
What hoops have the Department gone through? I hope that the Secretary of State will enlighten us about the difficulties in constructing the Bill. This is the first public-private sector partnership, as described by the Government. It is neither fish nor fowl stab at privatisation. We need to be enlightened line by line, to ensure that the Government get it right. Nobody will get any brownie points for the measure going down the pan. As the official Opposition, we would be panned if we failed to examine and challenge.
<P>
I can see that the Secretary of State will take that in the spirit that is intended. We will challenge because we genuinely want the Government to get it right. We have no intention of being obstructive, but we need to know what has changed in the advice that is being given to Ministers.
<P>
It is not a small or insignificant organisation&#151;quite the reverse. It is 50 years old; it has &#163;1.2 billion of investments in more than 400 businesses in 54 countries. It is a vast enterprise. It goes from St. Lucia to the Solomon Islands; from Mozambique to Malaysia. Many people depend on the CDC for their livelihoods, their operations and places of work. It will be too late to put the legislation right after it has been enacted.
<P>
The Government are putting up a ``for sale'' sign, which is an important issue. They are saying, ``Ethical investors wanted''. The key to success is to make that organisation attractive enough for investors to want to invest in the CDC. It is our duty to ask the questions that will expose the bones of the CDC to those investors, so that they consider it a company worth investing in. We do not want it to be sold off cheap, and we do not want it to fail. We must explore the CDC's ambitious financial objectives and the Government's plans for achieving them.
<P>
I do not want to delay the Committee. I support the sittings motion, and I hope that the Secretary of State will now reply to some of the issues that we have raised before she is forced to leave for another engagement.
<P>
<B>Sir David Madel </B>(South-West Bedfordshire): I shall be brief, as I am aware of the Secretary of State's timetable. I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Maxton, and I welcome the Secretary of State to the Committee. It is a mark of the seriousness of a Bill when the Secretary of State attends to pilot it through Committee.
<P>
I leave the Government with a thought on the question of whether this is a hybrid Bill. The definitive ruling was made by Mr. Speaker Hylton-Foster, who described a hybrid Bill
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``as a public Bill which affects a particular private interest in a manner different from the private interests of other persons or bodies of the same category or class.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The term ``or bodies'' applies in this Bill.
<P>
The Bill is unusual; it could be a hybrid Bill and I look to an explanation from the Government as we meander through Committee.
<P>
<B>The Secretary of State for International Development </B>(Clare Short): I am delighted to sit under your stewardship, Mr. Maxton&#151;there could be none finer. I hope that all the wise and fine members of the Committee will participate in our deliberations&#151;although I hope that none of us speak at unnecessary length. I agree with the message expressed in all the contributions of Opposition Members: we share the interest in getting this right. This is not a matter of crude party political difference. We are making a very important change and I hope that we will all work on getting it right. To follow the point raised by the hon. Member for Hertford and Stortford, if details emerge through our deliberations, we wish to improve them. We share the objective of making the change in the CDC sucessful; let us scrutinise whether we have got it right and modify things if necessary. I agree with the hon. Member for South-West Devon that we should take the time to do the job well; I hope that it is a matter of weeks, not months&#151;given the quality of intellects present in the Committee, I think that it will be. We can probably do the finest job necessary in a relatively short period, but which is sufficient to examine all the technical measures properly.
<P>
As everyone has said, the question is whether we are securing our development objectives properly. I say to the hon. Member for Hertford and Stortford that, whatever the history of previous Governments considering changes to the CDC, the Government&#151;and I as the relevant Secretary of State&#151;came to the matter afresh. As I said in my evidence to the Select Committee, I was not under any pressure for the matter to be solved in order to raise funding for the development budget. It was a question of considering whether the CDC was as good as it could be or whether we could use it to increase investment in the poorest countries in the world.
<P>
Our objective is genuinely to use the CDC's fine track record of investing in markets into which the private sector rarely goes. As the hon. Member for Hertford and Stortford knows better than anyone, the CDC is structured, as a public institution, not to compete with the private sector; it is expected to get a lower rate of return than that expected in the private sector. In some senses the CDC operates with one hand behind its back, almost as a last resort lender, being instructed to go into places the private sector will not go. However, while we want to support reforms in the relevant countries that invest in human development through education and health care, we also want to help countries create a more successful economic performance so that they have the growth necessary to reduce poverty. Such countries therefore need to be attractive destinations for private sector investment.
<P>
The question is whether the CDC could attract private sector investment, expanding its investments in those markets and bringing in private sector funds. More investment is in itself a good thing, but if in addition, private sector investment could achieve a decent rate of return in those countries, that would act as a bridge for other parts of the private sector to cross into them; CDC would prove that profitable investment is possible in those markets. That is why we have to give birth to a new creature. If we simply privatised the CDC, without imposing constraints on where it invested, the market would take it out of the poorest countries because no other investment organisation has a significant presence in those markets. We had to create something new, to enable us to stay in the places where the private sector tended not to go and get more investment into them. If we did not entrench the development objective, the normal forces of the market would in time have taken the CDC out of the poorest countries. So that is our objective, which a series of provisions in the Bill are intended to secure.
<P>
The hon. Member for Hertford and Stortford asked whether there was any danger of the CDC being oversold or undervalued. We must ensure that that does not happen. The indefinite retention of a 25 per cent. golden share means that the golden share on taxpayers' interest is not just a transitional interest to get the CDC privatised. We, as taxpayers, retain a substantial continuing interest in the CDC because we have an indefinite quarter stake in the company; we therefore have an interest in getting a decent rate of return from investments and do not want the CDC to underperform or undersell. At the same time, we do not have an interest in simply offloading the whole thing and getting some kind of return back into the Exchequer.
<P>
<H5>9.3 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I accept the criticism that the tax arrangements are late. How can I put this delicately? I am sure that all the Inland Revenue officials are extremely dedicated public servants with enormous, onerous responsibilities, but they are not the speediest officials in the public service. From the beginning, we made it clear that our objective was simply to secure a level playing field. Left to itself, the CDC would have to go offshore in order to compete with other investment companies for private sector funds, because of the different tax treatment there. That seems wrong, in practice and symbolically, and I was adamant that a major instrument of British development policy should not be headquartered offshore. I said when we discussed the matter that maybe we should have it in Africa and our advisers said, ``No way, you can't have it in Africa, the Cayman Islands, or wherever.'' They said we could put it in Ireland; it seems peculiar to suggest that a major instrument of British development policy should be headquartered there. Ireland is committed to development and its performance is becoming stronger and stronger.
<P>
We therefore wanted tax treatment for the unique body of the CDC which would not make it more privileged than other investment organisations but would put it in exactly the same position for tax purposes, which meant that it had to be headquartered in Britain. We made that objective clear in the House of Lords and on Second Reading. Now all the technical work has been done and approved by the necessary people, although I agree that the tax proposals have been tabled late&#151;they are covered only in clause 27, so we have some time&#151;and it is a case of examining the details. I shall provide to the Opposition, if they would like it, a detailed technical briefing. We could arrange that fairly soon and I hope that it helps. We can therefore look at the tax proposals properly and responsibly and make up a bit for their late tabling.
<P>
The hon. Member for South-West Devon asked about risk. Because we are retaining indefinitely the 25 per cent. share, any risk will be shared. Golden shares and Government holdings have often been transitory, but this is indefinite&#151;subject to future Governments or Parliaments wanting to do something different with the CDC, such as privatising it completely, although there would be difficulties in doing that, as our discussions will show. The question of when the corporation is to be floated depends on how rapidly we can restructure the balance sheet and get a track record with a good rate of return. The CDC is moving more into equity investment and less into lone investment because that increases its rate of return but also because it has the desirable quality of committing it to improving the management and capacity of companies; The CDC is not just taking a return on a loan but wants successful, creative companies. When it has that track record&#151;emerging markets are stabilising a bit, which is relevant to any proposals to float some or all of the 75 per cent. of CDC&#151;we can consider flotation. We want to get it right for the success of the company, for the return of the taxpayers' money and for responsible investors.
<P>
There is a sense in which the money that wil be generated from the CDC has already been discounted. The Government have agreed to the proposition so that when the return comes in it will go the the Exchequer. We already have the budgetary commitment to spend more of our GDP on overseas development, moving towards the 0.7 per cent. UN target and we do not have the pressure of having to raise money by a deadline so that we have to move at a time that is not necessarily best in terms of achieving our objective. That is important; it would be sad if we had to rush to do a less good job because we had to get the money into our budget in order to fulfil other commitments. We are not under that pressure.
<P>
The hon. Member for South-West Devon asked an important question on the use of the golden share. The hon. Member for Richmond Park, the Liberal Democrat spokesperson, asked about how the ethical code is to be incorporated. The public-private partnership has deliberately been incorporated into the Bill and its structures from the beginning so that that cannot be subject to political interference. Its make up will not be unpredictable for those who wish to invest in it. The golden share will exist from the beginning. Two directors will be appointed by the Secretary of State, but that is to install the ethical code and make it impossible to change it&#151;not that there will be a majority, which means that the board cannot be made to do things against its commercial interests.
<P>
The rules on investment in poor countries are entrenched and enforceable&#151;70 per cent. in poorer countries and 50 per cent. in Africa and south-east Asia. I shall put before the Committee a certain exchange of correspondence that will enforce those rules; it is another belt and braces provision. Nothing about the company will be unpredictable when investors buy into it. Nothing will depend on a Secretary of State's whimsical interference. The partnership, its behaviour, its ethical code and where it will invest will be entrenched in its structure, so that investors will know what kind of beast they are involved with. It will not be dependent on political decision making, which we are advised will make the corporation successful.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Streeter:</B> Let us forget countries and business principles. One of the key structures that has not been entrenched is the type of companies in which the new CDC will invest. What will happen if the Secretary of State is unhappy about the companies, although they are still within the 70 per cent. or 50 per cent. rule? The Bill does not set out the nature of the companies in which the CDC can invest.
<P>
<B>Clare Short:</B> We shall have an opportunity to return in detail to such matters. The ethical code is the entrenchment; there is then a ruling about no military or tobacco companies. Beyond that, the ethical code will be the responsibility of the board of the new company. That will avoid the position in which a particular Secretary of State might have a bugbear about certain matters as a result of which the likely rate of return could change and investors would not know about it. The ethical code will be reported on and interpreted by the board.
<P>
The Bill is not a hybrid, although given the different ways in which we first thought of proceeding, it could have involved hybridity. If, in a future Bill after the CDC had become a private company, the Government gave it tax advantages, it could become a hybrid, but at present it is not. We are making provisions for what will be a public body, even though Bill looks ahead to a time when it will be private. I am told that such a measure is well precedented in privatisation matters. The Committee may want to explore it, but obviously we have taken advice on the Bill and we are confident that it is not a hybrid.
<P>
The Chairman of the Select Committee said that the Bill was born out of the reducing aid budget&#151;of the past, I am happy to say. The original thinking about how to restructure the CDC and the worry that the reducing aid budget meant that there was less possibility of growth in investment may have led in the past to talk of the CDC being privatised or to keep it as it was. I genuinely believe that we have established something that is the best of both worlds. I assure the hon. Member for South-West Devon that the proposal was created not because of pressure, but from the challenge to have an investment organisation that proved that the poorest countries and poorest markets that are not attracting private sector investment can give a good rate of return and be attractive destinations for such investment. The CDC can be used as an instrument to expand investment and&#151;even more important&#151;to prove that such countries can give a good and reasonable rate of return. That would be a bridge for much bigger sums of private sector investment. That is our objective, and I think that the Committee shares it and wants to know whether we have secured it. We have not been dishonest for any ulterior purpose.
<P>
I say to the hon. Member for Richmond Park that I have apologised for the lateness of the tax proposals, but I hope that the thorough briefing will considerably make up for that. Everyone is welcome to attend that briefing, if they so wish including my hon. Friends.
<P>
The hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs. Gillan) was right to say that it had been suggested in the past that privatisation would be necessarily detrimental to the developmental objectives of CDC. I do not know what is going on between us; at Question Time yesterday and again today, I have found myself frequently agreeing with the official Opposition. It may be the weather. She is right that CDC would not be a developmental organisation under privatisation. Privatisation would not achieve the entrenchment of the ethical code or, more importantly, the requirement that 70 per cent. of the investment be in poor countries and 50 per cent. of the targets in sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia. Full privatisation would simply make CDC move as other investment companies move, seeing too high a risk in such markets and moving out of them.
<P>
The company is designed to be different and to achieve the objectives that I have set out. I welcome the fact that everyone has said that they hope that those objectives can be achieved and that the Committee's job is to scrutinise and test whether we have properly made arrangements to do so. I think that we are therefore agreed that if we are found to have secured our objectives, we will all support the Bill.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Resolved,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> That, during proceedings on the Commonwealth Development Corporation Bill [Lords], the Committee do meet on Tuesdays at half-past Ten o'clock and at half-past Four o'clock and on Thursdays at Nine o'clock and at half-past Four o'clock.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Gillan:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Maxton. The Secretary of State made a generous offer to provide a technical briefing to you and members of the Committee. Before she leaves the Room, will she suggest when, where and how contact will be made on that undertaking?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> That is not a point of order, but I am sure that the Secretary of State will respond.
<P>
<B>Clare Short:</B> I must attend a Cabinet Committee meeting on Kosovo and a Cabinet meeting but I intend to attend this Committee as much as I can, especially when it considers the tax proposals. In terms of the timing of the tax briefing, my officials are here&#151;
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> They are not here.
<P>
<B>Clare Short:</B> I become frustrated with the traditions of this place when something that everyone knows is true is not allowed to be true. There are people in close proximity to the Committee who could agree a date and time as soon as its deliberations come to an end. That could be fixed this morning.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that there is a financial resolution in connection with the Bill, copies of which are available in the Room. Also, adequate notice should be given of all amendments. As a general rule, neither I nor my co-Chairman intends to call starred amendments, including any that may be reached at an afternoon sitting.
<H4><center>Clause 1</center></H4>
<H4><center>Initial steps by Secretary of State</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<H5>9.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Streeter:</B> I have a few questions on clause 1 that link to something that was said earlier. If the Bill goes through the House, as I am sure it will once we have finished our important deliberations, a Companies Act company will be established. The clause deals with filing requirements&#151;which are all too familiar to me; when I had a proper job, I used to earn a living doing such work. In the phase before it is floated on the market, the company will become a Companies Act company, and the Government will hold all the shares. During that season, it will need to build up a track record, which will be important when it is floated on the market. We anticipate that the company will be in that season or phase for a year or two, or three, or perhaps even longer. It is hard to imagine it building up a track record that could last longer than two years, especially in the light of the past year's financial performance.
<P>
I should like to ask a few questions about the directors and shareholders mentioned in the clause. On filing day, who will the shareholders be? The Secretary of State? The Government? Who will the directors be? Will they be the same directors as now&#151;minus the managing director, who is resigning and going on to other, higher and better, things? Is the intention to introduce private-sector directors&#151;new ideas and new blood&#151;at that stage in the interim phase, or will the company continue under its existing arrangements? If the company is going to try to do what the Secretary of State has suggested, and move from loans to more of an equity base to sharpen its pencils and get ready for the sale of its shares, new blood would be a good idea.
<P>
In what state will the balance sheet be on filing day? Is the intention that filing day will coincide with a financial year end? Will it fall this calendar year, or as soon as the Bill is enacted? I understand if the Minister needs to await inspiration for some of those details, but I should like a little more information about who will run the company, how the company will establish a new track record, how it will look on filing day, who will be the shareholder and the state of the balance sheet.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wells:</B> As my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Devon suggests, the filing day is a matter of great importance. If the CDC is not to run down, when the Bill is enacted the Government must make up their mind to convert it as quickly as possible to a Companies Act company of which they hold all the shares&#151;that is how I understand it, but I should be grateful if the Minister would tell me if that will not be the case&#151;so that it can begin to acquire a track record in the private sector by operating as it will when shares are offered to private-sector investors.
<P>
As I understand the arcane Treasury rules governing such matters, if the entire company remains in Government hands, the CDC under Government ownership will remain unable to borrow on the private market, and will have to borrow from Treasury sources, involving all the folderol of macroeconomic problems. If such circumstances continue for any length of time, the corporation will not be operating as it will when its shares are owned by people other than the Government.
<P>
It is crucial that the Government consider the matter and decide what to do. For perhaps two to five years, the corporation would not be able to expand because the only money available to it would be self-generated funds and/or money that the Department for International Development invested from its budget. The Department could do that, although we should not explore that in debating this clause, as to do so would be out of order.
<P>
We must explore how that interim period will be handled. There is an alternative, to which my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Devon gave voice: that is, immediately to sell the shares to the private sector, and to dress the balance sheet ready for sale, thus putting the company in private-sector mode. I am certain that the company could be attractively sold to the private sector early on, without a track record. That implies that the Government would almost certainly have to sell the CDC at a discount. One thing that we have learnt from the Secretary of State this morning is that she does not wish to do that; she does not want to sell it off cheap. That is a dilemma that I want to explore with the Under-Secretary.

<P>

<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for International Development </B>(Mr. George Foulkes): As it is the first time that I have spoken in this Committee, may I also welcome your chairmanship, Mr. Maxton? I have a particular reason for doing so, having arrived in the House of Commons on the same day as you, and having served alongside you on a number of Committees and other bodies.
<P>
Of course we want to scrutinise the Bill fully, taking as long as is necessary, but if we take too long, as my hon. Friend the Member for Clydesbank and Milngavie (Mr. Worthington) suggested, we might have to meet in the Isle of Arran, rather than in London, to satisfy the requirements of the Chair.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Gillan:</B> That would be a good idea.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foulkes:</B> The hon. Lady is right&#151;it is an attractive thought. She has a Scottish background, which we appreciate.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I can assure the Under-Secretary that while he may wish the Committee to meet in the Isle of Arran, I have no wish to do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foulkes:</B> I suspect that you will have other things to do, Mr. Maxton.
<P>
Clauses 1 to 7 are all connected&#151;as, indeed, is most of the detail in schedules 1 and 2&#151;and describe the process by which the CDC will be transformed from a statutory corporation into a public limited company. We have chosen a novel way of doing that. Perhaps I Should say something about transformation and investing. Transformation involves converting the CDC from a statutory corporation to a public limited company, without bringing about any change in the CDC's legal identity. The reason for adopting that novel technique is because most of the CDC's assets are held in overseas jurisdictions, as the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham so graphically described in her alliterative list&#151;from St. Lucia to Singapore; from Barbados to the Bahamas; or whatever examples she used.
<P>
It is expected that no transfer of assets under the local private law of those jurisdictions will be necessary following the CDC's conversion to a plc, because its legal identity will not change as a result of the transformation. This is a novel and effective way of dealing with the matter. I hope that Opposition Members will agree.
<P>
The hon. Member for South-West Devon raised a number of important points.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wells:</B> I am sorry to interrupt the Under-Secretary, but on the point about the CDC remaining the same legal entity, does that mean that its assets and investments in the various countries overseas will be completely unaffected, and that they will not have to be transferred from the existing corporation to the new one on the vesting day? Is that therefore a legal means of transferring all the assets without having to go through a laborious process in each of the territories in which it invests?
<P>
<B>Mr. Foulkes:</B> With his usual expertise and intuition, the hon. Gentleman has worked out the position exactly, and that is why we are adopting it. Credit goes to our officials, CDC officials and others who have been involved in working out the best arrangements.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Gillan:</B> This may not be the place to ask this question, but the Under-Secretary is saying that the legal status will not change. What will happen if after filing day, and after the company has gone through the PPP process, an asset in a foreign country is nationalised?
<P>
<B>Mr. Foulkes:</B> That is an interesting hypothetical question. It is in order, because the hon. Lady was allowed to ask it, but it does not strictly come under this clause. However, as the hon. Lady has raised it, we shall see whether we can provide an answer at a later, more appropriate stage.
<P>
The CDC's board after transformation is an important matter. The current board is different from a normal Companies Act-type board, as there are no executive members. That will change at transformation. The CDC will have what might best be described as a Cadbury-style board&#151;Opposition Members will understand that&#151;with executive as well as non-executive members. The size of board under the draft articles that have been circulated will be from five to 15. We would expect it to be around 11, comprising six non-executive and five executive members. The six non-executive members will have private sector interests and involvement.
<P>
The Secretary of State will appoint the first board at transformation, and we will ensure that the board has the right mix of skills to take it forward. After that, directors will retire in rota in the normal way of a company. Detailed provisions are set out in the draft articles of association. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, as a special shareholder, will continue to appoint two directors, who will have a role in relation to the business principles and investment policy arrangements, to ensure that changes are not made without their agreement. As we consider their role, and the role of the special share, as well as the purpose of the investment policy, the Committee will realise why a PPP is very different from privatisation.
<P>
Of course, the two directors appointed by the Secretary of State, like all directors, will have to act in the company's interests. We shall be balancing continuity in the collective memory and understanding of the work of the corporation with new experience and skills. I hope that the Opposition will agree with that.
<P>
We are aiming for filing day to be later this year&#151;as soon as practicable, in fact&#151;but we have not fixed a date. Financial restructuring will happen after that. The shareholders will be the Secretary of State and a nominee. We shall discuss the balance sheet in more detail under clause 18. It will have share capital on the day of registration&#151;the day after filing day&#151;of at least &#163;50,000, and there will be further restructuring of the balance sheet soon afterwards.
<P>
On the question of interim period financing, which was raised by the hon. Member for Hertford and Stortford, there will be the internally generated funds, which I am pleased to report are growing. There will also be loans from the national loans board, which are equal to repayments, and access to private capital markets, which will be assessed on the grounds of value for money and in the context of the balance sheet restructuring. So there will be three areas of financing. I hope that I have answered the Opposition's questions.
<P>
<H5>10 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Streeter:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for his clear response. I forgot to ask him how the search for a new managing director was coming along. We have seen the advertisements in the newspapers and are tempted by the salary that is on offer. Will the new board of 11 and the Secretary of State's two appointees be in place on filing day and take the CDC into the new interim arrangement, or will that be the structure after private investment?
<P>
<B>Mr. Foulkes:</B> As to the search for the new managing director, the Secretary of State explained the position on Second Reading, but it bears repetition. The Government and the CDC are entirely happy with the record of Roy Reynolds. He has done an excellent job for the corporation, and has been helpful in preparing for the public-private partnership. It was his view and that of the board and the Government that, given his age and the uncertainty of the exact date of transfer to the public-private partnership, it would be better to start with a new managing director so that he or she could be in place during the transition period.
<P>
As well as advertising for a managing director, a firm of head hunters is involved&#151;a rather infelicitous title, particularly in Borneo&#151;[Interruption.] Perhaps that was not politically correct. We are endeavouring to ensure that we get the best person for the job. The salary seems attractive, certainly in relation to that received by members of the Committee, even Ministers, but in the private sector it strikes the right balance&#151;not too high to be criticised for being excessive, but high enough to get the right person. The Secretary of State's two appointees will be in place during the interim period and after the public-private partnership takes over, so there will be continuity during the whole process.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 1 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 2</center></H4>
<H4><center>Filing of documents</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Gillan:</B> The Under-Secretary was right to say that clauses 1 to 7 and the schedules are linked. Fortunately, we have the opportunity, given the Chairman's selection of amendments, to examine parts of the Bill individually, although I may stray into other clauses because they are interlinked. I hope that you will forgive me if I do that, Mr. Maxton, and call me to order. I have read that you have the reputation of being a Scottish werewolf. I hope that you do not have to show me your fangs. I shall try to remain in order.
<P>
I hope that the Under-Secretary will give us more detail about how the directors will be appointed by the Secretary of State. Will it be through the usual public appointments procedure? How will the posts be advertised? What mechanisms will the Secretary of State use to make those appointments?
<P>
As part of the provisions for registering the CDC as a plc, the clause places a burden on the CDC to deliver certain documents to the Registrar of Companies in England and Wales on the filing day, which as the Minister said is expected to be later this year. Those documents are listed in schedule 1, and contain few surprises. If my reading of schedule 1 is correct, it does not include the statement of business principles. I was surprised about that, given that it is such a pivotal part of the thrust of the Bill to hang CDC plc on the statement of business principles. Will the Minister comment on that?
<P>
We will have the memorandum and articles, the names of the directors, the secretary and the registered office, the accounts and the auditors' statements and a statement that CDC has adequate net assets. I am not an expert on the Companies Act 1985, but by hon. Friend the Member for South-West Devon used to make his living out of that Act, so if he wants to intervene I hope that he will do so. The filing requirements of the Companies Act 1985 have been followed quite closely, but there are some modifications due to the fact that this company is developing out of a public corporation.
<P>
The Bill contains a get-out clause. If the CDC is unable to state that it has adequate net assets, subsection (3) allows the Secretary of State to get out of providing the documents on the filing day. Before we proceed further, I hope that the Minister will tell us why he believes that provision to be necessary and in what circumstances the CDC may be unable to make the statement required by paragraph 6 of schedule 1. However unlikely it is that that would occur, it is considered a real enough threat to be covered by the legislation. Why should the Minister be given a second chance, and why has this provision been included?
<P>
With regard to the filing of the documents, the memorandum and articles of association have been provided to us, admirably drafted by Allen and Overy. Is that the final, final document, or will it be amended? Is the Minister satisfied with every dotted i and crossed t throughout the memorandum and articles of association? I had a quick look through them, and there are obviously some familiar parts, but they raise some questions. Will the Minister tell the Committee whether the CDC at present owns any patents and trade marks? Is a list of those patents and trade marks available? There is a provision under paragraph 12 of the memorandum concerning research and development. I am keen to know how the CDC stands at the moment, how it will stand during the transition period, and how it will stand when it becomes this new PPP vis-a-vis applications for grants to carry out research and development and any scientific research? What conflicts of interest might arise? How will CDC plc relate to government with regard to applications for Government grants or European grants? Can the Minister envisage any difficulties springing from this new type of company? What thinking has gone into that area?
<P>
Paragraph 23 deals with pension provisions. I hope that the Minister will give us a further and better explanation of how the staff will be treated. They will move from the public sector to the quasi-private sector, so they will be in a unique position. Pensions are a hot topic, and we need to explore the issue in great detail. I believe that there is an opportunity to discuss this later on in the Bill.

<P>

<B>Mr. Foulkes:</B> Yes.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Gillan:</B> The subject can be linked to the memorandum and articles of association at this stage. I hope that we can begin the dialogue under clause 2. The Minister could perhaps deal with it when we hit the other section of the Bill under which it is also appropriate to discuss these matters.
<P>
I share the concerns of the Minister and the Committee about the treatment of the staff, their terms and conditions, the way in which they are being kept informed of what is happening, what warning they will be given about the vesting day, what security will be given&#151;obviously, the transfer of undertakings procedures will apply&#151;and their pension provisions. Pension provisions are particularly important. I do not want to ruin the harmony in the Committee, but, as I have said before and I will say again, the Government's &#163;5 billion tax on pension funds has made Maxwell look like an amateur. We must ensure that we do not fall into any black holes over the pension provisions of the staff. That concern will be shared right across the board.
<P>
Article 52 of the articles of association deals with the statement of business principles and policies in so far as CDC will have such a statement. I asked the Minister whether that statement would be formalised under the clause. I hope that he will be able to tell us whether all the current businesses in which the CDC invests meet those principles, how they will be guaranteed to meet them, and what happens if they do not. What are the sanctions? Will there be a regular review of all businesses? How often will that review take place?
<P>
The statement of business principles and policies must be kept under review, not just the companies in which the CDC invests. How does the Minister envisage these business principles being changed and by whom? Will he talk the Committee through the process? How will it be triggered and could it lead to a change in the business principles that the Secretary of State has given us in draft form?
<P>
I have picked out only a few issues that the memorandum and articles of association raise. Article 94 comes to mind, because of my brief in the previous Government. Article 94(B)(ii) provides that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``any director of the age of 70 or over who would not otherwise be required to retire, must retire by rotation.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Roy Reynolds is retiring and the Minister mentioned his age. I want to know why that provision is included in article 94 of the memorandum and articles of association. I believe that it is ageism of the worst sort. What makes a man of 69 better than a man of 71? What makes a woman of 69 better than a woman of 71? I believe not in legislation to stamp out ageism, but in persuasion, and the Government should lead the way. Article 94 sets a very poor example to the rest of business and in the United Kingdom.
<P>
<H5>10.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
With the help of the Department for Education and Employment, I conducted a campaign started by my predecessor at that Department, Ann Widdecombe, to stamp out ageism. It was an educative campaign for employers and recruitment agencies. We stamped out ageism in Government Departments, and I had hoped that the Government would continue in that vein. I hope that the Minister will give very serious consideration to changing the clause and leading the way. It sends the wrong signals to the business community for a new Labour Government to convert the CDC to a new PPP under a clause that requires the compulsory resignation of directors when they reach 70.
<P>
Article 102, which sets the directors' fees, provides that the total fees paid to all the directors, excluding payments made under other provisions in the articles, must not exceed &#163;120,000 a year or a higher sum decided on by ordinary resolution at a general meeting. How was that figure arrived at? I realise that that is considerably less than Alun Michael is entitled to as a result of his four jobs, but it seems an arbitrary figure, picked out of the air&#151;
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Lady must refer to hon. Members by constituency, not by name.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Gillan:</B> I apologise, Mr. Maxton. I meant to say the Secretary of State for Wales, the right hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth (Mr. Michael), leader of the Welsh Assembly and possibly the new managing director of the CDC. As I was born in Llandaff, in Cardiff, I should have taken the opportunity to refer to the land of my birth. Just to make the Minister feel comfortable, I had a Scottish father. As I am pure Celt, the Minister does not frighten me.
<P>
I ask how the Minister arrived at the figure of &#163;120,000 a year purely out of interest. Salaries and directors' fees are a hot topic, and we would appreciate knowing the Department's thinking behind that figure.
<P>
I asked earlier about the two directors that the Secretary of State will appoint, and that point appears at the end of my notes. The Minister has assiduously written down the rather large number of questions with which I have bombarded him, and I hope that he will accept my apology for dwelling at length on the matter. I could probably have gone on for a lot longer. The memorandum and articles of association is a weightly document. However, as we shall have an opportunity to discuss some of the issues that it raises as we proceed, I have stuck to those points at this stage.
<P>
<B>Dr. Tonge:</B> I am worried about the relationship of the CDC's investment policy and statement of business principles to its structure. As the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham mentioned, pages 24 and 25 of the articles of association refer to the investment policy and the business principles. I do not know enough about company law to know whether those elements have to be filed on filing day with the articles of association to give them the standing that I require them to have. I am anxious that they should not be diluted, forgotten or sidelined on the way. It is important to make it clear whether those two elements of the articles of association should be filed on filing day&#151;if that is the correct term&#151;and written on tablets of stone at the start of the project.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foulkes:</B> I congratulate the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham on the ingenuity with which she raised a large number of questions under clause 2. It is astonishing and commendable that she has been able to do so. I shall try to answer them as fully as I can.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tony McWalter (Hemel Hempstead):</B> While I agree with the tone of my hon. Friend the Minister's comments, the memorandum and articles of association is an important document and I should like to associate myself with some of what was said by the Opposition. I do not think that it was filibustering.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foulkes</B><I> rose&#151;</I><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. If the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham had been filibustering, the Chairman would have called her to order.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foulkes:</B> My hon. Friend the Member for Hemel Hempstead (Mr. McWalter) perhaps misunderstood the import of what I said. I commended the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham because I was impressed by the range of valid and important points that she raised. She and the hon. Member for Richmond Park asked questions about the statement of business principles that has been circulated. Like the Government, they are acutely aware of the documents's importance. I did not intend to impute that, by raising such questions, they are not as enthusiastic about it as the Government. It is important to recognise that those involved in the CDC have been at the forefront of the large amount of discussion and thought that has gone into the document's production.
<P>
The hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham raised several questions. However important that we and the CDC think that the statement of business principles is, it is not a Companies Act document. Schedule 1 documents are therefore the only necessary documents for the CDC to become a plc.
<P>
<B>Dr. Tonge:</B> The Minister has answered part of my question. If the business principles are not legally required by the Companies Act 1985, how can they be made legally binding on the CDC so that it does not slip away from them and there is no deterioration of standards over time?
<P>
<B>Mr. Foulkes:</B> There is an obligation to have the statement of business principles in article 52 of the CDC articles of association, which is a required document. Article 52 entrenches one of the special shareholders' rights and cannot be altered without Parliament's consent. We shall deal with the subject on clause 18.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Gillan:</B> Article 52 states that the directors of the CDC will report a statement of business principles and policies each year. The Minister is right to say that it may be altered by Parliament only. However, it does not contain the statement of business principles. As the Government were creating this novel organisation in a fashion that has never existed before, there was an opportunity to take something that has been the bedrock and pillar of the process and enshrine it in the memorandum and articles of association. This is a long intervention and I can see you rising to your feet, Mr. Maxton. Will the Minister give me some idea of the thought process that went on, whether such a suggestion was considered at all or is completely off the wall?
<P>
<B>Mr. Foulkes:</B> Sometimes I am grateful for longer than normal interventions.
<P>
While the Government are a 100 per cent. shareholder in it, the CDC will adopt business principles, which cannot be changed without the agreement of the business sub-committee on which the Secretary of State's two directors sit. It is important to have not just a belt and braces approach but other safeguards. We have the golden share, the 25 per cent. shareholding, the two directors, the statement of investment policy, the statement of business principles and the memorandum and articles of association. We therefore have six elements tying the CDC.
<P>
The CDC is moving in the same direction as us. If the Opposition want us to investigate whether there is a way of incorporating the statement of business principles more firmly and deeply, I will undertake to do so and report back on whether that is necessary or possible. That is a genuine, sincere offer to the Committee.

<P>

<B>Mr. Streeter:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for giving way and for the spirit in which he approaches the issue. However, I was concerned about his assertion that the statement of business principles could not be changed without the approval of the business sub-committee on which the two appointees of the Secretary of State sit. I think that I am right in saying that the sub-committee of the board of directors has no status whatever in law. That decision would therefore have to be made by a board of directors, the shareholders generally or the golden shareholder. Could the Minister confirm that the business principles could be changed not by decision of the sub-commitee, but of the whole board&#151;on which the two appointees would of course be in a minority?
<P>
<B>Mr. Foulkes:</B> The hon. Gentleman is right. The board has the ultimate responsibility. However, the business principles sub-committee would review the matter regularly and make recommendations to the board.
<P>
Safeguards are in place. I have given the Committee the undertaking that we will consider whether incorporating a statement of business principles would be necessary or helpful and whether, if it is, there is a mechanism for doing so. I hope that that is helpful to all members of the Committee, including my hon. Friends.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Gillan:</B> I, and I am sure all members of the Committee&#151;and potential investors&#151;am most grateful for that offer. We do not at this stage know whether those changes would be of benefit to the new CDC plc but if it is, we would like them to be made, particularly if that gives heart to potential investors that there is less scope for the new organisation to be changed willy-nilly. When the Minister referred to the sub-committee, I and my hon. Friends were getting very worried because the Secretary of State had said earlier that there would be no adverse Government interference in CDC plc.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foulkes:</B> Perhaps I should move on, because we can come back to that issue later. I am grateful for the points made by the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham.
<P>
The Lady also raised a specific point on clause 2(3), which deals with what will happen if the CDC is unable to make

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the statement required by paragraph 6 of Schedule 1 on the filing day''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That eventuality is unlikely to occur but legisilation needs to deal with every eventuality. That is why that is included.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Gillan:</B> How unlikely is it to occur?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> That was one of the shorter interventions.
<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Foulkes:</B> It was short, but it is difficult to answer.
<P>
It is impossible to predict the likelihood of such an eventuality. When drafting legislation&#151;this point will come up later when we discuss the tax aspects&#151;provisions must cover every eventuality, however unlikely. The Government and our excellent parliamentary counsel and officers try to ensure that all eventualities are covered.
<P>
The hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham referred to executive members. We expect there to be five senior CDC executives on the board, including the new chief executive. As for the non-executives, we expect Lord Cairns, who is the chairman of CDC and well-respected in the City, to continue to serve after the transformation. We shall then consider what new non-executive directors should be appointed, and look for the right people in the usual way undertaken by the Government. Members of Parliament and Members of the Welsh Assembly, the Northern Ireland Assembly and the Scottish Parliament are ineligible to serve as directors, so if the hon. Lady were considering an appointment to the board of the CDC, she would have to give up her seat in Chesham and Amersham.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Gillan:</B> I have no intention of giving up my seat. Will the Under-Secretary clarify whether Members of the Welsh Assembly are excluded from such appointments? I thought that they could take up such jobs. It is not that I am looking for another job for the Secretary of State for Wales, the right hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth (Mr. Michael), but I think that the hon. Gentleman got it wrong.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foulkes:</B> The Bill makes provision for disqualification from membership of the Northern Ireland Assembly by amending the Northern Ireland Assembly Disqualification Act 1975. Section 36 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998 refers back to that Act. The Bill does not make provision for disqualification from the Scottish Parliament or the Welsh Assembly because the Government of Wales Act 1998 and the Scotland Act 1998 themselves make general provision about disqualification&#151;for example, the disqualification of judges, civil servants and service men. Any specific disqualifaction, such as disqualifying the holders of certain offices, are to be specified by Order in Council under section 12 of the Government of Wales Act and section 15 of the Scotland Act. Directors of the CDC appointed by the Secretary of State would fall into the latter category. I hope that I have clarified the position.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Gillan:</B> I understand from the Under-Secretary's response that Members of the Welsh Assembly, the Scottish Parliament, the Northern Ireland Assembly, the European Parliament and the House of Commons cannot be directors.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foulkes:</B> I have yet to check the position of Members of the European Parliament, so I shall come back to the hon. Lady about that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wells:</B> Is it not the case that Members of Parliament at Westminster are ineligible to serve on the present CDC board because they are in receipt of money or, to use the right term, profit under the Crown? Therefore, the Bill will be continuing current practice.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman is anticipating a later clause, which refers specifically to disqualification.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foulkes:</B> I am doubly grateful, Mr. Maxton. We shall have all the answers when we reach that part of the Bill.
<P>
The hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham asked a question about directors aged 70. The memorandum and articles of association are important, as she and my hon. Friend the Member for Hemel Hempstead said, but I would be deceiving the Committee if I said that I knew every dot and comma of the document's 64 pages. However, I shall do my best to deal with the specific points that have been raised.
<P>
I have sympathy with the comments of the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham. I worked for Age Concern Scotland before coming to the House of Commons 20 years ago&#151;I am now beginning to feel that I shall soon be one of my former employer's clients&#151;and I introduced a ten-minute Bill on ageism. Articles 94 and 88 state that 70-year-old directors can be reappointed, but a balance must be struck on the age at which directors can continue to serve. All of us who have been involved in organisations that have no upper age limit, and no opportunity to reappoint people, know that that can sometimes create difficulties.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Gillan:</B> I thank that Under-Secretary for giving way, and hope that I can help. I am really disappointed with his answer, as many others will be both inside and outside the Committee. The Government have an opportunity to put their money where their mouth is. The tokenism towards wiping out ageism is reflected in the fact that article 88 is being left in the memorandum and articles of association for CDC plc. Will the Minister undertake to reconsider the matter? I do not want a decision now, but I wonder whether he can discuss it and accept our small suggestion. I had seen article 88, but I did not think that it was good enough.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foulkes:</B> The hon. Lady presses me hard on this matter, which I understand. She will know that there are various provisions in all sorts of memorandum and articles for all sorts of companies. There are age provisions covering the appointment of justices of the peace and other public appointments that have persisted for a long time. The previous Government did not do much about that either. I met with grave resistance whenever I raised the matter.
<P>
However, to show that we are different from the previous Government, I undertake to look at the matter again to see whether changes can be made in the light of the representations of the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham. I hope that my hon. Friends will agree that that is a more positive approach than that of the previous Government. We are at least willing to consider the issue. The hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham and I have been involved in campaigns together on this matter.
<P>
I turn now to directors' fees. We might have to declare a vested interest at some point. I am referring to the fees of non-executive directors, which are &#163;30,000 for the chair, &#163;10,000 for the deputy and &#163;7,500 for other members, taking account of the fact that there will be seven other members. The total number board members has not yet been fixed, but we will be reviewing its size and composition at transformation. We want to ensure that, unlike privatisation, the creation of a public-private partnership, especially in an area of development, does not involve any of the non-executive directors getting what was described as fat-cat salaries under the previous Government. That would be entirely inappropriate and it will not happen.
<P>
Although the Secretary of State for Wales may be entitled to more than one salary, he does not take up that entitlement.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wells:</B> Will the Minister confirm that, under the Companies Act 1985, the memorandum and articles of association that will be filed under this clause, cannot be changed, except with the agreement of more than 75 per cent. of the shareholders? As the Government will hold about 25 or 30 per cent. of the shares at all stages, the memorandum and articles of association cannot be changed without the Government voting for that change. Therefore, the business principles in article 52 of the memorandum and articles cannot be changed either, except with the agreement of the Government shareholders in the corporation.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Foulkes:</B> That is a very interesting question posed by the hon. Gentleman, who I am always in danger of calling my hon. Friend for all sorts of reasons. Like you and I, Mr. Maxton, he came to the House in 1979, and we have survived together.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman said correctly that 75 per cent. of shareholders must agree to a change in the memorandum and articles, so it is important that the Government's share must be set at 25 per cent. to give us the power&#151;I talked earlier about belt and braces&#151;or blocking percentage. The hon. Gentleman asked whether that blocking percentage relates to the statement of business principles as well. I should think that is the case, but I shall return to that later. He has raised an important point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wells:</B> The business principles may be capable of being changed by the board, which would be subject to majority voting. How can we be certain that the business principles have been carried out for all the investments made in the CDC? What will happen when the CDC invests in, say, a company in Pakistan, when the business principles of the majority of the shareholders are very different from those held by the minority?
<P>
<B>Mr. Foulkes:</B> I said that we would return to the statement of business principles and I undertook to look at the issue. My understanding is the same as the hon. Gentleman's that the board will make the decision, rather than the shareholders, but I can check that to be sure. I said earlier that we would consider whether that matter needs to be further entrenched and, if so, what the mechanism should be. It may be that the shareholders should make that decision.
<P>
With regard to subsidiaries, the CDC aims to ensure that all subsidiaries implement the business principles and that it will continue to use its position to influence companies to adopt such business principles. It will be involved in shifting companies in which they become involved towards full implementation. It can disinvest if the companies do not achieve what the CDC wishes. There cannot be total control without a majority shareholding, but the CDC can have some influence in those subsidiary companies.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Gillan:</B> I asked whether all the current businesses observed the principles. Does the Under-Secretary have an estimate of whether the figure is 100 per cent. or 80 per cent? What efforts are being made to ensure that all the companies in which the CDC invests accept the business principles, prior to the changeover.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foulkes:</B> Perhaps I could come back to the hon. Lady on that wide question. In her eloquent opening speech, she described the wide range of countries and enterprises in which the CDC is involved&#151;a topic to which we shall return in later discussions. It is difficult to say off the top of my head whether the range of companies and investments in which the CDC is involved accept all the business principles. I would have thought that unlikely. However, we are moving in the right direction by adopting, discussing and pressing ahead with the principles, in regard to companies in which the CDC has not just a control but a shareholding.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I think that I am getting to the end of the hon. Lady's detailed questions&#151;
<P>
<B>Mr. Dennis Turner </B>(Wolverhampton, South-East): Hear, hear.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foulkes:</B> My hon. Friend is grateful for that.
<P>
The hon. Lady asked whether the memorandum and articles of association would change substantially and whether they were written in tablets of stone. We do not expect the substance to change substantially but we will review the memorandum and articles of association. After all, the Opposition said at the start that they want the Committee to do real work. If members of the Committee raise points about the memorandum and articles of association, we obviously want to take account of them. If any amendments are accepted, I undertake that the Government will put the revised version of the legislation in the Libraries of both Houses.
<P>
The hon. Lady asked a question on staff transfer. Because the legal entity and persona of the company is not changing, the transfer of undertakings provisions do not apply. I may be anticipating the debate on clause 5 if I say that CDC staff are not presently Crown servants and will not transfer from the public to the private sector. I alert the Opposition in advance that their amendment on that is therefore unnecessary.
<P>
I hope that I have dealt adequately with the hon. Lady's detailed, important questions. The Committee stage gives us the opportunity to go through the Bill point by point and enables the Opposition to ask and the Government to answer questions. I hope that we do not need a long stand part debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. McWalter:</B> I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will forgive me if I ask a question on a matter that confuses me. Subsection (3) refers to the eventuality of the corporation failing in its duty to make the statement required by paragraph 6 of schedule 1&#151;which deals with asset values&#151;on filing day. Paragraph 6 of schedule 1 refers to the eventuality of the corporation not giving notice
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``of intention to carry on business as an investment company under section 266 of the Companies Act 1985.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
However, Government amendment No. 11 suggests that there will be a registration as an investment company, albeit in a slightly strange form, under section 266 of the Companies Act 1985. I do not want to suggest that that is inconsistent, but the matter is getting a little labyrinthine and I would like clarification.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Gillan:</B> I thank the Minister for his tour de force in answering my questions; I want to give credit where it is due because he has tried hard to satisfy me on some of the points I raised. Sadly, however, he missed out a couple of points&#151;unless my ears were closed when he was speaking&#151;and I hope that he will respond to them at some time.
<P>
The Minister did not respond to my question about patents and trade marks. It is also important to consider how applications for grants at EC or Government level might be affected by the strange nature of the new company and the conflicts of interests that might arise from it. I hope that the Minister will have an opportunity to speak about that.
<P>
I am still worried about the business principles, which I am not sure have been totally thought through. That is not a criticism; the Minister and his officials are dealing with a highly complex process, and I take my hat off to them for having got so far. However, I am worried because there will be a statement of business principles on which the future CDC plc will hang its hat and go to the market, but the Minister cannot tell me what proportion of businesses in which the CDC currently invests meets those business principles. As a potential investor, I would be extremely worried to hear that the ultimate sanction on current investment businesses would be to disinvest from them, as I would not know what I was investing in. There could be a moving target of gargantuan proportions, especially as the vesting day is supposed to be later in the year, which goes against the timetable.
<P>
I think that there is only a small number and not a great pool of ethical investors. Only a certain type of investor will look at the CDC and CDC plc, and I want to ensure that it is as attractive as possible. There will be a disincentive for investors unless the Minister gives us a further assurance that there has been an audit of the current investment programme and that current investments meet the business principles. He should give us a definite idea of what percentage of businesses in which CDC invests could transgress at the time of the change over.
<P>
I understand the Minister's point about the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 1981, and would be interested in more details of the pension provisions and terms and conditions. He may be right in that the matter will be raised at another level, but I shall simply put down that marker.
<P>
I am grateful that the Minister will reconsider the cut-off at age 70, which I feel passionately about. He has the opportunity to do something about it, and I would see it as a triumph for the Opposition, not as a loss of face for him, if he had a mind open enough to deal with this ageism after we raised the subject. It is a small point of little substance concerning the Bill itself, but it would be an important signal if we could show the way as a team across the Committee on international development matters. I hope that he will move on that significant issue, however far from our main business it may be, and I would be personally grateful were he to respond to my request.
<P>
I have no more to add at this stage, other than that I hope that the Minister will have the opportunity to speak about my point on grants, trade marks and patents. I have no intention of dividing the Committee on the clause, and I look forward to the Minister's response on the matters that he said he would look into before our next sitting.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foulkes:</B> First, I shall deal with the important point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Hemel Hempstead. The working assumption all along has been that the time of registration is based on ignoring the special provision about finance that applies to investment groups only.
<P>
<B>Mr. McWalter:</B> That is why I said that it is not inconsistent.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foulkes:</B> The hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham asked about patents, trade marks and applications for grants, and wanted to know how many companies do not meet the business principles. We shall answer those questions as quickly as possible, and shall aim to do so before our next sitting. We shall arrange for any information sent to the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham to be sent also to other members of the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Gillan:</B> I should be pleased if the Minister would ensure that all members of the Committee have access to the same information as I shall have.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Foulkes:</B> I am slightly worried by the general tenor of the remarks that the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham made about the statement of business principles and policies. It is right that the CDC has been involved in this issue, which has been the subject of a 15-month consultation process, and details of the principles have been sent to all members of the Committee. Paragraph 9 of the introduction statement of business principles and policies, which was sent to all members of the Committee and which the hon. Lady has no doubt read, states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Where CDC has control of the business concerned, its responsibilities are clear. Where CDC, as a direct investor or investor through a financial intermediary, does not have control of the underlying company or business activity, it will seek to encourage compliance with similar business principles and policies. Where necessary, CDC will work with the local management concerned to achieve compliance over a reasonable time-frame. CDC may seek to withdraw from an investment if it considers that the measures necessary to achieve compliance are not being taken. CDC will aim to ensure that the sponsors of any business in which it invests subscribe to business principles and policies substantially in line with CDC's own.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That will involve the four important principles that have been described, the first of which is business integrity. I am sure that all businesses in which the CDC is involved will subscribe to all the principles of integrity. The second principle is the protection of the environment. I would not want any company in which the CDC is involved to ignore environmental protection, and neither would the hon. Member for Richmond Park, I am sure. The third principle is health and safety, and the fourth is social issues. Those are important principles. As well as being a development company, the CDC is and will continue to be a responsible company in those four spheres, encouraging the adoption of those principles.
<P>
The hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham is rather pessimistic about the number of ethical investors. However, the number of companies and organisations involved in ethical investment is growing rapidly. People consider it important. Some of my hon. Friends in the Committee are members of the co-operative movement, which has been involved in ethical investment for a long time. More and more people are moving in that direction. The Co-operative bank has been involved in a great deal of ethical investment, and has received a good return on it&#151;sometimes better, for a variety of reasons, than on general investment.
<P>
Ethical investment has been successful. Rather than question or challenge the CDC for investing ethically, we should encourage it as the right sort of investment. If major multinational companies based in Britain, British companies, individual investors and others want to make a good investment in an ethical company that is positive in relation to development and to how companies in which it is involved treat their workers and the environment, the CDC is the way forward.
<P>
<B>Mr. Streeter:</B> I do not want to prolong debate on the clause, but the Minister is taking us into interesting territory in discussing ethical investors, although I realise that my hon. Friend the Member for Chesham and Amersham raised the matter. Is he already conceding defeat on the point about people categorised as ethical investors? We would hope that we are all ethical investors in one sense, but I use the phrase as a term of art. Is he suggesting that private-sector investors generally will not be interested in investing in the CDC, and that it is only for specialist ethcial investors such as members of the co-operative movement?
<P>
<B>Mr. Foulkes:</B> No.
<P>
<B>Mr. Streeter:</B> That is what he seems to be saying. Is he shaping a company in which ordinary people, ordinary investment banks and ordinary pension funds will want to invest?
<P>
<B>Mr. Foulkes:</B> I am not conceding defeat. I find it incredible that the hon. Gentleman&#151;who speaks on behalf of the Opposition&#151;appears to be conceding that major companies are not interested in ethics, the environment or health and safety. More and more good British insurance companies and pension funds are looking for ethical investments. Such investments are moving into the main stream. Companies interested in a good investment will be looking at the CDC not only because they will receive a good return, but because it has the statement of business principles.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Gillan:</B> I hope that the Minister is giving way.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> No. He has finished his remarks.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Gillan:</B> The Minister tried to give the impression that I was against the statement of business principles. That is wrong and I wish to disabuse him gently of that fact. I put his remarks down to the rhetoric of debate as opposed to what he really believes. The statement of principles is fundamental and of great importance. The hon. Gentleman somehow missed my point, which concerned the way in which he referred earlier to the ultimate sanction of disinvestment and what the current position was on investments of the CDC that will be part of what is on offer as it moves towards CDC plc. What proportion of those businesses is in danger of facing the ultimate sanction?
<P>
I know that the Under-Secretary understands what I mean, but he might not have the answers to hand. I am not being unreasonable. I hope that he will consider my argument in the spirit in which it is intended, I do not want to prolong the debate, but my points are genuine and I and other members of the Committee look forward to receiving the detailed information that I, as a potential investor, would want about the company. I hope that that will put to bed clause 2.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foulkes:</B> I welcomed enthusiastically the hon. Lady's positive response to the statement of business principles. The pressure which she put her argument led me to concede that we could consider whether such principles could be entrenched further. However, that seemed at little at odds with the line that she took subsequently, when she queried whether there were exising investments that might not be accepted in the statement of business principles. She raised the spectre of disinvestment and, in so doing, she was in danger of undermining what we have in mind and the success of the CDC and its business principles. In her enthusiasm, the hon. Lady implied that there was a danger. We do not agree. We are not just encouraging the adoption of the statement of business principles, but are taking the lead from the CDC.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 2 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 3</center></H4>
<H4><center>Appointing day for registration</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Sir David Madel:</B> As was said earlier, clause 1 to 7 are time scale clauses and, to some extent, hang neatly together. Some of them seem more innocuous and innocent than others and clause 3 probably comes in that category.
<P>
The clause can be divided into two parts: if things go all right and if things go wrong. Let us suppose that everything goes all right, the registrar and the Secretary of State are satisfied and the corporation has done its duty. The pivotal point is subsection (3), which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``On receiving notice that the registrar is satisfied that the Corporation has discharged the duty . . . the Secretary of State shall make an order by statutory instrument appointing a day for registration.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
What is the time scale on that: pretty quickly, six months, a year?
<P>
The position would be different if things went wrong. I take it that subsection (4) was drafted to cover the possibility of faulty, inaccurate or inadequate documents being sent to the registrar. Decoded, the provision says that if trouble occurs, the CDC must go back to clause 1(1), which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Secretary of State may determine a day for the filing of documents by the Commonwealth Development Corporation.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In theory, we would go right back to the beginning&#151;or would we? If the documents were faulty and Parliament had an interest in such matter&#151;in other words, if subsection (4) were triggered because the registrar was not satisfied&#151;would a parliamentary statement be made automatically on the matter of how the Government would proceed? Would the Government investigate the documents or would the Comptroller and Auditor-General look into the matter? A range of possible actions could be taken before returning to clause 1(1).
<P>
Clause 3 is innocent and innocuous if all goes well but, as always, the draftsmen have covered the eventuality of things not going as we would wish. I hope that the Under-Secretary can enlighten the Committee on the objectives of subsections (3) and (4).
<P>
<B>Mr. Foulkes:</B> Yes, I also hope that I can enlighten the Committee. The clause includes provisions if matters do not proceed as planned. Such drafting is necessary, but we do not anticipate that such a problem will arise. Nevertheless, any prudent Government&#151;the previous Government were the same&#151;includes provisions in legislation in case things do not turn out as planned.
<P>
As for the documents required for registration, it is not just a case of turning up on the day and providing the documents, which are then checked to see if mistakes have been made. There is a continual process of checking with the registrar and ensuring that the documents meet all the requirements. It is not a rubber-stamping process but, if all the provisions are taken into account when preparing the documents, no problem should arise. We do not anticipate a need for parliamentary statements. When I am travelling by air, the stewardess always says, ``In the unlikely event of us landing on water'', and, fortunately, it always has been unlikely. But we must be ready for unlikely eventualities.
<P>
The appointed day for registration will be the day following filing day. I said earlier that we hoped that that would be some time later this year.

<P>

<B>Mr. Wells:</B> I am curious as to why, under clause 3(3), a day for registration must be appointed by statutory instrument. Why is it necessary to use legislative means to enable the Secretary of State to register the Company? Is it part of the wonderful juggling act that will transform the Commonwealth Development Corporation into a public company limited by shares without doing any transfers of the business. Is that why it has to be done by legislative means using the statutory instrument route? If the Minister intends to register the Company the day after the filing&#151;as he said he was going to do&#151;the Select Committee on Statutory Instruments will presumably have to sit on the filing day. I do not see how this timetable will work.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foulkes:</B> With respect, the hon. Gentleman is making a bit of a meal of it. As he and I know, after 20 years in this place, some of these procedures are fairly formal and automatic. The advantage of a statutory instrument is that there is automatic publication, so the public becomes aware that this procedure is taking place. That is the purpose of using this procedure. There is no need for the Select Committee on Statutory Instruments to deal with this and to get involved in these fairly routine, automatic procedures.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 3 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 4</center></H4>
<H4><center>Registration</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wells:</B> This provision is a continuation of the curiously contorted system that has been devised to achieve the brilliant legal trick of converting a public corporation into a public company limited by shares without having to transfer all the businesses in which the CDC has invested in each country. It raises the question of the certificates under subsection (3), which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``On registration of the Corporation's memorandum and articles of association the registrar shall give a certificate, signed by him or authenticated by his official seal ... that the Corporation remains incorporated ... that it is a public company limited by shares.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
By that means, the memorandum and articles of association will become part of the way in which the corporation will be controlled and its developmental objectives realised.
<P>
At this stage in our consideration of the Bill, we need to examine the details of the memorandum and articles of association. The Minister is indicating dissent, so I shall give way to him.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foulkes:</B> My understanding is that clauses 1 to 7 are included in the Bill to transform a statutory corporation into a public limited company. They are technical provisions, and are included for that purpose alone. As the hon. Gentleman rightly said, our officials and those of the CDC came up with this brilliant arrangement&#151;to use his expression&#151;which allowed for this simple transformation. Clauses 1 to 7 are included precisely for that purpose.
<P>
There will be other opportunities, under later clauses and new clauses, to discuss the capital structure, the timing, the developmental role, the commercial viability and the other important aspects that other members of the Committee want to get on to. With due respect to the hon. Gentleman, the points that have been raised are important, but clauses 1 to 7 are relatively technical.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I was not sure whether that was an intervention, but if it was, it was far too long.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wells:</B> I am sure that you are right, Mr. Maxton, but none the less it was a useful explanation. You will be pleased to hear that, as a result of that intervention, I shall not attempt to consider the memorandum and articles of association paragraph by paragraph at this stage. As the Minister implied in his overlong intervention, that will save time. We shall consider later the memorandum and articles of association, which are extremely important, so we shall come back to them, possibly with some amendments.

I have one question on clause 4. The Committee will remember that the Minister said that the Government propose to make an investment on &#163;50,000 at the time of registration.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foulkes</B><I> rose&#151;</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Wells:</B> The Minister should let me finish and then he can answer all my questions in one go.
<P>
Therefore, there is nominal shareholding that will represent the whole share capital at the time of the CDC's registration. At what stage will there be a capital structure reorganisation that will reflect the corporation's underlying assets? Such a reorganisation would put it in a condition in which prospective private investors would be able to assess whether to buy shares in the corporation under the balance sheet structure.
<P>
It is important that the corporation is not left for long with nominal shareholding only, for reasons that I suggested earlier. If it is, possible investors will not be able to see what will be the return on capital employed, the price: earnings ratio of the shares, the right price for the shares to be bought and the likely return for their underlying investment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Streeter:</B> Something that the Minister said triggered a thought in my mind. We are all congratulating ourselves&#151;fair enough&#151;on the device used to transform the legal nature of the CDC into a plc without the need for transferring assets. However, I am back to my old lawyer's ways and am thinking of the title to some of the assets that the company currently holds, whether property, loan securities or shares. How would anyone in Uganda considering the title to, say, a building, know that ownership had passed from the old CDC to the new plc? I cannot see anything in the Bill to tell me about that, although I am probably missing something obvious. It would be sensible to have a clause for the avoidance of doubt, as we used to say. Such a clause would make it clear to anyone that such a title had passed from the old CDC to the new plc.
<P>
I accept the fact that a transfer of assets will not take place; that is good news. I accept, as I shall talk about later, that employees will not be transferred so that the undertaking regulations do not apply. However, someone looking at the title of an asset overseas will want to be able to read a specific clause in the Bill and say, ``Ah, that's what's happened. It used to be owned by the public CDC, but now it's owned by the new plc.'' That would be sensible.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foulkes:</B> First, I shall deal with the point raised by the hon. Member for Hertford and Stortford. I hope that I said earlier that there should be &#163;50,000 minimum, which is the required minimum share capital that a public company can have under European Community law. That is expected to be a minimum.
<P>
I could make a lot of points about capital structure. As the hon. Gentleman said, it is an important part of the work ahead to restructure the CDC's capital balance sheet, as at present it is not in the form suitable for a public-private partnership. For example, it does not have any share capital. Several other points could be made. Subject to your ruling, Mr. Maxton, my advice is that such a discussion on capital structures might be better held when we debate clauses 14 or 16. However, I am open to suggestion, and shall give hon. Members time to consider the matter.
<P>
The hon. Member for South-West Devon asked about title. I sometimes wonder whether it is always useful to have lawyers serving on such Committees&#151;there are two on the Opposition Benches&#151;but on this occasion it is, because he has raised an important matter. What he describes as an ``avoidance of doubt'' provision would show that there was some doubt, and would make it less likely that foreign law would follow our law in holding that no transfer had taken place. I am sure that as a well-respected lawyer he will understand the importance of that.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<P>
<B>Mr. Streeter:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 1, in page 3, line 35, at end insert&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(5) On registration an employee of the Corporation shall cease to be a Crown servant.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In an earlier reply, the Minister removed some of the ground from beneath our feet in his usual cunning Scottish manner. The purpose of tabling the amendment was two-fold. First, we were worried because we had understood that employees of the CDC are Crown employees. If that is not the case, as he has said, what are they, apart from decent, hard-working human beings? What is their legal status, and will it change?
<P>
Our second purpose in tabling the amendment, following discussion with the Clerks Department, was to probe whether the Bill privatises the CDC. Usually when a privatisation takes place, one of the key benchmarks is the change in status of the employees of the company involved.
<P>
I shall not dwell too long on the matter because many points have already emerged, and this is not the place for us to make cheap party-political points, which tumble clumsily from my mouth because I am such a constructive, humble seeker after truth. However, I wonder why the Government are so insistent on calling this a public-private partnership. We are creating a Companies Act company, 75 per cent. of which will be sold over the next three or four years. The Government will retain 25 per cent. for the foreseeable future, but we are not told that they have ruled out selling that 25 per cent., although the Secretary of State suggested earlier that that was in her mind. Is that the intention, and if so, why make provision in the Bill for the sale of that 25 per cent.? We know that the Government will keep a golden share. However, that has taken place many times before in the 1980s. It is the usual way of converting a nationalised industry or organisation into a private company and selling it to the private sector.
<P>
My first question in speaking to the amendment, which was fashioned for this purpose, is how is this not a partial privatisation of the CDC? How does it differ? Secondly, although the Minister said that the CDC's legal identity will not change, I wonder whether it will remain the same for every purpose, including that of employer of the employees.
<P>
I am not the only one who is puzzling about the implications of the Bill for the employees&#151;I see you frown, Mr. Maxton. the House of Commons Library has been wondering about it too. When we were in government, the Labour Opposition took the House of Commons research papers as gospel truth. They were always thrown in our face as being the last word on the subject and to be relied on. I hope that the Minister will take the same approach in responding to me. That conundrum is tackled on page 30 of the research paper dated 16 March 1999, which asks what the difference is between the objectives of the Bill and partial privatisation. It says that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the conversion of CDC into a PPP is in most respects fairly typical of a partial privatisation.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It then sets out the framework for a partial privatisation and looks at the two reasons why the measure might not be a partial privatisation but something slightly different. We heard one of those reasons this morning: the proceeds of the sale will transfer not into the Treasury but the Department for International Development. However, that is not in itself a compelling, distinctive feature and I am not persuaded by it. It seems to me that the destination of the proceeds of a sale does not affect the legal nature of the process undertaken. The second reason is the notion, which again we have discussed, that it is not a privatisation because of the unique way in which the CDC is being converted into a plc, without the need to transfer its assets. Again, I am not persuaded by that because the fact that a Companies Act company is selling off 75 per cent. is by its very nature an act of privatisation. I therefore want to ask the Minister why he thinks that what is happening to the CDC is different. We raised that in another place and on Second Reading but the replies we received were not overwhelmingly persuasive.
<P>
I also have to ask the Minister what advantage he thinks there is in signalling to the world that we are talking about not a partial privatisation but something new, a public-private partnership? What do we gain by that? I can understand the argument that those seeking to invest might be reassured by the presence of Her Majesty's Government, but after 20 years of the tremendous success of privatisation in Britain, which has changed everything in our economy&#151;and, indeed, in the global economy&#151;we can say that privatisation is one of the great successes of the previous Conservative Administration. I say to the Minister that more people in the marketplace&#151;[Interruption.] It is interesting that there is muttering from the Labour Benches on that. The higher echelons of new Labour appear to have embraced privatisation as the remedy for everything, but clearly, there is not total accord with that in certian quarters of the Labour party.
<P>
I would argue that there are as many people who see the Government's involvement as an unnecessary intrusion by the dead hand of the state into a successful business as those who take comfort from it. So what advantage do we get from involving the Government in that way? We discussed earlier whether risk is fully transferred to the private sector; I understood the Secretary of State to say that the risk is being equally borne. It therefore seems to follow&#151;we will probe the matter later&#151;that the Government will not bale out private investors if the company goes crashing down in two or three years. If that is the case, what comfrot will they gain from having the Government on board? What great wisdom can the Government supply to the directors and investors of CDC that they cannot get from other sources? I am struggling with those questions.
<P>
I want to know why the Government think that creating a public-private partnership is so important. Why are they not honest enough to admit what they are doing? We all know that this is a privatisation&#151;why do the Government not have the good grace and the common sense to admit that? Will the Minister tell us in his reply&#151;which may take him several days&#151;whether he agrees that the Government's involvement in the new CDC does not add up to a row of beans?
<P>
Finally, could the Minister tell us whether he takes seriously the position of employees and say what consultation has taken place with them to talk them through the changes that will, of necessity, be made to their working arrangements? I hope that he will be able to satisfy us on those questions.
