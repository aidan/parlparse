<H4><center>Rates of vehicle excise duty for goods vehicles etc.</center></H4>
<P>
<H5>2.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. John Whittingdale </B>(Maldon and East Chelmsford): I beg to move amendment No. 28, in page 92, leave out lines 34 to 49.
<P>
We have already had a fairly full debate on the increase in the rate of vehicle excise duty, particularly for heavy goods vehicles of 40 tonnes and five axles, and I do not want to go over that ground again. The amendment draws attention to a point that was raised earlier by my right hon. Friend the Member for Charnwood (Mr. Dorrell), who drew attention to an injustice in the Government's proposals. Under the schedule, those who bought a licence prior to the Budget with a duration extending beyond 17 April 1999 will be required to pay the higher rate for the period after 17 April. The Institute of Directors drew attention to that and stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``if a licence was taken out on or before 9 March 1999 and lasts until 17 April 1999 or later, a new licence at the new, higher rate must be bought for the period from 17 April. This is most regrettable.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
To say ``regrettable'' is rather restrained. It continued:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``If someone buys a licence for a specified period, and the revenue weight of the vehicle does not change, the licence should remain valid for its full term without additional payment.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is a fair point.
<P>
When my right hon. Friend the Member for Charnwood referred to the matter, he said, correctly, that the Government are proposing retrospective taxation. Someone who buys a licence for a duration of up to a year is entitled to expect that the amount that he pays for that licence is the amount that he needs to pay, and that the Government will not later renege on the contract and ask for a higher rate to be paid for part of that period. Yet that is precisely what the Government are proposing, which is unfair because it is retrospective taxation. My right hon. Friend, with all the authority of a former Treasury Minister, drew attention to the danger of the Government indulging in retrospective taxation.
<P>
The purpose of our amendment is to remove from the schedule the provision requiring licence-holders to buy a new licence at the higher rate when they already have a licence. It would remove the element of retrospection.
<P>
<B>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Ms Patricia Hewitt):</B> <P>
The hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford (Mr. Whittingdale) misunderstands the process. There is nothing retrospective or unfair about the position set out in schedule 1. The policy that we set out in the pre-Budget report and which was announced at the time was that VED rates would be set at a level to dissuade operators from choosing to run their lorries at the heavier rate that came in at the beginning of the year. The new, heavier rate lorries were entitled to run on British roads only from the beginning of the year following the introduction of the European provision, which was accepted by the previous Government.
<P>
In the press statement that we issued at the time of the pre-Budget report, we said that all lorries should be permitted to run at the design weight or the new maximum permitted weight, whichever is the lower, rather than their plated weight, from 1 January 1999 when the new regulations came into effect until after the Budget. However, we said that any hauliers who decided to up-plate to the new vehicle class and then down-class after the Budget would not be required to weaken their vehicles because that would create unnecessary cost, but--this is the crucial part--that when the new VED rates came into effect after the Budget, any vehicle operating at the new weight would need to be up-plated and relicensed at the new VED rates.
<P>
Therefore, the position between the start of the year and the Budget on 9 March was that lorries were entitled to operate at the heavier weight without paying any extra VED or even having to go through the up-plating procedure. We then gave those lorries until 17 April either to re-license and up-plate to the new higher rate, or to fit a new axle and so qualify for the lower rate of VED, or to operate at the current plated weight--lower than the higher rate introduced on 1 January.
<P>
We allowed that additional period of six weeks to give operators time to make their choice in the light of the Budget announcements, and also to avoid log-jams of plating applications at the vehicle inspectorate and of relicensing applications at vehicle registration offices. That was a sensible, practical concession. As I hope I made clear to the right hon. Member for Charnwood when he raised the issue during our deliberations on Tuesday, there is no retrospection for those operators who updated and relicensed between 1 January and 9 March. Of course, their licences will remain in force for the normal period of 12 months, although they paid the lower rate of VED.
<P>
The effect of the amendment would be to remove the requirement for operators to make that choice, allowing them to operate at a higher weight, without any obligation to replace and relicense, or to return to the lower weight. The amendment is unacceptable because it would completely undermine the rationale that we announced last year for the new rates of VED--that lorries should pay for the environmental damage caused by their vehicles. The new heavier lorries that are permitted on our roads as a result of a European measure, agreed to by the previous Government, do some 33 per cent. more damage than the next class of lorries. That is more damage than some 10,000 cars. We are not prepared for the environmental logic behind the measure to be destroyed by the amendment. Secondly, the amendment would cause considerable confusion for haulage operators and would be quite unfair to the several thousand hauliers who have, quite properly and conscientiously, up-plated their lorries before 17 April to ensure that they were operating within the law. I very much hope that the Opposition will withdraw the amendment, but if they will not, I must ask my hon. Friends to oppose it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Whittingdale:</B> I do not accept what the Minister has said. This is a matter of natural justice. If some hauliers bought a licence in the expectation that it would run for a certain period, they are entitled to the assurance that it will run for that period. If, in the meantime, a higher rate takes effect, they will pay the higher rate when they relicense. However, I fear that I shall not persuade the Economic Secretary on that point. We shall continue to argue that this is another example of the punitive regime introduced by the Government. However, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Schedule 1 agreed to.
<P>
Clause 10 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 11</center></H4>
<H4><center>Gold</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick Gibb </B>(Bognor Regis and Littlehampton): I know that the Government are intent on decimating the country's gold reserves, in this financial year and over the next few years, to replace them a whole series of overseas currencies. They are not only selling gold but devaluing our remaining gold supplies by announcing their intention to sell in advance, which leads to a lower price on sale. Will the Paymaster General confirm that that decision has no connection with the provisions of clause 11, which change the VAT regime for investment gold?
<P>
There is concern outside this House about another issue arising from this clause and the Bill generally--the increasing use not only of secondary legislation, which we have talked about, but of tertiary legislation. Enormous concern exists among practitioners about the use of tertiary legislation, which is one step lower than secondary legislation. In this instance, the tertiary legislation is by way of a VAT notice, which is simply a leaflet, drawn up by Customs and Excise, without any parliamentary scrutiny whatever. Such notices used to be issued simply to summarise the law for practical uses, to help practitioners and business people to implement the law in an easily understandable way. It now appears that such notices are becoming part of legislation. Subsection (2)(b) and subsection (3) both refer to making provision
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``by reference to notices to be published by the Commissioners.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The clause therefore contains two such references, which is of concern to bodies outside this House, including the Law Society, which has stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``We are concerned at the proposed use of tertiary legislation ... for exempting investment gold and for exempting certain importations of gold. While tertiary legislation may be appropriate for certain limited sectors (such as for retail schemes), we consider that its widespread use is inappropriate--and so would not want its use in this context to be seen as a precedent--since we are genuinely concerned about introducing legislation without subjecting it to Parliamentary scrutiny.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The new Labour Government have not held Parliament in contempt, but the devaluation of the importance of Parliament and parliamentary scrutiny has been a general theme of their time in office. They believe that their victory at the general election with a thumping majority entitles them to govern without recourse to Parliament for the next five years. That is not what parliamentary democracy is about. It is about scrutinising every measure taken, every step of the way, despite the fact that an election is three years away.
<P>
Finally, a Customs and Excise press release states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Special provisions for transactions on the London bullion market remain intact.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Will the Paymaster General say what those special provisions are?
<P>
<B>The Paymaster General (Dawn Primarolo):</B> The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb) does himself a disservice by talking about widespread concern about the schedule. If he looks at the submissions made by almost every other professional body, with the exception of the Law Society, he will find that the clause is welcomed. I want to address his and the Law Society's clear misunderstanding with regard to the intentions behind the clause.
<P>
The clause provides for the enactment in United Kingdom legislation of EC Directive 98/80, which was an agreement achieved during the UK presidency. It concluded six years of intermittent negotiation that was started by the previous Government because of the disadvantage experienced by the UK industrial gold market in relation to other European gold markets.
<P>
The clause provides for secondary legislation to be introduced by notices, as the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton mentioned. I shall return to that point later. I must emphasise that we are bound under Community law to implement the directive into UK law on 1 January 2000.
<P>
<H5>2.45 pm<p1>Our dealing with the details of secondary and tertiary legislation will enable us to meet our legal obligation to legislate. More importantly, it will enable us to consult the London bullion market--we have consulted it closely throughout our negotiations--on the working of the directive, especially in relation to its tax and record-keeping provisions. Our intention, and that of the previous Government, is to ensure that the London bullion market is not damaged. It will not be; it is quite happy with the provisions. We also intend to remove the distortions that exist between the industrial gold market in the UK and other European markets.</H5>
</P>
<P>
Our aim is to ensure that the operational details of the directive are subject to proper consultation, and that we meet our legal obligation of implementation by 1 January 2000, and the Finance Bill is the only primary legislation in which we could have done that. Had we legislated completely in the Finance Bill, we would not have had the time to conduct the necessary detailed consultation.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton made the allegation that there is something unusual and devious about using secondary legislation in this way. That is not the case. The previous Government undertook consultations in this way. Indeed, I was looking through some Hansards to see how Paymasters General in the previous Government dealt with such matters. When they were asked for details of consultations or regulations that had yet to be introduced, they often said, ``Well, we don't know yet, but we will consult, and then we will know.'' At least this Government are clearly setting out the agenda.
<P>
The directive is widely recognised as a success for the UK presidency, and it has been widely welcomed by the industrial market. It will remove the 17.5 per cent. rate of VAT on industrial gold, which will ensure that other European markets compete with us on an equal basis. It will enable the growth of an industrial gold market outside the bullion market that cannot currently exist, because people can buy gold more cheaply elsewhere in Europe where tax rates are lower
<P>
The directive is to be welcomed, and I am sorry that the Law Society's mild questioning of it, and the comments made by the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, have completely missed the point. They should welcome the clause.

<P>

<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> It is wrong for the Paymaster General to treat the Law Society in that way. It is no ordinary society--it represents this country's legal profession. We are talking about the legislative process and how laws are interpreted in practice. The problem with tertiary legislation is not simply that it is not subject to parliamentary scrutiny. Those who are deemed to understand our law should be able to consult it, but it is difficult for them to do so when much of it is framed not in the statute book or in statutory instruments, but in some leaflet, with which tax advisers alone are familiar. For that reason, notwithstanding the issue of parliamentary scrutiny, the Government must take on board the genuine concerns of the legal profession, rather than treating them with arrogant contempt.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I read the Law Society's submission. Its observations were framed in no stronger terms than the need for clarification. As the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton knows, I have explained the importance of the notices issued by both tax authorities. They are not, as he describes them, mere ``leaflets''. If we failed properly to consult with the London bullion market and other investment gold markets, the hon. Gentleman would be aware of that. Earlier, I referred to investment gold markets as industrial gold markets. There is a slight difference between the two and I should like to set the record straight on that.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman is trying to use a comment made by the Law Society to score a political point that does not need to be scored. The gold market is very important. The Law Society is in total agreement on the directive's objectives; it wants to be consulted and we have provided for that. The previous Government shared those objectives and, had they faced similar time constraints, would have employed the same methods. Were the Conservative party in power, and had the hon. Gentleman been fortunate enough to be a Minister, he would be making the same, perfectly justifiable points that I have made.
<P>
<B>Mr. Whittingdale:</B> My hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton raised an important point that the Paymaster General has conspicuously failed to address. Is there a connection between the clause and the recent announcement of the sale of more than half the country's gold reserves?
<P>
Yesterday, the Economic Secretary and I had an interesting exchange on that subject. She said that, in the spirit of transparency that now pervades the Government, they intended to tell the markets about the sale. Did the Government intend to depress the price of gold by announcing the sale?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> This has nothing to do with an EC directive and the matters are not connected in any way; I was merely trying to stay in order. I am pleased to hear about the point that my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary made in response to the hon. Gentleman's question.
<P>
The Government have made their position clear with regard to the sale of gold reserves. The sale is a prudent restructuring that is not connected with the clause in any way, except for the use of the word, ``gold''.
<P>
<B>Mr. Whittingdale:</B> Did the Government intend that the price of gold should fall when they made the announcement?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I allowed the hon. Gentleman to ask whether there was a connection between the clause and Government policy on the sale of gold. The Government have made it clear that there is no connection. The policy on gold sales has nothing to do with the Bill and we should bring our discussion on that to a close.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 11 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 12</center></H4>
<H4><center>Assignment of debts</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 42, in page 5, line 24, leave out
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``except in such circumstances as may be prescribed.''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Although Opposition Members support this clearly needed anti-avoidance measure, we are concerned, as are outside practitioners and interested bodies, about the phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``except in such circumstances as may be prescribed''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
in subsection (1), which amends section 36 of the Value Added Tax Act 1994. The purpose of the clause is to ensure that cash received from a customer is taken into account when calculating bad debt relief for VAT purposes, even when the debt has been assigned to a third party and the payment is received by that third party, which is the usual position in debt factoring.
<P>
This is a probing amendment. Why does subsection (1) define the word ``received'' as meaning
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``either by the claimant or, except in such circumstances as may be prescribed, by a person to whom''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
the debt has been assigned? What circumstances does the Minister have in mind when receipts by a third party on an assigned debt will not be taken into account for VAT bad debt relief purposes?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I can help the hon. Gentleman. The answer to his question is none. I thank him for pointing out the technical amendment that we should make to the Bill. Amendment No. 42 is accepted by the Government. He will be pleased to know that his name will go down in history as helping us again to improve legislation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I am most grateful. That ranks with my other great Committee victory, which was to include an apostrophe in working families' tax credit. The Bill will be much improved by the amendment. However, can she explain the interaction of clause 12 as amended with statutory instrument 1999/599, which also covers the assignment of debt issues?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I do not know what statutory instrument the hon. Gentleman means because I do not keep number references in my head. However, he was right to say that amendment No. 42 does two things. First, it improves the management of bad debt relief and, secondly, it makes clear under what circumstances refunds are made or the tax becomes liable if the bill is paid. It also provides a cross-reference to ensure that we are clear about the tax point of supply. As for his question on the statutory instrument, unless he gives a more complete title, I cannot help him.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I am happy to oblige. I apologise for not giving its full title, which is the Value Added Tax (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulations 1999.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I thought that the hon. Gentleman might be referring to the time of supply, but I could not be sure from his reference. Believe it or not, the matter is now slightly clearer and the answer to his question is that there is no legislative link.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> On the basis of that answer, and the fact that the amendment has been accepted, that is all I have to say.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
<H5>3 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael Jack </B>(Fylde): On a point of order, Mr. Butterfill. We have had a discussion on a very narrow point and I seek your guidance on whether you will allow a short clause stand part debate.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I was just about to propose the Question, and if the right hon. Gentleman catches my eye when I do, I shall call him.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> I wonder whether the Paymaster General can clear up a small technical point. Clause 12(4) provides that until Customs and Excise introduces the necessary regulations, references in the current regulations to trade include an assignee. Will the Paymaster General explain why that is so, and why, unlike other Customs regulations under the Bill, the regulations referred to in the clause have not yet been laid?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> It was not sufficiently clear in the legislation that the provision should also apply to the assignee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> I am grateful to the Paymaster General for that clarification, and I am sure that it will have been noted beyond the walls of the Committee Room.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 12, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Butterfill. There are many amendments to schedule 2. Do you intend to have a substantive debate on the schedule? If so, I shall not comment on clause 13, but will respond during the debate on the schedule.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am perfectly happy, if it is the Committee's wish, to allow the discussion on schedule 2 to range fairly widely, in which case it would be possible to dispense with a stand part debate on clause 13.
<P>
Clause 13 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<H4><center>VAT: GROUPS OF COMPANIES</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 38, in page 94, line 24, leave out paragraph (b) and insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``(b) such earlier time as may be requested in the application, and as the Commissioners may allow, or
<P>
(c) such later time as may be requested in the application.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 39, in page 94, line 25, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``(4A) Where an application is taken to be granted with effect from the day on which it is received by the Commissioners under subsection (4)(a) above the Commissioners shall, within the period of seven days starting with the day on which it was received by them, notify the applicant of the date on which the application was received by them''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 40, in page 94, line 38, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``(5A) A refusal of an application under subsection (5)(c) above which is not notified to the applicant within the period of 90 days starting with the day on which it was received by the Commissioners shall not have effect.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Much of schedule 2 is welcome, particularly the removal of the 90-day notice period for grouping. Instead, the grouping will take place at the beginning of the 90-day period. But there is concern about the schedule both outside the House and among Opposition members. The first group of three amendments covers minor concerns and suggests some improvements. The next group covers fundamental and widespread concerns about the schedule.
<P>
The amendments before us refer to the timing of grouping. Under the schedule, new section 43B(4) to the Value Added Tax Act 1994 states that there are two options. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Where this section applies in relation to an application''--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
for grouping--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``it shall ... be taken to be granted with effect from . .. the day on which the application is received by the Commissioners, or ... such earlier ... time as the Commissioners may allow.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment would introduce a third option. It states that the body could either be regarded as having applied from the day on which the application is received, or
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``such earlier time as may be requested in the application'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
provided that the commissioners agree, which is fair enough. Al1 commentators--

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I think that the hon. Gentleman meant to say that the amendment states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``such later time as may be requested.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> No. I shall come on to that. Sub-paragraph (b) in the amendment states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``such earlier time as may be requested in the application, and as the Commissioners may allow.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Commentators accept that the commissioners should have the discretion to agree to an earlier date on which the grouping may take place.
<P>
The third option is contained in sub-paragraph (c) of the amendment, which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``such later time as may be requested''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The point of the amendment is that the commissioners should not have the discretion to allow a later date. No issues relating to revenue protection or avoidance are involved.
<P>
There is a practical reason why an applicant--a company or group--will want the grouping to take place on a specific date that is later than the date on which the application was submitted. Most companies account for VAT on a quarterly basis. The amendment would allow companies to state that a grouping will take effect from the start of the next quarterly accounting period. That is an important issue for accountants--as an accountant, I appreciate the need to know the precise date on which the grouping will start. It needs to start at the beginning of a quarterly accounting period. It would be cumbersome for accounting purposes if the grouping began half way through an accounting period.
<P>
If the amendment is not agreed to, groups will probably put in an application just before the beginning of their next quarterly accounting period, which could cause an enormous administrative burden for Customs and Excise.
<P>
The Chartered Institute of Taxation, which represents people who advise and work in taxation in the private sector, said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``We agree that Customs and Excise should have power to accept or reject a request for an application to be backdated. However, we see no need for an equivalent power in relation to a request for the application to take effect from a date later than the time when the application is received.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It goes on to say that that will discourage early applications and encourage late applications. In essence, that is what amendment No. 38 is about. I hope that the Government will follow the precedent that they set in relation to an amendment to clause 12, and accept this sensible amendment.
<P>
Amendment No. 39 is about the notifying a company of the date of receipt. As the Bill is drafted, the relevant grouping will generally take effect from the date that the application is received. For accounting purposes, a group needs to know the precise date. One cannot account for something roughly; one has to account for it on a precise day. Given the postal system and the internal procedures of Customs and Excise, it would help a business if it was officially informed of the date, so that the accounting systems could be amended with certainty.
<P>
The Chartered Institute of Taxation said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a company needs to know the day from which an application takes effect. It cannot predict when the application will be received or whether Customs and Excise will accept an earlier or later date. Thus, there is a clear need for Customs and Excise to notify the company of the effective date without delay ... We consider that a requirement to notify should be written in to the legislation.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That deals with amendment No. 39.
<P>
Amendment No. 40 relates to the situation in which a grouping application is refused. Under the Bill's provisions, Customs can refuse an application for VAT grouping at any time within 90 days from the date of application. In the meantime, the business would account for VAT as a group, assuming that the grouping had not previously been refused. The proposal is a welcome change. However, as the Bill is drafted, Customs could argue that it had made the decision to refuse an application within the 90-day period although it had not communicated that decision to the company within that period.
<P>
Under the terms of the amendment, once the 90-day period has elapsed, the applicant should be entitled to assume that the application for grouping has been accepted. The Chartered Institute of Taxation holds that view. It said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the refusal of an application needs to be notified to the company so that the necessary action can be taken. We consider that a requirement to notify should be written into the legislation.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is also the opinion of the Confederation of British Industry. As Ministers seem to treat the views of the professionals with disdain, perhaps they will take the views of the representatives of industry more seriously. In welcoming the removal of the 90-day advance notice period, the CBI said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``However, allowing Customs and Excise 90 days to consider a grouping application will be excessive in most cases. The Department should be committed to responding promptly to an application ... There should be an overall limit of 90 days in which all queries must be dealt with.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The CBI, which backs the amendment, made the additional point that if Customs and Excise reaches a decision in the first couple of weeks--in most cases, it will be clear to it whether a group application should be accepted--it should notify taxpayers, companies and groups well before the 90-day period has elapsed. The amendment would mean that where the 90-day period has elapsed and no notification has been given, the taxpayer will be entitled to assume that an application for grouping has been accepted.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> May I explain at the outset why the changes are being made and what their effect will be? The schedule relates to a business facilitation measure, in particular VAT grouping. The facility will remove some of the administrative burdens that associated companies can incur when complying with VAT rules. It enables companies to register an account for the tax as a single VAT registration. Supplies between group members are disregarded for VAT purposes. That enables business to simplify accounting arrangements and it can reduce VAT liability. Grouping is a permissive provision in European law. It has been adopted by eight member states, including Austria, Denmark, Eire, Finland, Germany, Holland and, most recently, Sweden. The permissive nature of European law has enabled each member state to develop a different approach to their grouping provisions.
<P>
The schedule implements changes that result from a review of grouping facilities which was undertaken by Customs and Excise. It tried to establish whether the balance between business facilitation and revenue costs was fair and took into account the opinion of businesses that it received during the consultation period. The changes remove the uncertainty that business has experienced as a result of recent court decisions that relate to the entitlement of overseas companies to join groups and to the scope of protection powers. Subsequent amendments deal with that.
<P>
The changes benefit business. They make the facility more flexible by allowing grouping to take place with immediate effect, which touches on some of the points made by the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton. That also helps Customs to counter abuse and ensure that revenue yield is protected. We are striking a balance between facilitating business and protecting the taxpayer.
<P>
As for the detail and the 90-day notices, the problem is that the law requires businesses to give up to 90-days' notice before an application for grouping can take effect. Business rightly regards that as an unnecessary obstacle to legitimate business, which prevents businesses from reacting quickly to changing business structures. The proposal on the 90 days, which the hon. Gentleman welcomed in his comments on his amendment, will provide more flexibility for business. The 90-day notice will be removed and, instead, grouping will be approved from the date on which Customs receives an application. Clearly, business will derive benefits from being able to use the grouping facility from that point, but the interests of the taxpayer must be balanced. If businesses are allowed immediate entry to the group on submission of application, Customs will need a power to remove a business from the group, if, on studying the application, it is clear that it should not be permitted.
<P>
<H5>3.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton focus specifically on the issue of timing. It would be wrong to give businesses an automatic right to group from the point at which they express their wish to do so, without introducing protection powers for Customs and Excise to be used if an application is not allowed. Customs will not refuse an application out of hand--inquiries will be made and consideration given to the protection of revenue and the impact on business. The power to refuse an application is merely a balance.
<P>
I want to speak about the eligibility criteria and the appeals and anti-avoidance provisions, with which the amendments are also concerned. The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton tabled a series of amendments--Nos. 38, 39 and 40. I regret to say that I shall call on my hon. Friends to resist those amendments if he presses them to a vote. Amendment No. 38 would limit the commissioner's control over when applications for grouping will be accepted. The hon. Gentleman argued that companies should be able to express their wish to group at some time in the future and not be limited by the 90-day period. That argument must be resisted. Companies should put in their applications on the date when they intend to group, when the grouping will become effective and the review will take place. If an application is made more than 90 days before the grouping is to take effect, a change in business activities may occur so that a new revenue risk arises between the end of the 90-day period and the date on which the application takes effect. Most reasonable people will accept that we cannot allow that to occur between the expiry of the 90-day period and the date on which the group emerges.

<P>

<B>Mr. Jack:</B> The Paymaster General has laid great emphasis on 90 days and no period shorter than 90 days for the purpose of coming to a decision on whether a group is not a group. Based on previous experience, how long does Customs and Exercise take to reach such decisions? For example, does it take between 20 and 90 days?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I was coming to that point, and I thank the right hon. Gentleman for pointing me towards amendment No. 39, which deals with the period within which Customs and Exercise should respond to the application. The amendment would establish a period of seven days from receipt of application. Given the flexibility that changes to the regulations will provide, that would impose an unreasonable burden. However, the right hon. Gentleman is right to ask for some indication of the notification period. Customs and Exercise proposes to write to an applicant within 15 working days of receipt of the application either to say that inquiries are being made, or to give confirmation of the application.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> Will the Paymaster General give way?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I want to finish this point, because the amendment deals with the length of the process and the action that Customs and Excise will take. When an inquiry is made, it will write to confirm the date of receipt.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> May I press the Paymaster General for more detail about the terms of the letter? Where a company receives a letter on the 16th or 17th day--depending on the postal service--stating that no further inquiries will be made, will it also state that, for example, the group exists and no further inquiries will be made in respect of approval? Should the letter be regarded as firm approval?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> Clearly, one cannot be held responsible for postal delays. However, all sensible people would say that, in considering a notification period of 15 days, allowance should be made for the length of time it might take to receive such notification. In addition to companies being notified writing, telephone inquiries would be made.
<P>
The answer to the right hon. Gentleman's question is yes. If inquiries are to be made, they will be made in detail at that point. Where no inquiries are made, the application to join the group is confirmed and the company will be informed within 15 days. That is a reasonable period, which strikes a good balance between the demands on Customs and Excise and the seven-day period that the amendment would establish. I understand why seven days seems attractive, but it would place an unreasonable burden on Customs and Exercise
<P>
With regard to the point that underpins amendment No. 39, Customs and Excise should reach such decisions long before the 90 days are up. For that reason, I ask the Committee to reject the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> I am grateful to the Paymaster General for that clarification. Although inquiries might not be made directly to the company, other work could be undertaken by Customs and Excise. The clock goes on ticking for 90 days for those for whom inquiries continue to be a concern. Will Customs and Excise write to the company with its decision when it has completed its inquiries, or will it wait until 90 days have elapsed?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> Customs and Excise will pursue the inquiries as quickly as possible, so that a company can be told whether it may become part of a group. A 90-day period would be the absolute limit. No reasonable person would expect Customs and Excise to sit on an application and simply wait for the days to pass. Inquiries will be handled as speedily as possible; the speed will also depend on how quickly a company responds to the inquiry.
<P>
It is not only a matter of Customs and Excise issuing the questions, but how long the company takes to provide that detailed information--if, indeed, it is prepared to respond. It would be unreasonable to blame Customs and Excise when a company had held up the flow of responses. As soon as the outcome of the inquiry is determined, the company will be told. It may then appeal if it does not agree with that outcome. If it is given permission to group, it will have the certainty that it already believed that it had from the date of application.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> Will the Paymaster General confirm that some form of practice and guidance note will be issued to applicants, so that they can understand the provisions that she has just described?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> Yes, of course. Guidance on the operation will be most helpful. Perhaps the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton would call it a ``leaflet''; it would certainly be a notice that would enable companies to see how Customs and Excise would proceed, and to understand its own obligation to supply information to assist a speedy reply.
<P>
I do not want to tempt fate, but I am about to move on to amendment No. 40. Does the right hon. Gentleman wish to say any more about amendment No. 39, before I leave it?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Will the Paymaster General tell us which part of the schedule refers to the period of 15 days?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> Fifteen days is not specified in the schedule, but that is the practice that Customs and Excise will pursue. The exchange between the right hon. Member for Fylde (Mr. Jack) and myself clarified that. I think that he referred to a code of practice. However, the business brief is the proper place in which to express those points, and that will happen. Finally--
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick St. Aubyn </B>(Guildford): I have listened with great interest to the details so ably given to us by the Paymaster General. There have been no Liberals present during this debate. Is that because those matters have already been dealt with informally with the representatives of the Liberal party, who are supposed to be here, under the new cosy arrangements between the Liberals and the Labour party?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. That is not relevant to the discussion.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> Thank you, Mr. Butterfill. I think that hon. Members will find that the Liberal Democrats have tabled an amendment to the schedule, which we shall discuss later.
<P>
Amendment No. 40--
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown </B>(Cotswold): Will the hon. Lady give way?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The hon. Gentleman was waiting for me to say that. Yes, of course I will give way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> The clause gives Customs and Excise wide powers to de-group companies if it seems to them that revenue is being lost. Will the Paymaster General give an assurance that satisfactory discussions will take place before Customs and Excise issue a notice of their absolute decision that a grouping proposal is unacceptable? Wide-ranging distortions could be created in the trading pattern of a company, if such a notice were to be issued without warning.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The measure does not give wide-ranging powers to Customs and Excise as has been suggested, because it already has a right to refuse a company entry to a group. Because we now propose an automatic right for a company to enter a group, if its application is found to be incorrect we must also provide a means of taking that company out of the group. The position with access to groups is the same. There is no carte blanche for de-grouping companies.
<P>
On the hon. Gentleman's second point, which is important, proper discussion will take place with the companies concerned to ensure that we have all the information and understand it clearly so that a decision can be made on whether a company should be in a group. The onus is on the company to supply the information. If it does not supply all the information and Customs is left with only a partial view, it would have to make a decision on that basis. It is in the interests of Customs as well as the companies to ensure full discussion and exchange of information when inquiries are sought and a company enters a group.
<P>
<H5>3.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> That is a very helpful reply and I am sure that the matter will be watched by practitioners outside.
<P>
The matter has been subject to consultation with many relevant bodies. Will the Paymaster General say why the legislation does not refer to the grouping of professional partnerships and service companies, and whether that could be dealt with under clause 13?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> Clause 13 builds on the existing arrangements for grouping and the same rules will apply after the clause is enacted as apply now. I have tried to explain to the Committee that we are looking for a balance in dealing with the 90 days--removing that as a block, but giving the power to Customs as a substitute. We had a power to refuse access to a group and that had to be done in 90 days. If we allow a company into a group immediately, we must have some way of taking it out, if it should not have been there in the first place. That is all that the provisions do. I am happy to assure the Committee that proper discussion will take place at every point. It is not in the best interests of Customs and Excise if grouping does not operate as efficiently as possible.
<P>
<B>Mr. Oliver Heald </B>(North-East Hertfordshire): Would the Paymaster General be prepared to describe these matters as vital for British industry?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> Yes. The grouping arrangements are very important. I tried to explain earlier that, throughout the European Union, grouping occurs in slightly different ways, but it is a valuable facility to British business. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman knows that it results in a considerable loss of revenue to the Exchequer in VAT that would otherwise be collected. The previous Government and the present one believe that grouping is an important business facility and should not be disturbed. That is why we are doing nothing radical; we are being modest and precise in providing a balanced package.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I do not want to try the patience of the Paymaster General, but there was consultation with various interested groups and Customs and Excise accepted that grouping of professional partnerships and service companies would be included. If the Paymaster General cannot tell me now why clause 13 does not deal with that, I should be grateful if she could write to me with an answer.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The hon. Gentleman will find that the agreement was that Customs should examine the matter.
<P>
It is a very complicated area and, therefore, we were unable to settle it, but we have said that we shall further consider the issue. As I have also said, our purpose was to build on the current arrangements and to deal specifically with the 90-day issue, as well as some of the issues that have arisen subsequently as a result of tribunal decisions.
<P>
Amendment No. 40 would ensure that, if the refusal of an application on revenue protection grounds was not notified within the 90-day period, commencing with the date of the application, the refusal would be invalid. The amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton is unnecessary. I have told the Committee how Customs will handle the issue, and that will be detailed in the business brief. Therefore, I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I should like to start on a note of agreement with the Paymaster General. I agree that the schedule and the issue of VAT grouping is vital to British industry. It interesting to note that, during the debate on the amendment, there has been no Liberal Democrat presence in Committee, despite the fact that these measures are vital to British industry. Therefore, it is good to see that the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey) is in his place now, albeit at the tail end of the debate.
<P>
On a note of disagreement, the Paymaster General underestimates the difference between the situation of a taxpayer and that of Customs and Excise officials, because the balance of power greatly favours Customs. I believe that most business people, almost to a man or woman, would say, that the balance of power rests with Customs. It is not satisfactory to say that there is a code of conduct, that the business brief sets out procedures for Customs--for example, that it will send out letters within 15 days--and that no reasonable person would expect it to sit on an inquiry until the end of 90 days. All those assurances may or may not be set out in writing, but they are not set out in legislation. That is not satisfactory because our postbags are full of letters about situations in which people have behaved unreasonably. I am afraid that people behave unreasonably, both in the state and private sectors. However, at least in the private sector people can shop around and go elsewhere, but in the state sector, there is no alternative but to deal with the one Customs and Excise unit. Therefore, it is important that we do not rely on statements of practice and codes of conduct, but that the position is set out in legislation, so that the taxpayer can have recourse to that legislation when things go wrong.
<P>
Things do go wrong. There are many heart-rending cases where unreasonable mistakes have been made, both by the Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise. I believe that the amendments would reduce the likelihood of those mistakes occurring. However, I do not want to delay the Committee unreasonably by pressing the amendment to a vote. The Paymaster General's assurances will be helpful to those taxpayers who get into difficulty with Customs and Excise because, under Pepper v. Hart, her words will carry almost as much weight as the law.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> May I respond briefly to the hon. Gentleman? In our discussions and consultations on the schedule, we have not heard the clamour of complaint and accusation that he suggests. <P>
It is necessary for Customs and Excise to have the powers to prevent avoidance and abuse. The schedule strikes the right balance, which will help businesses and protect the taxpayer.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> This large group of amendments can be split into three segments.
<P>
There is relief--I was going to say concern, but the concerns have been dissipated--outside the House about the fact that the Government have back-tracked on their disastrous proposal to end VAT grouping when exempt or partially exempt companies are in a group. That proposal would have done enormous damage to the financial sector in the City--it would have cost an estimated 400 million in additional VAT--and an enormous compliance burden would have resulted. The City has welcomed the fact that the rules to prevent non--UK companies without a UK presence being included in a VAT group will not take effect in relation to existing groups until next year.
<P>
The Institute of Directors has expressed concern that the proposal will drive businesses away from the UK. It said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``There will be a net loss to the country, and no gain to the Exchequer''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I hope that the Paymaster General will respond to that point.
<P>
Despite the fact that the Government have back-tracked on their VAT grouping proposals, there is a concern that they are still apparently intent on proceeding with the mini-GAAR, the general anti-avoidance rule, for VAT purposes. What is the Government's latest position on that matter?
<P>
The first segment in the group of amendments relates to the phrase, ``it appears'', which is a subjective phrase that makes people nervous. The phrase is littered throughout the schedule, which states, for example:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Commissioners may refuse an application ... if it appears to them''. <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Elsewhere, it states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Commissioners may give a notice ... only if it appears 1 to them to be necessary for the protection of the revenue''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The phrase gives too much discretionary power to Customs and Excise and it involves a degree of uncertainty that might revive the concerns that had been felt in relation to VAT groupings.
<P>
What does the phrase, ``protection of the revenue'' mean? Does it mean that insurance companies should not be in groups? If an insurance company leaves a group, Customs will gain more revenue, because the inter-group charges between a partially exempt company and a fully taxable company in a group will not be recoverable. Does the phrase mean that all insurance companies will be de-grouped? Will charities automatically be excluded from VAT groups on the same grounds?
<P>
The Institute of Indirect Taxation said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Under all of these provisions the trigger for Customs powers is subjective. It is irrelevant whether or not a state of affairs which justifies removal from a group exists. The only question is whether or not it `appears' to Customs that such a state of affairs exists. There is no requirement for Customs to satisfy themselves whether the impression they have formed is right.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is also the view of the Law Society. It is worrying when such subjective phrases are littered throughout legislation.
<P>
The Law Society was also concerned about the retrospective nature of the schedule.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey </B>(Kingston and Surbiton): Before the hon. Gentleman addresses the retrospective aspect of the schedule, is it not curious that the word, ``appears'' means that Customs and Excise will not be required to inform the companies--taxpayers--of its reasons? Taxpayers may be required to de-group without knowing why.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes a valid point. It is difficult to appeal against a decision when taxpayer have not been told the reasons for it. How can tax payers check whether the reasons were right? Customs and Excise could make a wrong decision and there would be no redress. What matters according to the law is what appears to the commissioners to be the case, not what is actually the case.
<P>
<H5>3.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Is not there another point to be made on the objective and subjective test? The Bill fetters the discretion of the tribunal, which is required not to consider what is fair between the taxpayer and Customs, but what is in the interests of providing revenue to Customs.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> My hon. Friend is right and I shall discuss the appeal procedure in more detail later. It is difficult to appeal on the ground of an incorrect fact. The grounds for appeal are that the commissioners acted unreasonably. Such an appeal is used in the judicial review process, not in an appeal to a tribunal.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman explain what would happen if a company gave Customs and Excise an incorrect fact and provided on appeal the correct fact? Whose fault would it be?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Those issues need to be dealt with before the appeal. If the facts are unclear, they should be sorted out. We are talking about a balance of power between the taxpayer and Customs and Excise. It cannot be the case that the benefit of <P>
doubt is always given to Customs and Excise. It is important that the law is fair to both the taxpayer and the Exchequer.

<br>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> Surely the answer to the Paymaster General is that there is no requirement on Customs and Excise to obtain the correct facts from the taxpayer. There is no requirement to talk to the taxpayer. In relation to de-grouping, it is only a requirement if Customs and Excise, on whatever facts it has used, decides that it appears to be so. We must ensure that primary legislation requires Customs and Excise to establish the correct facts.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The hon. Gentleman is right. Our amendments try to redress the many concerns that we have about the Bill, which is why there is such a range of amendments. Representations to the Government devote more pages to this schedule than to almost any other part of the Bill. Those concerns should not be dismissed lightly.
<P>
The Law Society is worried about retrospection. It said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``It would seem from the proposed new<P>
</UL></FONT>''
<P>
section 43
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``that it would be possible for the Commissioners retrospectively to degroup a company ... that ... ignores the possibility of a mistake being made by the Commissioners in granting the application in the first place. Retrospective degrouping should be allowed (if at all) only where inadequate or incorrect information was supplied with the grouping application or following a subsequent change ... so that the control criteria cease to be fulfilled.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Paymaster General talked about incorrect information being supplied, but she must consider what would happen in reverse.
<P>
What will happen if a company is sold out of a group? Will the group or Customs and Excise need to take administrative action to remove the company from the group, or will it automatically be de-grouped because it no longer fulfils the criteria eligibility set out in new section 43?
<P>
The phrase, ``it appears to them'' litters the schedule, which is why amendments Nos. 34 to 41 seek to remove it. Amendment No. 41 deals with an issue that is probably more important than any other that we have discussed. It would remove the phrase, 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``for the protection of the revenue''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Institute of Directors stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The power, given by new section 43C (1) and (2), to remove companies from groups where that is necessary for the protection of the revenue is far too wide. It could be interpreted to mean that if grouping led to less VAT being paid than would have been the case without grouping ... the revenue was threatened and the group should be broken up. This would be wholly unacceptable''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo indicated dissent.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The Paymaster General dismisses that concern, but the law states that Customs and Excise has the power to remove a company from a group to protect the revenue. It makes no reference to circumstances in which anti-avoidance has taken place, but simply concentrates on protecting the revenue. If Customs can get more revenue by kicking a company out of a group, the Bill will empower it to do that.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The hon. Gentleman is not doing himself justice. knows that both Revenue departments operate on the basis of protecting the revenue within rules laid down in legislation provided by Parliament. His argument that Customs and Excise would deliberately de-group to raise more VAT is preposterous and unworthy of this Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The Paymaster General may well be right; Customs may not degroup to raise more revenue. However, the law will empower it to degroup in circumstances in which it can raise more revenue. Why create laws that are not to be implemented? Why not create laws correctly and accurately? The hon. Lady could have made the valid point that the phrase, ``protection of the revenue.'' is already used in sections 43(4) and (5) of the Value Added Tax Act 1994. However, it is used there only when positive action is to be taken to change the structure of the group.
<P>
The new power will be applicable at any time, regardless of any change in the group's structure or activities as a whole. That is what people find objectionable. At any time, Customs could say, ``I am sorry, you can no longer be grouped. There is a partially exempt company in your group and we believe that we can gain more revenue by removing it, so we will''. That power could be used against charities and insurance companies. For example, a trading subsidiary of a charity or a partially exempt insurance company could be de-grouped.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> The hon. Gentleman is right. The Minister said from a sedentary position that that was without precedent. However, a precedent was set in the VAT tribunal case involving National Westminster bank. The commissioner ruled that Customs and Excise could refuse a group registration not only where there was a VAT avoidance scheme but, on the grounds of protection of the revenue, where there was loss of tax as a normal consequence of VAT grouping. Therefore, the way in which the current law is being interpreted reinforces the hon. Gentleman's point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. I shall refer to that case in a few moments. It would help members of the Committee and the public if the Paymaster General could define the Government's interpretation of ``protection of the revenue'' in order to limit its scope. That definition could then be recorded in Hansard.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> That is a tax avoidance charter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> It is not a tax avoidance charter. It would simply clarify the law in respect of the meaning of the phrase. As the law stands, the provision will enable Customs to remove a partially exempt company from a group in order to increase the revenue take to the Exchequer. The partially exempt company could not reclaim in full the VAT that it would have had to pay on intergroup transactions between a partially exempt company outside the group and a fully taxable company inside the group. That would increase the revenue.
<P>
By way of defence, Customs and Excise has said that it will issue a business brief, setting out its interpretation of the phrase, ``protection of the revenue''. However, the brief will not be issued until after the Bill receives Royal Assent. Why? We are expected to vote for this inadequate and badly drafted legislation in the hope that the business brief will mitigate the damage that the schedule will inflict.
<P>
That seems an absurd way of carrying on the legislative process.
<P>
Does the hon. Lady have a draft of the business brief? If so, could all Committee members have a copy before we make a decision on schedule 2? If we are expected to rely on the business brief, is that not another example of tertiary legislation with no parliamentary scrutiny? It is wrong for widely drawn legislation to be tempered by executive action. That is an unacceptable way to deal with taxation legislation in a democratic country. As a Member of Parliament and a representative of the Conservative party, I believe strongly that legislation should be drafted narrowly and should reflect the current state of affairs. Widely drafted legislation should not be subsequently reduced and censored by executive action.
<P>
If the term ``protection of the revenue'' is meant to apply only, to cases of tax avoidance, will the Paymaster General explain, with reference to the point made by the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton, how VAT tribunals will interpret the phrase? As the hon. Gentleman said, it has already been interpreted in the NatWest v. Customs and Excise Commissioners case heard in March last year. Page 16 of the report of the case states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``We do not accept the submission of Mr. Cordara''--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
for NatWest--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``that the phrase `protection of the revenue' is confined to schemes which abuse grouping and does not apply where a tax benefit flows from the normal operation of grouping ... In our judgment the protection in question under section 43(5A) may be against any loss of revenue which is not de minimis whether or not it follows from the normal operation of grouping. It certainly covers an artificial avoidance scheme but it also covers a straightforward case which would not be characterised as avoidance or as abusive''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> Precisely. The hon. Gentleman seems to have got it. The tribunal widened the definition of ``protection of the revenue'' and the schedule seeks to clarify and narrow it. Would the hon. Gentleman read out the ruling again? The tribunal said that we interpreted the definition of ``protection of the revenue'' too narrowly. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The Paymaster General has misunderstood the case. The report states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``It certainly covers an artificial avoidance scheme but it also covers a straightforward case which would not be characterised by avoidance or as abusive''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Those are the words of the judgment; that is the law. The legal interpretation of the phrase ``protection of the revenue'' does not refer only to anti-avoidance issues but to ordinary situations that would not be characterised as avoidance. The schedule does not provide an interpretation of ``protection of the revenue'' at all. For that, we must rely on the business brief, which we have not even seen and which will not be published before the Bill receives Royal Assent.
<P>
The notes on clauses and the Customs and Excise press release lead us to believe that the phrase is intended to cover avoidance only, but the legal precedent is for a wider interpretation. I do not understand what the hon. Lady was talking about, I read out the judgment, and it interprets the phrase ``protection of the revenue'' more widely. Nothing in the schedule or the Bill overrules that case.
<P>
We are expected to rely on a Customs and Excise brief, which we have not seen. I do not believe that such a brief can overrule the legal precedent of a tribunal case. I look forward to the Paymaster General's full response on that point.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 29 to 31 cover issues connected with the appeal procedure, which the Committee has touched on briefly. Those will be right of appeal against the new powers only on the basis of a judicial review. No appeal will be possible against the grounds for a decision, or because new facts have come to light; an appeal can be based only on whether the commissioners acted in a reasonable way. <P>
This is of huge concern to those bodies that expressed a view on the issue. For example, the Institute of Indirect Taxation has said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Although there is a right of appeal this is extremely limited. Under paragraph 4 of Schedule 2 all that the VAT tribunal is entitled to do is consider whether, when the Officer formed his opinion, he could have been reasonably satisfied that there were grounds for giving the notice. It cannot question whether a reasonable Officer would have carried out further inquiries. It cannot question whether the Officer's opinion was right or wrong or, indeed, even whether on the facts available to the Officer at the time he made his decision the tribunal would have arrived at the same decision. All it can ask itself is whether the Officer acted irrationally or in a biased manner.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Law Society, to which I know the Economic Secretary does not want to listen, is also concerned. It says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``We consider that the proposed new section 84 ... unjustifiably limits the jurisdiction of the tribunal ... If the only circumstances in which a tribunal may allow an appeal are those where it considered the Commissioners could not reasonably be satisfied that the date was appropriate, the taxpayer is left in a very uncertain position.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<H5>4 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
That is also the view of the Institute of Chartered Accountants. It is the view of Mr. Peter Jenkins, a tax partner at Ernst and Young, who was quoted in the Financial Times as saying:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``This is another attempt to limit the role of the tribunal to a simply supervisory one.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Institute of Chartered Accountants said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``We are very concerned with the appeal procedure as set out in proposed section 84(4C) ... This limits the Tribunal's role to a supervisory one. It enables Customs and Excise to reverse discretionary powers to themselves to be the sole interpreters of what they meant in the first place.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is not acceptable The whole schedule is unacceptable. It is littered with subjective phrases. The phrase, ``protection of the revenue'' sets a tribunal precedent and means any measure to raise more revenue for the Government. Against all that mess, the appeal procedure is limited to what amounts to judicial review. The amendment is vital if we are to make the schedule acceptable. Without it, the schedule will cause enormous difficulties for business throughout the country.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I shall start by clarifying for the Committee the definition of the phrase, "protection of the revenue''. Frankly, the hon. Gentleman's allegation that Customs would deliberately de-group in order to raise more VAT is outrageous. The proposals make no change to the protection of the revenue. His picture of an Armageddon, created by problems resulting from the actions of Customs and Excise officials--professional officials, following legislation and the intent of Parliament--is a disgrace and he should withdraw his remarks. That has not happened and there is no reason on earth why it should happen, given the professionalism of our officials. The measure provides clarification and removes uncertainty. I asked Customs to publish its business brief on when the revenue protection powers will be encoded to ensure that everyone understands that, whatever the tribunal has said about how widely we can interpret `protection of the revenue', Customs intends to proceed in the same way as it has always done. The problem mentioned by the hon. Gentleman will not arise because officials working for Her Majesty's Government would not do such a thing. I am aghast that he suggests that they would.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Will the hon. Lady give way?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> Only if the hon. Gentleman will apologise to the officials whom he claims would act in that way. Otherwise I shall not give way to him.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb indicated dissent.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> Retrospection was then suggested--
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Will the hon. Lady give way? She is wrong to make these allegations against me. I did not say that Customs officials will act in an unreasonable way. My point is that they can act unreasonably, and that people, generally, act unreasonably throughout society. Customs officials are no different from any anyone else in society, so it is important that the law should prevent people from acting unreasonably in this instance. Customs and Excise has enormous powers, which ordinary people outside the revenue--raising bodies do not have.
<P>
On the specific issue of protecting the revenue, I know that Customs and Excise will not immediately use this power to break up groups willy nilly to raise more revenue, but the law would allow it to do so. What is the point of creating a law that is badly drafted? If the Paymaster General is so convinced that Customs and Excise has no intention of breaking up groups to raise revenue, she should accept the amendment because it would ultimately make no difference to the practice.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The hon. Gentleman continues to misunderstand the current law. Moreover, there will be no change to the law in relation to grouping as a result of the schedule. My advice to him is that when he is in a hole, he should stop digging. He should find another point to advance. The Finance Bill is worthy of a more sophisticated argument than, ``Sometimes people act badly, therefore we should suspect the actions of Customs and Excise with regard to grouping''. That is simply daft.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> Will the Minister tell us where in the schedule the Government are trying to narrow the definition that was put forward in the VAT tribunal case to which the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton referred?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> Yes, I am coming to the point about the definition of ``protection of the revenue''.
<P>
My first point is that Opposition members are suggesting that something has changed, and that the schedule seeks to confer wider powers. It does not. Secondly, they asked a question about a tribunal ruling that suggested that there should be wider powers, and then asked what the Government, or Customs and Excise, intended to do about it. Those were two separate propositions that were conflated in their argument, to facilitate the passing of the amendment. They are, none the less, important points that should be addressed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Will the hon. Lady give way?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I would like to make some progress. Allegations have been made, especially regarding protection of the revenue, and the statement to be made on the matter in the business brief. In relation to retrospection--
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> Will the hon. Lady give way?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> Will the right hon. Gentleman forgive me? I should like to deal with the points that have already been made, before he makes any more. I was generous to him in giving way last time, and I will be happy to do so again. The only question so far has been whether Customs would be unpleasant enough to act in a way for which there was no provision under the law.
<P>
I shall turn to the matter of retrospection. There is no retrospection in the case of a body's removal from a group on the grounds of protection of the revenue. That leads me to the other point that the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton made, when he suggested that Customs might say, ``Got to protect the revenue, need more VAT, whip the companies out of the group''. There is no retrospection for such removals. They can only be carried out from the current date. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman can grasp that fact.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton then talked about the phrase, ``it appears'', describing it as a subjective phrase, and said that Governments past and present used the concept of protection of the revenue. <P>
He said that companies would not know why they had been refused and asked whether they would be told. The answer is yes. They will be given reasons. If a business does not provide the full facts, a decision will be made on what are believed to be the full facts. If the company then provides a little more information in case grouping is refused and it appears against the decision, the further information would be considered by Customs and Excise and would influence its decision on whether the company should be removed from the group. It is a pity that the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton missed our first debate, because we discussed fully how Customs would ensure that businesses were informed of the facts and why the decision was taken.
<P>
Another question concerned the tribunal's powers and why they are being limited to rulings on whether the commissioners came to a reasonable decision. The area in which the tribunal'' powers are limited in that way is when Customs exercises the discretion that has been given to it in law. Customs and Excise is charged with the care and management of the tax system. It is best placed to make decisions on the appropriate course of information in a given set of circumstances and the tribunal's role is to ensure that the powers are exercised reasonably. That has always been the tribunal's role in connection with the care and management responsibilities of Customs and Excise. Nothing has changed.
<P>
If Opposition Members want to change the balance and to remove from Customs and Excise some of its responsibility for care and management and give it to the tribunal, they should be more honest and not try to dress it up in terms of Customs behaving unreasonably.
<P>
I was then asked a series of questions about what happens if the tribunal decides in a company's favour when that company has been told that it will be removed from a group. If the tribunal decides that, although the facts of the case may have been subsequently supplied to the tribunal and not to Customs and Excise, the company should be allowed into the group, the appeal is upheld, Customs' decision to refuse the application is overturned and the company enters the group. That is a direct, immediate and reasonable appeal procedure. Why are hon. Gentlemen having such difficulty in grasping that?
<P>
When the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton came into the Room, we were discussing the decision in the National Westminster case. The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton acknowledged that the tribunal broadened the interpretation of necessary for the protection of revenue. I have asked Customs to publish a business brief to clarify when the powers will be used so that we can provide more certainty to business. A company will normally be removed from a group for the protection of revenue only if it appears to Customs that it is engaged in a VAT avoidance scheme, membership of the group threatens the collectability of tax, or the revenue loss associated with its membership of the group goes beyond the natural consequences of grouping. Those are the rules that Customs and Excise has operated and will continue to operate when interpreting revenue protection powers.
<P>
It is right that Customs has broad powers and some discretion, as has long been provided in our legislation. That is to ensure that abuse is dealt with adequately. Believe it or not, abuse happens--some people do not want to pay the tax that they are supposed to pay. To deal with that problem, it is sometimes necessary to draft legislation in broad terms. That approach has been adopted in the anti-avoidance legislation that both the present and the previous Governments have introduced. It is the conventional way to proceed.
<P>
In relation to the change in the grouping rules, Customs and Excise has had revenue protection powers since the introduction of the relevant tax. That returns us to the beginning of our debate, when the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton said that in an effort to generate more income from VAT, de-groupings would be forced. Customs and Excise has had the right of removal since the creation of the tax, but the outcome that the hon. Gentleman described has not happened, and there is no reason to believe that it will happen. 
<P>
<H5>4.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I hope that the Committee will reject the amendments. They would fundamentally undermine the powers that Customs and Excise needs to preserve the balance that I discussed earlier, which relates to the automatic right to enter a group, and would involve removing the 90-day rule. Custom and Excise needs to protect the revenue. The power will not be abused as the hon. Gentleman suggested.

<P>

<B>Mr. Jack:</B> I shall begin my discussion of the amendments tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton with a note of admonishment for the Paymaster General. I was disappointed that her response to genuine and careful probing by Opposition Members became somewhat testy. We were merely seeking to clarify the Bill's terminology. The hon. Lady seemed to suggest that because we had the temerity to ask questions, we were trying to introduce such lax legislation that the entire VAT regime would become vulnerable. We have every right to ask searching questions about the Bill's terminology. It is the duty of the Opposition to do that and, in my judgment, it is the duty of Ministers to reply without getting angry.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. There is a Division in the House. In order to give Committee members a short break after the Division, I suggest that we reconvene at ten minutes to 5.
<P>
<H5>4.17 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Sitting suspended for a Division in the House.
<P>
<H5>4.50 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
On resuming
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> I am grateful to you, Mr. Butterfill, for providing us with an opportunity for rest and refreshment, which permits us to resume our probing of the Bill with vigour.
<P>
Before we adjourned, I was saying that in my judgment it was proper for the Opposition to ask the Paymaster General technical and searching questions on our own behalf and on behalf of other bodies that have an interest in these matters. I hope that she will not be so testy in her response to me.
<P>
I said during our debate on the sittings motion that the Pepper v. Hart decision meant that people outside the House read carefully what we say. The Paymaster General sought to give the impression that the provisions in clause 13 and the schedule were not really very different from those that are already in existence. What, she seemed to ask, was all the fuss about? It is interesting that practitioners in the field are exercised by the proposed powers, and that they have posed certain questions. If the situation was, as the Paymaster General suggested, much the same, this debate might not be necessary.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> If the right hon. Gentleman consults Hansard, he will find that I was responding to the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, who discussed what actions Customs and Excise officials might take in relation to groupings. I explained that the rules that applied when VAT was created are still in operation. I was responding to that point and to no other.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> I am grateful to the Paymaster General for clarifying the position. That was not quite how it came across earlier--one sometimes needs an action replay to see where the foul occurred, and for what reasons.
<P>
I have dealt with some of the officials whom the Paymaster General sought to defend, as any good Minister would do. She and I know that even in the best-ordered officialdoms mistakes and misjudgments can occasionally occur. My hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton teased out an interesting point about the limitations of the appeals procedure. He made it clear that the reasonableness of an officer could be directly questioned, but not necessarily the facts that led to the judgment. The amendments that my hon. Friend moved would deal with that deficiency and with the difference between reasonableness and judgment. Many people outside the House have raised questions about the appeals mechanism. We shall return to that matter in a moment.
<P>
The schedule deals with a matter that has been the subject of debate on previous Finance Bills. Customs and Excise withdrew from the field hurt the previous time that it tried to take action in this regard. Once again, it is seeking to introduce new and novel- procedures.
<P>
The Paymaster General gave the impression that many of the schedule's powers merely replicate powers that already exist. However, the notes on clauses confound my understanding of her view. In relation to proposed new section 43C to the Value Added Tax Act 1994, the notes on clauses state: ``The change''--which clearly suggests that something must have altered--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``means that, Customs will now be able to remove companies from groups when it appears that any of the eligibility criteria are no longer met, or when necessary for the protection of the revenue.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Paymaster General failed to distinguish the before-and-after effect so that we might judge more accurately whether the amendments tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton should be approved. 
<P>
The wording in the notes on clauses is clear. Something has changed. My hon. Friend's questions are justified. The Paymaster General indicate earlier from a sedentary position that by asking for information about how the tests in the schedule were to be applied, we were creating a tax-avoidance charter. I appreciate that tax law has to be regularly re-examined and honed to deal with those who try to find ways round it. Preserving the revenue is an important objective, but I am concerned about how the tests are applied. At the heart of the matter is the fact that grouping could be designated legitimate tax planning. For a group of associated companies, where exempt supplies may be involved, it could be a case of doing the right thing. 
<P>
There is also the matter of artificial avoidance. The Paymaster General should help us to distinguish between the legitimate and the illegitimate, She did not clarify that to the satisfaction of outside observers. She tried to, and the missing document may supply answers, but as my hon. Friend said, we are being asked to take that document on trust and to accept that it will give sufficient clarification for businesses to know where they stand.
<P>
I am not clear what will happen when new companies come into an existing group and, by virtue of their arrival, cause a reduction, in global terms, of VAT revenue. The second test is the protection of the revenue. I understand what that means in a broad sense. If someone blatantly sets out to create a VAT tax-avoidance vehicle to reduce payments artificially by millions of pounds, that is obvious and would be noticed by customs officials, but what about borderline cases? By moving in and out of groups, companies could encounter different activities and arrangements. It is not clear whether, if that affected the overall VAT take, that would be the trigger for proposed new section 43C to come into effect,
<P>
We should reflect on the Institute of Directors' briefing. It stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The power, given by new section 43C(1) and (2), to remove companies from groups where that is necessary for the protection of the revenue is far too wide. It could be interpreted to mean that if grouping led to less VAT being paid than would have been the case without grouping (and without restructuring into a single company), the revenue was threatened and the group should be broken up.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Paymaster General may regard that as a hypothetical point, but the mems of the Institute of Directors, who live in the real world, do not. They legitimately raise that key point and her response to it will enable us to judge the worth of my hon. Friend's amendments.
<P>
The Institute of Directors went on to say:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``This would be wholly unacceptable, and would only be justifed on the basis that the grouping represents a loss to the Exchequer. It does not represent such a loss. Grouping merely reduces the VAT to what it would have been if a group were structured as a single company.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Those are business manoeuvrings, but they are a result of what happens in the real world. They are real issues and they reflect other concerns that my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton has raised. 
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
We also discussed the operation of the VAT tribunal, but the Paymaster General's response glossed over the points raised. My hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton read out a section of the submission from the Institute of Indirect Taxation, which pointed out that the right of appeal will be extremely limited. As she is a good constituency Member of Parliament, I am sure that the Paymaster General, from time to time, will have met people who have had dealings with Her Majesty's Customs and Excise. It is a powerful body with powers that are widely drawn for understandable reasons. Under the schedule, the rights of appeal are severely limited, and it surprises me that the Paymaster General is as happy to accept the status quo as she claims. 
<P>
I am not entirely convinced that the new powers do not include any new deviances. A compare and contrast operation might help the Paymaster General to convince the Committee that her judgment is correct and that there is no difference between this and any other appeal mechanism operated by Customs and Excise. Will she tell the Committee which parts of the appropriate Acts and statutes are worded in precisely the same way as the provisions in this schedule? I have the impression that there are differences, because if they were the same, the notes on clauses would have said so, and we would not have received letters that probe those differences.
<P>
People have a basic right to understand how judgments are formed so that they may counter them through any appeal mechanism, but the appeals mechanism cannot question whether, for example, a reasonable officer would have carried out further inquiries. Unless the amendmens are accepted, the mechanism will be a recipe for disaster. Committee members would be rightly criticised if we knowingly agreed to it and did not challenge it. I hope that the Paymaster General can provide some further elucidation, as we need a clear definition on which to base our judgments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> The Paymaster General referred to groupings and whether a company could be forced to de-group by Her Majesty's Customs and Excise. She said that Her Majesty's Customs and Excise would never do that. Why, therefore, is she asking the Committee to pass proposed new section 43C(1) and (2)? I shall read out what the Bill says, as it is buried deep in the schedule. Proposed new section 43C(1) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Commissioners may, by notice given to a body corporate, terminate its treatment as a member of a group from a date''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Proposed new section 43C(2) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Commissioners may give a notice under subsection (1) above only if it appears to them to be necessary for the protection of the revenue.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Her Majesty's Customs and Excise may therefore give such notice to protect the revenue. 
<P>
Proposed new subsection (3) continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the Commissioners shall, by notice given to the body, terminate its treatment as a member of the group from a date specified in the notice.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That gives Customs and Excise all the powers that it needs, but proposed new section 5 widens those powers even further. That is wrong. Finance Bills should not seek to establish such wide powers.
<P>
Where schedule 9A of the Value Added Tax Act 1994 attempted to restrict the powers of Her Majesty's Customs and Excise through anti-avoidance legislation, proposed new sub-paragraph (2) will remove that legislation. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``This paragraph shall not apply where the relevant event is the termination of a body corporate's treatment as a member of a group by a notice under section 43C(1) or (3)''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Those are the sections that I read out.
<P>
Why is the Committee being asked to grant such wide powers to Her Majesty's Customs and Excise? If the Paymaster General is to justify those enormous powers, she must explain why the Value Added Tax Act 1994 did not work. What aspect of the anti avoidance provisions did companies circumvent that required the establishment of those powers? Rather than narrowing the powers in the light of the National Westminster bank case, the Bill will widen them greatly. The Paymaster General should tell the Committee why those powers are needed.

<P>

<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The powers deal with ineligibility. It may be determined, as a result of a tribunal, that a company is ineligible for a group because the law with regard to qualification was extra-statutory. Committee members will understand that the question of eligibility--that is, a fixed position in the UK--is one of the reasons for the provision. Where companies have formed a group, but circumstances have changed and a particular company should no longer belong to it, powers will exist to remove that company.
<P>
I should tell the hon. Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown) that there is no section 43C(5). Nevertheless, I think that I understand his point. If I have misunderstood, I shall happily give way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> It is paragraph 5 to schedule 2, not section 43C(5).
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The tribunal will be able to spot mistakes and misjudgments, and to decide whether a judgment is unreasonable and a company should in fact enter the group.
<P>
The hon. Member for Cotswold also mentioned a before-and-after scenario. In the past, the power to remove came into force when control ceased; henceforth, it will come into force when any of the eligibility conditions are not met. In respect of revenue protection, there will be an extended power to remove over 90 days. Once companies are grouped, there is a level playing field. It will then be possible to decide that a particular company cannot be included in the group because it does not fulfil the eligibility criteria. In all cases, companies will be informed and will have a right of appeal to the tribunal. If the tribunal decides that Customs made mistakes or misjudgments, it can conclude that the decision is unreasonable and restore the company to the group.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> I am grateful for the Paymaster General's efforts to clarify these important points. I understand that Customs has<P>
 no pre-transaction ruling. Can she clarify what advice or discussion will be available to a company in a group to enable it, before making a change, to establish whether that change would comply with the rules?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> Going back to the point about what happens before and after, the right hon. Gentleman said compare and contrast. The provision extends the right of appeal. Under the old legislation, there is no right of appeal against removal of a company from a group for ineligibility. With effect from Royal Assent, the powers of Customs to remove companies from groups will be subject to a right of appeal. The new powers specifically make the decision subject to a right of appeal. I suggest to the right hon. Gentleman that that explanation does not fit well with the allegation that rights are being taken away from companies or that extra acquisition is going on.
<P>
I am sure that Opposition Members accept that it is conceivable that if a company in a group--it may have entered the group some time ago--were subjected to the present criteria for eligibility to be in the group, it might not satisfy that eligibility. The process is, therefore, in place for the company to be notified and if it can prove that it is still eligible, the position remains.
<P>
I return to the point made by the hon. Member for North-East Herefordshire--
<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> North-East Hertfordshire.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I am sorry. The hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire (Mr. Heald) referred to the importance of the grouping facility to businesses. I emphasised in the debate, and I do so again now, that the Government recognise the importance of the facility. We are trying to make the relationship between Customs and business fair, not to undermine or to start the process of undermining the facility for companies to go into groups.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Fylde asked whether anything else was subject to the right of appeal. Appeals can be made to the VAT and duties tribunal against, first, a refusal of any application to form, join, leave or disband a group or change a representative member; secondly, any notice to remove a company from a group for ineligibility; thirdly, a notice to remove a company from a group for protection of revenue; and, finally, any anti-avoidance notice issued under schedule 9A of the Value Added Tax Act 1994.
<P>
I am sad that the hon. Gentleman thinks that my argument is that Customs always gets it right. I know that he has considerable experience and none of us is infallible. When drafting legislation, even draft proposals going to parliamentary counsel do not always come out quite as intended, but the provisions are clear and fair.
<P>
The hon. Member for Cotswold asked why Customs needs the additional powers to remove companies from groups. We are trying to address the current inequity whereby companies applying to be grouped can be refused, but others, which are already grouped, present the same concerns but continue to be allowed to take advantage of the facility. If this measure is about business facilitation, about being fair and maintaining the benefits that companies can acquire from grouping, it seems entirely reasonable that we should have that right to remove. However, as I have explained to the Committee, that right is clearly qualified by the rights of appeal.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
In all the points that hon. Members have raised, they have been happy to accept that the 90-day requirement should go, and that businesses should have the automatic right to group on request. However, they do not seem to accept that there should be a balancing right for Customs to deal with the problem of any companies that are in a group but should not be, on the basis of the ineligibility criteria or any other criteria that I have listed. The new powers, to which the hon. Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown) referred--
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> I am sure that I heard my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton right when he pledged himself to be in favour of measures that were designed to stop the improper avoidance of tax. We have tried to probe the operation of what appear to be new arrangements laid out in the schedule, which is the subject of the amendments. I hope that the Paymaster General will withdraw the slight slur on our good reputation for wanting people to pay proper taxes in properly defined circumstances.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I do not believe that I made such a slur. When I responded very sharply, it was in response to the point made by the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton that Customs might decide to de-group in order to collect more VAT for the Exchequer, because I considered that to be an unacceptable proposition. I am sure that, as we move on to discuss other anti avoidance measures in the Bill, the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton will not be slow to say when he support the Government's action, although I do not expect him to go so far as to vote with us.
<P>
I have fully explained to the Committee why these powers, and the checks and balances on the use of these powers, are necessary. I have also explained how important they are, not only to maintain a fair relationship between Customs and business, but to foster fair relationships within the business community, so that businesses can make tax-planning decisions in order to compete with other groups on an equal basis. For these reasons, we have suggested--and we have the support of a substantial section of the business community--the changes that are before the Committee. I urge hon. Members to vote against the amendment if it is pressed to a Division.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> No one objects to strong anti-avoidance legislation. The previous Government set a record in the history of tax legislation by passing more anti-avoidance legislation than any Government in history. When I joined the tax practice, KPMG,--Pete Marwick, as it was then--all tax legislation was in one relatively slim volume of Butterworths. By the time that I left, that volume had turned into three, and on much thinner paper. Therefore, the Conservative party has a good record on anti avoidance legislation.
<P>
We welcome the opportunity for companies to be grouped from the day of their application and to be de-grouped only if the application is refused. However, legislation must reflect the clear intention of Parliament, and it is clear that it does not. The Paymaster General said that Executive action would be taken to give a new interpretation to the legislation. She said that she would ensure that Customs and Excise would tell companies why their applications for grouping had not been allowed. But nothing in the legislation requires it to do that. She is giving a different interpretation of the law that we are being asked to pass.
<P>
The Paymaster General also said that if we were to remove the phrase ``it appears to them'' from the Bill, we would create a tax-avoidance charter. Let us take one example of where that phrase is slotted in. New section 43B(5) says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Commissioners may refuse an application, within the period of 90 days starting with the day on which it was received by them, if it appears to them ... in the case of an application such as is mentioned in subsection (1) above, that the bodies corporate are not eligible under section 43A(1) to be treated as members of a group.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If we remove the phrase ``it appears to them'', the new section reads:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Commissioners may refuse an application, within the period of 90 days starting with the day on which it was received by them, if ... in the case of an application such as is mentioned in subsection (1) above, that the bodies corporate are not eligible under section 43A(1)''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The only difference is to remove the subjective phrase ``it appears to them''. It should not be a case of whether ``it appears to them''. What matters is whether a company is or is not eligible under new section 43A. That has an impact on the appeal procedure and the just application of tax law to companies.
<P>
The Paymaster General objected to the fact that I said that Customs may--I did not say would--have a power to remove a company from a group solely on the grounds that the Government could raise more money by ejecting it from that group, but that is what the legislation will allow. I do not know whether Customs will use that power, but before the Labour party came into office that power did not exist, and after the schedule is passed, it will exist. She has created the possibility for Customs to eject companies from a group for the purpose of raising more revenue.
<P>
The Paymaster General said that I had misunderstood the NatWest case, but that is not correct--I did not disagree with her. The case expands the definition of the phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``for the protection of the revenue''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
to include not only companies or groups engaged in tax avoidance, but those that are not. The phrase gives the Government power to act in circumstances other than tax avoidance. It could be used on the basis of the law as interpreted by the tribunal to remove a company from a group solely to enable the Government to raise more revenue.
<P>
The Paymaster General claimed that the NatWest case would make no difference to the way in which Customs and Excise, by executive action, applies the law. That may be so, but we are concerned about the law as it stands. The tribunal, which set a precedent, interpreted the law as meaning that Customs and Excise can--not necessarily will--remove companies from a group to try to raise more money. She quoted from what I suspect was the first or second draft of the business brief that will temper the powers of Customs and Excise, and used three succinct phrases to explain how Customs and Excise will interpret the term,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the protection of revenue''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The third phrase, which was the only one that I managed to write down, was that the protection of the revenue will be relevant if it appears to Customs and Excise that the revenue loss goes beyond the natural consequence of grouping. The Government will interpret that phrase to mean avoidance. It will apply to circumstances that go beyond the reduced revenue that results from the natural consequence of being grouped.
<P>
Why was that three-part phrase not incorporated into the Bill? It would not have taken up much space. It is a simple definition of ``protection of the revenue'' that should have been incorporated into the schedule. Had that been done, we could have saved an hour and a half of debating time, allayed the concerns expressed by outside bodies, and probably prevented a great deal of litigation in future.
<P>
A simple VAT business brief does not overrule the legal precedent set by a VAT tribunal. However, that could have been achieved by incorporating the phrase into the Bill. The Paymaster General should table an amendment on Report that incorporates the phrase from the business brief into the Bill. Will the Minister also provide copies of that draft of the business brief to all members of the Committee, so that we can see it before Report?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The hon. Gentleman, in his desire to scrutinise the meaning of the phrase ``it appears to them'', has lost the point. I shall outline the effect that his amendment would have.
<P>
Customs could make a judgment on the basis of information provided by a company---information as ``it appears to them''. The case could then go to appeal, during which the company could provide additional information that had not previously been available to Customs. The officials presiding over the appeal would be at an advantage over Customs because they would have more facts at their fingertips. Customs would have made its judgment on the information as it appeared to them at the time.
<P>
Under the amendment, companies would not be able to provide information to Customs, chance their arm and then wait to see whether they succeeded on appeal in getting into the group.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Why would companies do that?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> Perhaps I should say, ``Touch''. Why would Customs officers deliberately take a company out of a group in order to raise more revenue? Perhaps companies would hope that they could get away with a lower tax liability. I do not know. The hon. Gentleman does not want to accept that suggestion. The hon. Gentleman thinks that Customs makes mistakes, but companies do not. Customs would therefore get blamed for its own mistakes and those of the companies. That is unreasonable.
<P>
The schedule provides for Customs to make a decision on the basis of information supplied. An appeal can then decide whether that was reasonable, and if more information is introduced to show that a different decision should have been made, that can be dealt with at that time.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton also asked why the definition was not in the Bill. There are circumstances in which the inclusion of a company that is not entitled to full input tax recovery could lead to an unacceptable revenue loss. The term ``protection of the revenue'' is not susceptible to interpretation in the regulations, unlike the concepts of care and management. The appeals procedure functions as a double check. I have explained that the grouping process can be permissive, which allows businesses to vary their group composition. That requires constant reappraisal of their input tax recovery methods.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Customs and excise is charged by Parliament with the care and management of the tax. The relevant principle cannot be defined in law; the previous Government did not attempt to define it. The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton asked why the principle was not included in the Bill, but I have a sneaking feeling that he really knows why it is not there. He rightly said that he has much personal experience as an accountant, and he is familiar with the complexities that can arise. 
<P>
In view of the help to business that is available, the balance that is needed in relation to the powers of Customs and Excise, the right of appeal, the information that is provided and the speed with which decisions about companies can be made, the hon. Gentleman has not proved the need for the amendments. I am not convinced that they are necessary, and I advise my hon. Friends to vote against them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The Paymaster General forgets that we are debating new powers. My right hon. Friend the Member for Fylde obtained from the Paymaster General an admission that Customs would acquire additional powers. She gave her interpretation of how the new powers will be used, and her definition of the phrase, ``protection of the revenue''. That matter has been widely debated and the relevant issues have been aired. The Pepper v. Hart decision may assist businesses in this context. We may return to the matter on Report when we have studied the new definition of the phrase in Hansard. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn .
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 52, in page 95, line 15, at end insert---
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``43D. In sections 43B(5)(c) and 43C(2) above the power of the Commissioners to refuse an application to be treated as a member or members of a group or to terminate the treatment of a body corporate as a member of a group on the grounds that it is necessary for the protection of the revenue shall not be interpreted as meaning that the Commissioners have the power to refuse such an application or to terminate treatment as a member of a group on the grounds that a company or a number of companies make exempt supplies or would be unable to fully recover VAT incurred on supplies made between companies if they were not members of the same group.''<P>
</UL></FONT>.
<P>
In her summary of the previous debate, the Paymaster General said that the background of the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton as a practitioner would help him to understand why the guidelines could not be put in regulations or primary legislation. I do not have such a background, and I did not understand the Government's rationale. She did not explain why the guidelines could not be incorporated into law. I agree with the hon. Gentleman that it would be courteous to give Committee members the guidelines before we reach Report stage. The Government should introduce an amendment on Report to put those guidelines into law. Companies would then know which laws they would have to deal with.
<P>
Amendment No. 52 attempts to clarify what the guidelines might mean in so far as they apply to partly exempt companies. In our previous debate we discussed the importance of grouping, especially as it relates to partly exempt companies. In view of the history of the subject, the amendment seeks clarification for such companies.
<P>
After the last Budget but one, the Government published a consultation paper on the restriction of VAT groups to fully taxable corporate bodies. The main suggestion in that paper was that partly exempt companies would no longer be able to join, or to remain a member of, a group. The Government have moved away from that position--at least, that is what they are telling us today. However, the history of this subject, means that we need firm reassurances that the Government have no intention of de-grouping partly exempt companies. I appreciate that we have touched on that matter, so my contribution to this debate will not be long.
<P>
If the Government's intention is not to target partly exempt companies, ideally they should accept the amendment. That would make it clear that the change in the rules on VAT grouping were not targeted at partly exempt companies. If the Government cannot do that, will the Paymaster General state clearly that the power being given to Customs cannot be used to prevent the normal consequences of VAT grouping, especially the ability for partly exempt companies to make supply to each other without being liable for tax on that supply?
<P>
Is the VAT saving achieved when a partly exempt company joins a VAT group a natural consequence of that grouping or not? Like the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, I was frantically jotting down the guidelines when they were announced to the Committee, and the Paymaster General did say that de-grouping would not occur if the tax saved did not exceed the natural consequence of grouping. Will she say whether that criterion applies only to partly exempt companies?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I do not intend to repeat the same points again. The shortness of the hon. Gentleman's speech shows that he has accepted that many of the points that concern him have been aired, even if he is not happy with the Government's responses.
<P>
The amendment would undermine our important changes to the grouping rules. As I said to the hon. Gentleman, the power to remove companies from groups on revenue protection grounds will enable Customs to counter abuse and avoidance in the same way as when it considers grouping applications. Where a company has joined a group, and the group has changed, it is reasonable to apply the test again. I cannot understand why that is such a huge problem. Why should a decision be made for all time, regardless of any changes in companies? If a company no longer complies with the criteria for joining a group, why should it be allowed to stay in that group?
<P>
I do not intend to prevent companies from grouping merely because they are not entitled to recover all their input tax. That is the undertaking that the hon. Gentleman seeks. As tax is lost through the grouping facility, why does the hon. Gentleman regard it as unreasonable for the Government to consult about whether grouping is still working well, whether any changes are necessary and whether the arrangements justify the revenue forgone? Those are reasonable questions to pose.
<P>
Clause 13 represents the Government saying, ``We are committed to grouping, business has asked us to make some changes to it, and it must be based on a fair balance of powers''. If the hon. Gentleman checks the record, he will find that the right hon. Member for Fylde suggested that the natural consequences of the grouping should be equated with what would happen if that group were one company. He understood what ``natural consequences'' might mean--he has more experience of Treasury matters than some, of course--and I do not understand why other Committee members are struggling with the idea. I urge the Committee to reject the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> We have no problem with the Government consulting on whether the grouping rules are working properly. That is the normal practice of Governments and it is right to ensure that the tax system's rules are not being used to avoid paying tax. The Paymaster General got half way towards giving me the reassurance that I sought. The amendment's purpose is to establish that, in determining the interpretation of the phrase, ``protection of the revenue'' that Customs and Excise will use--which was clarified in the guidelines to which the Paymaster General referred--the Government do not intend that VAT savings achieved by a partly exempt company will be interpreted as a means of circumventing the tax laws.

<P>

<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> These measures are not targeted on partly exempt companies. However, in respect of all groups, additional revenue loss, which was considered the natural consequence of grouping, will constitute a legitimate consideration with regard to ``protection of the revenue''. If the hon. Gentleman is asking whether the measures are a means to deal with partly exempt companies only, I can reassure him that that is not the case. If that is his only problem, I do not know what else I can say to reinforce the point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> Those who read the report of our proceedings will find those words very helpful. On that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Will the Paymaster General explain why the European Union requires details of sales made by UK businesses to businesses registered in other member states?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> It has always required such details as part of the regulations on VAT. The clause will simply ensure that the legislation will deal with the specific point on a two-year period for assessing penalties. It will not disturb or change any other part of that aspect of VAT legislation. In the past, Customs has always required that point to be covered in the legislation.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> On the surface, the clause appears sensible, in that it closes the loophole whereby a VAT repayment return might be submitted more than 30 days before entitlement to repayment, which led to a theoretical 5 per cent. interest repayment supplement. Closing theoretical loopholes is all very well; we could close all such loopholes in tax legislation and, in doing so, triple the amount of tax legislation.
<P>
The Law Society has stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``We are surprised that the early submission of VAT returns is described as VAT avoidance.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Will the Minister clarify for the Committee the extent of the avoidance that the clause would close and the estimated lost revenue?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> It is not appropriate for Ministers to give examples of cases in which applications were made to reclaim VAT beyond the 30-day period and with expectation of the supplement. However, I assure the hon. Gentleman that such applications have been made. We are seeking to close the loophole by clarifying when the 30-day period starts in relation to the repayment supplement. The move is necessary because the loophole is vulnerable to exploitation. The difference in the wording of the legislation could lead to a significant loss of revenue. The Government believe that the modest change is prudent because we have already seen attempts to claim back money to which the claimants were not entitled.
<P>
I am sure that the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton will understand that it would be inappropriate for me to give details of the case.

<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The clause is being introduced to tidy up our legislation following a European Union case against Italy. The case concerned subscriptions to political and other bodies, which the United Kingdom considered to be outside the scope of VAT but which need to be recategorised as exempt from VAT. All that is required is a simple, two-line amendment to group 9 in schedule 9 of the Value Added Tax 1994. That is clear from the draft statutory instrument that has already been published. Why did the Government not make that simple amendment in clause 17 instead of going to the trouble of introducing a separate statutory instrument?
<P>
The clause has been necessitated by a European Court of Justice case, Commission v. Italian Republic, which required Italy to comply with article 13 of the sixth directive, under which exempt supplies cannot be treated as outside the scope of VAT. Article 13Al(1) deals with
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``supply of services and goods closely linked thereto for the benefit of their members in return for a subscription fixed in accordance with their rules by non-profit-making organisations with aims of a political, trade-union, religious, patriotic, philosophical, philanthropic or civic nature''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Why have the Government not included the word ``civic'' in the draft statutory instrument?
<P>
The Institute of Chartered Accountants is concerned about the lack of consultation. It stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``We are puzzled at the inclusion of Clause 17. ... Customs have recently issued for consultation a technical note on this''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
 European Union case. The institute continued:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The deadline for responses is 21 May 1999. We find it hard to see how the requisite legislation can be drafted satisfactorily in advance of considering the responses to the consultation. This calls into question the genuine nature of the consultation.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The wider issue is that outside bodies are becoming concerned that they spend a lot of time and effort in responding to requests from the Government for opinions from outside bodies. The preparation of those documents takes a lot of expensive time outside the House and if no attention is paid to those consultations, future requests for consultations and opinions will be jeopardised. It is important not to be so blatant as to create a statutory instrument and clause before the consultation closure date has passed.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The hon. Gentleman asked about preparing for the European judgment. He knows that last year's judgment is complex and covers a number of issues. It has taken time to ensure that we have made the necessary changes.
<P>
The consultation date of 21 May was necessary to ensure that the responses of companies were received in time to enable us to make the proposal workable. We must fulfil our obligations. I am puzzled by the hon. Gentleman's concern that this enabling clause will be followed by delegated legislation, on which we will consult. He seemed to imply that that was not the proper way to proceed.
<P>
I am completely floored by the fact that the word ``civic'' is missing from the groups that are covered by the definition. I cannot assist him with that now. He will note that the organisations gain from the change in VAT liability by falling within the sixth directive. The clause represents a loss of revenue to the Government, not an increase in revenue from the taxpayer.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I hesitated to speak until the Paymaster General had dealt with the important point of my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton. Before we agree to the clause and the removal of section 94(3), we should pause for reflection. Section 94 is important. It deals with the meaning of business. Section 94(3) provides what activities are excluded from the definition of business which, otherwise, is extremely wide. Section 94(1) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``In this Act `business', includes any trade, profession or vocation.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The sixth directive includes a clear right for Governments in territories to exempt activities such as those of an educational or cultural nature. I am worried that the clause and the subsequent statutory instrument will limit the terms within which the exemptions are framed so that they are not wide enough. Although I understand why my amendment could not be debated, I believe that it would have been workable. There is a danger that the clause will inadvertently exclude the one step by which the Government could resolve the most important problem of the British art market.
<P>
At Treasury questions today, we heard an answer on this issue from the Paymaster General. Apparently, she believes that because the proposed changes to VAT in the art market were agreed by a Minister in a previous Administration, she can, without a blemish on her honour, lie back and think of Europe when this matter goes through at the end of June. But the problem for the Paymaster General and the Government is that, in this instance, they can do something to prevent a dramatic fall in the art market in this country, which it is agreed could cost an estimated 5,000 jobs. Many of those jobs are in London, but some are in other parts of the country, including my constituency of Guildford, from where I have received letters from constituents, including antiquarian booksellers.
<P>
Before going any further, I must declare a possible interest in this matter. I have a brother-in-law who runs an auction house in London, which he started himself, and which will be affected by the change. As he has said to me, and as representatives of the whole art market have said in their submissions to the Government, jobs will be taken from Britain and created elsewhere. At the moment, my brother-in-law happens to be involved in an art auction in Monaco, where, I believe, the writ of the European Union does not apply. He will have to make more sales in Geneva, Monaco and New York, and fewer in London, if VAT at 5 per cent. is imposed on art sales.
<P>
Under section 94, and under the terms of article 13 of the sixth directive, it is accepted that sales of art are, in effect, merely a cultural exchange, and it is simply a mistake in law for the European Union to describe sales of art as a value-added activity. A work of art falls within the definition in schedule 11 to the Value Added Tax Act 1994, and it is a mistake to suggest that any further value can be added to such property. Any change to a work of art will detract from its value. In that respect, a work of art is unlike any other product or commodity because any commodity can have value added to it by undergoing some process, and a work of art is unlike a property, which can be developed. Therefore, in law, a work of art should naturally be excluded.
<P>
Why is it that, in this country, we have never taxed the sale of works of art? It is because art is a cultural activity, and cultural activities may be exempted from VAT by a member of the European Union under the terms of article 13 of the sixth directive, provided that the activity meets one of the criteria set out in article 13. One of those criteria is that the activities of the body--an auction house or art dealer--shall not distort competition, so as to place at a disadvantage commercial entities that are liable to VAT. As we know from the submissions made by representatives of the art market to the Government, their case is that the people with whom they are in competition are not liable for VAT. The London art market is the only really international art market within the EU. There is nothing like it in Germany, France or elsewhere, and it is competing with other centres, such as Geneva and New York, where VAT is not applied. Therefore, if the Government were to exercise their rights under article 13, they could claim the justification that, in doing so, they were not distorting competition with other EU countries, and other companies in those countries that are subject to VAT.
<P>
I ask the Paymaster General to consider the matter very seriously. When I raised the matter with the Prime Minister in the House, there were roars of laughter on the Government Benches at the thought that 5,000 jobs in the art market might be lost. Those are not all jobs with high salaries that enable people to live fabulously comfortable lives. Some of the people who will lose their jobs are porters who handle and transport works of art, or other people who serve the business. Many of them are not at all well off, but they have been in the industry for many years and would find it difficult to get another job that provided the same reward and satisfaction. The business should be excluded under the clause precisely because it is a cultural activity. People who come to this country to buy works of art also spend a lot of money on other things, such as expensive London hotels, which employ many people. Their spending benefits the tourist trade greatly and adds to the general wealth of the town.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman has made his point. He is now trying to speak to his amendment, which, as he knows, would contravene the resolution. I have been tolerant in allowing him to make his point, but we must now return to the matter in hand.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I thank you for your tolerance, Mr. Butterfill, which is always appreciated by Opposition Members. I await the Paymaster General's response with great interest.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The hon. Gentleman owes me an apology. I hope that he will apologise now for the unacceptable language that he uses only when addressing women Committee members. If he is unable to consider apologising now for the slur against me, perhaps, after he has consulted Hansard, he will have the good grace to make that apology on a point of order at the beginning of the Committee's next sitting.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> If I have caused any offence to the hon. Lady I sincerely apologise. After fighting one election campaign, I was given an award by the Polite Society for being a courteous candidate. I would hate that to be jeopardised by any mischance, or by any misuse of words that was misunderstood by the hon. Lady. No slight on her was intended, and I sincerely apologise for the offending whisper.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> Clearly, that award was not made by the women in his constituency. Saying to a woman that she should,``lay back and think of Europe'' is unacceptable language and he should not have said it. That is a simple matter. I accept his apology, but his comments may explain why there are so few women Conservative Members. Perhaps he will be more careful about his use of language in future.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I am grateful to the Paymaster General for giving way again. We have important business to dispatch. I assure her that I meant no offence. What I meant to say was that she should sit back and think of Europe.
<P>
The Committee is considering an important matter, and we should get on with discussing it. I take offence myself at the suggestion that I have at any point insulted members of the opposite sex on either side of the House. I would be shocked if that were the case.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> In that case, when the learned Gentleman read Hansard, he will be shocked. His amendments were out of order, as you rightly said, Mr. Butterfill, because they were outside the resolution. The question of VAT on art was done and dusted by the previous Government, who signed on the dotted line. As for using a veto, the matter is already agreed and can be re-opened only on the basis of unanimity. If the hon. Gentleman is in such close contact with the art market he will know full well that we have been working extremely closely with the business. Those who work in it are complimentary about our efforts to resolve the mess left by the previous Government. No article 13(4)1A exists in the sixth directive. If he wishes to debate the issue I will be happy to respond to him at the appropriate time. He is welcome to put in for an Adjournment debate. I would love to debate the matter with him, but this is not the appropriate time.
<P>
I now have an answer to the question asked by the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton about the word ``civic''. I know that the clause hangs in the balance on the basis of why that word was or was not included. Apparently, civic bodies do not exist in the UK and we were unable to find any bodies that were not covered by existing definitions. In keeping with the hon. Gentleman's point about the incorporation in legislation of superfluous words, the word, ``civic'' was omitted.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I am grateful to the Paymaster General for that response. Given that the provision is based on an infraction proceeding and the case of the European Court of Justice Commission v. Italian Republic, we should bring our legislation into line with article 13a(l)(l) by adopting the same phraseology.
<P>
There are many civic organisations in this country. For example, committees that look after unadopted streets in residential areas are civic organisations. Many such organisations proliferate in areas such as Bognor Regis, where protection of communal areas and people on lower incomes is effected voluntarily through civic organisations. Such organisations should be included, particularly given the Government's trumpeting of community involvement. However, their interpretation of community involvement differs from most people's.

<H4><center>Starting rate</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory </B>(Wells): I beg to move amendment No. 53, in page 9, line 8, leave out subsection (7).
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss the following amendments: No. 62, in page 9, line 18, leave out subsections (8) and (9).
<P>
No. 63, in page 10, line 5, at end add---
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``(13)(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of the Income Tax Acts, an individual shall be charged to income tax at the starting rate on an amount of his income equal to the starting rate limit whatever the nature of that income.
<P>
(b) For the purposes of paragraph (a) above, income means total income as reduced by all deductions.
<P>
(c) Where the amount of income chargeable to income tax after deductions is less than the starting rate limit, paragraph (a) above shall apply only to the amount of income so chargeable.
<P>
(d) Where income tax at the lower rate has been borne on income chargeable at the starting rate any necessary repayment of tax shall be made on the making of a claim.''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> The clause will introduce a 10 per cent. starting rate of income tax. We welcome any reduction in taxation that might help to offset the huge increase in other forms of taxation that we have witnessed in the past three Budgets. The amendments would make the 10p rate a genuine starting rate that would be less partial and discriminatory.
<P>
The tax change was announced in a typically misleading way in the Budget speech. The Chancellor said that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``it will take effect in April 1999, a l0p starting rate on the first 1,500 of income''.<P>
</UL></FONT>--[Official Report, 9 March 1999; Vol. 327, c. 188.]<P>

<P>
That is incorrect. The starting rate will not apply to all income. For example, it will not apply to many forms of saving income. I regret to say that that misleading announcement was repeated in the ``Budget 99'' pamphlet, to which I have had cause to refer in previous debates in the House and in this Committee. The wording in the pamphlet is even worse. It baldly states that the Government will be introducing a 10p rate of income tax on the first 1,500. The figure is not described as income, let alone of what sort. The new rate will apply only to earned income and rental income. However, millions of people in this country who have income on which they are taxed under statute have no earned income or rental income. I refer to pensioners, especially poorer pensioners. It is wrong and cruelly deceptive for the Government to pretend that the 10p starting rate will apply to them.
<P>
Immediately after the Budget, many pensioners asked me when they could look forward to the new 10p starting rate on their first 1,500 of income. I had to tell them that it was clear from the small print of the Budget that they would continue to be taxed, not at 10p, but at 20p in the pound. The matter is serious, because pensioners are unable to change their earning pattern. Most cannot get jobs, do not receive rental income and find it difficult to switch their investments into lower taxed products. The Paymaster General wrote to some of them suggesting that they take advantage of the new individual savings accounts. Many pensioners are suspicious of ISAs because they have seen what happened when the Government changed the rules on PEPs and TESSAs and believe that the same may happen to ISAs in the unexpected eventuality that the Government succeed in their aim. Leaving that aside, pensioners cannot be expected at such a late stage in their lives to switch to shares and other risky products. They want to continue to receive income from familiar savings products such as bank accounts and building society accounts, all of which will be taxed at 20 per cent. That is not only unfair, but is extremely confusing and adds to the general complexity of what the Government are doing to the tax system.
<P>
The Chartered Institute of Taxation helpfully focused on the problem of elderly, poorer taxpayers. It has shown that three single pensioners under 75 with a state pension of 4,000 and an additional gross taxable income of 2,000 could be taxed differently and be left with a different post-tax income. If a pensioner's additional income comes from dividends, they are taxed at one rate, if it comes from bank interest it is taxed in another way and if he lives on a retirement annuity it is taxed at yet a different rate. The position is extremely confusing, particularly for unsophisticated taxpayers, who find it difficult enough to understand the tax system even when all the rates are the same. The Government are committed to self-assessment and this is another barrier to people understanding the system, filling in the forms correctly and paying the correct amount.
<P>
The Government are making the system unfair and complex, which is all the more bizarre when the Chancellor has a declared aim of encouraging savings. We hear all the time from the Government that they want to increase people's self-reliance, especially in old age, by persuading them to save for the long term. So why are the Government excluding the new 10p tax rate from many forms of savings?

<P>

<B>Mr. Christopher Leslie </B>(Shipley): I wonder whether the hon. Gentleman has costed his amendments. Where would he get the money to pay for them?
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> We have gone into cost many times. Our aim is to stop and, if possible, reverse the enormous extra tax burden that the Government are levying on the British people. We make no apology for doing that. It is calculated that the additional burden throughout the life of this Parliament will amount to around 40 billion. If the Opposition can reverse that in some small way during our proceedings, we shall have done everyone, including our constituents, a sterling service.
<P>
On costs, the hon. Gentleman's query would be better directed towards his own Front Bench.
<P>
The Daily Mail, which has done a great service in drawing the public's attention to the iniquity, calculated that the cost of allowing pensioners to benefit from the 10p tax rate would be about 55 million. In the context of the colossal extra tax that is being levied in the Budget, that would be a modest turning back of the tide. I urge the Government to reconsider the matter.
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> My right hon. Friend was challenged from the Labour Benches on the question of cost. Does he recall that when the Chancellor first floated the idea, he did so in a complete vacuum? One might have been led to believe that replacing the 20p band with a 10p starting rate would cost about 8 billion, but that that would not dissuade him from continuing with the matter because he believed in it?
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> My right hon. Friend is absolutely right because that fits in with the pattern. The Chancellor is a serial offender, not just in raising taxes, but in doing so by stealth.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Love </B>(Edmonton): Will the right hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I shall give way in a moment.
<P>
I suggest that Labour Members take a glimpse of the Daily Mail campaign. Under the general heading, ``One million pensioners pay for Brown's `folly''', it refers to the cost and states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>```The Chancellor's tax revenues this year will be about 320 billion,' said ... Maurice Fitzpatrick''---<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
of chartered accountants, Chantrey Vellacott---
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>```The 55 million it would cost to extend the 10p rate to pensioners' savings would be less than one five-thousandth of that.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Leslie:</B> The right hon. Gentleman says that he wants to commit 55 million to extending the 10p rate to pensioners, but his amendment would apply to everyone, not only pensioners. As a responsible Opposition Member proposing an amendment, presumably he knows what the cost of his amendment would be to the Exchequer.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> Yes, 85 million.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> May I continue where my right hon. Friend left off, because he does himself a disservice? A parliamentary question answered by the Paymaster General supplied much of the detail on which he based his answer a moment ago on the cost of his proposal. That is the answer to the hon. Member for Shipley (Mr. Leslie).
<P>
If the hon. Gentleman wants to discuss where money comes from, we can do so when we come to my more radical amendment, but I do not want to trespass into that area now.
<P>
In his amendment, my right hon. Friend seeks to remove an unfairness which arises out of the 10p starting rate on those who rely on savings as the principal part of their income. My right hon. Friend is right to touch on the fact that pensioners are again being disadvantaged by the Government.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I had thought that the right hon. Gentleman was intervening, but as he is not, I must propose the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> I am sorry, Mr. Butterfill, that I anticipated your entirely correct procedural activity, but at least Labour Members will have an idea of forthcoming attractions.
<P>
The amendment moved by my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory) has teased out the very strong anti-pensioner theme that runs through this Bill and previous Finance Bills. The self-same pensioners who will have to cope with the fact that their pensions will still be taxed at 20p, and not 10p, are those who are reeling from the loss of income resulting from the ending of payable tax credits that was discussed in the previous Finance Bill.
<P>
They are the same pensioners who will have to comply with the incredible complexities of the Bill if they are to maximise the advantages of their tax allowances. As we shall see, their ability to use their capital--perhaps for savings purposes--by freeing it from their property is again inhibited by later clauses.
<P>
I sense that the Government have reflected their strong anti-pensioner views in the Bill. My examples illustrate that. Pensioners are on the other side of most lines that are drawn between those who gain help from social security and those who are dependent on their own means. Surely it is in the Government's interest to minimise the take from savings investment, because that would increase self-reliance. It would also slow the process by which less well-off pensioners with savings might drift towards the need to obtain help from the social security system. The Government's proposal is a financial own goal.
<P>
The amendment of my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells also deals with the problem of complexity. The introduction of the 10p starting rate now means that we will have rates of 10p, 20p, 23p and 40p, and other marginal rates are applied to other forms of taxable income. That will result in a multiplicity and complexity of choices that will create difficulty for the pensioners who are required to complete self-assessment forms. I thought that we were in the era of trying to simplify the tax system, but the proposal significantly adds to its complexity.
<P>
I do not understand why the Government have introduced the proposal or why they decided that there should not be a mechanism so that at least the 1,500 of earned income, which will be taxed at 10p, cannot be considered as 1,500 of savings income. The Government have argued that a benign, and perhaps an even more generous, effect could be achieved if someone were to open an individual savings account. As we know from the complexity of such accounts, it is easy to use up one's allowance rather quickly. Therefore, one might still have savings income that cannot benefit from the tax-free status of an ISA, but which should benefit from the lower tax rate.
<P>
The Government's approach is totally inconsistent. I would have thought that their aim would have been to minimise the tax take from pensioners and those on low incomes. For some obscure reason, it is not. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells said, the way in which the proposal was announced was scandalous. The Chancellor did not have the courage to stand up in the House of Commons and announce in his Budget statement that the 20p rate would remain for that class of income.
<P>
<B>Mr. Love:</B> In the Budget statement, the Chancellor said that the introduction of a lower 10 per cent. tax rate was intended to meet the Government's commitment to improving incentives to work. Does the hon. Gentleman believe that he has done that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> I do not want to trespass into a debate on one of my amendments, but, as I shall prove later, the short answer to the hon. Gentleman's question is no.
<P>
I am talking about those with savings whom the proposal affects. It is a pity that the Chancellor did not have the courage to stand up and say clearly during the Budget statement what the proposal meant for savers. He was hoping for a cheap headline--the 10p tax rate--but, as I know from my postbag, he has left many pensioners profoundly disappointed with the Government. They thought that they had found the pensioner's friend--far from it, they found a pickpocket, Scrooge-like approach under which money will be taken from some of the poorest people in our society.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Ruffley </B>(Bury St. Edmunds): I endorse the remarks of my right hon. Friend the right hon. Member for Fylde, especially those on the affect of the clause on older people. Like my right hon. Friend, I have received oral and written representations stating that the clause is unfair and adds complexity. In the new environment of self-assessment, my older constituents will be baffled and disadvantaged under the clause.
<P>
I should like to take a short excursion into the history of the rates of tax imposed on non-dividend savings income. In November 1995, the then Chancellor, my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke), for whom I had the great privilege of working in the Treasury, considered the taxation of savings income. He realised that the system contained some deficiencies and sought to make it fairer, and he did so by reducing the rate of tax on non-dividend savings income to 20 per cent.
<P>
That change tackled the problem that tax at source was charged at the basic rate. Those who paid income tax at 20 per cent. had to reclaim the difference between the 25 per cent. rate that they paid on their savings income and the 20 per cent. rate that they paid on their non-savings income. The problem was that that was hugely administratively complex and costly for the Revenue.
<P>
In 1995, one in five taxpayers--5 million people--paid tax at 20 per cent. Those people who paid tax on non-dividend savings income before November 1995 had to make such claims, so my right hon. and learned Friend changed the rate to 20 per cent. That measure made the administration of the system less complex--fewer claims had to be made to the Revenue. Moreover, it reduced the tax on savings for the hard-working British people who were saving under the previous Administration. According to the savings ratios published in the Red Book, people are saving much less as a direct result of the policies that the Chancellor has implemented since July 1997.
<P>
Under the clause, the rate of tax on non-dividend savings income will stay at 20 per cent. That is a cruel deception, because 10 per cent. taxpayers will pay tax at 20 per cent. on their savings income. The Institute for Fiscal Studies--an impartial body--said that the clause would lead to the
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``rather odd situation in which savings are taxed more heavily than other income for 10 per cent. rate taxpayers and less heavily for basic rate taxpayers.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is a perverse set of arrangements.
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
As my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells observed, the Chartered Institute of Taxation has said that one in three pensioners have different savings strategies. They may have income from annuities, bank accounts or dividends. Pensioners will face three different taxation regimes if it comes from different sources, even though their gross income may be the same.
<P>
In the world of self-assessement, that does not seem conducive to assisting senior citizens, in particular. Many of my constituents are senior citizens, as my constituency has an old population compared with other constituencies. They will be confused by the clause. I had hoped that the Chancellor of the Exchequer would live up to his much-vaunted reputation for being a reforming Chancellor--a self-styled reforming tax Chancellor. He has failed miserably to deliver on his promises.
<P>
Many professional bodies have concluded that the clause will reintroduce a form of the investment income surcharge for 10 per cent. taxpayers. That is not acceptable. It is anti-pensioner and anti-saver. If the Government are not prepared to accept our amendments, I hope that they will listen to the cascade of criticism that I predict will emanate from this measure. The turmoil and ruckus that was caused for pensioners and savers as a result of the advanced corporation tax changes last year is nothing compared with the problems that the clause will cause. Savers are doing nothing more than being prudent and thrifty, which are values and principles that I thought the Government were meant to be advancing in the Budget. Surely, the facts show otherwise.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Dr. Vincent Cable </B>(Twickenham): In continuing the discussion about the anomalies created by the 10p rate, it is part of a much wider argument. The basic point that we should start with, although I do not want to dwell on it because we have debated it elsewhere, is the Government's social objective of helping people at the bottom end of the scale, whether their income is earned or not. That could have been more efficiently achieved by raising tax allowances in a tax-neutral way, which is the conclusion of the Institute of Fiscal Studies and many other critical observers of these measures.
<P>
However, the point that we are concerned about is savings. I am not sure that that has fully sunk in with the Government. They have now gone back to the convention, which most of us thought was long buried, of distinguishing between earned and unearned income. In the past, there was an ideological overtone that unearned income--a rentier income--was less worthy and that it deserved to be penalised by higher rates of tax. I thought that we had long since got past that point. It is not altogether clear whether that is the Government's motivation or whether they have just created an anomaly.
<P>
There are elements in the proposal that are also anomalous. For example, let us consider someone living off a pension income--it could be a state pension, a private or an occupational pension. If it is from the private sector, the pensioner will be living off income that is derived from a pension fund that has been invested in interest-earning assets. The pensioner will not pay the 20p rate. If he has invested the money in a bank or building society account, he will have to pay the extra rate. Interest income can be charged differently, quite anomalously, arbitrarily and unfairly. Our main concern, however, is not with anomalies per se but with the effect that they have on people at the bottom end of the income scale--those who are essentially poor.
<P>
It is worth doing the arithmetic to discover what the provision will mean for pensioners. Those who earn up to the personal allowance, which is 4,335, will pay no tax. Those who earn the full amount of income allowed at the 10p rate, which is another 1,500, will pay 300 tax on that extra tranche of income. If it was charged at the 10p rate, they would pay only 150. Those with an income of 5,800--by no stretch of the imagination could that be called a princely income--will lose 150 a year. That loss is probably over and above the loss that many of them suffered as a result last year's tax credit for dividends, which caused an average loss of 75.
<P>
<B>Ms Sally Keeble </B>(Northampton, North): I thought that we were increasing the thresholds for pensioners to 5,800 or 5,900. The person that the hon. Gentleman is citing presumably would not pay tax.
<P>
<B>Dr. Cable:</B> The sum that I gave is derived from official sources. I presume that it is correct.
<P>
<B>Ms Keeble:</B> I want to get it clear. The example would be quite helpful. Presumably the example that you are citing is under the old tax regime, not the new one. Under the new one, I believe that the person you are quoting--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am not quoting anybody.
<P>
<B>Ms Keeble:</B> I am sorry, Mr. Butterfill. Perhaps I should ask you for advice, as I am told that you are much more familiar with tax regimes than I am. I assume that such people would not pay tax because they do not earn over the threshold.
<P>
<B>Dr. Cable:</B> The figures that I was citing were for a woman pensioner aged under 65. At higher ages, there is a different threshold, but the same logic still applies. Because of the 10p band of approximately 1,500, pensioners are losing 150 each. That is not changed by the arithmetic that I used, and it comes on top of the loss of dividend tax credit, which many people in similar circumstances have encountered.
<P>
In winding up, I shall speak about the various ways of dealing with that anomaly. The first is proposed in amendment No. 63, which would allow people in that position to charge their savings income as the first tranche of their allowance, which would exempt them from much of that additional taxation. Another simpler way, which we suggest in subsequent amendments, would be to apply the 10p rate to all savings income. Of course, one could simply abolish the whole scheme. There are various ways to deal with the problem; this group of amendments includes one, which seems as technically sound as the others. I would be happy to support it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Cawsey </B>(Brigg and Goole): It is always an honour to follow a Liberal spokesman whose idea of helping pensioners is to increase income tax. Liberal Democrats seem to say that every time that they speak. I doubt whether pensioners would want it.
<P>
It has been suggested that the Government's policies are anti-pensioner. In fact, the Government have done much for pensioners, and they have rightly aimed at pensioners with the lowest incomes. The 100 heating allowance, the free eye test, the minimum income guarantee and the pilot scheme to ensure that pensioners receive all the benefits to which they are entitled are progressive means to deal with the matter.
<P>
Several Opposition Members said that that was all done by stealth and that when my right hon. Friend the Chancellor made his statement no one knew what was going on. Opposition Members have quoted the Daily Mail, which was worth while in one respect: most members of the public get their information on the Budget, and on Government and Opposition policies, from the media rather than from watching the House of Commons in action. That is why I am surprised by Opposition Members' comments. If they read the press releases issued by the Inland Revenue on Budget day, they will see that the details given to the media clearly stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The 10p rate will apply to taxable income of up to 1,500 and replaces the lower rate of 20p. The rates of tax on savings income remain at 20p for income below the basic rate limit and 40p above that.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That was stated at the time and given to the media at the time. If the Opposition missed it, that shows only that on Budget day they were as sloppy and incompetent as they have been in Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Whittingdale:</B> It is a great pleasure to follow the hon. Gentleman. I did not agree with what he said but am delighted that he has chosen to break his silence.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cawsey:</B> It is the second time that I have spoken in the debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Whittingdale:</B> In that case, I double my congratulations. I hope that other Labour Members who have not spoken--with the honourable exception of the hon. Member for Northampton, North (Ms Keeble)--will follow his example and contribute.
<P>
The hon. Member for Brigg and Goole suggested that we were somehow wrong in saying that people in the country may not initially have realised that the Chancellor did not intend that the 10p rate should apply only to earned income, not savings. The 20 per cent. rate was conspicuous by its absence in the Chancellor's Budget day speech. It was not only the Opposition who found out, when we came to study the small print, what the Chancellor was doing; Mike Warburton, the senior tax partner at the accountancy firm Grant Thornton, said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``It wasn't immediately apparent from the Budget that the rate for savers would remain unchanged at 20 per cent.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Our amendment would simply provide what many people in the country thought was in the Budget in the first place: that the 10p rate would apply to the first 1,500 of income, whether savings or earned income.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leslie:</B> Some time ago, the Conservative Front-Bench spokesman said in opening the debate that the cost of the amendments for pensioners would be about 55 million. When I asked him the total cost of the amendments for all savers, we were told that the costing had taken place.
<P>
<B>Mr. Whittingdale:</B> I believe that the figure for extending the 10p starting rate to everyone, not just pensioners, is around 85 million. I am sure that the Minister will say whether that is right.
<P>
<B>Mr. Derek Twigg:</B> What would the Opposition change in the Budget and how would they find the money to pay for that which they propose?
<P>
<B>Mr. Whittingdale:</B> Given the sums that we have been debating, 85 million is not a huge amount. I would have thought that, simply in terms of equity, that would be attractive to the Government; I shall return to that point.
<P>
First, I return to the point made by my right hon. Friend the Member for Fylde on the additional complexity that the 20 per cent. rate for savings introduces into the tax system. I had understood that one of the Government's objectives was to try to simplify the taxation system. It has been pointed out that as a result of this and other changes brought in by the Government, there are now six different taxation rates on income. There is the 10 per cent. earned income starting rate, the 20 per cent. savings income rate, the 23 per cent. base rate, the 32.5 per cent. dividend income rate, the 34 per cent. trusts rate and the 40 per cent. higher rate. During the two years that they have been in office, the Government have doubled the number of rates in existence.
<P>

</P>
<P>
Much worse than the additional complexity is the discrimination against savings income that the policy introduces into the tax system. As my hon. Friend the Member for Bury St. Edmunds (Mr. Ruffley) said, the Government are re-introducing an investment income surcharge, something that we removed when we were in office, and which we hoped that we would never see again in the tax system. A not insignificant number of people will be affected; about 1.4 million people will pay a marginal rate of 20 per cent. on their savings. Of those, some 950,000--nearly 1 million--are pensioners.
<P>
My right hon. Friend the Member for Wells has already drawn the Committee's attention to some of the criticism that the measure has attracted from professional bodies. I can add to those organisations the Law Society, which said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``We consider that to disapply the 10 per cent. starting rate from savings income unfairly discriminates against those who rely on savings as their main source of income.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Institute of Chartered Accountants said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``This has opened up a potential unfairness between those who receive investment income as against employment income.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Building Societies Association said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The BSA supports charging the first 1,500 of taxable employment income ... to tax at 10 per cent., but believes that taxing an equivalent amount of savings income at 20 per cent ... is neither fair nor efficient.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is not only professional bodies that have criticised the provision. It is sad that we do not have with us this year to discuss the Bill my hon. Friend the Member for Sevenoaks (Mr. Fallon), who did sterling service on the two previous Finance Bills. He drew my attention to a letter that one of his constituents had written to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and asked if I would make the Committee aware of it.
<P>
Mrs. Allen, of Swanley in Kent, wrote:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``In the budget I was delighted to hear that the first 1,500 of taxable income was to be charged at 10p in the pound. As a pensioner I felt that this would make life a little easier for me, having saved all my life ... As a working person I was not wealthy and often had hard times like most other people.
<P>
But, in a magazine that I was reading recently it was stated that this 10p would not apply to interest on savings!!! Surely this cannot be? It was said that it would only apply to earnings or pensions. Now as a pensioner I have an income of limited means, with a small pension that takes me just over the limit to claim any benefits ... I rely on the interest from my savings to pay for such things and I really thought that now, in the light of the last budget I would have things a bit easier. PLEASE tell me this is so.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I do not know whether the Chancellor of the Exchequer has answered Mrs. Allen yet, but she will be very disappointed when she receives his answer. He will say that it is not so and that she will be continuing to pay 20 per cent. on her savings income. It is not just Conservative Members who believe that the provision is unfair.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Derek Twigg:</B> The hon. Gentleman said earlier that he would return to the cost of the amendment and I remind him of that. What should be taken out of the Budget to pay for it?
<P>
<B>Mr. Whittingdale:</B> I thought that I had already said that, given the overall amount of taxation that the Government are taking from the people--an extra 40 billion over the Parliament--85 million is not a huge amount.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> May I help my hon. Friend? Labour Members ask that question as part of a ritual. Treasury Ministers could revisit the interesting negotiation that happens each year between the Chief Secretary and the Secretary of State for Social Security when they discuss the estimating and rounding errors in the biggest single item of Government expenditure. There is always an element of horse trading and discussion, and in that context 85 million is a small sum. This would be a good way in which to re-apply those funds.
<P>
<B>Mr. Whittingdale:</B> My right hon. Friend speaks with considerable experience of such matters, and I have no doubt that he is right. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> As there is an outbreak of interest on the Government Benches in making savings, I suggest to my hon. Friend that he recommends the end of a misleading and propagandist leaflet of which 1.5 million copies were printed and distributed. I understand that most of them have now been thrown away unread, but they managed to be misleading and wasteful at the same time. If we are looking for savings, we can start with the way in which the Government tried to mislead the British public in the aftermath of the Budget.
<P>
<B>Mr. Whittingdale:</B> I am grateful to my right hon. Friend. There is now a host of suggestions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Love:</B> I say to the right hon. Member for Fylde that we take our lessons from the previous Government in relation to the leaflets now going out around the country. That precedent was set up and used extensively by them over the years. The Opposition have now committed themselves to 40 billion additional expenditure on health and education over the next three years. Will the right hon. Gentleman reassure us that if the Opposition are suggesting cuts in taxation, and if they were to return to government, they would not prejudice that additional expenditure?
<P>
<B>Mr. Whittingdale:</B> The hon. Gentleman is straying a little, but I am happy to reassure him that we made clear, from the moment of the original announcement, that we welcome the extra money going into both health and education.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> No, the Opposition did not. I think that the shadow Chancellor said that it was folly, unsustainable and retrograde for public finances.
<P>
<B>Mr. Whittingdale:</B> The shadow Chancellor said that the Government's overall spending plans were reckless, but he specifically said that we welcomed extra money on health and education.
<P>
I want to mention a possible way in which extra money could be found, one that is especially dear to the heart of my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells. The money that we are talking about--the cost of extending the 10p starting rate of savings income--is about four days' worth of our contributions to the European Union. I believe that savings can certainly be found in that area.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cawsey:</B> I want to clarify that, from the suggestions that we have had so far from Opposition Members, we can make savings by cutting social benefits, ensuring--despite the fact that the Opposition say that we do things by stealth--that the public receive no information about what the Government do, and attacking farmers by cutting our European contribution. What on earth has happened to the Conservative party?
<P>
<B>Mr. Whittingdale:</B> My right hon. Friend the Member for Wells was reticent in pointing it out himself, but I understand that a post office in his constituency has refused to distribute the leaflet that he mentioned because it believes that it is propaganda and might be in breach of its obligations.
<P>
<B>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mrs. Barbara Roche):</B> I appreciate that the hon. Gentleman has moved on, but the point about cutting our contributions to the European Community interested me. Do I take it that that is the official--
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> Yes.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> The shadow Chief Secretary has confirmed that in order to pay for this policy, the contributions to the European Union would be cut.
<P>
<B>Mr. Whittingdale:</B> I am not sure that I would accept the causal link there. I merely gave an example of where we believe that savings can be found. I draw the Financial Secretary's attention to an excellent speech that my right hon. Friend made in the past 24 hours, in which he set out our view that savings could be found in the contribution paid by this country to the European Union. It has been widely reported in the newspapers today, and quite rightly.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> When asked where the money would come from to pay for this policy, the hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford said that the payments to the European Union could be reduced. He made the direct link. Would he like to withdraw that now?
<P>
<B>Mr. Whittingdale:</B> At least three different ways in which we believe that savings can be found have come from the Conservative Benches. My right hon. Friend the Member for Fylde made a very helpful suggestion, my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells has pointed out the ridiculous propaganda costs that have been incurred, and I have mentioned the European Union contributions. Nobody has yet mentioned welfare reform, which we were told would be the means of financing all the Government's extra expenses.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We are straying a little far from the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Whittingdale:</B> Thank you, Mr. Butterfill, for drawing us all back to order.
<P>
As I think I have said three times now, I was coming to the end of my remarks, but I wanted to leave the Committee with this final example.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mohammad Sarwar </B>(Glasgow, Govan): rose--
<P>
<B>Mr. Whittingdale:</B> I do not think that the hon. Gentleman has yet spoken, so I am keen that he should have a chance.
<P>
<B>Mr. Sarwar:</B> The three proposals that have been put forward would raise 85 million. Which is the preferred option?
<P>
<B>Mr. Whittingdale:</B> rose--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not be tempted any further down this road. It has been great fun and we have all enjoyed it. Can we please get back to the amendment?
<P>
<B>Mr. Whittingdale:</B> I shall of course be guided by you, Mr. Butterfill.
<P>
I wanted to finish by drawing the Minister's attention to early-day motion 495, which reads:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``That this House notes that the 10p tax rate announced by the Chancellor does not apply to the savings income of people of pensionable age; and calls on HM Government to extend the 10p rate to pensioners' savings to reward thrift and boost pensioner incomes.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Paymaster General may be aware that that early-day motion carries the signatures of 14 Labour Members of Parliament. By an extraordinary coincidence, none of those 14 Members has been selected to serve on the Committee. The Government Whip's Office must send up a prayer of thanks for this amazing stroke of fortune.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I hope that the hon. Gentleman is not seeking to impugn the integrity of the Committee of Selection.
<P>
<B>Mr. Whittingdale:</B> I would not dream of doing such a thing, Mr. Butterfill. I merely point out that some Labour Members, although sadly not on the Benches opposite me, believe, as we do, that this is extremely unfair discrimination against people on low incomes who depend on their savings income.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> As we are against the clock, may I ask my hon. Friend whether he agrees that a far better and less discriminatory way to give away 1.8 billion would be to increase personal allowances? Thereby all the poor would benefit on their savings and unearned income?
<P>
<B>Mr. Whittingdale:</B> My hon. Friend tempts me into a new speech on the merits of a 10p starting rate against a rise in personal allowances. He touches on an important point, to which I suspect we may return. However, I shall resist the temptation to make another speech on that topic.
<P>
I merely say to the Minister that I hope that the Government will listen to us, to the hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable) and to the 14 Labour Members who signed the early-day motion and accept the amendment that we have tabled.
<P>
Debate adjourned.--[Mr. Robert Ainsworth.]
<P>
Adjourned accordingly at two minutes to Seven o'clock till Tuesday 18 May at half-past Ten o'clock.
