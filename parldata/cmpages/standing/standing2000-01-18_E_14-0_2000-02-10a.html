<H4><center>Clause 65</center></H4>
<H4><center>Directions: supplementary</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<H5>9 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Dr. Gavin Strang </B>(Edinburgh, East and Musselburgh): The clause accompanies one that we debated, briefly but usefully, in an earlier sitting. It concerns the major issue in the Bill-that of security. That is undoubtedly the reason why other Governments have not privatised air traffic control. Although Conservative Members have not been drawn on the issue, I suspect that that is also why the previous Administration never got round to privatising the service, notwithstanding the huge programme of privatisation that took place under the two previous Prime Ministers.
<P>
There is a conflict-a tension-between civil aviation and military needs. The great strength of the British system has been the way in which that conflict has been handled. It is not simply a question of our being better than France, as some might say. We are probably the best in the world. Our success is based on our experience and our structures, on the fact that the military controllers work alongside civil controllers in the same premises, and on the public sector.
<P>
The relationship between a Government official and a publicly-owned company-which might be totally separate from the Civil Aviation Authority, but that is not the issue-is different from that between a Government official and a private company. There would be less incentive for co-operation between the military sector and a partially privatised air traffic control service. That would also apply in the case of a fully privatised, monopoly provider of air traffic control. The Conservatives still seem to advocate that option and the Minister has not ruled out the possibility of a flotation in the longer term.
<P>
Perhaps I should not say too much on that matter, because it would be a mistake to pre-empt the debate on clause 81. Whatever instructions may be given in relation to United Kingdom airspace under clause 65 would be completely overridden by the provisions in clause 81, as it is vital to protect the military interest. We shall discuss that in due course,
<P>
The two points that I want to make arise partly from the remarks made by my hon. Friend the Minister at the previous sitting. Pressures exist that will make it harder to achieve this co-operation. The first pressure will arise through an increase in traffic. I have heard people say that military pilots should not be training in Britain and that they should go and train somewhere else. That is unacceptable. Our pilots must be able to train in our airspace. It is, therefore, necessary to have co-operation at the highest level. There is, indeed, very sophisticated co-operation, involving the military using airspace that will be used from time to time by civil planes.
<P>
That co-operation is a great British success story. It has been achieved because the service is in the public sector, but even in that sector it will come under more pressure because of the huge growth in traffic. Only yesterday the latest figures were published in the Financial Times. They showed a 6.5 per cent. growth in European civil air passenger movements, so traffic is growing much faster than the British economy and other European economies. We must allow for the possibility that that fast growth will continue.
<P>
The military requirement is important. Whatever view one might take on the deployment of our military forces, I suspect that all members of the Committee agree that we must maintain the high standards in the Royal Air Force, as I believe that we do as a country. That is why, as I think everyone who has spoken so far has acknowledged, it is vital that co-operation is not jeopardised.
<P>
Co-operation will also come under more pressure in time-I accept that it will not happen overnight-because of privatisation. Let us be blunt about it. It does not matter who the strategic partner is-although we may say a little more about that on clause 81. In spite of the safeguards that are in place on security and other issues, if a private-sector animal is to run the business commercially, pressure will be put on it. The dangers of the Bill are not necessarily immediate, but in time people develop different agendas. The company will have an obligation to its shareholders and to its owners, who may be anywhere in the world. No doubt we shall discuss that on clause 81. There will be a new element-an element that says, ``We must get the highest private profit that we reasonably can out of this operation for our owners.'' If that element is injected into the co-operation between the military and the civil sides, it is bound to put pressure on that co-„operation in time.
<P>
That is why I believe that we can be less confident than the Minister implied. I have not read his remarks, because we do not yet have the Official Report from Tuesday, but he appeared to be saying that there is unlikely to be a problem. However, that view is based on history rather than on the two pressures that we now face. One pressure is the growth in traffic. The other-I accept that this is not necessarily the view of the Committee as a whole-is the inevitable tension between a group of people who are employed and answerable to an organisation that does not necessarily sign up completely to the British way of life, if I may use that phrase to include civil rights, parliamentary democracy and so on.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before we proceed too far down this road, I should say that clause 65 relates specifically to the disregard of provisions made under clause 64. It certainly refers to clause 81, but I suspect that we shall have a fuller debate on security issues under that clause. I therefore caution hon. Members not to go too far down that road now.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bernard Jenkin </B>(North Essex): I think, Mr. Gale, that that was an indication that the document in my hand, which is the heads of terms of the National Air Traffic Services and Ministry of Defence contract, will probably be more profitably debated under clause 81. I do not know whether you want to give me guidance on that matter.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I have already given the hon. Gentleman the guidance.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> In that case, we shall listen to what the Minister says in response.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (Mr. Keith Hill):</B> The issues raised by my right hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, East and Musselburgh (Dr. Strang) are serious, and I warmly support his concerns about the need for the effective control and use of airspace. Indeed, the whole point of this brief chapter in the Bill is to clarify responsibility for that.
<P>
My right hon. Friend expressed concern about the pressures that will make it harder to achieve co-„operation, specifically the increase in traffic. Of course, that would occur irrespective of the public-private partnership. It is right and proper for the Government to ensure that the Director of Airspace Policy will be able to cope with such matters.
<P>
My right hon. Friend also expressed a long-term concern that relates to his difficulty with the concept of the public-private partnership. He is worried that changes in responsibilities to shareholders and the need to generate profit are bound to put pressure on the use of airspace, and he perceives growing tension between military and civil need for airspace. The clause expresses the Government's determination that the DAP's role should remain firmly in the public sector.
<P>
The DAP's responsibility is precisely to bring together civil and military airspace management by acting on behalf of both interests and participating in the Joint Air Navigation Services Council. He must ensure that UK airspace is used in the most effective way, consistent with securing safe operation and the expeditious flow of airspace. He must also ensure that, so far as is practicable, the needs of all classes of airspace user will be met without according preferential treatment to either civil or military users. He will advise the CAA, the Ministry of Defence and the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions, and support UK representation in various international organisations, working groups and committees that deal with airspace and related air traffic management matters.
<P>
The Government tried to anticipate the concerns expressed by my right hon. Friend, and we are confident that the arrangements and the DAP's role in the CAA will meet those concerns.
<P>
Clause 64(5) will ensure that in times of hostility the directions will take precedence over all others, excepting those given in clause 81-which we shall debate in due course-which relate to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``times of actual or imminent hostilities or of severe international tension or of great . . . emergency''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The directions will be made available by the CAA to the public. Only where a circumstance is listed in clause 64(5) and referred to the Secretary of State for consultation under clause 64(6) must the Secretary of State notify the CAA that publication of all or part of the direction would be against the public interest. That is the precise focus of the clause, and I hope that it will stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Owen Paterson </B>(North Shropshire): I thank the Under-Secretary for his explanation. I shall refer briefly to the points that I made in respect of clause 64 because they are relevant to this clause. I understand that the DAP will be the person who takes the decisions, but will he be the absolute and final arbiter, or will there be an appeal mechanism?
<P>
I cited the example of the growing demand in my patch for low-level airspace below two flight paths, which are also expanding rapidly. As the right hon. Member for Edinburgh, East and Musselburgh said, demand at a higher level is growing, and the time may come when the two conflict. As I understand it, all such disputes will be resolved by the DAP, but will there be a higher body to which either interest might appeal?

<B>Mr. Hill:</B> The short answer is yes. In the event of a disagreement within the CAA, the DAP has the right to appeal to the Secretary of State for Defence on the grounds of national security.

</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Robert Syms </B>(Poole): I beg to move amendment No. 376, in page 42, line 17, leave out `CAA may' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`Secretary of State shall make an order to'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We have already discussed charging for air traffic services in the context of the various agreements. The Secretary of State, through the treaty and Eurocontrol, sets many of the charges. Some of our earlier amendments aimed to replace the Secretary of State with the CAA, but this amendment would do the reverse. It gives the Minister an opportunity to refresh our memories and give an overview of charging, which is an important issue. I hope that he can assure us that the regime will not lead to an explosion in charging prices.
<P>
<B>The Minister for Housing and Planning (Mr. Nick Raynsford):</B> To help the Committee I shall give a brief outline of the current arrangements for levying charges through Eurocontrol and the agreements affecting the Shanwick oceanic control area and air traffic services provided by other Governments. I shall then explain how the Bill will affect those arrangements.
<P>
The existing arrangements involve charges being levied under section 73(1)(a) of the Civil Aviation Act 1982, which authorises the Secretary of State to make regulations requiring the payment to him, the CAA or Eurocontrol of air navigation charges provided by him, the CAA, Eurocontrol or any other person. Enforcement mechanisms, including the powers of aircraft detention and sale, are contained in section 74(4) and (5) of the 1982 Act.
<P>
Three sets of regulations apply under the provisions of the 1982 Act. The most important are the route charges regulations, which require the operator and, on notice, the owner of any aircraft to which navigation services are made available in respect of each en-route flight in the flight information regions of UK airspace, to pay Eurocontrol a charge for those services. Those charges are then passed on to NATS.
<P>
The navigation services charges regulations require three kinds of charges to be specified. First, every aircraft flying across the Shanwick oceanic control area and filing a flight plan pays a charge to the CAA. Secondly, every aircraft pays the CAA the appropriate charge for navigation services provided in connection with landing at Heathrow, Gatwick, Stansted, Edinburgh, Glasgow and Aberdeen-that is, the six BAA airports. Thirdly, every helicopter flying within the specified areas of the northern and southern North sea pays a charge to the CAA.
<P>
The joint financing regulations require every aircraft making a crossing between Europe and America to pay the CAA a charge for air navigation services that are provided by the Governments of Denmark and Iceland. Until 1 February this year, the CAA also collected such charges in respect of Canada. I am afraid that I must apologise for an unfortunate, but understandable, typographical error in the explanatory notes. Paragraph 57, which describes those arrangements, refers to the Governments of Canada, Denmark and Ireland. Unfortunately, an `r' has been substituted for a `c'; it should read Iceland, not Ireland. I hope that hon. Members will excuse us for that typographical error and understand how easily that kind of thing can happen.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Resign!
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for his kind comments on my performance.
<P>
On the last point-not, I hasten to say, resignation-perhaps I might usefully explain what lies behind the collection of those charges. As I said, the collection of charges in respect of the Government of Canada stopped on 1 February. Charging on behalf of Denmark and Iceland continues. The reason for that is simple. Most of the large volume of air traffic flying through the airspace of Denmark and Iceland is in transit. For that reason, neither Iceland nor Denmark has any means of taking action if charges are not paid. In many cases, the airlines will not have landing arrangements at any Danish or Icelandic airport. The ability to seize and sell an aircraft is not available, whereas the vast majority of the operators-probably all of them-will have landing arrangements in the UK, so it is easier for us to act as the enforcement agent, which we do. We collect the fees on their behalf, and charge a small collection fee for that administrative service. That is helpful, because it reduces costs for UK airspace users.
<P>
Clauses 66 to 70 propose the minimum necessary changes to those arrangements post-PPP. The guiding considerations are: first, that the legal basis on which NATS charges and recovers for en-route Eurocontrol and Shanwick air navigation services will continue to be secure, clear and unambiguous; secondly, that the international obligations of the UK will continue to be met; thirdly, that the existing powers of detention and sale, which enable debts to be enforced and recovered, will remain robust; and fourthly, that the Government and the CAA will each retain the appropriate functions, but only those which are required to be carried out in the public sector.
<P>
The charging, recovery and enforcement mechanisms will be underpinned by a new obligation in primary legislation for users to pay the relevant charges. Given such an obligation, it is no longer necessary for charges to be promulgated by the Secretary of State. Previously, the regulations promulgated by the Secretary of State provided for the obligation to make a payment. That is now enshrined in primary legislation, which is why the Secretary of State does not need to promulgate those arrangements through regulations.
<P>
In practice, the instruments serve mainly to give national legal effect to charges set by others.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I hear what the Minister says, but surely the regulations specify the level of charges. The primary legislation does not specify the level of charges. The specification of the level of charges is delegated, and is not subject to parliamentary scrutiny in the way in which it once was. That seems to me to be a departure.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes a fair point, but it is a general principle that it is unwise to specify charges, which can vary from year to year, in primary legislation, because it then becomes necessary to return to primary legislation to amend them. That is why, under the new arrangements, the power to make the charges, and the requirement to pay them, is enshrined in legislation. That leaves no doubt. The detail of the charges will be the responsibility of the CAA. That is the sensible arrangement-the CAA is the right body to put those charges into effect. Such charges are often the product of international negotiations. Requiring the Secretary of State to enter that loop would be unnecessarily cumbersome.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I was not suggesting that we should specify the charges in primary legislation. I want there to be some accountability, or check, in relation to the charges that the CAA may cook up with National Air Traffic Services. What safeguard is in place to prevent charges from becoming excessive?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> As I was saying, in many cases the charges reflect international agreements. For example, with Eurocontrol charges, the relevant amount is set by Eurocontrol. Similarly, charges promulgated for the Danish and Icelandic sectors are set by the Danish and Icelandic authorities. We are not in a position to query that arrangement. It would be inappropriate to suggest that the Secretary of State should be able to intervene and tell those authorities what charges they should make. Charges for Shanwick are made on NATS' recommendation.
<P>
Under the new arrangements, the CAA will become the regulator and will be in the right position to make an overall appraisal in the light of all the information about the reasonableness of NATS' charge proposals. It will be a similar relationship to that which will exist in many other areas where regulatory frameworks are in place. We do not believe that it is right to bring in the Secretary of State. In the past, his or her role has been necessary only because the primary legislation contained no provision to enforce the payment. That has been remedied in the Bill. There will be an obligation to make the payment. Therefore, we do not believe that the Secretary of State should be involved in the minutiae of setting the charges.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> As the Minister said, most agreements are by international treaty, which sets the pinnacle of figures. I think that the intention is that agreement should go straight through the system to NATS. The licence provides for the regulator to limit the fees if, during the licence period, the feeling is that too much is going to the licensee.
<P>
I asked earlier whether there might be a gap between treaty obligations income and what the licensee can charge and, if so, what would happen to the money. I should be grateful for a reassurance as to whether there will be a gap between what the regulator and the international treaties will set.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> As we have discussed, there will often be a temporary gap, because charges have to be set on the basis of estimated flows of income. At the end of the relevant period, the charges will be reconciled with the actual figures and a subsequent adjustment may be necessary, but that simply reflects sensible administrative arrangements to take account of such variations.
<P>
Otherwise, our view is that there need be no concern about the issue raised by the hon. Members for Poole (Mr. Syms) and for North Essex (Mr. Jenkin). As I said, most charge-setting arrangements will remain as they are and nothing in these arrangements creates scope for further escalation. On the contrary, in the case of UK and Shanwick en-route charges, there will be the additional safeguard of a charge-control mechanism to put downward pressure on controllable costs.
<P>
In future, all charges will be promulgated by the regulator, subject to their being within the parameters set by Eurocontrol-and, for Denmark and Iceland, by the International Civil Aviation Organisation and other Governments-following proposals made by NATS and also, where necessary, subject to their being consistent with the proposed new price controls.
<P>
There are two other categories of air traffic services: airports and that familiar old friend of ours, North sea helicopters. Airports are already contestable, with fees negotiated and priced under contract. However, in the case of airport services provided at six of the British Airports Authority airports, the existing basis for recovery of NATS' charges is by direct charges to the airlines rather than recovery from the relevant airport. Provision will need to be made for there to continue to be a legislative underpinning of NATS' entitlement to these charges, at least for the remaining term of the existing contracts. The position thereafter may be the subject of a review. In the case of North sea helicopters, the legal basis for charging is the obligation imposed by the Civil Aviation (Navigation Services Charges) Regulations 1998. This, or an equivalent, legal underpinning will need to be maintained for the time being.
<P>
The Government intend that the existing powers of detention and sale of aircraft should continue to be made available. Accordingly, it is proposed that, in the case of UK en-route charges, the right to request that detention occur remains with Eurocontrol and that detention will require authorisation from the CAA in its capacity as regulator.
<P>
We can see no reason to alter the existing provisions, which are a little surreal, because they envisage a constable or other person authorised for the purpose effecting the detention of the aircraft. It conjures up a lovely image of a ``Dixon of Dock Green'' figure saying ``'Allo, 'allo, 'allo''. However, that is the provision and we do not intend to amend it.
<P>
In the case of Shanwick, Denmark and Iceland, we propose that detention will require authorisation from the regulator-the CAA. It would consider that step only following a request from NATS that demonstrated that charges had remained unpaid for a specified period-currently 56 days-that the level of unpaid charge was significant, which means that detention cannot be used for purely trivial matters, and that there was no reasonable prospect of early payment.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> To take the Minister back a minute, can he explain the role of Eurocontrol if an aircraft needs to be detained and sold to recover proceeds? The loss may be not to NATS or the UK but to another jurisdiction or authority? Can Eurocontrol direct the CAA to seize an aircraft for a loss in another country?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> No. I can give the hon. Gentleman an assurance about that. I see immediately the pavlovian reaction. At the mention of Eurocontrol we immediately have this image of the wicked Europeans coming to detain aircraft.
<P>
I assure the hon. Gentleman that the provisions give Eurocontrol the right to carry out that detention-for obvious reasons we are dealing with European arrangements-but the decision is based on an application by NATS based on its concern that a significant debt is outstanding that it has no reasonable prospect of obtaining. Secondly, detention must be authorised by the CAA. I hope that that gives the hon. Gentleman the reassurance that he seeks.
<P>
I was saying that the conditions require the CAA to be satisfied that the unpaid charge is significant and unlikely to be paid in the immediate future. Again, the authorised person regime should continue to be available to effect the detention. That is where the constable comes back in.
<P>
I shall not fall into the tempting trap of saying how delighted we are that the Opposition, who spent most of part I trying to remove the Secretary of State's powers, have now done a significant U-turn by tabling an amendment seeking to extend those powers. I shall simply explain why we do not believe that the amendment is necessary.
<P>
The first element of the amendment makes the Secretary of State, rather than the CAA, responsible for setting charges and for doing so by order, no doubt out of a concern that the legal basis for the setting and recovery of charges should be no less robust than at present. That is the key policy consideration, which I have already outlined, behind the proposed new arrangement. The present arrangement, based on the Civil Aviation Act 1982, operates by primary legislation giving power to the Secretary of State to make secondary legislation or regulations. Once made, a regulation is the source of the obligation to pay, in addition to being the description of the charges. It is envisaged that, for the new framework, the primary legislation, which is subsection (3), should be the legal source of the obligation to pay.
<P>
With that general obligation in place, the amounts of the charges, the persons by and to whom the charges are payable and the airspace in respect of which they are so payable will then fall to be identified. That will be done by the CAA issuing notices under clause 67(1). The notices will not, of themselves, create substantive legal obligations, but will designate the tariff to which the statutory obligation to pay attaches. The tariffs will specify the charges due and will be regularly updated and amended.
<P>
The level of charges will be set, not by the CAA, but by the relevant providers-Eurocontrol for UK en-„route charges, foreign Governments for Denmark and Iceland, and NATS for oceanic and, for the present, BAA airports and North sea helicopters, for the reasons that I explained.
<P>
I hope that that answers the second element of the hon. Gentleman's amendment, which requires the Secretary of State to promulgate these charges. The proposed charging framework recognises the practical reality that the service provider is responsible for proposing its charges within the relevant regulatory parameters, whether set under the proposed charge controls for Eurocontrol and oceanic charges, the Eurocontrol charging principles, the ICAO approvals or the requirements of overseas Governments on whose behalf they are collected. Compliance with all those requirements is the direct responsibility of NATS. Therefore, unless there is clear and present evidence of those parameters being breached, the CAA will be able to promulgate only those charges in its notices. It would clearly be acting beyond its powers if it refused to promulgate the charges in that way for any other reason, knowing that the effect of so doing would frustrate the ability not only of NATS but of all the other parties involved to recover their legitimate charges.
<P>
In summary, the amendment is unnecessary because, although we understand its underlying motives, they are fully met in the Bill. Therefore, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will agree to withdraw it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> On the proceeds raised from the seizure of assets to recover unpaid charges, the Minister said that a charge is made for such seizures. Does that happen regularly? He also said that profits from the seizure of assets have been used to reduce costs to other users. In future, will such profits be so used, or will they form part of the profits of air traffic services providers? How will the excess proceeds of recovered charges be treated?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> In mentioning the small administrative charge, I was referring to the recovery of charges on behalf of the Icelandic and Danish Governments, not the seizure of aircraft. As far as I know, no administrative charge will be made for a seizure; the purpose of the provision is simply to recover debts owed to NATS that have not been properly paid. As I understand it, normal provisions for debt recovery through the seizure of assets will apply, but if I discover that I am wrong, I shall write to the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I am grateful for that clarification.
<P>
What will happen if there is disagreement about the charges that should be levied? I appreciate that this is a point that the Minister may want to mock, but we are without doubt effectively passing control over the setting of charges from the Secretary of State and Parliament to international treaty. Denmark and Iceland seem able to continue to set their own charges-I may be wrong, but I believe that Denmark was a participant in Eurocontrol-but ours will be determined by Eurocontrol.
<P>
I appreciate that there is open disagreement across the Floor of the Committee on the legal enforceability of Eurocontrol decisions, which may become enforceable in United Kingdom law through the European Community. We are entering a legally fluid period. When the European Union joins Eurocontrol and its competence develops, it may eventually negotiate directly with Eurocontrol on the level of charges throughout the EU. As a result, we may have no say in the level of charges imposed on the United Kingdom. I should be delighted to hear an assurance from the Minister that that is not the case, because I may be able to prove him wrong as matters develop.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> In practice, as I stressed at the outset, we are seeking simply to roll forward the existing arrangements, but under a new framework that will distinguish the obligation to pay, which is set in legislation, from the promulgation of the charges, which is handled by the CAA. Currently, both are dealt with through regulations made by the Secretary of State. There is no obligation to pay in primary legislation, so the regulations are necessary and the Secretary of State has to be involved. However, in reality the Secretary of State promulgates charges that are, to a large extent, determined by other parties. An element of rubber-stamping has to be involved-as was also the case under the previous Government-because we are party to a much larger arrangement, which covers many other states and, in respect of the oceanic control area, international agreements.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gerald Howarth </B>(Aldershot): I apologise to the Committee and to you, Mr. Gale, for not having been here a little earlier. I sympathise with what Madam Speaker said yesterday about the goings-on in Parliament square.
<P>
The Minister may recall page 43 of the draft air traffic services licence, which features an extraordinarily complex formula that has been devised for establishing the various bases of costings for Eurocontrol charges. Is that formula used, or was it devised to meet the proposed new arrangements?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> In fact, there is not one formula, but several formulae, which deal with charging not only for Eurocontrol areas, but for the oceanic services. During a previous sitting-the hon. Gentleman may care to refer to the relevant Hansard-I took the Committee through the basic principles of the formula and offered to provide a detailed explanation of the algebra. However, the appetite of Committee members for that explanation was not as keen as the hon. Gentleman's. In any case, I suspect that you would rule me out of order, Mr. Gale, if I reverted to a matter that was considered earlier.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The Minister would have been ruled out of order on that occasion, never mind now.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> Thank you, Mr. Gale. I return to the key point-[Interruption.]
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> My question to the Minister did not concern the complexity of the formula, but whether it is currently applied or has been devised to meet the requirements of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The formula relates to the proposed new arrangement, but builds largely on existing arrangements. The basic principle, which I explained on the previous occasion, is that it is intended to reflect actual arrangements, to give an incentive to efficiency and to allow for adjustment when the actual levels of service are known, which inevitably follows the period of time in which the estimate-based charges are set. That is why the formula is complex. While it essentially reflects current arrangements, it is not precisely the formula that applies at present because we are moving to a new regulatory framework. I hope that the hon. Gentleman is satisfied with that explanation.
<P>
Real safeguards are in place in terms of incentives to keep costs down. While this will be a tough regulatory framework, it has to reflect wider international obligations in respect not only of Eurocontrol-I am aware that that exercises Conservative Members-but of other international Governments and obligations. I hope that the Committee agrees that the arrangements are robust and sound and that the amendment would add nothing to the Bill and should be withdrawn.

<P>

<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for his response to my earlier comments. However, he delivered a real classic when he said that as we make the change-a substantial change, in that the setting of charges is no longer to be directly answerable to Parliament and is, in effect, being handed over to an international organisation-
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford indicated dissent.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> That is what the Minister said. He said that in practice the charges are largely determined by agreements to which we are party.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> That is what I said, but I was talking about current practice, which we do not propose to change. If the hon. Gentleman reads tomorrow's Hansard, he will see that he said that we are seeking to hand the arrangements over to an international body. My point was that that is part of existing arrangements. We are not proposing to cede sovereignty, which I know is a matter of deep concern to him. 
<P>
<H5>9.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The pavlovian responses seem to be coming from those on the Government Benches. The stimulus is to ridicule any mention of the European Union-growls and grunts then emerge from Labour Members. They may all be satisfied, but I am not. Whatever the Minister says, the present arrangements are only international. The Secretary of State may decide that we will not accept them. They are all entered into through bilateral negotiations. Even if those international organisations impose unacceptable charges, we can object and have our say.
<P>
That will not be the case with air traffic charges, which will be set in the fullness of time by Eurocontrol. As we discussed, when the EU becomes a full member of Eurocontrol it will negotiate collectively on behalf of all member states. Transport is dealt with by qualified majority voting, so if there were votes on those negotiations in the Council of Ministers, the decision would be taken on that basis. Joining Eurocontrol will give the EU exclusive internal competence on such matters, so the charges will be legally enforceable under European Community law. That is significant.
<P>
What if there were a disagreement? What would happen if the CAA advised the Secretary of State that the charges were too high? Other countries, whether members of the EU or not, might have all sorts of motives for setting higher charges than necessary for aircraft that pass through our airspace. What safeguard would allow Parliament and Members to intervene on the level of charges, to protect our aviation industry? That industry is important to this country? Does the Minister accept that analysis of the effect of the EU joining Eurocontrol?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The simple point that I was trying to get across, which I shall repeat, is that the present arrangement is based on a series of international agreements. Although the Secretary of State promulgates the regulations, he has little discretion in the determination of those charges. Just as there is an element of rubber-stamping in the present arrangements, the CAA will have to consider those international agreements when it discharges its responsibilities in future. Like the Secretary of State, it will be able to refuse to promulgate them. If it did so without good reason, however, it would be in breach of those obligations and could be liable for serious action. If there were good reason for refusing to implement, the CAA would be able to refuse, as the Secretary of State currently can. There is no change in the relationship between the British authorities and the international bodies, which set the parameters.
<P>
We have signed up to a series of agreements, by which we are bound, but we have a measure of discretion. The CAA will exercise exactly the same measure of discretion as the Secretary of State does now. If the hon. Gentleman seriously thinks that the Secretary of State can determine, by reference to the formulae that the hon. Member for Aldershot (Mr. Howarth) kindly drew to the Committee's attention once again, whether or not the charges are right, without taking expert advice from the CAA, he is deluding himself. The CAA is best placed to reach that judgment and we are proposing a sensible framework to allow the administration of those arrangements to proceed in the most orderly way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> We need not detain the Committee further because the Minister has given a strong assurance on this matter. He told us, and I wrote it in my book, that if the CAA is strongly of the opinion that the charges set by Eurocontrol are unreasonable, it can refuse to implement those charges and enter into negotiation as a bilateral partner. He was clearly of the opinion that there was no possibility of the charges being determined in a European legal sense and becoming directly applicable under European Community law.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford indicated assent.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The Minister is nodding. I shall put that in my book. I am glad that we have debated this highly significant matter and my hon. Friend will probably wish to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> As I understand the matter, the Government will collect money through international treaty. In effect, there will be a collection fund rather like a rate collection fund. The formula will take into consideration inflation and volume. As volume is unpredictable and may rise at a rate of five per cent. or six per cent., there will be a balancing figure at the end of a year. That figure will probably be higher rather than lower, and, within the formula, will eventually be passed to the new company.
<P>
The Secretary of State and the Department will debit a small charge to cover costs, in line with their obligations under the treaty, and the CAA will also debit a small charge. Principally, however, the fees will go towards the provision of air traffic services. We are a little clearer about the matter, now that we have the Minister's words in the book, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Dr. Strang:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 366, in page 42, line 23, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(1A) But the CAA may not apply charges in respect of classes of aircraft which were not subject to charges for air traffic services on 1 January 2000.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment relates to the general aviation community. So far in our deliberations, the voice of that community has not been raised to any great extent. There has not been much discussion of the interests of that sector. The phrase ``general aviation'' is a catch-all term that applies to all aviation apart from the carriers. It describes business fliers, people who fly for pleasure, and probably such operations as the helicopters that fly out to North sea oil rigs. It essentially describes the people flying smaller planes and operating in the lower airspace.
<P>
I am glad that the hon. Member for Aldershot is with us. He told the Committee that he was an amateur flier, which makes him a suitable substitute for the right hon. Member for Kensington and Chelsea (Mr. Portillo), who has gone elsewhere. I hope that the hon. Gentleman's experience will enable him to contribute to the debate. It is an important issue. The general aviation sector is huge and it is growing, as are the other sectors. There is great opposition in that sector to this complex partial privatisation scheme.
<P>
Of course, that opposition is not unanimous and I am sure that the hon. Member for Aldershot will put forward the views of those who support privatisation in some form. However, it is reasonable to say that there is a great deal of concern in that sector, some of which has been articulated for a very long time. I shall quote some examples later. It is not only air traffic controllers and airline pilots who are aligned against this legislation, but a large part of the general aviation community.
<P>
The issue here is that the radar service in lower airspace is provided free of charge. That is an excellent service and a sensible way of working. I am sure that the hon. Member for Aldershot would point out, if I did not, that charging and privatisation are separate issues. It is perfectly possible for a public-sector company to introduce charges. Indeed, at least one such company on the continent has contemplated charges, although I do not know how far matters have progressed. It is not necessarily true that the public sector equals no charges, and the private sector equals charges. However, in respect of a private sector company that must achieve a higher return not only on current profit but capital deployed, there will be additional pressure for charges. That is why the general aviation community is against the provision.
<P>
The most concise way in which to illustrate the point is by quoting from a Popular Flying Association memorandum in the 14th report of the Transport Select Committee which was published last July. As Committee members will know, that Committee produced a considerable number of reports. Paragraph 4 of the memorandum, which is dated 17 February 1999, states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The proposed privatisation of NATS will almost certainly lead to a reduction in safety unless accompanied by a prohibition on any increases in low level (below 5,000 feet) controlled airspace from which light aircraft are excluded, or can only enter under certain circumstances, or are charged for using. Any increase m controlled airspace will lead to light aircraft being squeezed into the reduced amount of free space and increase the collision risk. Pilots will not announce themselves to radar controllers if they are to be charged for doing so.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I doubt whether every pilot would agree that charges will prevent them from clocking on. If the hon. Member for Aldershot felt it sensible to clock on, he would doubtless do so and pay the charge. Nevertheless, human nature being what it is, individual pilots will make judgments on whether it is really necessary to clock on for a particular flight. I have no doubt that this is a real and important issue.
<P>
In giving oral evidence to the Transport Select Committee, Colin Mitchell, the chairman of the Popular Flying Association, said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``They might then start applying charges for the use of lower airspace radar services that are currently provided free and which pilots willingly use, and if they did that then the certain reaction of amateur pilots would be to try to avoid paying those charges by not using those services.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Committee members will recall that I briefly raised this subject during a previous sitting. I tabled this probing amendment, which provides the opportunity to develop the subject, because I was not entirely satisfied by the response given by my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary, the Member for Sunderland, South (Mr. Mullin) on the subject of charges. He said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``No one can guarantee that the arrangement will stay the same for ever, but there are no plans to change and I understand from National Air Traffic Services that a change would in any case almost certainly cost more to administer than it would to collect and so would not be worth while.'' [Official Report, Standing Committee E, 27 January 2000; c. 250.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In the light of my hon. Friend's response, I have not the slightest doubt that he and the Government hope that additional commercial pressure arising from partial privatisation will not result in charges several years down the track. He will probably agree that, whoever the new air traffic control operator is, it would be sensible to avoid charges and thereby give people the maximum incentive to clock on.
<P>
I should draw my hon. Friend's attention to a matter that Colin Mitchell of the PFA raised with the Transport Select Committee. If all popular fliers were required to install transponders, that would be a different ballgame. That is not a wild proposal. In the fishing industry, part of which I represent, the issue of transponders is on-„going and controversial. However, it is not an out-of-the-box proposal, if I may use that phrase. At some point it may be said, ``We will put transponders on and make them pay charges.''
<P>
We want to hear a little more about the prospects. We must remember that the purpose of the Bill is to create a licence for the new semi-private operator, which will run for between 15 and 30 years, so we are talking about the long term. Therefore, we should be concerned not simply with the immediate impact of the Bill but with its long-term impact. I hope that the Government will make a further statement on their view on charges and say whether they can do anything to ensure that the new partially privatised NATS does not introduce charges in lower airspace.

<P>

<B>Mr. Gerald Howarth:</B> I congratulate the right hon. Member for Edinburgh, East and Musselburgh on tabling the amendment and on speaking so eloquently to it. As a private pilot, I am very much affected by the argument that he has deployed. I am glad that he tabled the amendment. Having arrived rather late in the Committee I was not, perhaps in a good position to do so. He has raised some important points, which I wish to amplify.
<P>
The right hon. Gentleman is right to say that there is concern among the general aviation community-not military aviators or those employed by the major airlines, but everyone from air taxi operations, flying clubs right down to the Popular Flying Association, whose members might be flying home-built aeroplanes or war birds, aeroplanes like the Mustang or the Hurricane that served in earlier combats. Therefore, it is a wide community, and it has been concerned for a number of years about the likelihood of the CAA introducing charges for air navigation services provided by what we now call NATS.
<P>
Indeed, the concern has been exacerbated in recent months by the introduction of changes under, I think, the Air Navigation (Fifth Amendment) Order to the flight crew licensing arrangements. As the Under-Secretary of State, the hon. Member for Sunderland, South knows, not only did we debate that issue in the House in December, but it is also a matter that I have discussed at length with the CAA in Gatwick. The effect of those proposals, which emanate from the joint air worthiness authorities-the pan-European authority, which has nothing to do with the European Union-has been to impose substantial increases on private flying costs in the United Kingdom.
<P>
Private flying is not an activity enjoyed just by fat cats and the rich; it is a sport for a large number of people. I cannot give the figure off the top of my head, but I think that there are about 50,000 active private pilots. They may be business men who have their own aeroplanes and use them for business purposes and for pleasure-perhaps to go to Le Touquet for an enjoyable Sunday lunch, of course trying not to upset the residents of Kent on the way and choosing their line of route carefully outside controlled airspace, to avoid overflying towns and so on, which might upset your constituents, Mr. Gale.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (Mr. Chris Mullin):</B> And not drinking too much wine there either!
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> The Minister was suggesting that they would not consume too much wine in Le Touquet. I am sure that he is well aware that it is a severe offence to be in charge of an aircraft and under the influence of alcohol. I abide strictly by the rule-no alcohol within eight hours of aviating. Most of my friends-the vast majority-but not all, do the same-I do not want to be caught telling an untruth.
<P>
<B>Ms Claire Ward </B>(Watford): Has the hon. Gentleman's flying experience made him used to flying solo? It is obviously a skill that he needs at the moment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I am most grateful to the hon. Lady for pointing that out. When the instructor steps out of the aeroplane and one flies solo for the first time, it is the most nervous and exciting of moments. Generally, one is so scared out of one's wits-I use a polite expression-that one does not really notice that the instructor has gone. It was the same on this occasion: I did not notice that I was flying solo. However, I am not scared out of my wits because my experience of solo flying in this place is as extensive as my experience of flying solo in an aeroplane. I occasionally find myself-I hesitate to say out on a limb-articulating my constituents' views, which are robust but not necessarily as robust as the views of other hon. Members' constituents.
<P>
We have had an enjoyable distraction-I thank the hon. Lady for her comments-but I should move on. General aviation is important to the United Kingdom. We have a tremendous reputation for leading the way in aerospace, and we were one of the first countries in the world to experience the thrill of flying. Samuel Cody first took to the skies over these islands on 16 October 1908 from Laffans plain, which happens to be in Farnborough in my constituency.
<P>
Today, the British aerospace industry, which includes BAe Systems and Rolls-Royce, is a world leader. BAe Systems is the third largest defence company in the world, and the industry makes an important national contribution. About 400,000 people are employed in the defence industry, and the aerospace industry plays a huge part in that regard. It operates throughout the United Kingdom, not simply in the south-east, and the north-west is heavily dominated by the industry. It is Britain's most successful manufacturing industry.
<P>
Our airlines also excel. British Airlines is the world's favourite airline. Virgin Atlantic, British Midland, and other British airlines are at the forefront in terms of safety and the quality of service that they provide, and they are respected throughout the world. When British Airways took the Union flag off the back of its aeroplanes it demonstrated that it did not understand that foreigners like to fly that airline because it is British-they know that in terms of quality of maintenance, safety standards and the skills of the pilots, it is second to none.
<P>
You will be relieved to hear, Mr. Gale, that that returns me directly to the amendment. The theme of my comments was flying training, which is an important component in our aviation industry. Many pilots who end up as captains on British Airways, British Midland or Virgin Atlantic will have begun their aviation lives as schoolboy or schoolgirl enthusiasts. They may have been in the Air Cadet Force in their youth but decided that they did not want to join the Royal Air Force. They have found their way to the major airlines through self-improvement. That means-[Interruption.] I am very glad that the captain of this Tory airline is back in his place. As his first officer, I hope that he will be pleased to know that the aircraft is making steady progress, straight and level, without deviating, towards our objective. We are in touch with air traffic control services-masterminded, of course, by the Under-Secretary, the hon. Member for Sunderland, South, who has responsibility for those matters. I am in close contact with him at all times.
<P>
The general aviation community provides the seed corn of much of this country's commercial flying resource, in terms of air crew and the RAF. The right hon. Member for Edinburgh, East and Musselburgh rightly drew attention not only to the concerns of general aviation, but to the increased costs that could be involved, adding to the already increasing burden of costs. I hope that members of the Committee appreciate that general aviation is an extremely important component of the big and successful picture that is this country's aerospace, aircraft and airline industry.
<P>
Whenever the question of charges for air traffic control services arises, it causes alarm and concern throughout the general aviation community. I noted what the right hon. Gentleman said about the assurances that he had received from Ministers. However, as parliamentarians we are only too familiar with the phrase, ``The Government have no plans''. We heard it in relation to tax before the previous election. Plans and intentions can change; it is capability that counts, and all Governments have the capability to impose charges. I take some comfort from the possibility that the Under-Secretary recognises that considerable expense would be involved in imposing air traffic control service charges on the general aviation community. Perhaps that is the only factor that it can rely on to protect it. I hope that the Under-Secretary will reaffirm his assurance that the Government currently have no plans in that respect, and his understanding that any such plans could involve great expense.
<P>
The Committee should take another factor into account. When I first learned to fly in 1965, my aeronautical map showed that vast tracts of this country, including the south-east, had no controlled airspace. Today, on a map such as the well-known ``1/2 million'' map, it is almost impossible to see any part of the countryside that is not covered by some form of controlled airspace. Clearly, much of that extends from a level that is well above ground level-say, from 2,500 ft. upwards-but around major airports the expansion of controlled airspace is growing all the time. That causes difficulties in accommodating private aviation. I hope that that will not be used as an excuse for making charges, on the grounds that because there is more and more controlled airspace, there is less opportunity for private aviators to fly without running into it so it is reasonable that charges should be imposed. That would be grossly unfair to the general aviation community.
<P>
Severe safety implications would be involved if the CAA, the Government or the new NATS company were to seek to impose charges on the general aviation community. That is a recognition of the value of making available to the general aviation community the full range of air traffic control services. That is a reassurance to airlines, air taxi operators and others who ply the airways professionally. The knowledge that the general aviation community is in contact with air traffic control is a reassurance to those who pay the charges.
<P>
<H5>10.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
It is a small premium for the airlines and others who are subject to charges to pay, in order to know-and for their passengers to know-that that important safety component is available.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies </B>(Croydon, Central): On the relationship between charges and disincentives to use the system-which might undermine safety, to which my hon. Friend the Minister referred-would it not be possible for the Government to levy a flat charge on all private air users? Such a charge could be redistributed through the CAA, and put towards the costs incurred, without placing a disincentive on usage.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> Of course it would be possible to impose a flat charge. That would have an instant effect on the cost of flying training. As I explained, flying training, through the self-improver route, is the source of a substantial proportion of pilots who subsequently become captains of 747s and other major airliners. Deciding how to generate a flat charge that would be regarded as fair is another matter. The fact that no charges have been imposed on the general aviation community to date is a recognition, throughout the professional aviation business, not only that it would be expensive to recover those charges, but that it would have a disadvantageous effect on flight safety. The more that we encourage private flyers to seek recourse to air traffic control services, the better. NATS and the controllers on the ground provide a very good service to the private aviator, bearing in mind the pressures on them and the fact that their principal role is to ensure the separation of airliners carrying large numbers of passengers. Nevertheless, the private aviator is greatly reassured to know that, in extremis-for example, sudden incoming bad weather-if he calls up the air traffic controller he will not be treated as an irritation, or as someone who should know better, but will be given help. That is reassuring not only for the pilots but for those on the ground, and for other users of airspace in these congested islands.
<P>
I repeat my congratulations to the right hon. Member for Edinburgh, East and Musselburgh on moving the amendment. As the Committee will understand, I have a close vested interest in the subject. The right hon. Gentleman spoke for the general aviation community, as I hope that I have done. The Minister will recognise the effect of the increased charges resulting from the JAR flight crew licensing arrangements. I hope that he will give the general aviation community the strongest possible assurance that there will be safeguards in relation to the costs of air traffic control services under the new arrangements. In perpetuating the existing arrangement, he will make a substantial contribution to the continuation of the high standards of air safety that we enjoy in this country.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I was not originally down to respond to the amendment, but as my right hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, East and Musselburgh made it clear that I was the author of the original assurance, it seems only right that I should do so.
<P>
My right hon. Friend has raised an important point, to which the hon. Member for Aldershot has ably added. No one can give an absolute guarantee that at no time in the future will there be charges for general aviation. That would be the case even if the existing arrangements for air traffic control continued indefinitely. All that I can do is repeat my earlier assurance that there are no plans for such charges. In addition, the advice that we have received is that it would be more trouble than it was worth to collect charges from general aviators, because so many transactions are involved. That is the safeguard to which I draw hon. Members' attention.
<P>
The hon. Member for Aldershot made a delightful speech. He is sometimes unfairly depicted as a humourless, right-wing idealogue, but one of the things that one learns in this place is that people rarely live up to their caricature.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth rose-</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I hope that the hon. Gentleman is not going to disappoint me.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I just wanted to save the Minister's own reputation. Can I warn him that, if anybody calls me moderate, I tend to sue them?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I am protected by privilege, I hope. I was about to say that we served together on the Home Affairs Committee and I have always found the hon. Gentleman to be a most reasonable colleague. Although his views are sometimes a little outside the main stream, I have always found that he puts them in a most reasonable and courteous way. He has that saving grace that many of us who hold strong views on one side or another have, and that is a capacity to laugh at himself occasionally.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman made a valuable speech, because he speaks from experience and I acknowledge his point about safety. Had he gone on much longer about the good lunches in Le Touquet, however, I might have revised my opinion and called for charges. The Conservative position, as I understand it, is for total privatisation. If partial privatisation makes charging of general aviation more likely, total privatisation would make it even more likely.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I think that the Minister is souring the atmosphere. I assure him that we would want to give similar assurances. It is invidious of him to suggest that my hon. Friend the Member for Aldershot, who is known among his friends as Biggles, would not get similar assurances from a Conservative Government, were we implementing our policy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I am most grateful for that comment. I have certainly no desire to sour the atmosphere. Indeed, when one sees a bit of consensus emerging in the Committee, one seizes it eagerly. Therefore, I am happy with the hon. Gentleman's assurance.
<P>
I want to make a few final points. All aircraft are required to pay charges for specific services, such as those provided in connection with landing at certain airports. General aviation users-effectively light aircraft users-are not exempt from those charges, but in practice they do not pay any, nor do they use the relevant specified services. In that respect no change from the present position is proposed, and I repeat that there is no intention to make any changes that would impact on general aviation users. The hon. Member for North Essex can put that into his book, as can my right hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, East and Musselburgh. However, it would be wrong to accept the amendment, which would enshrine in legislation the principle that the charging system could not be altered without recourse to Parliament. It is clearly not sensible, as I am sure my right hon. Friend will agree, for primary legislation to freeze the legal position in respect of non-charge-paying classes of aircraft at some arbitrary date.
<P>
I assure the hon. Gentleman that strong safeguards are in place. If NATS decides in future that it would like changes to be made to the charging provisions, those changes will need not only to be the subject of full consultation with air users but to be justified to the regulator. On the basis of those assurances, I invite the right hon. Member to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Dr. Strang:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his response, and to the hon. Member for Aldershot for his participation in the debate.
<P>
I would like to say, across the Floor, to the hon. Member for Aldershot that we all have our political baggage and our views about the public and private sectors and the role of privatisation. However, the hon. Gentleman was kind enough to say that I was speaking for the general aviation community on this issue, and most of that community take the view that ``if it ain't broke, don't fix it.'' It is common sense that, if one must make changes, one should ensure that the new system will not make matters worse. That is self-evident, and it is the view of most of those who will be affected by the provisions, that is, the people who fly in the lower airspace. I was grateful to the hon. Member for Aldershot for pointing out that this is a safety issue.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary suggested that full privatisation would make it more, rather than less, likely that charging would be introduced. I agree with him on that important point. It is not too far from my own view, which is that partial privatisation will make it more likely than no privatisation. The Government made it clear that the new strategic private partner will have control of the operation, although various safeguards have been put in place.
<P>
It remains to be seen how different an animal the new body will be from a fully privatised operation, especially in this area. That is because this area is unique in having no major security issues involved. The provision is yet another specialised pragmatic act that should lead people to reject the complex privatisation proposals before us, and to want to retain National Air Traffic Services as a public monopoly provider-a public service within the public sector.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> The right hon. Gentleman referred earlier to the view that ``if it ain't broke, don't fix it.'' That view is important, but it is always incumbent on those who seek to effect change where there is contentment with the status quo, to reassure people that they will not be worse off as a result of the changes. Would the right hon. Gentleman agree with that?
<P>
<B>Dr. Strang:</B> I would certainly agree. I am glad that the hon. Gentleman intervened for another reason: perhaps I was going too far in my disagreement with privatisation.
<P>
It is right that we should ask for undertakings from the Government. Those undertakings should be as strong as possible. We debated pensions earlier, when the Minister was forthcoming on some aspects of the two pension funds in relation to the entitlement of the new NATS employees, provided that they were being transferred from the old NATS to the same benefits as the rest of the CAA staff. We are entitled to ask for as firm a commitment as we can get. To be fair to the Government, they could not go any further than the comments made by my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary, but as I said at the outset, it would make little sense to incorporate this provision into the Bill. However, it is important to raise the issue, and I hope that Ministers and their successors will pay attention to what has been said this morning.

<P>

<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 395, in page 47, line 16, leave out first ``General''.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 403 and 404.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> Perhaps a brief tour of the horizon might be in order. This is not a complex matter, which is why I have been put in charge of it. [Laughter.] Chapter V of part I-clauses 75 to 77-will confer on the CAA powers concurrent with the Director General of Fair Trading to deal with competition issues in the supply of air traffic services. Those powers arise from the Fair Trading Act 1973 and the Competition Act 1998.
<P>
The Government take competition seriously and, as we have said, we would consider tabling amendments to lay an explicit duty to promote competition on the Secretary of State and the CAA. We recognise that, for a number of years at least, meaningful competition for the provision of en-route air traffic services is likely to be limited to parts of the market. For example, we have discussed the possibility of licensing to NATS, or another provider, new international airspace for which the UK assumes responsibility. There is also the possibility of further competition in the provision of services such as terminal approach control and North sea helicopters, which could be permitted through licensing and the licence amendment process. Competition already exists for the provision of air traffic services at airports, and we want to build on that. Where possible, competition should be promoted; we do not want anti-competitive behaviour in the market.
<P>
Committee members will note that, consistent with powers enjoyed by other sector regulators, we propose to give the CAA powers concurrent with the Director General of Fair Trading in respect of the supply of air traffic services, and not merely en-route air traffic services. Clauses 75 and 76 will confer concurrent powers under the Competition Act 1998. Those powers will allow the regulator to conduct investigations into possible anti-competitive behaviour and apparent abuses of a dominant position, impose interim measures to prevent serious and irreparable damage to the victims of prohibited behaviour, impose financial penalties on those responsible for anti-competitive behaviour, and give and enforce directions to ensure that anti-competitive behaviour does not persist.
<P>
In addition, the clauses confer concurrent powers under the 1973 Act for the investigation of and, if necessary, reference to the Competition Commission of monopoly situations relating to the supply of air traffic services that may have effects adverse to the public interest. A monopoly situation occurs when, inter alia, a single player, or a group of interconnected players, would supply at least one quarter of all services in the United Kingdom.
<P>
Clause 77 sets out the procedures for the exercise of the functions under the 1973 Act, which are carried out concurrently by the CAA and the director general. That is to avoid duplication of regulatory activity. The procedures are also designed to ensure that any action is taken by the most appropriate authority. If the CAA makes reference to the Competition Commission, it must help the commission with its investigations by providing any relevant information in its possession. Concurrent jurisdiction will also be exercised in conformity with procedures and guidelines established by the CAA and the director general, as has been the case for other regulated utility sectors.
<P>
The amendments correct drafting errors. Eagle-eyed members of the Committee will have spotted that subsection (1)(c) refers to ``the Director General'' and explains that he is the Director General of Fair Trading. Elsewhere in part I, however, he is referred to simply as ``the Director''. Therefore, in the interests of clarity and consistency, amendment No. 395 makes subsection (1)(c) refer to ``the Director''.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 403 and 404 correct mistaken cross-references to the Competition Act 1980. Schedule 2 to the Competition Act 1998 inserted a paragraph (r) in section 19 of the 1980 Act, hence our error in the Bill.
<P>
As I say, the amendments are purely technical and I commend them to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> We trust that the Minister has it all right now.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I am sure that we have.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.

Clause 75, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 76</center></H4>
<H4><center>Functions exercisable by CAA and Director</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 396, in page 47, line 20, leave out from `apply' to second `the' in line 21 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`shall be concurrent functions of the CAA and'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take the following Government amendments: Nos. 397 to 402 and 405.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> These amendments are also technical in nature. They are for clarification and to ensure that the functions conferred by chapter V will automatically change as and when the Fair Trading Act 1973 and the Competition Act 1998 are amended, thus avoiding the need to amend chapter V at the same time. It was felt that there might be a risk that the use of the term ``transferred'' would be taken erroneously to refer to a one-„off event and that, consequently, chapter V would not be amended by amendments to the 1973 and 1998 Acts.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 398 to 402 specify that clause 77, which sets down the procedures for the exercise of concurrent powers, applies only to functions under the 1973 Act. Regulations made under section 54 of the 1998 Act will deal, so far as is necessary, with the matters set out in clause 77 relating to the concurrent functions under the 1998 Act.
<P>
Amendment No. 397 removes some inappropriate cross-references in subsection (7)(b). That provision states that, with certain exceptions, no objection may be made to anything done by the CAA under part I of the 1998 Act on the ground that it should have been done by the Director General of Fair Trading. However, the subsection includes some functions which, under sections 52(6), 52(8) and 54 of the 1998 Act can only be exercised by, or in relation to, the director. These references are a mistake-commendable frankness there, Mr. Gale-and the amendment is intended to delete them.
<P>
Amendment No. 405 would ensure that the general objectives of the CAA in section 4 of the Civil Aviation Act 1982 do not apply when the CAA is exercising a function under the Competition Act 1998. That is necessary in order to secure consistent application of the provisions of the 1998 Act by the Director General of Fair Trading and all the regulators who exercise functions concurrently with him.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> These are extremely complex matters and I cannot pretend that Conservative Members have fully understood them. I reiterate the fact that once again complex provisions are not expected to be relevant to the operation of the PPP for 30 years. All such provisions are excessive. I hope that the Minister will consider revisiting the whole question of the application of competition and the number of licences that will be involved. The current provisions appear to involve excessive complications.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> We shall consider that, but I do not believe that our approach is unusual in relation to the regulation of utilities.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, we may take amendment No. 379, in page 51, line 13, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(11A) Nothing arising from the European Communities Act 1972 as amended shall limit the powers of the Secretary of State to give directions under this section.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The Minister may argue that the amendment replicates provisions that are already contained in the clause that relates to national security. We discussed the contract between the Secretary of State for Defence and National Air Traffic Services, and the fact that such directions may be necessary in times of national emergency and at times when matters of national security are relevant.
<P>
The amendment would prevent confusion in a time of national crisis, when national security is paramount, and it would clarify where responsibility for national security lies at a time of national crisis. It has been drafted as widely as possible, with the insertion of ``as he thinks appropriate'', which gives the Secretary of State the maximum leeway to determine matters of national security. Amendment No. 379 risks going over ground that we have already covered, which I do not propose to do. We have already discussed whether there are obligations under the European Community treaty that might override issues of national security. In the previous debate, the Minister of State attempted to wriggle out from under the inevitability of national security matters being compromised and justiciable under the European Community treaties. I shall merely reiterate that that also applies to this clause.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
What we may regard as a dire national emergency or international crisis might not be regarded as such by other EU members. If we had a crisis in which other EU members did not wish to support us, they might use their powers, under European Communities legislation, to enforce their view instead of ours. I notice a glint in your eye, Mr. Gale, and I do not propose to discuss the matter at any length.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Dr. Strang:</B> It goes without saying that this is an important part of the Bill. I am grateful to you, Mr. Gale, for anticipating this clause to some extent in a previous debate. I shall not repeat what I said earlier. A good Chairman of a Standing Committee is a little like a football referee-he has the good sense to allow the game to flow and to maintain discipline without constantly interrupting play. That is a sensible way to allow the Committee to develop.
<P>
In response to the hon. Member for North Essex, it is important to clarify the security issue. Different threats exist-I am not trying to suggest that the hon. Gentleman does not acknowledge that-and, to some extent, that was revealed in earlier discussions, when he quoted from European Union literature. I suspect, from what he was saying that there is a difference between our interpretation of ``public security'' or ``national security'', and the interpretation in Brussels, although I do not want to focus on Europe in this debate. We must address the threat-for example, a terrorist threat such as the hijacking at Stansted. A whole range of variations exists. The threat might not be a hijack, but something in the plane that would cause enormous damage to the civilian population of this country. That issue is germane to the Committee's previous discussions. We are considering a situation in which the Prime Minister and the Defence Secretary might say, ``We are on the verge of a real crisis''. The clause states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Secretary of State may give directions to any listed person in any time of actual or imminent hostilities or of severe international tension or of great national emergency''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is drafted widely, which is no doubt right, and I hope that the Minister will elaborate on it. In such circumstances, the Government must take control of the system. That does not arise only when formal hostilities are under way, but during periods of international tension. We should not lose sight of the fact that this country is sometimes heavily exposed in that respect. Wisely-or perhaps unwisely-we sometimes seek to have a major influence on various international situations throughout the world, whether in the middle east, the Balkans or wherever.
<P>
It is important to recognise that we are talking not only about war. A crisis could arise in the middle east, say, in which the UK strongly aligns itself with the United States, which is taking a leading position, while another faction taking a different view is supported by one or two of the other major powers. That is the kind of situation that is relevant, rather than a hijack or another incident on a plane that could do real damage to the civil population. I hope that the Minister will confirm that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> Clause 81 gives the Secretary of State power to give directions to a range of people engaged in aviation and related activities in times of severe international tension, great national emergency or actual or imminent hostilities. It has similarities with sections 62 and 63 of the Civil Aviation Act 1982, which it replaces.
<P>
Amendment No. 377 would give the Secretary of State the power to direct the CAA or a licence holder with regard to the performance of their functions if it is thought appropriate to do so in the interests of national security. Members of the Committee will recall that the issue of national security arose in relation to clause 38. That provision, and another to which I shall turn in a moment, make the amendment unnecessary. I refer the hon. Member for North Essex to clause 38(1), which makes it clear that the Secretary of State can give directions to the licence holder in the interests of national security. That aspect is thoroughly covered.
<P>
I know that the hon. Gentleman is much preoccupied with Europe, so I shall clarify once and for all how issues of national security relate to European provisions. Contrary to what he said earlier, the concept of public security in the European Community treaty includes that of national security. I have already referred to the Sirdar judgment, which was given only last October. Paragraph 17 of the judgment states that the
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``concept of public security . . . covers both a Member State's internal security . . . and its external security''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
National security is protected under European Community law.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Where in the treaty does it say that nothing in it shall limit member states' exercise of control over matters that they consider to be issues of their public security-to use the European Community term? In fact, it does not say that. The exclusions for public security are pretty narrow. As the Minister acknowledged, matters of public security are justiciable by the European Court, and he cannot deny that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The hon. Gentleman is wrong. I know that he is a great expert on European matters, and I urge him to look into the matter further. Article 297-formerly article 224-of the treaty recognises the right of a member state to take measures
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``in the event of serious internal disturbances affecting the maintenance of law and order, in the event of war, serious international tension constituting a threat of war, or in order to carry out obligations it has accepted for the purpose of maintaining peace and international security''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That makes it absolutely clear that the exercise of the powers in clause 81 would be entirely consistent with the treaty.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I accept that the article exists, but because it is in the treaty it would be for the European Court of Justice to reconcile any conflict between it and obligations elsewhere in the treaty. Matters of public security are narrowly defined elsewhere in the treaty. I am referring to the treaty that is in force-I believe that the Amsterdam treaty is not yet in force.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford indicated dissent.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> It is in force. I beg the Committee's pardon.
<P>
Article 36, which refers to elimination of quantitative restrictions between member states-I am referring to the old treaty-states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The provisions of Articles 28 and 29 shall not preclude prohibitions or restrictions on imports, exports or goods in transit justified on grounds of public morality, public policy or public security''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
However, it continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Such prohibitions or restrictions shall not, however, constitute a means of arbitrary discrimination or a disguised restriction on trade between Member States.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If another group of countries regards what we regard as a matter of national security as an arbitrary or discriminatory restriction on trade between member states, the court is required to adjudicate on that matter, and it may not take the same view. The Minister might regard the matter as one of national security, but the court may not agree. That has already happened in with sex equality in the armed forces.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The hon. Gentleman has illustrated perfectly why his party will remain in opposition for a very long time. The Conservatives are utterly obsessed with the minutiae of a treaty that they do not fully understand. Article 36, which the hon. Gentleman just quoted, deals with the free movement of goods, so it inevitably provides a series of safeguards against actions that would infringe such movement, and rightly so. He must recognise that article 297 makes it clear that, in the event of a series of defined activities that cover the provisions we are describing, an individual member state may take action consistent with the treaty. As I said, the European Court, which he prays in aid, made it clear in the Sirdar judgment that matters of public security include both internal and external security.
<P>
The Opposition are talking a load of nonsense. They are trying to conjure their Eurosceptic fantasy of European commissioners who try to fetter this country's ability to defend itself, but there is no substance to it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gerald Howarth:</B> The Minister is working himself into a lather, but the Conservative party will prove popular at the next election in part because my hon. Friend the Member for North Essex is using this Committee to probe the Government's understanding of the consequences of the Bill.
<P>
The Minister has argued to the Committee, the House and the people that it is for us exclusively to determine what constitutes a national emergency. In other words, he has argued that the definition of a national emergency rests solely with the British people. However, his words will ring hollow when the British people realise that what we believed was an issue for Parliament has been usurped by the European Commission, the European Court of Justice or the European Court of Human Rights. The legislation that is being debated this afternoon on the Floor of the House concerns the European Court of Human Rights; it has nothing to do with Parliament.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I remind the hon. Gentleman that interventions are interventions, not speeches.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> There are three simple principles. First article 297, to which I have referred, and which the hon. Member for North Essex cannot gainsay because he knows that it is in the treaty, makes it clear that, on a range of defined activities that we would all acknowledge as covering matters of national security and national emergency, the member state has the ability to act in its own interest. That is compatible with the treaty obligations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> Is that clear?
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> It is absolutely clear in article 297. I hope that, unless hon. Members can demonstrate that that article has been repealed, which it has not, they will stop making their ridiculous claims about supposed European demands to take competence in this area.
<P>
Secondly, Opposition Members appear unaware of the fact that the final act on accession of the European Community to Eurocontrol, signed on 27 January 2000, contains a clear acknowledgement that there is no EC competence on defence and security policies. It is surprising that we have not heard about that from Opposition Members.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Is that a declaration?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> It is. This statement describes having adopted the following joint declaration on the absence of community competence in the fields of national security and defence.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Will the Minister say whether he believes that the declaration is justiciable by the European Court of Justice?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I thought that we might have that question. That is the hon. Gentleman's third line of argument and the third on which I shall shoot him down. In the Sirdar judgment, to which we have already referred, the European Court of Justice made it perfectly clear that matters of public security cover national security. The European Court of Justice may wish to look at the matter, but it must-if it is to be consistent with the Sirdar judgment-accept that matters of national security are covered by provisions for public security. Furthermore, the provisions of article 297 make it compatible with the treaty for member states to pursue issues of their own national security.
<P>
We have heard a lot of nonsense from Opposition Members. I hope that they will now accept that the arrangements that we are introducing give real safeguards and guarantees for our national security.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I understand that this is essentially a re-enactment of some of the provisions of the Civil Aviation Act 1982. Will the Minister inform us of any significant changes to the provisions in the 1982 Act, of which we should be aware? I cannot find the appropriate section. Perhaps the Minister will draw my attention to it?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> It is section 6 of that Act. The amendment tabled by the Opposition suggests that the Secretary of State should have the power to direct any licence holder or the CAA in the interests of national security. Those powers are now provided by clause 38 in the Bill. We are discussing two separate sets of provisions: the clause 38 power, which covers the general matters of national security, and the powers in clause 81, which deal specifically with a state of emergency.
<P>
There is a fundamental difference between those provisions. If hon. Members look carefully at the text of clauses 38 and 81, they will see that, whereas in clause 38, there is a provision for consultation-a perfectly proper arrangement-before directions are issued, clause 81 affords no such provision, because these powers are expected to be used only in emergencies, when there is a need for immediate action. Clearly, it would be wrong for the Government to be inhibited by an obligation to consult before it could issue a direction. These provisions carry forward powers that already exist in the 1982 Act, and they are there to ensure that the relevant powers are available to protect our national security in an emergency.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I am sorry to keep pressing the Minister. It seems that clause 81 is a completely new re-enactment, and that clause 38 deals with section 6 of the 1982 Act. As clause 38 provides for consultation and clause 81 provides for a fiat by Government, why has this extensive clause been deemed necessary?
<P>
I ask the Minister a further question. What happens if the United Kingdom seeks to apply sanctions that extend to the operations of a particular airline or airlines from a particular country? For example, in view of their concerns about Austria, the Government might like to impose sanctions on Lauda Air or other Austrian airlines. Could that be done under the clause, without any consultation?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> Clause 81 is designed to cover periods of emergency and hostilities. I do not believe that that applies in the case of Lauda Air. It certainly would not be appropriate for action to be taken against an airline that might be thought to be acting improperly on the basis of these provisions. The provisions are intended to cope with an emergency situation where it is necessary for the Secretary of State to act in the national interest. The clause empowers him to direct the CAA to carry out a series of actions, which are defined in subsection (4):
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``(a) to regulate or prohibit . . . the navigation of all or any descriptions of aircraft over the United Kingdom or over part of it or over any area of sea;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(b) to regulate or prohibit . . . the use, building, maintenance or establishment of aerodromes or flying schools or of any description of aerodrome or flying school;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(c) to secure that relevant assets are taken into the Secretary of State's possession for use by or for the purposes of the armed forces of the Crown.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The hon. Member for Aldershot will recognise the circumstances in which those powers might be needed, but they would be in a national emergency and not simply an action against Lauda Air.
<P>
There are distinctions between the existing provisions and the new ones, because NATS and the CAA are now separated. Clause 38 allows the Secretary of State to give directions to NATS, whereas clause 81 replaces sections 62 and 63 of the 1982 Act. The existing provisions of section 6 of the 1982 Act, which are not repealed, cover the Secretary of State's power to give directions to the CAA.
<P>
There are again some complex inter-„relationships here, but I hope that the hon. Gentleman will recognise that the provisions give the Secretary of State the power to intervene as necessary, either in the general national interest or, separately, in an emergency, and that they cover the type of circumstance that might be needed to defend the national interest.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for his courtesy. May I put another point to him which does arise today? It relates to hijackers taking control of an aircraft and effectively nominating a country to which they wish the aircraft to go. We may see a spate of such hijackings in the future, especially if people are given asylum as a consequence of having landed in the United Kingdom, and that could give rise to a considerable national emergency. Will the clause provide powers to the Secretary of State to direct NATS to refuse landing rights in the United Kingdom to an aircraft under the control of hijackers?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I appreciate that to some extent that point is relevant to the clause, although it is a moot point whether it is relevant to the amendment, and that it is of general interest, but I do not propose to allow the Committee to embark on a discussion that will take place on the Floor of the House later today. I shall, however, allow the Minister to answer in narrow terms the specific query that he has been asked.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> Thank you, Mr. Gale. In response to the hon. Gentleman's question, article 78 of the Air Navigation (No. 2) Order 1995 requires a provider of air traffic services not to provide such services at any place unless they are provided in accordance with the standards and procedures that are specified in the NATS manual. Part I of that manual has a chapter on hijacking and part II contains detailed requirements. In the event of a hijacking, the watch commander of the unit dealing with the provision of air traffic services is required to communicate with the transport security division of the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions. That results in the aircraft being routed to Stansted, as we recently witnessed.
<P>
I hope that that answers the question that the hon. Member for North Essex asked about the powers that will be available to deal with a hijacking. If it appears that a hijack constitutes a serious threat to this country, the powers in the clause will apply, but if it appears that a hijack will have no material impact on national security, the Air Navigation (No. 2) Order 1995 will provide a framework to deal with the problem.
<P>
I hope that that deals with Committee members' concerns. I know that it goes against the grain, but I hope that the hon. Member for North Essex will withdraw his unnecessary amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I listened carefully to the Minister's slightly intemperate outburst, which I felt had more to do with his party's politicking than with the clause. My hon. Friend the Member for Aldershot made an interesting point about the European Community's attitude towards Austria and about how the provisions in the clause would be relevant. The European Union is taking on a role that has traditionally been dealt with by member states. That may not relate to the provisions, but we may receive directions to take actions that might surprise us.
<P>
The Minister's fundamental mistake was to rest his argument on article 297 of the Amsterdam treaty. I do not think that the hon. Gentleman had read it as carefully as he suggested he had done. The article states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Member States shall consult each other with a view to taking together the steps needed to prevent the functioning of the common market being affected by measures which a Member State may be called upon to take in the event of serious internal disturbances affecting the maintenance of law and order, in the event of war, serious international tension constituting a threat of war, or in order to carry out obligations it has accepted for the purpose of maintaining peace and international security.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In other words, it places an obligation to consult on member states, but it does not provide an exemption to deal with matters of national security. If the actions that Ministers want to take on the pretext of national security are not international obligations or obligations that we have been called on to meet, they will not be covered by the clause. The Minister must acknowledge three facts about the article: first, that it merely provides an obligation to consult; secondly, that it involves ways to maintain the provisions of the single market, but to override them; and, thirdly, it refers only to what we ``may be called upon'' to do as a result of international obligations. If the Minister rests his defence on that article, he is on very shaky ground.
<P>
Earlier, I quoted article 36 of the old treaty. I quoted from the old treaty because the new treaty is not available in a handy form-[Hon. Members: ``Sold out''.]

<P>

<B>Mr. Gerald Howarth:</B> Hon. Members say that it has been sold out. That could only have happened if the European Commission's propaganda office in London had bought up all the copies that they give out free.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I shall press on, because I know that hon. Members want to finish considering this matter.
<P>
My point is that the article provides no exclusion whatever for actions to be taken by member states. The point of quoting from article 36 of the former treaty was to demonstrate, in relation to the four freedoms underpinning the legal obligations of EU member states, that there are specific and narrow exclusions on public security matters. If we consider transport, which is set in stone in articles 70 to 80 in the Amsterdam treaty, there is no exclusion on public security matters. Moreover, as I pointed out before, the provisions for creating law and obligations by directive under that set of articles are by qualified majority voting.
<P>
The Minister should reflect on the fact that the past 25 years are littered with ministerial assurances about what will not and cannot happen and is not provided for in the treaties. We are dealing with a malleable and expanding legal order in the European Union, against which the United Kingdom has no constitutional defence whatever. The European Court of Justice is capable of interpreting what meaning it wants in those treaties. I heard someone say a few moments ago that I keep a handy copy of the treaty under my pillow-anyone who knows anything about the politics should know something about the procedures by which decisions are made in his party, his Committee or his country. We are familiar with the procedures by which laws are made in our country. That is why everyone should be familiar with the provisions of the treaty. It is not good enough for the Minister to grab a sloppy briefing from one of his officials and insist that it provides an absolute defence against any European Union decision on national security issues. That is simply not so. He will go down as one of many Ministers who have received comfortable briefings from his officials about things that cannot happen under the treaties. He will find that history proves him wrong.
<P>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 378, in page 51, line 1, leave out subsection (10).
<P>
The amendment places an obligation on the Secretary of State to pay out compensation to people who might suffer loss as a result of directions under this clause. Is that precedented in previous legislation? Is it normal, in what is effectively a state of war, for the Government to accept liability for the damages that their actions might cause?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I am surprised that the hon. Gentleman should seek the deletion of this subsection. It is a matter of natural justice that an individual should have the right of compensation from the Secretary of State if he has been deprived of the benefit of an asset within his ownership. The hon. Gentleman asked whether that is precedented; I am assured that it is. It is also a matter of natural justice, and I hope that he will recognise that and withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Dr. Strang:</B> I agree with my hon. Friend the Minister. As he explained, we are talking about a national emergency or imminent hostilities. Let us suppose that this new animal has been created. We must assume that the strategic partner may be a private company that is not based in the UK, because the Government have not ruled that option out. One of the situations to which the Bill refers-say an imminent hostility-arises. The company concerned-I shall not give a specific example, because I do not want to imply criticism of another country-is a foreign company, which, although the bulk of its employees are British, has one or two foreign nationals working for it. When the imminent hostility arises, the foreign national says, quite reasonably, ``Sorry, I'm not on the British side, and neither are the people who employ me'', and has to give up his job. Would that loss be covered? It is crucial that such issues are taken into account in choosing the new strategic partner.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I remind my right hon. Friend that clause 81 is designed to cover situations of extreme international tension in which there is a clear need for the state to take urgent action to protect its interests. If, in that situation, the power that was exercised took away from an individual the right to continue his or her business, thereby involving a loss, it is reasonable that the question of compensation would arise. That is not consequential on the new strategic partnership; it is a matter of the Secretary of State exercising the powers that are necessary-as I think that we would all agree-to protect the national interest in an extreme emergency.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gerald Howarth:</B> The right hon. Member for Edinburgh, East and Musselburgh raised an important matter. It is no use hon. Members looking at their watches-the Committee is here to scrutinise legislation. What would happen in the case of, say, the aerodrome in Farnborough, which could soon be owned by foreign nationals outside this country, if one of its assets, such as an aeroplane, was owned by nationals of a country with which we were in conflict? The Minister is right to adduce the principle of natural justice, but I do not think that the British people would consider it to be natural justice if enemies of the United Kingdom-
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. This is the third time that I have had to reprimand the hon. Gentleman for making speeches rather than interventions. Interventions are interventions and speeches are speeches. If he wishes to try to catch my eye, he is of course at liberty to do so. So far, he has done so unfailingly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I can respond only by saying that this is an emergency power that is available to cope with emergency situations. As the hon. Member for Aldershot said, one of the affected assets could be owned by a body that is owned overseas-possibly by a country with which the United Kingdom has come into conflict. In that situation, the compensation provisions would still apply, but in the event of international hostilities it is unlikely that representatives of that country would seek redress through the British courts, which would be the only way in which they could do so. The hon. Gentleman can rest assured that the provision is unlikely to be used by a country in direct hostilities with the United Kingdom as a means of reducing our war chest, if I may use that phrase. I hope that he will recognise that the principle of natural justice applies and that the person who has an asset removed as a result of this exercise of power by the Secretary of State should, in principle, be entitled to compensation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The hon. Gentleman may wish to reflect on the point that has been made and perhaps table an amendment on Report. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
