							<b class="B">Mr.
Dominic Grieve</b> (Beaconsfield) (Con):
Good morning. What is Liberty&#146;s view on gathering and sharing
information? It is clear in the various clauses that one of the
purposes, at least, is to bring the security services within a
statutory framework. However, the powers are extensive, and include not
only the prevention of crime but the use of information for national
security purposes, or for the purposes of the security services
themselves. First, does Liberty have a view on that in principle?
Secondly, if there is anything that causes you anxiety, should
something be done about
it?</div>
					<a name="0804251000014"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								Gareth
Crossman:
							</b>
						</i> The point of principle is that we would
much rather see any information-sharing system on a statutory rather
than a non-statutory basis, for various reasons including human rights
compliance. To be prescribed by law is an important step in something
that has the potential to be extremely invasive. We have no issue of
principle with the idea of information-sharing powers&#151;including
the DNA-sharing powers that are contained in the Bill&#151;being
placed on a statutory basis.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column96" />Column number: 96</div>
					<a name="0804251000015"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, in a
way you have identified where our concerns might lie, particularly in
relation to DNA. The current national DNA database, which is operated
by the police, serves a single purpose, and that single purpose is
crime detection. By allowing the security services to have a broader
remit for national security purposes, the concept becomes rather more
nebulous. It includes crime detection, but is not limited to that. One
of our concerns is that when mass data retention has taken
place&#151;at present the national DNA database has 4.5 million
samples&#151;it is always possible that the uses of that database
will be extended beyond crime detection and prevention. This is the
first statutory instance where there will be the power for other
purposes to be in place. My suggestion would be to limit the security
services to the same role as that of the police in relation to
sample-sharing powers.</div>

and we may have to tease it out at a later stage, but I wondered what
instances might exist where national security issues were not related

							<b class="B">Mr.
David Heath</b> (Somerton and Frome) (LD): May I follow up
what is implied by that? It is something that has concerned me for some
time. Over recent years, various Acts of Parliament have conferred
considerable exceptional powers on the police and security services to
deal with an exceptional circumstance: terrorism. In your
organisation&#146;s experience, have those powers been used within
the limits that Parliament expected?</div>
					<a name="0804251000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								Gareth
Crossman:
							</b>
						</i> No. That is a significant problem. There
has been a tendency, not only in counter-terrorism, but across the
board in legislating over the last few years, to set the parameters of
the legislation quite wide, and then make a promise that it will not be
used in inappropriate ways. I will give a couple of examples: section
44 of the Terrorism Act 2000, which the legislation states was passed
specifically for anti-terrorism purposes, has been used as a general
stop-and-search tool. That is not the opinion only of Liberty; it is
the opinion expressed by the Metropolitan Police Authority. A week or
so ago, we heard that Poole council in Dorset had been using powers
under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000&#151;those are
very invasive powers&#151;specifically to find out whether people
were operating within the catchment area of a local school. I suggest
that that purpose was not identified by Parliament at the
time.</div>

Chakrabarti:

						</i> Yes. The idea of a bargain in the
English language is that behind that bargain, agreement or contract,
sits some kind of equity between the parties. As we know, from examples
coming from the United States, on occasion that bargain is far from
equitable. There is a suggestion that people may have bargained away
their liberty because they were advised that they had no hope against a
more serious charge, and they may perhaps have admitted things that
they would not freely have admitted. Just as important, if not more
important, in this context is justice to victims and their families.
Again, there is a suggestion that if deals are done and bargains are
struck with defendants, the victims are left out of the process. It is
a difficult issue. There is no doubt that the public can, on occasion,
be protected by deals being struck on a plea-bargaining basis with
someone who has done bad things but who will be of assistance to the
authorities. In that equation, one must also remember that individual
victims and their families need justice to ensure that they do not feel
that their rights and freedoms have been traded away for a greater
good.</div>

						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								Shami
Chakrabarti:
							</b>
						</i> Perhaps I can set out the big picture
and Mr. Crossman, as always, will add flesh to the
bones.</div>
					<a name="0804251000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is an
important distinction to be made. There is questioning post-charge for
the offence with which you have already been charged, which is
essentially dealt with in the Bill as it is presented. For example, I
have charged you with possessing material for a terrorist purpose.
Presumably, I have charged you on evidence. Subsequent to that charge,
I want to question you again. That has often caused great anxiety to
the judiciary and to lawyers. Their legitimate fear&#151;I do not
think that it is an objection in principle, but one of concern about
how the practice would work&#151;is that you might charge too
lightly, and then in the long period between charge and trial, subject
somebody to repeated, oppressive questioning on the same matter until
they crack. No doubt one would have to work very hard to ensure that
appropriate safeguards are in place to stop that from happening. Also,
we hope, and believe, that people are charged on proper evidence in the
first place, so it is not often necessary to do extensive post-charge
questioning unless new material has genuinely come to light. It is in
the interests of justice that new material be put to an accused
person.</div>
					<a name="0804251000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">Then
there is a different animal, which is something that is not really
pursued and that we would like to see pursued. As the Metropolitan
Police Commissioner 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column98" />Column number: 98</div>outlined the other day, terrorism is special. It is special in the
complexity of some plots, in the gravity of potential consequences and,
in the words that he used, in the seriousness of the ambition. You are
dealing with something that has a disproportionate danger to the
public. In recent years, you and your colleagues have placed on to the
statute book a number of what we would call precursor offences, or
low-level terrorist offences. Let us make no mistake, those are serious
matters. Offences include being a member of a proscribed organisation,
funding and inciting terrorism, possessing material for a terrorist
purpose and so on. They are serious custodial offences in their own
right, but they are offences that are sometimes easier to prove than
the international complex conspiracy to
murder.</div>
					<a name="0804251000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
principle, there is no reason why, if someone is chargeable and
convictable for a precursor offence&#151;do not get me wrong, some of
those offences in their day were quite controversial, but they are
proper offences that this House has passed&#151;the authorities
should not get on and charge them at the earliest possible opportunity.
Even if the same set of facts and broadly the same allegation is later
capable of being charged as a conspiracy to murder as new evidence
emerges, there should be the possibility of continuing with the
investigation and potentially the subsequent questioning with judicial
safeguards. That would allow the police and prosecutors to charge
earlier for the original, lower level but serious offence and have the
opportunity to charge later on, with quite a long period between
charge, which we say should be done as quickly possible and within
hours or days, and trial. Realistically, in a complex terror case, that
period could be up to a year.</div>
					<a name="0804251000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">In England and Wales, the moment
of charge is really special and it should come as soon as possible, as
that is the first moment when somebody knows why they are detained and
they have the opportunity to start preparing their defence. The
post-charge questioning that we are advocating for the more grave,
conventional conspiracy to murder could actually be of great
assistance. When it was put to the commissioner, facetiously, that some
people think the police are not charging as soon as they should, that
they are faffing about, no one had suggested that the police were
faffing about. <i class="I">[Interruption.] </i>I can only say that I certainly
do not think so and I do not think that there is any lack of good faith
on the part of the police, but the current arrangements create a
genuine and understandable incentive for the police not to charge with
a lower level offence until they are sure that they cannot charge
conspiracy to murder.</div>

appropriate to allow further questioning: that the original charges
were appropriate; 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column99" />Column number: 99</div>that it was in the interest of justice to allow further questioning; and
that any further questioning would not be oppressive. Those are
relatively straightforward determinations for a court to
make.</div>

						</i> One might also make sure that the
current sorts of safeguards that apply under PACE codes, such as access
to a solicitor, breaks and all of the things that have become so
important in a police station, would apply. Remember, this person is
now not in the police station any more, but in prison custody. One of
the historical reasons why my profession and Gareth&#146;s has been
concerned about the idea of post-charge questioning is that in a
pre-PACE world, people would be subject to lengthy, oppressive
questioning. We must ensure that the same physical, practical
safeguards such as access to lawyers, tape recording, video taping,
appropriate breaks all apply even though a person is no longer in the
police station, but on remand in custody for offence No.1, a lower
level offence.</div>
					<a name="0804251000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, we would argue that
prosecutors apply to a judge for permission and that the judge grants
permission on the basis that charge No. 1 was not a trumped-up charge,
as has sometimes been suggested; it was a proper charge in the first
place, it justified custody in its own right&#151;it was not stealing
a bicycle, for example, but possessing material for a terrorist
purpose&#151;and that as Gareth said it is in the interests of
justice to put this further material to the
accused.</div>

privacy, but privacy is not an absolute. It is an important value in
our society, but it is always subject to some balanced interference,
which must be necessary, proportionate and in accordance with the law.
Gareth is an expert on this subject. It is often necessary and
certainly proportionate, and can easily be in accordance with the law.
We would like to see judges more involved in authorising interception
rather than senior police officers or politicians, but it can well be
necessary, proportionate and lawful to intercept people&#146;s
telephone calls, particularly when it is thought that they may be
involved in terrorism. Once you have made that interference for that
laudable objective, why on earth would you not find a way to use the
material in evidence in a courtroom, as they do in the United States,
and all over Europe and the democratic world? I understand that the
security services have historical and operational concerns that must be
met. However, our basic proposition is that with wit, wisdom and a
common enterprise to do this, people could work together to achieve
that outcome. The Privy Council report commissioned by the Prime
Minister is a helpful step in that
direction.</div>
					<a name="0804251000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, as
someone who used to work on the other side of the desk, so to speak,
and with the security services, part of their historical objection
comes from a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column100" />Column number: 100</div>time when the security services&#146; job in this country was not
really aimed at bringing people to court. In the days of the cold war,
it was not really about Crown court trials, but about espionage between
states. It was a cold war between states. It was not about individuals
who owe loyalty to no particular state, and who, ultimately, must be
brought to justice in a criminal court, with which intercept evidence
could be incredibly
helpful.</div>
					<a name="0804251000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">Why
is it permissible to bug my bedroom with a listening device and use
that material in court, yet if I happen to be having the same
conversation on my telephone&#151;it could be to my husband; we could
be plotting wicked things together&#151;rather than discussing it in
the bedroom, the material could never be used, however valuable it
would be in convicting us? There is an absolute legal prohibition on
it. We must all do better, both on our side of the desk and the
security community, to work together to crack
this.</div>

about the intention to use the evidence to convict people, but that, by
using it, gaps in their knowledge would be shown. It would show where
there are weaknesses, as inevitably there are. Do you not recognise

Lord Carlile has been mooting this idea for two or three years. It is
not something that has come upon us all of a sudden. We are still
talking about intercept. No doubt you have observed the evidence of Sir
Ian Blair earlier this week. He was quite dismissive of intercept
evidence, saying that there were numerous legislative and
administrative problems and all manner of other problems with it.
Roughly, what he said was it is not going to happen in the next few
years. What do you think is the real objection? If the United States is
able to do it without compromising the sources or giving secrets away
about their technology, am I being simplistic in saying that we should
be looking at it
immediately?</div>

if it can be done in the United States and all over the free world, we
can do it. That is not to say that work does not need to be done to
meet some of the concerns of the security services. By the way, in my
experience the agencies have not always spoken with one voice on this
issue. Unsurprisingly, over the years it has often been the Security
Service, which was a bit closer to the criminal justice paradigm, that
has pushed for it. I may be out of date on
that.</div>
					<a name="0804251000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">As for Sir Ian, I
did not pick up on what you said. If he was dismissive of intercepts,
that is disappointing. It is also a change of mind on his part. I
remember vividly being telephoned by a journalist one Saturday morning
a couple of years ago because Sir Ian had said that we should have
intercept evidence in courts. They had called me, of course, because
they expected me to be outraged. Imagine their surprise when I said
that Liberty has been calling for that for some time. In my experience,
Sir Ian appreciated that it could be useful. It is very useful in the
United States, not only in terror trials, but in organised crime
trials. If he has changed his mind, I am disappointed about
that.</div>

plot to hijack planes and fly them into Canary Wharf, which was

want to be clear to you, Mr. Bercow, and to the rest of the
Committee that we at Liberty never predicate any of our arguments on
the basis of whether the threat is at this or that level. We do not
question bad faith on the part of others. However, we have expressed
concerns about the practice of off-the-record briefings about
intelligence. There are moments when the public need to know what is
going on, partly to inform debate and partly because there is a public
information duty. When you see a police raid in your area, you cannot

think that there is a general acceptance of the use to which intercept

Investigatory Powers Act 2000 we do not just face things head on. You
acknowledge the use of the intercept material by selecting small areas
in which you think it could be put into operational use, such as asset
freezing proceedings, rather than taking the bull by the horns and
saying: we know that intercept material can be of use in a range of
proceedings, be it asset freezing or others, so why not just deal with

from a feeling on the part of those who advise the Government that it
cannot be made to work in the classic adversarial criminal justice

and those different quasi-judicial systems that are not Rolls-Royce
criminal due process. We disagree. We know that it is hard, but we say
that people like us would have to sit down with people in the security
and intelligence community and genuinely work together to make sure
that it can be done, that there can be proper Rolls-Royce criminal due

						</i> No, it does not affect our view, partly
because we have heard Sir Ian&#146;s views on many occasions. He has
been very straight about the fact that there is no current evidence, no
current case and no current necessity, but he talks about a pragmatic
assumption&#151;I think that was the phrase&#151;that at some
point, because of the trends that he sees and the complexity and
international nature of plots, with lots of computer discs and so on,
which are all real points, he may run out of time. He does not want to
run out of time, which is understandable, given his responsibilities.
So, we say, rather than keep ratcheting up the number of days for
pre-charge detention, let us take on board the problems that Sir Ian
and others identify and find more proportionate alternatives, better
alternative policies, rather than, every time there is a difficult
case, every time there we are worried about the international and
complex nature of plots, adding another 10 or  14
days, until we end up with an outcome in terms of due
process in this country that is alien to our traditions, is an
international embarrassment, is counter-productive to fighting
terrorism and undermines the Government&#146;s own laudable prevent
strategy. Let us deal with the problems that Sir Ian presents in ways

						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								Shami
Chakrabarti:

						</i> No, Mr. Bailey, I do not. The
reason why we completely stand by the comment that, inevitably during
any period of pre-charge detention, whether it is three, 30 or 100
days, some innocents will be detained, is because that is how due
process works in a free society that is trying to deal with
criminality. The way our system works is that you arrest on reasonable
suspicion. You charge when you have evidence and a belief that you will
be able to convict, and you convict when you are certain beyond all
reasonable doubt.</div>
					<a name="0804251000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">So, inevitably
you arrest more people than you charge and you charge more people than
you convict, although the DPP has an astonishingly good record in not
over-charging, notwithstanding his changed threshold, because he has a
92 per cent. conviction rate, so good for him. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column104" />Column number: 104</div>But you are bound to arrest more people than you charge. You have to.
That is not wickedness or error on the part of the police. If I was a
policeman I would arrest more people than I charged, because you arrest
on suspicion. You have to, because you are trying to prevent terrorist
atrocities. That is how it works in a free
society.</div>
					<a name="0804251000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">As for judicial authorisation at
seven-day intervals, although that is a laudable attempt to try to
ensure that this is not used gratuitously and is not used all the time,
there is very little that a judge can really do to referee a process
that has not actually begun. Why we make such a fuss about this, by the
way, and why it is charge and not trial that we are talking
about&#151;pre-charge detention, not pre-trial detention, as
journalists sometimes report&#151;is that in our adversarial system
the moment of charge is the moment when you know what you are accused
of and you can start answering back. That is when the ball goes into
play and that is when the judge, as referee, can start doing his
job.</div>
					<a name="0804251000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">Prior to that,
well you can make me the judge, Mr. Bailey. I am hardly
going to be a hanging judge am I? What am I going to referee? There is
no accusation. There is no fight. Frankly, even Shami is going to keep
authorising the detention because I am terrified of what will happen if
I do not. The police will be saying, &#147;We suspect this person of
terrible things and we need more time to come up with more
evidence.&#148; That is the test in the Bill. There have to be
reasonable grounds to believe that more time is needed to
investigate  this person.</div>

charged are not met in this process. Would you not agree that, because
there are enhanced thresholds, presided over by people, certainly on
the basis of the evidence that we had from the DPP, who are not even

DPP&#146;s new threshold test for charging and asking me whether I am
not afraid that that could lead to injustice. My answer to that is that
charge is the moment where you put up or shut up. If the DPP says they
are now charging a bit more readily than previously, with anticipated
evidence to follow rather than having all the evidence in their hands,
does that cause me concern? Well, he has a 92 per cent. conviction

Mr. Bailey&#151;are not high enough. They cannot be. The
hoop that we need is charge. That is the hoop that we are all looking

to three 9/11s on one day. The argument is that there comes a time when
essentially there is an emergency in the land and, notwithstanding all
of those other brilliant ideas for operational policing that in our
view should apply day in, day out and year in, year out, the atrocity
would be such that the police and security services are for a time
literally overwhelmed.</div>
					<a name="0804251000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">Mr. McNulty used the
example of there being three 9/11s on one day, which is a pretty
catastrophic scenario. That scenario was put to us at Liberty last
summer, and we were asked what we had to say about it and how the
current law of the land would deal with such a scenario. All that we
did was point out that Parliament had already looked at emergency
powers legislation in the very recent past and had come up with
something called the Civil Contingencies Act 2004. As you can imagine,
we at Liberty talk about these things with a slightly heavy heart and a
slight chill, but we none the less engage in these debates. My
colleague Gareth worked very hard with all of you to try to ensure that
that chilling piece of emergency powers legislation had at least some
safeguards. Even in a nightmare scenario such as three 9/11s in one
day, in our democracy there must be some safeguards.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column106" />Column number: 106</div>
					<a name="0804251000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">That Act has three safeguards.
First and foremost, there has to be an emergency in the land. That is
not provided for in the current Bill, which will just relate to an
individual case in which more time is sought for investigative
purposes. Secondly, Parliament would have to vote on that issue and on
whether the regulations were necessary to meet an emergency. Parliament
can deal with that, because it would not be interfering in an
individual case, but discussing and debating the state of the
emergency. Finally, because what are made under the 2004 Act are
regulations, they are subject to judicial review. That is not our law;
that is the Government&#146;s Civil Contingencies Act of
2004.</div>
					<a name="0804251000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">Chilling though
it may be, and perhaps should be, as all emergency powers Acts feel in
a democracy, at least it has those three safeguards. The first and most
important of those safeguards&#151;that the powers are only for
genuine emergencies&#151;is completely lacking from what is being
painted as a reserve power in the Bill. In substance and in law, it is
triggerable in individual cases whenever a chief constable, the DPP and
the Home Secretary agree that more time could reasonably be necessary
to investigate an individual case. In our view, those positions are
chalk and
cheese.</div>

is used in an emergency and not an individual case. You asked whether
pre-charge detention amounts to criminal proceedings for the purposes
of the CCA. We think that criminal proceedings begin at the moment of
charge. If there is any doubt about that, there is no problem with
having a separate piece of legislation that is more specific than the
CCA and that deals only with emergency detention in a genuine
emergency. That would put the matter beyond doubt. I do not think that
anybody would have a problem with that. The substance is crucial. If

that can now be charged; the reduction in charging threshold; and
post-charge questioning with appropriate safeguards. Many of us would
have liked to see intercept as well. Could that package not achieve the
objective that we share, which is of early charge rather than detention
without
charge?</div>

						</i> Absolutely. That is what we believe. If
somebody says that there are still gaps, we will wholeheartedly look at
those gaps. We take this very seriously. We are not just sitting here
throwing stones at Government policy and at the concerns of the
Metropolitan police or others. We have been doing our very best to
engage with this, as I know parliamentarians on all sides of the House
have as well. We think that there is very strong package, some of which
was not present in 2005. That is important. Sometimes journalism will
deliberately present things in a certain way and all of sudden people
change their minds: Labour Members who voted for 90 days, but now do
not support 42 days. How can that possibly be justified? Well partly,
they have spoken in this House and justified their positions because
they have now seen the development of a range of alternatives that just
were not on offer back in the autumn of
2005.</div>

enable an earlier charge to be pressed, post-preferment of that charge

charge is alien to prosecutorial practice in this country and is
something that they rather preciously do not wish to engage

<div class="Column"><a name="Column112" />Column number: 112</div>am glad that you put it. We should agonise about this. I am not talking
about a holding charge. I am talking about a proper and serious
terrorist offence, which in its own right justifies remand in custody
and a very serious custodial term on conviction. This is not stealing
the bicycle. This is a serious terrorist offence in its own right. But
these precursor terrorist offences were taken by this House because
they are so grave. So if you end up being convicted of possessing
material for a terrorist purpose and nothing else, you are a very
serious criminal who is going to prison for a long
time.</div>

						</b> May I give one other example which is critical to
the Government&#146;s case? Very often they say that one of the
complexities is the difficulty of dealing with computer encryption and
finding the key. I am at a loss to understand why the legislation that
the House passed to require production of the key to encrypted material
has not been more often used. Sir Ian said on Tuesday that one of the
reasons was that because the tariff on it was so low, a court was
unlikely to hold someone on remand for refusing to produce the key to
suspected terrorist material. Have you any comments on
that?</div>

						</i> A more obvious reason why it has been so
infrequently used is that this legislation was passed in 2000 and has
remained inoperative. It has only very recently been brought into
force. If the law ain&#146;t there, you can&#146;t use it. Just to
supplement what Shami said, it is extremely unhelpful to talk of
holding charges. That is not the process you go through. You do not
charge somebody with an offence such as acts preparatory to terrorism,
with a view to bringing a charge at a later date. You charge him with
that offence because that is the appropriate charge to bring and it may
happen that there is further investigation at a future date<i class="I">. </i>To
look at it from the end of what the final charge may be is the
inappropriate way of looking at it. That is why you get very unhelpful

measures rather than ratcheting up the days of pre-charge detention and
said, with a heavy heart, that you had considered the Civil
Contingencies Act. I served on the Bill in 2003-04 and I seem to recall
being told that it was precisely not about terrorism and being
reassured on that point because we would be bringing forward proposals
later. Liberty&#146;s criticism  of the Act is that it is
without an appropriate consideration of proportionality and that it
allows sweeping draconian powers. Is not the real attraction of those
who put forward the Civil Contingencies Act that that lack of
proportionality would make it easier to go to judicial review and to
stop any extension beyond 28 days and the introduction of 58
days under the Act?</div>

								Shami

						</i> I must disagree. If
one looks at the definition of &#147;emergency&#148; in the Civil
Contingencies Act, terrorism is one of the grounds of emergency that is
expressly provided in that Act. I can only refer the Committee to the
definition of &#147;emergency&#148; in that Act. Terrorism is one
of the many potential triggers. I 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column113" />Column number: 113</div>am also delighted to say that, as a result of the work by many people
such as you, who tightened up that legislation between the first draft
and the final draft, proportionality is expressly built into the test
for making regulations under that Act. Do not get me wrong; I do not
want emergencies every day of the week. I am not Mr.
Rumsfeld, who wants a permanent state of emergency. This is chilling
stuff; emergency powers in democracies are chilling stuff. However,
necessity, proportionality and compatibility with human rights are all
now written into that Act.</div>

regulations? I am afraid, Sir, that that is just not my experience of
litigating in our courts. If you remember, even in the infamous or

that I do not think we have touched on, which is coroners&#146;

the need to have a jury in coroners&#146; inquests. The apparent
justification is that that is a necessity because intelligence material
or secret material might have to be placed before a coroner in such
circumstances. What is your opinion of that proposal and, in
particular, do you have a view about the difficulty of getting vetted

						</i> My feeling is that these are excessive
measures. Liberty&#146;s view is that there is, as in many other
parts of the legal system, a huge issue of public trust and confidence
in the inquest system. Allowing direct Executive input into the inquest
system, such as allowing a Government Minister directly to replace a
coroner or allowing a Government Minister to decide that juries shall
not be present at inquests, will have a massive impact upon public
confidence. I do not deny for a second that there may be national
security issues and other issues relating to the evidence that can be
heard, but the current system allows for public interest immunity, for
example, to allow for certain material not to go before the court or
for it to be dealt with in particular ways.</div>

					<a name="0804251000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was slightly

Often, when the Government are planning something, there will be quite
a long lead-up to it, but this was a case of the Government saying
