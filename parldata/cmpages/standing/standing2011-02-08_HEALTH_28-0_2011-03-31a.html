that I meant to explain this morning. There will be Divisions in the
House this afternoon, but, unlike in other circumstances, there will be
no extra time as a result. If hon. Members want to make points and
there are two Divisions, that will be half an hour out of the debating
time. I repeat what I said this morning. The debate finishes at 4
o’clock, so please bear that in mind. If you have important
points to make and want to get to them, we will have to work
together.<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000102">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
652 relates to subsection (2), which requires that health and social
care bodies comply with requests for information from the Information
Centre in a manner and time period specified by it. The primary role of
health and social care bodies must clearly be the provision of care to
patients, and the amendment seeks assurance that health care
professionals will be protected from unreasonable demands for
information that take them away from their clinical duties and expect
them to provide information within an unreasonable amount of time. This
short, sharp amendment is straight to the
point.<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000105">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I
think I can offer the reassurance that the hon. Lady is seeking. The
Information Centre is already under a general obligation to behave
reasonably when discharging its functions, as are all public bodies. In
addition, the Information Centre is required by clause 241 to consult
representatives of those bodies from whom information will be
collected. Clause 237 imposes a duty on the Information Centre to seek
to minimise the burdens that it poses on others. For those reasons, I
think that the issue of reasonableness is fully dealt with, and I hope
that the hon. Lady will be able to withdraw the
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000106">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> We discussed earlier what this provision means
and why there are powers to require and request information. It would
seem that the Information Centre can require health and social care
bodies to provide information, but it can only request that any other
person should provide such information. What would happen if there were
a health care body that was not an NHS body? Would the Information
Centre have the power to require an independent, private care provider
to provide information, or does it have power only over NHS
bodies?<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000113">&#160;</a>

NHS services. If it is providing such services, it is covered by the

                           </span> Further to the point raised by
my hon. Friend the Member for Islington South and Finsbury, I think
that the Minister has explained that, in essence, the provision refers
to any private body providing NHS services; I assume that that includes
any body providing services to a GP consortium. It would therefore be
designated a health or social care body—a public body—and
would be obliged to provide the information.<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000115">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">How does that
potentially conflict with the right that is enshrined—or at
least implied—elsewhere in the Bill that a commercial operation
may be able to withstand having to provide that information if it is
deemed to be against the commercial or other interests of that private
provider? Which duty is pre-eminent in that circumstance? Is there any
circumstance in which the Minister can imagine a company that provided
NHS services—it would therefore be obliged to provide
information to the Information Centre—successfully arguing that
to do so would be detrimental to their commercial interests? Would it
be allowed to withhold the
information?<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000116">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Finally,
if that danger exists, is there then a further, much larger danger?
When we have an NHS with many more providers, which is a clear
intention of the Bill, it might be more difficult for the NHS, as an
aggregate, corporate entity, to get detailed information that is
critical in judging whether it is performing well, and whether changes
in policy might be required. Is there a

                           </strong> I return to what I said to the hon. Member for
Islington South and Finsbury. The first point is that where a
provider—whether private, a charity or a public
body—provides publicly funded services, it will be covered by
this clause and the other clauses in this part of the Bill. The
scenario that the hon. Gentleman described is important to test, but I
can reassure him. As far as we were concerned when drafting the Bill,
the clauses, and the powers they give to the Information Centre and
other bodies, will enable us to ensure that there is consistency and
the ability to compare information in the way that the hon. Gentleman
fears we might not.<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000118">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In addition
to that, there is the contracting route, which would be available to
reinforce that further, but we are confident that, as drafted, the
clauses allow for those requirements to be placed on any provider
funded by the taxpayer to provide free NHS care. We drafted the Bill to
have that policy
effect.<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000119">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Also,
to ensure that we can fulfil those information questions, Government
amendments 683, 684 and 685, which I have just moved formally, clarify
that the Information Centre will have powers to collect information
from publicly funded private organisations providing health services or
adult social care under arrangements with public bodies. For example,
Monitor, as one of the bodies involved, could request information
through the Information Centre in that way. Part of the issue is about
having one organisation that is seen as the honest broker and the place
where data are held, within a framework that guarantees patient
confidentiality. That is the key guiding principle that we have
followed in framing the
provisions.<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000120">&#160;</a>

on reflection and having read <em>Hansard</em>, I feel that I have not
covered every point that the hon. Gentleman has raised, I will be sure
to write to

                           </strong> I am grateful for that answer. However, it still
seems to me that, as it relates to this discussion, clause 242
conflicts slightly with clause 243(1)(a), which essentially says that
the information might not be provided if the Information Centre deemed
it detrimental to the interests of the provider.<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000122">&#160;</a>

that my question stands. If a commercial company, albeit one normally
bound by the same rules in respect of providing services to the NHS,
does not want to provide the information because it is damaging to its
commercial interests—competition law will obviously apply here,
so there will be a slightly different set of parameters—could it
withhold that

it makes for an interesting debate. I will first deal with our
amendment and then I will discuss amendment 653. We have already
discussed the importance of confidentiality and privacy safeguards in
respect of information collected by the Information Centre. In
particular, we need to ensure that information published by the
Information Centre does not lead to individual patients being
identified. I would like to reiterate how important an issue that is;
we do not take it in any way
lightly.<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000132">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
686 clarifies that when the information collected by the Information
Centre is in a form described in the next subsection, the centre must
not publish the information. For example, the amendment makes it clear
that the Information Centre is prohibited from publishing information
that identifies patients or service users. Amendment 698 corrects an
inaccuracy in the definition of “provider” originally
proposed in this clause. The original definition did not capture all
those whose identities it may be in the public interest for the
Information Centre to publish. Amendment 698 provides a more
comprehensive definition of those whose identity might be
published.<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000133">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
692 removes the old definition and amendments 687 to 690 replace the
previous term with the new one. Amendment 691 ensures that when the
information collected by the Information Centre does not meet published
standards, the Information Centre must use its discretion as to whether
the public interest is sufficient to warrant publication. The
reliability of information is an important consideration for
professional statisticians, for the public purse and for those who need
to trust the information made available.<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000134">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I want to
make it clear, however, that the Information Centre may not disclose
information that identifies any individual patient or service user
without specific further statutory authority to do so. In addition, the
powers to direct or request the Information Centre to collect
information provided by clauses 238 and 239 do not themselves provide
such statutory
authority.<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000135">&#160;</a>

694 sets out the circumstances in which the Information Centre may pass
information to one or more bodies whether or not it was obliged to
publish that information. It replaces the existing provision, which is
removed by amendment 697. The Information Centre may disclose
information if it considers that it is in the public interest to do so,
when the reason why the information was not published was to protect
the identity of a body that provided care or because the information
did not meet relevant published standards.<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000136">&#160;</a>

makes it clear that the Information Centre does not have discretion
where it has been directed to publish such information. We recognise
that the Information Centre’s views may be important and should
be taken into account. Indeed, clause 245(4) requires the Secretary of
State or the NHS commissioning board to have regard to advice that the
Information Centre may give. However, we feel that ultimately the
Information Centre should not be authorised to disregard a lawful

                        <p class="tabbed">Clause 243 is
about the publication of information. It states that the Information
Centre must publish all information that it collects, but there are
some exceptions. Those are, first, when<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000144">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“the information

                        </p>
                        <p>which
makes sense, and secondly,
when<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000145">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“the

                        </p>
                        <p>The
third exception, however, is
when<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000146">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“the

                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">All
information will be published, therefore, apart from the information
that the Secretary of State would rather is not, and we wondered what
that was. Will the Minister give us an example of what that information
would be, particularly in light of the debate that we had on the
previous clause?<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000147">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Bupa, for
example, might say to the Minister, “We are happy to provide
services to the NHS, but we see no reason why we should be providing
all this information to the Information Centre. As far as we are
concerned, it should be confidential, because it will embarrass us
commercially otherwise.” The Secretary of State might say,
“Yes, we understand.” Would the Information Centre not
publish information in such circumstances?<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000148">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
Minister’s response was interesting. I wonder whether he has
thought it through and whether there has been real consultation with
private providers about the attitude of the Department on publishing
all the information on any services provided by the private sector to
the national health service. I am interested to know whether I am
right, and whether clause 243(1)(c) covers those
points.<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000149">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
Opposition amendment seeks to prevent the Secretary of State or
commissioning board from directing the Information Centre not to
publish information that it collects when that information would
otherwise have been published. I fully sympathise with the desire to
ensure that information is not withheld simply because the commissioner
of that information does not like what it says. It is for that reason
that a number of safeguards have been built into the Bill to ensure
that this further amendment is unnecessary.<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000151">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">For example,
the Information Centre may provide advice about the publication of
information under clause 245, and the Secretary of State and the
commissioning board are obliged to have regard to that. The Information
Centre is also under an obligation provided by clause 244 to maintain a
register that contains a description of the information that it has
collected, and I referred to that register in this morning’s
sitting. It would therefore be very obvious if an attempt were made to
suppress the publication of data collection.<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000152">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There will,
however, be rare occasions when it is entirely appropriate for the
Secretary of State to direct that information should be collected, but
not published. For example, there might be information about a serious
epidemic or a threat to public health. The release of such information
will occur, but that needs to be done carefully to prevent unnecessary
alarm.<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000153">&#160;</a>

clause will allow regulations to make provision for a scheme to
accredit organisations that act as information intermediaries.
Information intermediaries are expected to play a key part in making
better use of information to support service improvement and patient
choice. An accreditation scheme may be run by the Information Centre or
by any other body that is specified in regulations. The regulations
would enable the operating body to set the accreditation criteria, to
keep the scheme under review and to charge reasonable fees. The scheme
will essentially act as a kitemark, indicating that the products of an
accredited organisation are of a high quality and enabling those
seeking the services of an information intermediary to select one that
has demonstrated that it meets quality standards.<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000193">&#160;</a>

Centre can collect such information. The process would involve the
Information Centre checking the identity of GPs and issuing numbers
that are unique to individual GPs and used in prescribing services.

abolish the Alcohol Education and Research Council, and I want to ask

will know that in recent months the Government have been putting
together the responsibility deal. There are numerous areas in which
people are trying to influence what we eat and drink and everything
else, but the Government’s responsibility deal alcohol network
has not been able to agree the way forward, as I am sure that the
Minister is well aware. Six organisations in the network have refused
to sign up to what the Government are proposing: Alcohol Concern,
the British Association for the Study of the
Liver, the British Liver Trust, the British Medical Association, the
Institute of Alcohol Studies and the Royal College of Physicians, in
which I have registered an interest during our Committee

organisations have refused to sign up because they are not convinced

that we have ended up in such a situation with the responsibility deal,
but I would not want Members to think for one minute that I am not in
favour of its aims. If we look at what has happened with processed food
in the past eight years or more, there has been a massive reduction in
salt, for example, and that has happened due to co-operation among the
food industry itself, the Food Standards Agency and other

that I was going to make. I am particularly interested in the clause
because I know that the Alcohol Education and Research Council has had
a particular impact in Wales. It has conducted research into the impact
of alcohol misuse on young people and families, which led to the
formation of the strengthening families
programme—SFP10-14—which operated extremely successfully
in south Wales, particularly in the Cardiff area with the drug and
alcohol misuse board. Although the clause does not abolish the fund
that the council has hitherto administered, can the Minister offer any
reassurance that the funding will in no way be jeopardised by the
council’s change in status because, as my right hon. Friend
said, alcohol misuse is such an enormously important
issue?<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000238">&#160;</a>

comments that the right hon. Member for Rother Valley made about the
responsibility deal, and particularly about the way in which such
engagement with industry can result in greater and more rapid progress,
were welcome<em>.</em> That is the responsible way to approach the
responsibility deal, too. One of the misconceptions that has been
spread around is the belief that the deals are the only game in town
when it comes to public health policy. Some of the non-governmental
organisations with which we have engaged on the responsibility deal in
respect of alcohol have certainly had that misapprehension. They
thought that the responsibility deal was the only way in which issues
around alcohol harm could be pursued, but that is not
true.<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000241">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
the meetings that we have had with a variety of NGOs, including those
to which the right hon. Gentleman referred, the Under-Secretary of
State for Health, my hon. Friend the Member for Guildford (Anne
Milton), and I have made it very clear that the Government also intend
to produce a strategy for reduction in alcohol harm. The Government are
already moving on a number of fronts, particularly around price and the
use of tax policy to make more progress than has perhaps been made up
until now. However, the NGOs seemed to want to have a debate with
industry, with all the companies in the room, about setting prices and
tax policy. It is not possible to have industry in the room
collectively agreeing price issues because that breaches competition
law, so we were not prepared—or able—to have
conversations in that context.<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000242">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">That does not
mean that the Government do not want to make progress on those issues.
Indeed, the key thing is who sets policy. I am clear that it is the
Government who set policy, not industry and not NGOs. As long as we are
clear about that, we will listen to both sides and make judgments
appropriately. We have seen some marked movements already with the
responsibility deal on alcohol, not least from one supermarket that has
decided to withdraw all front-of-shop alcohol promotions. Another
alcohol purveyor has committed itself to reducing the alcohol content
of one of its leading brands. Those are useful nudges—to use a
much maligned phrase—to others to act in such a
way.<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000243">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Thank you Mr Hancock. As I was saying, I will
briefly relate the fascinating history of the Appointments Commission.
It was established in 2001, within the NHS, to appoint people to trusts
and other NHS bodies, but its role has expanded significantly over the
last couple of years. In 2003 it was expanded to include appointments
to all bodies in the health and social care sector. Then—this is
my real point—in 2006, its role was expanded further and its
name changed to the Appointments Commission, from its original title,
the NHS Appointments Commission. It became a body responsible for
providing recruitment and selection services to all Government
Departments. It is therefore no longer concerned solely with the NHS,
or just health and social care bodies; it is responsible for absolutely
everything—all Government Departments. To safeguard its original
role in the NHS, a special committee—the health and social care
appointments committee—was established internally to carry on
the NHS part of the
role.<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000265">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
have three questions. First, if the Government wanted
to change the procedures in the NHS and, as the clause
suggests, pass all the responsibility for recruiting and selecting for
all NHS bodies to the Secretary of 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 1251<a class="bkMark" name="Column1251">&#160;</a>
                           </div>State, why not simply abolish that committee within the Appointments
Commission?<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000266">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Secondly,
what will be the procedure in future for selecting, recruiting and
sourcing people for public bodies within the NHS? The responsibility
will pass to the Secretary of State. His responsibilities will be
dramatically reduced by the Bill, because he will no longer be directly
responsible for promoting universal health care—that will be the
responsibility of the NHS commissioning board quango—but I would
not have though he will have enough time to recruit and select people
for all the various GP consortia and other public health bodies. Is it
not likely that we will see Odgers or one of the other headhunting
firms, as opposed to a public body, selecting people with the relevant
expertise and experience? Is it not more likely that we will see more
private recruiting companies employed by the Secretary of State to
source, select and appoint these
individuals?<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000267">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Thirdly,
what process will apply in other Departments? The decision implemented
in the Bill will affect all other Departments. Every year, the
Appointments Commission selects more than 1,000 people to leading roles
in public bodies in this country. That is a lot of work for other
Ministers to undertake. Can the Minister point to where in other Bills
those other Ministers will be given the responsibility for taking on
the role that previously has been conducted by the Appointments
Commission?<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000268">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I do not think it is the Minister’s job to
explain what is going to happen in other Departments. His
responsibility to this Committee is to explain what is going to happen
in the Department of Health. I was a bit nervous for a minute there, Mr
Smith. You got very comfortable leaning on the back of your chair. I
thought that we were in for a very long
speech.<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000269">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Let me start by being very clear about where
responsibility sits once the Appointments Commission is abolished. Yes,
it rests with Ministers, but it rests within the context of a framework
of existing safeguards that apply to ministerial appointments in other
Government Departments. These appointments will be undertaken in
accordance with the code of practice issued by the Commissioner for
Public Appointments, who is not being abolished and will continue to be
subject to that office’s scrutiny. That will help to ensure that
the process remains open, transparent and that appointments are made,
as they always should be, on the basis of the merits of the
candidates.<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000270">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There
was a number of questions about how long the Appointments Commission
will continue to work. The Department and the commission are working
towards a planned abolition date of 31 March 2012, which leads on to a
question about what happens in the interim period between its abolition
and the abolition of primary care trusts in 2013. Where necessary
re-appointments, or in a more limited number of cases, extensions of
appointments, should be made for strategic health authority and PCT
chairs and non-executive directors up to the latest abolition date for
the body. Otherwise, either a vacancy will be carried, as long as the
board can function effectively and is quorate, or a temporary
appointment will be made in the context of the code that I just
described, which is overseen by the commissioner.<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000271">&#160;</a>

                        </div>
                        <p class="tabbed">The Department
has also amended legislation to allow the flexibility for primary care
trust non-executive directors to serve on more than one PCT board, in
part to reflect the current clustering. The hon. Member for Pontypridd
asked me about the Appointments Commission’s responsibility for
other Government Departments. It can make appointments elsewhere, but
the vast majority of the appointments it makes are to the NHS. One of
the other changes that we have already debated are the changes to the
governance arrangements for NHS trusts, with all of them moving to
foundation trust status, where they will be responsible for their own
appointments. The commission is not sustainable as a non-departmental
public body once those NHS appointments are removed from its remit, so
other Departments will appoint in the same way as I have described:
Ministers will appoint on the basis of merit and subject to the code of
practice.<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000272">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Does the Minister not accept that it is a
retrograde step to reverse the arrangement wherein an arm’s
length body administers appointments in the NHS and return to the
status quo ante where the Secretary of State does it? Is that not also
at odds with the Government’s stated aim to remove the Secretary
of State and reduce political interference in the
NHS?<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000273">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> No, no and no. To expand ever so slightly, the
number of appointments that would be made in future would be in the
tens, not the thousands and because of that and because they are
appointments to positions such as the chair of the Care Quality
Commission, or to Monitor, or to a limited number of other posts such
as on the NHS commissioning board, it will be appropriate for those
matters to be discharged by ministerial appointment in the context of
the code and the necessary supervision that is provided both to the
Department of Health and other Government
Departments.<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000274">&#160;</a>

obviously a disappointed and bitter person because I have never been on
a quango in my life or been a non-executive anything, but presumably
appointments will be made to acute trusts which are managed through the
appointments process. Is that not the case? Acute trusts will continue
to exist and there will presumably be plenty of them. I received an
advertisement today about my local acute trust that appeared to come
from the Appointments Commission. In the past, a disproportionate
number of the candidates who got such posts seemed to be of a favoured
political party, depending on who was the Secretary of State at the
time. Will the Minister assure me that there will be rigid monitoring,
so that when the Secretary of State has this power, appointments will
be made in a transparent way and no political bias can be
detected?<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000275">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Yes is the first and straightforward answer to
that question. Secondly, in future all acute trusts will be foundation
trusts and therefore responsible for their own governance arrangements.
There will be accountability and safeguards for that, which we debated
last week. Such decisions will not be made by the Secretary of State;
they will be made by the members and the governors of the foundation
trusts.<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000276">&#160;</a>

                        <p>Given
the numerous incidents in the lifetime of the NHS, collecting data and
identifying trends and patterns of avoidable incidents are important.
We need to be satisfied that patients are well looked after and that
the Government’s changes provide such confidence. I will not go
into specific patient safety incidents, but no doubt the hon. Member
for Stafford could spend a long time talking about that in the context
of the Mid Staffordshire trust and related
areas.<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000284">&#160;</a>

given a great priority throughout the health service, but mistakes are
made. Human beings make mistakes: there are mistakes in procedures,
mistakes in the provision of treatment and mistakes in the various
reporting systems of the various parts of the health service. We cannot
overestimate the importance of patient safety. The Royal College of

are real savings to be made, or whether it is the product of an
ideological drive to make changes. I do not want to muddy the waters,
but concerns have been raised about that generally. The Royal College
of Nursing is concerned that patient safety could be compromised by a
much reduced service resulting from the NPSA’s abolition. As I
have said, the Public Administration Committee has stated that the
Government’s approach to abolishing quangos does not necessarily
deliver all that they said it would. I would like to hear the
Government’s views on
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000290">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
patient safety division function will become part of the remit of the

understand from the impact assessment that that is supposed to happen
by September this year. The Minister may want to say some more about
that, because the timing and the scale of the change are clearly
important. Given that the new body would be a sub-committee of the
board, what assurances can the Minister give us on the priority and
focus that the NHS commissioning board will give it?<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000293">&#160;</a>

that the sub-committee will be given by the NHS commissioning board is
important, as is the make-up of the sub-committee. I suspect the
Minister will probably say that that is up to the national
commissioning board to decide, but I wonder whether in drawing up this
legislation the Minister has had discussions with the other Departments
or with the health service as a whole about the possible make-up of the
sub-committee. Although he could say that that is up to the NHS
commissioning board—he might not say that; I might be
pre-empting him—it is important that we know the level, calibre
and responsibilities of people who could be considered for that
sub-committee, in order to give us

note with interest paragraph E98 of the impact assessment, the second
sentence of which
states:<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000298">&#160;</a>

not the word used is “if”, the matter is discussed in the

known as an outpost—that might be some indication of how
important the regions will be. I am not sure where the terminology
comes from. Has the Minister had any more thoughts on whether having
regional offices would be a logical extension? I want to repeat the

                        <p>I accept that it is in
the impact assessment as a possibility, but it will be useful to hear
whether the Government are thinking along those lines. Is there more
information on the staff and how they are reacting? What safeguards
have been put in place? The paragraph also

important matters. We are not trying to score political points, but

about fragmentation. The whole reorganisation process will take a long

off the ball—that is in the impact assessment. It is important

                        <p class="tabbed">My first
point follows what the hon. Member for Halton said about the importance
of patient safety. Clearly, after the Mid Staffordshire experience,
patient safety is now taken extremely seriously throughout the
NHS—I am sure that it always was in most cases, but it is now at
the forefront of NHS services. There are two ways to regard the
abolition of the NPSA. Either it indicates that there is less emphasis
on patient safety; or—the alternative that I subscribe to and
the explanatory notes endorse—it embeds patient safety in the
heart of the NHS. In
fact:<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000309">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“The

                        </p>

welcome that.<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000310">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The hon. Gentleman makes an important point. Does
he accept that our concern is reasonable? I hear what he says about a
lot of emphasis being put on patient safety, and of course there is,
but the health service is about to go through the biggest
reorganisation in its history. There is a massive amount of work to do,
ranging from work on clinical care and commissioning to pricing,
accommodation and other reorganisation issues, so there could be a
danger that people will take their eye off the ball, because the
reorganisation will pull them so much in one direction. That is the
point I was trying to make.<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000311">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I thank the hon. Gentleman and I would underline
his point. I was about to say that it is vital that the ball is not
dropped in the transition between the NPSA and the embedding of patient
safety in the heart of the NHS and the national commissioning board.
Patient safety is of the utmost importance. I would like to hear the
Minister’s reaction to that and to get that on the
record.<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000312">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Secondly,
I ask the Minister to comment on the likely outcome of the Francis
inquiry. I am sure that there will be a lot on patient safety, and I

                        <p class="tabbed">My third
point concerns the national research ethics service. It may be a minor
part of the NPSA’s remit, but I see the risk of something
falling between the gaps when I read the explanatory notes. Research
ethics are key if we want to be at the forefront of medical research
internationally—indeed, we are at the fore at the moment, and we
must not fall behind. How will the Government ensure that there is no
hiatus between the present provision under the NPSA and that envisaged
in the Bill?<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000314">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> At the end of his speech the hon. Gentleman the
Member for Stafford asked a question I was going to ask. It is clear
that the clause abolishes the National Patient Safety Agency and moves
responsibility for the national reporting and learning service to the
NHS commissioning board, but it does not say what will happen to the
national research ethics service, which guarantees or attempts to
guarantee the safety and rights of patients involved in research and to
promote ethical research; nor is it clear what will happen to the
national clinical assessment service, a part of the NPSA which helps
practitioners and managers to prevent patient safety incidents from
happening.<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000315">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I have an
example of what the National Patient Safety Agency does from my own
experience of running the ambulance service network. The NPSA’s
work is very important, and I am concerned about its responsibilities
moving to the national board. We did a large piece of work with the
NPSA where it provided from the ambulance services all the reports of
patient incidents where there were real safety concerns. Those
incidents often happened during the handover period, when ambulances
turn up at hospital or people are leaving hospital. The NPSA gave its
initial findings to the network and we met with all our members from
the various ambulance services and talked about how to increase
reporting rates where appropriate—there were big variations
between different ambulance services which did not make sense. We
explored the data, saw what was happening, what the impact on patients
was and what was going wrong. We held a big event where people could,
in a safe environment, say what had really happened and why they
thought things had gone wrong. We learned from best practice and from
what other people were doing to try to reduce those safety
concerns.<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000316">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">That is one
small area of patient safety, yet a very important one that had not
been looked at before. My worry is that the national commissioning
board has so much else on its plate that it will not be able to do that
kind of work in detail across a range of different areas. With the big
reorganisation that the Government want, I do not think that that sort
of work will be at the top of the national commissioning board’s
agenda.<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000317">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It is right
that safety is integral to the work of commissioners. However, we know
staff have been worried in the past about reporting patient safety
incidents, basically in case they got into trouble. Now they are being
asked to report incidents not to an independent agency, but to the very
board that is responsible for driving the commissioning of their
services. Are they likely to say, “We have had some safety
problems” to the people who will commission their service? They
will not, because they will think, “The board might not
commission us if they think we have problems with patient
safety.”<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000318">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I have a
practical concern: will the board be able to do what is required of it,
with everything else that it has on its plate? I am also worried about
a point of principle. Is it likely that services will report such
incidents to the body that determines whether their services are
commissioned in future? That is why I am concerned that the clause and
the abolition of the NPSA have not been thought
through.<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000319">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> In that case, I will not repeat concerns that my
hon. Friend has just raised, but I will add one further, important
illustration. The National Patient Safety Agency is responsible for
both funding and monitoring the national confidential inquiries. Three
are undertaken every year; they examine patient outcome and death,
maternal and child health care, and suicide and homicide.
NCEPOD—the national confidential enquiry into patient outcome
and death—is particularly important to the NHS. It is one of the
key investigative tools that the NHS has to provide it with meaningful
scrutiny of outcomes—the most important outcome, which is
whether patients die as a result of NHS
treatment.<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000321">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">By
way of further illustration, the most recent NCEPOD report, which was
about deaths of patients within 30 days of cancer treatment, has been
hugely influential in shaping the latest iteration of the national
cancer strategy. I cannot imagine that NCEPOD is being abolished, so
will its funding and monitoring pass to the national commissioning
board? Is the Minister confident that among the commissioning
board’s many other priorities, many of which will be
administrative, it will have the requisite time and expertise to
conduct that work? Is there not a danger that some of the expertise of
the NPSA will be lost?<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000322">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">My second
point, as ever, relates to Wales. The NPSA is a prime example of a body
that touches Wales and England. Its remit covers both countries, and in
passing its responsibility wholly to the national commissioning board,
there is, as far as I can see, no provision in the Bill for what will
happen in Wales henceforth. Which body will be responsible for the
activities undertaken hitherto by NPSA? If I am wrong, and the Minister
can point me to the place in the Bill where it says what will happen in
Wales, I shall be grateful.<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000323">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">My third and
final point relates to the national clinical assessment service. The
explanatory notes state that it will move to being self-funding, which
raises a question in my mind, related to the one I asked on Tuesday
about the abolition of the Office of the Health Professions
Adjudicator. My concern is that that will lead to less independent
scrutiny of clinicians’ fitness to practice. What reassurance
can the Minister give that, in becoming somehow self-funding, the
important work that the NPSA undertakes in that respect will not become
less rigorous? In other words, will people not want to use the service
if they have to pay for it in future, which seems an obvious risk?
Ditto—will that apply to Wales and England, or will Wales have
to fund the service itself in future?<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000324">&#160;</a>

opening remarks of the hon. Member for Halton, we returned to a debate
on which we spent some happy hours at the beginning of the Committee:
whether the NHS commissioning board would have a local or regional
presence. As I tried to intimate to the hon. Gentleman, the impact
assessment is drafted to indicate that that is an if and remains so.
All I would say is that we have indicated that we expect, not least
because the NHS commissioning board will have membership of the local
health and well-being boards, that it will have some form of local
presence. We expect the NHS commissioning board to have the
responsibility for defining precisely how that is delivered.<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000326">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The hon.
Member for Halton made a point about the RCN and its view about the
important role that is currently discharged by the National Patient
Safety Agency. There is no difference between either side of the
Committee on the importance that the Government attach to patient
safety. We see that as a key priority for all those working in the
health service. We cannot allow patient safety to be an add-on, or an
afterthought. For that reason, the Bill puts safety at the heart of the
NHS and not at arm’s length, which is how it is currently
arranged.<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000327">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Currently,
the NPSA’s core function is to improve the safety of the NHS by
promoting a culture of reporting and learning from adverse events. It
does that primarily through the patient safety division, which runs the
national reporting and learning systems. Functions of the organisation,
while necessary in the system to support wider quality and safety
improvement, do not of themselves need to be reformed at arm’s
length from the Department. Safety is a key domain of quality and will
therefore be a central priority for the commissioning board. Patients
rightly expect that any service provider within the NHS, and funded by
the NHS, should be safe.<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000328">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The hon.
Gentleman’s suggestion that somehow this is an example of
fragmentation, is really nonsense. Clause 19 inserts new section 13M in
the National Health Service Act 2006 to make provision to give the NHS
commissioning board responsibility for the functions currently carried
out by the NPSA: the collection of information about patient safety
incidents, the analysis of that information, and the sharing of the
resulting learning with all providers of NHS services—those who
contract with commissioning consortia, or directly with the NHS
commissioning board. There is a notion that having those functions in a
nominally arm’s length body somehow makes them more effective
than bringing them right into the core of commissioning activity and
leadership within the system, which we think is a far more powerful way
of driving a safety agenda through the NHS.<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000329">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Let me
address the question from the hon. Member for Halton about what will
happen to the NPSA. We now know of the power the national reporting and
learning system has for driving improvements in the safety of services;
the NPSA’s national reporting and learning system is the most
comprehensive system of its kind in the world, and we will preserve and
improve on it. There is no intention for that system to be jettisoned
as part of the transition.<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000330">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The hon.
Gentleman also asked about staff at the NPSA. The NPSA is working with
its board and the Department of Health to ensure that a robust
transition plan is in place to help protect staff. The NPSA has offered
various forms of support to its staff, and, in December, embarked on a
consultation with staff on the detail of proposals for staff. Indeed,
the hon. Gentleman referred to paragraph E104 of the impact assessment.
If we read on, it

                        <p class="tabbed">I was asked
when the functions will be transferred. The NHS commissioning board is
unlikely to take on NPSA functions until early 2012. Abolition of the
NPSA is expected to take place on 31 March 2012. Therefore, the
suggestion that it will take place in September 2011 is no longer the

                           </strong> The thinking was that it was a task that would
need to be dealt with at an early stage in the preparations of the NHS
commissioning board. We have now taken the view that to maintain
continuity in service and to work through the issues of staff transfer,
it makes more sense to work on the basis of 31 March 2012 as the point
at which the National Patient Safety Agency is

was asked some questions about the National Clinical Assessment
Service, the patient safety division, the National Research Ethics
Service and the national clinical audit and patient outcomes programme.
The patient safety division, which both reports on and learns from
serious patient instances, should move to the NHS commissioning board
as a patient safety sub-committee of that board, covering the whole
function from getting evidence to working up evidence-based services.
That will provide an opportunity to preserve the synergy between the
learning and operational practice that already exist in the system. We
are engaging with the National Patient Safety Agency to discuss the
transitional arrangements for the patient safety division.<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000339">&#160;</a>

the questions about the National Clinical Assessment Service that were
asked by the hon. Member for Leicester West and my hon. Friend the
Member for Stafford, I have to say that the service is widely valued by
doctors, dentists and pharmacists. However, there is an expectation
that revalidation of the medical profession and other incentives in the
system will reduce the need for such a service in the future. The
National Clinical Assessment Service will become self-funded, and the
Department intends to agree a date with the service for achieving that
self-sufficiency.<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000340">&#160;</a>

made to the National Research Ethics Service, which helps to protect

authorises research ethics committees that approve individual research

hon. Member for Pontypridd asked about the National Patient Safety
Agency’s work in respect of clinical audits and so on.
Currently, there are three confidential inquiries to provide learning
about what went wrong in adverse health care incidents. In future, the
inquiries would sit with the national clinical audit and patient
outcomes programme, which consists of 30 individual national
clinical audits managed on behalf of the Department by the Healthcare

developing outcome measures for patient safety so that everyone can see
how the NHS is performing and organisations can be held to account by

                           </strong> The Minister said at one point that if someone is a
whistleblower, it is at least probable that they will want to refer to
a commissioning body rather than to an arm’s-length
organisation. There is no either/or in this. I was slightly concerned
by what he said. I am well aware of a specialist commission in which
there are serious accusations of incompetence on the part of surgeons.
I am also aware of allegations that these whistleblowers have been
treated extraordinarily badly within the organisation.<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000345">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It is
obviously very important that a whistleblower with an honest concern
should find it easy to blow the whistle when appropriate. The
whistleblower can do one of two things. First, they can blow the
whistle and get in trouble with their own provider, which is a tough
choice to make, especially if they are not guaranteed anonymity or
protection. I can cite a number of whistleblowers who have been offered
anonymity but that anonymity has been betrayed by the
provider.<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000346">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Secondly,
given the scenario laid out in the Bill, the whistleblower can report
to an organisation that directly commissions the particular service. I
am not certain whether that will make a whistleblower more or less
confident to do the important job of whistleblowing. The Government
have made appreciable progress and their rhetoric gives the impression
that they genuinely wish to make it easier for whistleblowers to report
errors.<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000347">&#160;</a>

may be asking for too much, but I wonder whether there is sufficient
evidence to suggest that people are more comfortable going to a body
that provides the wherewithal—the funding or the cash—for
their organisation, even if it is one of its sub-committees, or going
to a completely independent body. The hon.

                           </strong> I welcome some of the things that the
Minister said, but we still have serious concerns. The fact that the
Government got the date wrong—the change was intended to happen
by September 2011—is a serious concern, as we are talking about
national patient safety. It is worth repeating, so that we can
understand this, that the Government
stated:<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000350">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

work of the PSD relating to reporting and learning from serious patient
safety incidents will move to the NHS Commissioning Board as a Patient
Safety sub-committee of the Board. This is intended to happen by

                        </p>
                        <p>We
have now heard that that will not happen until September 2012, and I
would not put money on even that being the date. If they can get that
wrong in their impact assessment, that is a serious issue that raises
more concerns about their going apace with the whole
process.<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000351">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We
are told that that is what the Bill is all about, but we have to
examine the fragmentation caused by the Bill, the pressure brought
about by both the reorganisation and the monetary constraints on
people, and the speed at which the Government are trying to take the
changes forward. That is why we have had this debate. We have found out
only one nugget of information on one or two other interesting issues.
I am interested to hear what the Minister has to say on the points that
have been made, as we have serious concerns. Unless he can convince us
otherwise, we will vote against the
clause.<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000352">&#160;</a>

colleagues in Wales to ensure that both the transition and future
arrangements are adequately

the right to protection in law, but a fundamental professional duty to
raise with their employer any concerns they may have about the quality

                           </div>when they do so. The Government have made it clear to NHS organisations
that they should have policies and procedures in place to support and
encourage staff to raise legitimate concerns, which should be acted on.
We want to see a culture in the NHS in which whistleblowers can come
forward and raise legitimate concerns without fear of repercussions or
reprisals.<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000356">&#160;</a>

course, we are not changing the system that people can use to report
such concerns; we are merely moving the function back into the heart of
the NHS, where it properly belongs. How people access that function and
make their reports is not changing. In that sense, people should have
no doubt about how they discharge their responsibilities to patients.
If my hon. Friend the Member for Southport writes to me about the
details of that case, I will be only too happy to follow those matters
up with him subsequent to our deliberations.<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000357">&#160;</a>

we would be condemned for having rushed it, having far too much detail
and prejudging things. However, when we do not have a level of detail
and we come to an initial interim timetable, we are condemned for not
having enough detail. The Department of Health has received an early
business plan from the

                           </strong> No, I will not give way until I have finished
this point, if the hon. Gentleman will forgive me. The Department of
Health has received an early business plan from the NPSA. The proposed
transition will be in September 2011. When tested, it was clear that
more time was required for the NHS commissioning board to determine how
to deliver these functions. Early 2012 was a more appropriate date. In
other words, we are ensuring continuity of service during transition.
That is the right and proper thing to do with the reorganisation that
we are going through.<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000362">&#160;</a>

Gentleman’s suggestion about pace, all I would say is this. We
published the White Paper last July and consulted extensively. There
were 6,000 responses. We had a Command Paper in December and the Bill
was published this year. That is not rapid. The hon. Gentleman may want
to paint that picture, but it is not a true characterisation at
all.<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000363">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> This clause is important. The explanatory notes
state that the organisation mentioned in the clause title supports the
NHS in analysing its current practices against best practice and
implementing changes to achieve better results. What we have been
talking about in terms of improving quality is paramount to improving
patient safety, about which we have had a long discussion. Obviously, a
body that plays an important role in analysing current NHS practices
against best practice and bringing about changes to achieve better
results is very important. It will be interesting to hear what the
Minister has to say about the rationale for the
measure.<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000397">&#160;</a>

alternative possibility is that the functions remain provided by, and

the leadership for commissioning improvement services directly to the
Commissioning Board. It is possible there might be indirect costs from
staff due to underperformance from changes. However, it is believed the
changes will be small and negligible in cost terms.”<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000796">&#160;</a>

the concern of the Opposition about the impact of the changes in the

the Committee has already seen, the Bill provides for the NHS
commissioning board to have the functions of the NHS Institute for
Innovation and Improvement that will support the board in promoting
innovation and leading quality improvement. Clause 19 places a duty on
the NHS commissioning board to promote innovation when exercising its
functions. We also had a recent debate on the role of NICE in promoting
innovation. Innovation could be achieved, for example, through the NHS
commissioning board’s developing guidance for commissioning
consortia, hosting some clinical commissioning networks, where
appropriate, and working to encourage a culture of innovation within
commissioning
organisations.<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000402">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Clause
19 also provides for the NHS commissioning board to make payments as
prizes in order to promote innovation in the provision of health
services. Promoting innovation in this way will support the delivery of
quality and productivity improvements across the NHS to help transform
health care for patients and the public. With the board’s
responsibilities around innovation, the arm’s-length body is no
longer necessary and that is why clause 262 provides for its abolition.
The issue is about ensuring that patient safety and innovation are not
subcontracted or at arm’s length, but rather that they are at
the heart of what the NHS is
about.<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000403">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> This group of amendments takes us back to a
theme that arose earlier today—it is important that information
should be shared, but that should be within the strict confines of
existing law. We want specific reassurance about that. Clause 264
requires Monitor to share information with the Care Quality Commission.
Clause 265 requires the Care Quality Commission to share information
with Monitor. Clause 264 also obliges Monitor to co-operate
with the Care Quality Commission in a more general
sense.<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000410">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
is difficult to envisage any circumstances that would require the
economic regulator, Monitor, to use patient information to carry out
its functions. Therefore we assume that this does not refer to medical
records. Would the Minister consider making that clear in the Bill?
Amendment 728 makes the same point. Clause 266 sets out which bodies
would be subject to a duty to co-operate with another. Although
information sharing is not specified in the Bill, the explanatory notes
indicate that this duty could take the form of bodies requesting
information from provider organisations. The bodies concerned are the
commissioning board, Monitor, the CQC, NICE, the Information Centre and
strategic health authorities. That potentially enables very wide
information-sharing powers without reference to confidentiality or
information governance
controls.<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000411">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Once
again, it is a matter of looking at the Bill, seeing that it seems very
permissive and being rightly concerned about whether the necessary
controls are in place. We all know that confidentiality plays an
essential role in the relationship between health professionals and
their patients. The requirement for confidentiality allows patients to
divulge sensitive information to their doctor without worrying that it
will be disclosed to others without their consent. If there was any
doubt about that, patients might think twice about divulging such
information. So could the Minister provide some reassurance that
patient confidentiality will be preserved when all these bodies are
under a duty to co-operate with one
another?<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000412">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I know that the Committee wants to make progress so

                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
primary purpose of the information provisions of clauses 264 and 265 is
to ensure that the Care Quality Commission and Monitor work together to
operate an effective joint licensing and registration regime in a
streamlined way. This regime would present a single, integrated process
and interface for providers.<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000414">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
provisions ensure that both bodies assist each other in the exercise of
their functions, by sharing information. For example, given that a
provider has to 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 1267<a class="bkMark" name="Column1267">&#160;</a>
                           </div>be registered with the CQC to fulfil the requirements for holding a
licence issued by Monitor, there would be a need for the commission to
share information relating to a provider’s registration status
with Monitor. That is important in preventing the two regulators from
requesting the same information separately, which will reduce demands
placed on health care providers
themselves.<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000415">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">These
duties are absolutely not designed to enable either body to override
current checks on the sharing of confidential information.
In particular, patient confidentiality is an important principle and is
something that everyone entrusted with sensitive information about
patients and service users should recognise. Under the Health and
Social Care Act 2008, the CQC is prevented from disclosing confidential
personal information except in particular circumstances set out in
legislation. For example, disclosure is permitted when the information
is necessary to protect the welfare of any individual or for the
purpose of criminal proceedings. The Bill does not alter
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000416">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
addition, the 2008 Act places the CQC under a statutory duty to publish
a code of practice in relation to how it will obtain, use, handle and
disclose confidential personal information. The Commission is required
to consult with interested parties, such as user and advisory groups,
before publishing the code. That remains
unchanged.<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000417">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
the economic regulator, Monitor will not need to collect or make use of
attributable personal information. Consequently, Monitor should not
require any such information from the CQC in order to carry out its
functions, nor should it have any such information to share. Monitor
might collect information only in relation to individual cases, such as
the costs of particular care, if it is necessary, for example, to carry
out economic analysis or to investigate anti-competitive behaviour. In
such cases, the information collected will again be
non-attributable.<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000418">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
carrying out its competition functions, Monitor will also be bound by
the restrictions on disclosure of information in part 9 of the
Enterprise Act 2002. These restrictions would prohibit the disclosure
of information—relating to the affairs of an individual or any
business of an undertaking—that was obtained by Monitor when
exercising functions under the Competition Act 1998, or in relation to
market investigation references, except as expressly
permitted.<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000419">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">All
the bodies bound by the new duties of co-operation in clauses 264, 265
and 266 will continue to be subject to existing rules protecting
confidential information. In particular, they will all be subject to
the Data Protection Act 1998. The new duties in these clauses do not
allow them to share information outside those legal
constraints.<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000420">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Lady also wanted specific reassurance on whether Monitor might
need to see patient records. There is no reason for Monitor to need or
see patient records. I hope that that helps her. Monitor may require
only information necessary for the exercise of its functions, and
patient records would not be necessary for that purpose. For those
reasons I hope that the hon. Lady will withdraw the
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000421">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">In
looking at the clause, and in particular at Monitor’s duty to
co-operate with the Care Quality Commission, I wish to hark back to and
tie it into the debate that we had on clause 53, on the power to give
Monitor functions relating to adult social care services. Essentially,
clause 53 sets up the architecture to allow regulation that will, in
the future, allow Monitor potentially to set up designated services in
adult social
care.<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000433">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">How
would that impact on the relationship that Monitor will have with the
Care Quality Commission, given the CQC’s particular role in
relation to social care? They are supposed to co-operate, yet Monitor
may enter the field by making decisions as to which organisations will
be designated. Since our debates on clause 53, there have been further
developments in relation to the chain of old people’s homes
known as Southern Cross. They continue to remind us of the importance
of this procedural issue, of the vulnerability of many important
services and of the potential need for Monitor to designate a large
number of them, particularly given the cold wind that is blowing
through social care at the moment; it will continue blowing for the
next few years.<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000434">&#160;</a>

few weeks ago saying that before taking account of efficiency savings
the gap would be only £1 billion by 2014, and that
once efficiency savings were taken into account there will be no gap.

brief but important debate on clause 264. I shall be brief
because we got to the nub of the issue when we discussed the
amendments. I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Stafford for his
brief contribution and his support for the clause. He was right in his
analysis. Given his experience as a constituency MP in Stafford, what
he said was relevant. The right hon. Member for Rother Valley asked for
an example. I am more than happy to give one. The information could,
for example, disclose suspicion of poor quality.<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000445">&#160;</a>

Member for Islington South and Finsbury mentioned social care. In
debates on an earlier clause it was made clear that Monitor’s
role will not apply to social care until regulations are made. There
will be full consultation before that. If Monitor is given functions in
relation to adult social care—before anyone gets hold of the
wrong end of the stick, that sentence began with
“if”—we would expect it to co-operate fully with
the CQC on concerns that might arise in relation to the
provision of such care. For those reasons, I ask that the clause stand
part of the Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000446">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I want briefly to say something about the clause
and ask the Minister some questions. The clause relates to an important
and controversial issue, which is the use of supervised community
treatment orders for people with mental health problems.<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000476">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

                        </div>
                        <p class="tabbed">Members may be
aware that supervised community treatment orders were introduced in an
attempt to stop the revolving door, whereby patients with mental health
problems who are released from hospital and back into the community but
do not take their medication may end up being a risk to themselves and,
on some rare but significant occasions, becoming a danger to others as
well. One of the features of such orders is that within 28
days, a patient has to automatically have an interview with a doctor,
who gives a second opinion—the second opinion appointed doctors.
In England, they are appointed by the Care Quality Commission and in
Wales, they are appointed by the Healthcare Inspectorate on behalf of
Welsh Ministers.<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000477">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">A large
number of community treatment orders have been used. In answer to a
recent parliamentary question, the Minister said that there are now
more than 7,000 supervised community treatment orders. That is a lot
more than the previous Government initially
predicted.<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000478">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There
is huge concern among patient groups, psychiatrists, mental health
campaigners and others about the shortage of second opinion doctors.
That shortage may mean delays in treatment, because patients are not
supposed to receive such treatment unless they have had a second
opinion. As I have said, this is a controversial area. Many mental
health charities are concerned that patients will be forced to receive
treatment. Others are concerned that although the provision is meant to
help patients—requiring them to take their medicine—there
will be the whole revolving door issue. Under the clause, if a patient
consents to having treatment in the community, a second opinion is not
needed. I think the clause also clarifies that if at any stage the
patient changes their mind and decides to withdraw their consent, they
cannot be forced to receive the
treatment.<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000479">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
is a complicated clause. I think it seeks to strike the difficult
balance between ensuring that patients take the medicine they need
without infringing their rights and clarifying that patients can
receive that treatment without having a second opinion, while at the
same time allowing them to change their mind. As Members can tell from
my speech, it is a difficult
issue.<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000480">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Royal College of Psychiatrists has welcomed the clause, which is a good
thing. It believes that the clause strengthens safeguards and frees up
the time of second opinion doctors, which should enable the Care
Quality Commission to provide second opinion doctors with enough time
for the patients who lack capacity to give
consent.<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000481">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Has
the Minister made an assessment of the shortage of second opinion
appointed doctors? Does he think that amending the Bill would reduce
the number of supervised community treatment orders? My concern is that
the initial clinician may still determine that a patient requires a
supervised community treatment order if they think there will be a
serious consequence. That is where the difficulty lies, so could the
Minister tell the Committee whether that definition has been
established? Is he in discussion with the profession about
it?<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000482">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am grateful to the hon. Lady for raising this
important issue, because I know that many patient groups representing
people with mental health concerns are concerned about it. The issue
was aired during the passage of the provisions that gave rise to 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 1273<a class="bkMark" name="Column1273">&#160;</a>
                           </div>community treatment orders in the first place. She is right; the figures
published so far are higher than the original estimates made by the
Department at the time of the impact assessment produced for the Bill
that introduced
them.<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000483">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
advice that Ministers have received until now has been very clear, and
we have come to the view that we are still in the very early days of
the introduction of CTOs. For that reason it would be premature to
think that we should change them. We believe that the clause, which is
born of our discussions with people in the sector, is welcomed by
others, as the hon. Lady
said.<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000484">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
clause amends the rules in the Mental Health Act 1983 on the treatment
of patients receiving supervised community treatment. Members will
recall that they were introduced by the previous Government. The main
effect of the change will be that approval by a second opinion
appointed doctor will not generally be necessary if a patient consents
to the treatment in question. Instead, the approved clinician in charge
of the treatment would be able to issue a certificate, prescribed in
regulations, stating that the patient has capacity and is consenting.
The change would not apply to, for example, electro-convulsive therapy
patients under 18, for whom a second opinion appointed doctor
certificate would still be
required.<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000485">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Clause
273 brings the rules on approval of treatment for patients on
supervised community treatment more into line with those for detained
patients. That will reduce the pressure on the CQC in respect of second
opinion doctors, to which the hon. Lady referred. None of this will
change the rule that patients on supervised community treatment with
capacity to consent cannot be treated against their will unless they
are recalled to
hospital.<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000486">&#160;</a>

                        </h4>
                        <p class="tabbed">Why
has the use of supervised community treatment orders been greater than
predicted? Our conclusion at this stage is that we need more data
before we can take a final view on whether a real and significant
change in practice is going
on.<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000487">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
second opinion appointed doctor system obviously provides an important
safeguard for patients. The hon. Lady asked about assessment. These
issues are kept under close review because of the clear public interest
in ensuring that anything that has an impact on a patient’s
freedom is closely monitored. The clause allows a
resource—second opinion doctors—to be used in a more
targeted way. Appropriate safeguards are provided for the patient
interest.<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000488">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">For
those reasons, I hope that the clause will stand part of the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000489">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am grateful to the Minister for his response.
It is good to hear him make it clear that it is too early to consider
making changes or to say whether the measures are working. As I said,
this is a controversial issue, and although it is right that second
opinion doctors focus on patients who really need them, I was concerned
that that would remove safeguards from other patients. At this stage,
the provision probably strikes the right balance, but will the
Department or anyone else do research on the issue? Is there a
timetable for assessing how the measures are working? We want to
protect patients and the public, but also to retain people’s
freedom. Is there a timetable?<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000490">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> We have not had much discussion of NHS property,
which is a significant area to which we should give some time. The
top-down reorganisation will probably have the single biggest impact on
property owned by the NHS, which of course can range from the
Department to strategic health authorities and primary care trusts.
Perhaps the Minister will correct me, but I think that it is
potentially the largest single change in NHS history. The clause
relates to transfer schemes. Given the scale of change, an awful lot of
transferring will be going on. That is the implication of the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000501">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
have a number of questions and comments. Will the Minister set out who
in the Department of Health will be responsible for ensuring that the
transfer scheme happens, works and is managed? We are talking about
billions of pounds’ worth of property owned by the taxpayer. I
will come to that issue during debate on amendments to the next clause.
Will the chief executive of the NHS be responsible? How much influence
and impact will he have on what happens in terms of the transfer of NHS
property?<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000502">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We have made
this point continuously, although I know that the Minister has a
different point of view. We believe that massive costs will be incurred
as a result of the reorganisation, although there are differences of
opinion about how much. Part of that cost must be due to transfer of
properties. I will come to some of the specifics.<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000503">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It would be
useful to know whether the Department has worked out how much staffing
resource it expects to be taken up in the Department, strategic health
authorities and primary care trusts. It is an extensive exercise; as I
have said, it is probably the largest single change in property in NHS
history. Will the Minister also tell us what the size of the estate is?
How many buildings and premises are we talking about? It would be
useful for the Committee to have some idea of the scale, as it is
absolutely relevant to our arguments about the size of the

                        <p class="tabbed">It is also
important to know what value is currently placed on the NHS estate, and
how much of it will change hands. I assume that some business
assessment or analysis must have been done. I have heard, for instance,
that the primary care trust estate is estimated at about £36
billion. That is a massive amount of money to be affected by the Bill.
It would be useful to have some
idea.<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000505">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
believe strongly that this is just another element of the upheaval that
the Government are inflicting on the national health service, as well
as all the clinical procedures affected by the Bill: commissioning
consortia, GP surgeries, hospitals and other NHS services. It is a
massive upheaval, and many staff must be affected. It is important that
we understand that. We have made the point that people are taking their
eye off the ball of the real purpose of the NHS by spending so much
time on
this.<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000506">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
much-maligned managers whom the Government like to attack have an
exceptionally important role in property management and maintenance,
and will be involved. A lot of them are leaving because of the changes,
and the forthcoming PCT clusters will have an impact on staffing. The
measures will be an important part of that. They will also have an
impact on patients. It matters where and how commissioning and service
provision are delivered, how they are delivered and whether they are
disrupted during the various stages of proposed changes to the health
service that the Government want to make.<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000507">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Clause 274(2)
refers to liabilities. Does the Minister have any idea what those
liabilities might be or add up to? I assume that that will be an
important consideration in how the process is managed and what costs it
might leave the taxpayer if there is a transfer to a private provider
in future. Liability is important to discuss.<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000508">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Who will deal
with the legal work? Will it be subcontracted outside the Department,
the strategic health authorities or the primary care trusts? Those of
us who have bought or moved houses know that the legal process is an
important part of that. Selling property for commercial or public use
must involve a significant amount of legal work. I know from my PCT
that it has sometimes had to seek legal advice on issues that I have
raised with it, so I am not sure whether the expertise exists in those
organisations in the quantity needed to manage the process. We need to
know whether a lot of money will be spent buying in legal advice from
outside, because it is important.<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000509">&#160;</a>

                        <p>Leases are another
important part of any transaction relating to the future of property,
so it would be useful to know whether there have been any discussions
in the Department about the length of time for which leases should be

transferred over as a result of lease and legal
complications.<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000513">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I might have
missed the reason for this—I apologise in advance if that is the
case—but I want to double check what subsection (9) means by the
term “local authority.” I am not sure whether that
includes unitary and metropolitan councils as well. Unless I have
misread it, the list does not seem to include those. It would be useful
if the Minister could say if that is the
case.<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000514">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
the Government have said, significant changes are included in the Bill.
However, they have already started making changes in terms of the
clustering of PCTs, which I have mentioned. They are also doing various
other things before the Bill has been agreed. Has any work begun on the
clustering of the PCTs, as I understand that they are to be in place by
June? Another important issue is that of private finance initiative and
LIFTCo property, including a number of NHS buildings—for
example, my PCT and one of my local hospitals. Will the Minister say
how the transfer of properties will work in the case of PFI
buildings—hospitals and whatever—and LIFTCo? My PCT is
part of such a scheme. That is very important because it will have
implications for the health
service.<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000515">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
would be useful if the Minister could say what the Government intend to
do with the part of LIFTCo that the NHS owns during the transfer
process. Do they intend to sell it off? Will the Minister also mention
private sector joint ventures? I have read around on the internet and
some people are talking about private sector joint ventures being set
up for future property dealings as a result of the Bill’s
changes. Will the Minister tell us what discussions he, his colleagues,
the Secretary of State or his departmental officials have had with
private companies about the NHS estate? What discussions has he had
about how NHS property or the NHS estate will be managed as a result of
the changes in the Bill and the transfer procedures set out in the
clause? There is a definition of who has responsibility to see the
process through in terms of the NHS, but have the Government got plans
to set up some sort of private sector joint ventures? What private
sector involvement will there be in managing the future NHS
estate?<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000516">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I will say
more about the staff in discussing the next clause. Property is an
important part of the Bill, and I have already mentioned the scale and
the cost of the measure. We have not had much discussion on the matter,
so this is the opportunity to explore some of the issues to a greater
extent. As the Minister will realise, we feel that much of this
property is owned by the taxpayer and we are concerned about how it
will be managed in the future.<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000517">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Finally,
another issue is the fact that some of the buildings are purpose-built
for NHS use, and there would be difficulties in transferring them to
anyone else. If the Minister will answer those questions, I will be
grateful.<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000518">&#160;</a>

                           <strong>John
Pugh:</strong> This is a big issue, which the Minister does not have time to
deal with thoroughly and we do not have time to debate thoroughly. My
concern, which is at a slightly different angle from the hon. Member
for Halton, is that of orphan buildings. Many buildings were built
rather quickly under PFI and local improvement finance trusts. I have
calculated that the legacy cost to the NHS is some £4.5 billion.
I have a building in my constituency that no one can find much to do
with. When the PCTs go, there will be a problem of disposing of these
buildings. What do we do with buildings that other people do not want
to inherit, because they are costly to run and the overheads are high?
I assume that the Government intend to set up a residual body of some
sort.<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000519">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There is a
difference between the LIFT arrangement, where the PCT will be a
vanishing trustee in the arrangement, and the PFI schemes. I have had
conversations with some of the companies behind the LIFTCo initiative,
who ask the exact same question as we are asking here. They cannot
lose, because they are in contract for the next twenty years, or
however long it may be. The only person that can lose appreciably is
the taxpayer. If people will not use these buildings, even though they
will be there— unnecessarily endowed in some cases with Darzi
clinics—what will befall these unwanted
properties?<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000520">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> It will be helpful to start by giving the Committee
a relatively brief outline of what the clause does, before answering
the number of specific questions that the hon. Member for Halton has
asked, echoed partly by the hon. Member for Southport.<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000521">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Clause 274
allows the Secretary of State to establish transfer schemes for the
transfer of property, staff, rights and liabilities in connection with
the creation, modification or abolition of bodies as a result of the
Bill. That includes, for example, the transfer of staff currently
employed by PCTs, SHAs and certain special health authorities, such as
the Health and Social Care Information Centre, as well as the transfer
of property held by bodies such as the Health Protection Agency. The
schemes allow for transfers to a range of bodies, some newly
established by the Bill. For example, PCT property may be transferred
to commissioning consortia, ensuring that that property remains
available for delivering health care.<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000522">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The lists of
the bodies that transfers can be made from and to are set out, as some
hon. Members will know, in a table in schedules 21 and 22 to the Bill.
In some circumstances, the transfer scheme allows staff and property to
be transferred to a qualifying company. A qualifying company is one
established under section 223 of the NHS Act 2006, which is partly or
wholly owned by the Secretary of State and which is formed for the
purposes of providing services or facilities to persons or bodies
exercising functions under the 2006 Act.<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000523">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Section 223
companies are a long-established means for providing services to the
NHS, with examples in the past including the successful NHS
Professionals and Dr Foster Intelligence. It is not as a
prelude to privatisation; it is a means of allowing private investment
and private sector expertise to be brought in as required. At this
stage we are still considering the role such a company

                           </div>could play, as work in this area is still being developed. The clause
also allows the Secretary of State to direct either the NHS
commissioning board or a qualifying company to make transfer schemes on
his behalf. He may also direct them as to how they exercise those
functions.<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000524">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
powers in this clauses are broad, but purposefully so. We are still at
an early stage in deciding how staff and property will be distributed,
and many decisions will have to be made on a case-by-case basis. We
think this power strikes a sensible balance between flexibility and
ensuring that the property and staff of the NHS are properly
transferred to the structures in the new scheme.<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000525">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The hon.
Member for Halton asked a number of specific questions, which I would
like to go through. First, he asked who was going to be responsible in
the Department of Health. The answer to that is that the Secretary of
State will be, but he can delegate to the commissioning board or to a
section 223 company owned by the Secretary of State. The hon. Gentleman
also asked about Department of Health
staffing.<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000526">&#160;</a>

commissioning board by the Secretary of State. Does the chief executive
of the National Health Service have no say whatsoever on decisions
relating to the transfer of property—in other words, to the
proposals in this clause? Is it solely the Secretary of State who can
delegate to the national commissioning board? Can the Minister be clear
on that
point?<a class="bkMark" name="11040142000001">&#160;</a>

at one of the Select Committee hearings in terms of a specific
allegiance to one or the other. There is an accounting officer issue as
well. Will it, therefore, be delegated to him not as chief executive of

                           </strong> The fact is that the NHS chief executive has no
statutory role. He advises the Secretary of State. On the question of
Department of Health staff raised by the hon. Gentleman, currently the
process is to be determined. The issue is taken very seriously. There
is already a well-established team within the Department of Health to
manage transitional issues, as the hon. Gentleman would expect. He also
raised the issue of legal processes. There are legal advisers to the
Secretary of State and the commissioning board who will be dealing with
legal issues. Again, I assume that the hon. Gentleman would expect

                           </strong> Yes, for primary care. As the hon. Gentleman will
appreciate, this is a horribly complex issue. To be frank, I cannot
give an accurate figure off the top of my head, but I can guarantee the
hon. Gentleman that I will write to him with the accurate figures as
soon as I can after this Committee so that he is fully aware of the
sort of numbers involved. I hope that he finds that helpful. The hon.
Gentleman also asked what will happen to unwanted properties.
Everything will have to be transferred somewhere, and no property will
be abandoned. He also asked about private sector joint ventures to be
set up and discussions held. I can tell him that discussions are under
way within the Department and with the Cabinet Office. We have not had
discussions with the private sector.<a class="bkMark" name="11040142000008">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The hon.
Gentleman asked about unitary and metropolitan councils. Clause
274(9)(b) relates to unitary authorities, so property can be
transferred to them provided that it is for public health service,
which I hope reassures him. The hon. Gentleman and my hon. Friend the
Member for Southport have mentioned PFI and LIFTCo. PFI deals could be
transferred, as could NHS shares in LIFTCo, but discussions are still
ongoing and the most appropriate solution in both cases will depend on
individual circumstances. The hon. Member for Halton has also asked
about our discussions on leases. Leases could be transferred but,
again, decisions need to be made on a case-by-case basis. I think that
that has answered all his questions.<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000527">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am glad that no building would be abandoned. My
concern—it is a very particular concern in my constituency, but
it is probably replicated in lots of others—is that GP consortia
will prefer to conduct many of the clinics that are currently set up
in-house in their own clinics. The buildings will not actually be
abandoned, therefore, but they may not be used either and the costs
will be incurred.<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000528">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I appreciate the point that my hon. Friend raises,
and I understand and share his desire to avoid waste in the NHS. In
such circumstances—I think it will be a relatively small number
of cases—decisions will have to be taken on a case-by-case
basis, rather than giving a blanket, overarching direction that this or
that must happen. I hope that that satisfies my hon.

                        <p class="tabbed">Clauses
274 and 275 deal with the transfers of property, liabilities and staff
that will take place as a result of changes made in the Bill. Schedule
21 details the types of property transfers that the Secretary of State
can make, or can direct the board or qualifying company—which
can be partly or wholly owned by the Government for NHS
purposes—to make. Such transfers will generally be from existing
bodies that will be abolished, such as PCTs and SHAs, as we have
discussed, to new bodies or existing bodies that will continue to
function after the Bill becomes law. The amendment would remove the
provision that allows the transfer of property that is currently held
by a PCT to any other person who provides services as part of the
health service in England and consents to the transfer. In practice,
that means that a public property built with public money could be
transferred to private providers that are providing services for the
NHS. As PCTs currently own properties worth billions of pounds, which
we have already discussed, it is clearly of concern that they can
vanish from public hands and be put into private hands. Further
clarification is needed on the circumstances in which Ministers would
hand over NHS assets to private providers and why they would need this
power to do so. Specifically, when we talk about transfer are we
talking about it being free or at a cost?<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000561">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I will be very quick. This amendment would prevent
any property currently held by a PCT from being transferred to any
provider of services, apart from the health service in England, that is
not a public authority. That would stop the Secretary of State or the
NHS commissioning board from transferring property from PCTs to social
enterprises, voluntary and community groups or to any other person
providing services as part of the health service who is not a public
authority.<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000562">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I am aware of
the concerns expressed by Unite during the evidence sessions earlier in

                           </div>PCTs to private providers for free or below market rate. I can
categorically assure the Committee that we will not do that.
Furthermore, there are long-established safeguards to ensure that the
Secretary of State could not simply hand over the assets of PCTs and
strategic health authorities to private providers without proper
scrutiny. As with all public assets, where a property is transferred to
a third party and the potential gift—the reduction in market
value—is worth more than £250,000 the transaction must be
approved by Her Majesty’s Treasury and the case laid before
Parliament.<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000563">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Any such
transfer would also need a proper business case to show a commensurate
social or other benefit to justify transfer at below market rate before
it could proceed. Where the potential gift is worth less than
£250,000 the board of the NHS body entering into the transaction
must similarly develop a business case and satisfy themselves and their
auditors that they are receiving commensurate benefit in kind. In this
case, the board minutes would be publicly available.<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000564">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The transfer
scheme provisions in the Bill also contain powers to ensure that
transferred property is used to provide health care. Clause 275 (3)
allows transfer schemes to create rights and liabilities in relation to
property transferred. For example, a transfer scheme could place a
covenant on the property to ensure that it continues to be used for
purposes connected to providing NHS-funded services.<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000565">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In the
transfers from PCTs to community foundation trusts, which are already
taking place under the transforming community service programme, we are
already proposing to incorporate a buy-back provision. That will ensure
that if the property is vacant, if a provider is no longer providing
services or if the provider ceases to exist, the property can be
returned to the Secretary of State or a body nominated by him, such as
another foundation trust. The power is a means to ensure that property
would continue to be used to provide services. For transfers under
these clauses in the Bill, we are actively considering a similar
arrangement, though the precise details are still being worked
out.<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000566">&#160;</a>

the hon. Gentleman will be reassured that we do not have the faintest
intention of handing over NHS property to private companies, and there

rights and liabilities that could not otherwise be transferred, and the
transfer of criminal liabilities in a limited range of bodies. The
clause also allows supplementary, incidental, transitional and
consequential provision to be made by a transfer scheme. For example, a
transfer scheme may create rights or impose liabilities, such as
requiring that a property transferred to a local authority from a PCT
should continue to be used for health care purposes. The clause
requires the Secretary of State to ensure that the liabilities of all
PCTs, SHAs and certain special health authorities are dealt with by the
time those bodies are abolished by the

                        <p class="tabbed">Fluoridation
is a controversial subject, and I want to make it clear that, in the
new clauses and the associated amendments, we do not seek to come down
on one side or the other. However, to ensure that we consider the
policy fully and carefully it was thought important to introduce
further amendments. With the abolition of strategic health authorities,
responsibility for proposing fluoridation schemes and for conducting
consultation on such schemes should be transferred to local
authorities, and responsibility for contracting fluoridation schemes
should be transferred to the Secretary of State. In practice, the
Secretary of State’s function will be carried out by Public
Health England.<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000600">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Making local
authorities responsible for consultation on fluoridation schemes would
fit well with their responsibilities for public health. Proposals for
fluoridation schemes would derive from the joint strategic needs
assessments that local authorities make of their populations. On the
other hand, negotiating and managing contracts—or
“arrangements” in the new clauses—is a complex
legal and technical process. It is unlikely that any single local
authority would have the necessary expertise, and it would be wasteful
to try to replicate it across 50 or so local authorities, so we intend
that Public Health England should take on the
task.<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000601">&#160;</a>

only this week; they are bigger than the original Bill on the subject
that went through the House in the 1980s. It seems ridiculous that we
have only two minutes to talk about a major issue, which the Minister
rightly pointed out caused debate on the Floor of the House. It is a
disgrace that we have all this work before us yet are told that we have
to finish at 4 o’clock. What sort of oversight is this? New
clauses, new schedules, hundreds of amendments are being tabled while
we sit here trying to get some oversight of a most important Bill

chairmanship—[<span class="smallcaps">Hon. Members:</span> “Hear,

to the dedicated civil servants from the Department of Health, who have

thank all my hon. Friends not only for attending very regularly but for
their contributions. There have been clear divisions between the two
sides of the Committee, but my hon. Friends have ensured that our
debates have been carried out in a friendly and reasonable way. I pay
tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for Preseli Pembrokeshire and the
hon. Member for Sedgefield, because I have always found that it is very
foolish to fall foul of a Whip and because of how they have controlled
us and organised our proceedings.<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000745">&#160;</a>

particular pleasure to work with Opposition Committee members. The hon.
Member for Halton has been the perfect gent; the hon. Members for
Islington South and Finsbury and for Leicester West—the latter
better known as “Leicester Liz”. They have all been
stalwarts in pushing their case. I have now come to understand more
fully the meaning of the words “misconception” and
“misinterpretation”. I have learned a lot that I will not
forget in a hurry. I do thank Opposition Committee members, because
although we may have serious differences of opinion on our vision for
improving and modernising the health service, at least our debates have
been conducted in a friendly and constructive way. That is particularly
due to how they have responded to the debating from the Government side
of the

our thanks to you and your fellow Chairs, Mr Hood, Mr Gale and Dr

they have been extremely helpful. I thank them for all their hard work
in keeping track of everything. Of course, I also thank <em>Hansard</em>

very difficult sometimes to keep up with proceedings. I put our thanks

also the many groups outside—I will not name them because there
are so many—that have an interest or are part of the national
health service. They took such an interest in providing briefings to
Members on both sides of the Committee and suggestions for amendments,
and those have been very helpful.<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000752">&#160;</a>

also thank my colleagues—specifically, my shadow ministerial
colleagues, my hon. Friends the Members for Islington South and
Finsbury and for Leicester West. In particular, I pay tribute to my
party’s Back Benchers, who have done a sterling job in holding
the Government to account and have put in a tremendous amount of hard
work. I also thank the Government Back Benchers; we would have liked to
have heard more from them, although I am sure that their Whip thought
differently.<a class="bkMark" name="11040119000753">&#160;</a>
