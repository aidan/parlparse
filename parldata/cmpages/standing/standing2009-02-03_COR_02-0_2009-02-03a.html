<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020411000371"></a>The
Chairman:</b> On behalf of the Committee, I welcome the
witnesses for this afternoon&#146;s first evidence session. They are
Andr&#233; Rebello, honorary secretary of the Coroners Society of
England and Wales; Deborah Coles and Helen Shaw, co-directors of
Inquest; Alison Cox, chief executive of Cardiac Risk in the Young; and
Professor Peter Furness, president of the Royal College of
Pathologists. Thank you all for joining
us.</div><a name="09020411000017"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
83</b><a name="09020411000372"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Henry Bellingham</b> (North-West Norfolk) (Con): I have four
quick questions regarding appointments and directed mainly at
Andr&#233; Rebello and the Coroners&#146; Society. First, does the
Coroners&#146; Society feel that the posts of senior, area and
assistant coroner should remain freehold? Secondly, does it concern you
that the Bill makes provision for the area and assistant coroners to be
appointed by the local authority, rather than by the senior coroner?
For example, if a local authority had an agenda because it did not have
much confidence in the senior coroner, could not there be potential
problems of conflict if it decided that it wanted to put its stamp on
the appointment of the area and assistant
coroners?</div><a name="09020411000018"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thirdly,
do you feel that it is right that medically qualified professionals
will be precluded from applying for those posts? Fourthly, does it
concern you that senior coroners, who effectively are very experienced
members of the judiciary, will be precluded from applying for the post
of deputy chief coroner, as those are all based on appointment? Those
questions run
together.</div><a name="09020411000019"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020411000373"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Mr. Rebello, I ask you to respond to
those questions first, then the other witnesses may indicate if they
wish to come in afterwards.</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column38" />Column number: 38</div><a name="09020411000020"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Andr&#233;
Rebello:</b></i> With regard to freehold coroners, clearly
the title &#147;freehold&#148; will give added independence, make
it clear that coroners are not employed and, I am sure, give the public
more confidence with the coronial office. Local authorities perhaps
have too much control of the budget they provide to coroners and things
of that nature, which will affect the coronial service. Having the
office as a freehold office&#151;whatever that means&#151;might
give the public greater
confidence.</div><a name="09020411000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is right for coroners to be appointed by the local authority, or the
local authority in conjunction with someone from the chief
coroner&#146;s office, or even&#151;for the senior
coroner&#151;the Judicial Appointments Commission. Thereafter, it is
very difficult for someone to be parachuted in to work with the senior
coroner. They have to work as a team: when the senior coroner is not
there, the assistant coroners must be available. In any event, area
coroners would be full-time judicial office holders&#151;very similar
to the senior coroner.</div>
<a name="09020411000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given that
there are no national terms and conditions for coroners, the danger is
that someone who happens to be on the books of the local authority
legal department might be told, &#147;You are the new assistant
coroner, go along and help the coroner.&#148; That would be
outrageous. It is essential for the coroner to be involved in the
appointment of assistant coroners.</div>
<a name="09020411000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would be
very uncomfortable about someone being appointed to work with me, to
the standards that I set within my jurisdiction, if I had no control
regarding whether that person had the specifications and particular
abilities to carry out coronial office to the standards I want. We
cannot have an assistant coroner coming in and working to different
standards. It may be that the chief coroner sets the tone for the whole
country, but I do not know whether that will happen overnight. I would
definitely expect certain standards in my jurisdiction of Liverpool,
and I would be very uncomfortable with any assistant coroner coming in.
I would want to have some
control.</div><a name="09020411000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">Medically
qualified coroners have provided an excellent service over the years,
and many&#151;if not all&#151;are also legally qualified. The
difficulty is that, as a lawyer, one is trained to have a sense of
natural justice. A lawyer can always call a doctor to give technical
evidence on medical matters. It is exactly the same as a High Court
judge who does not have to be a doctor when dealing with a matter of
medical negligence. The difficulty arises if someone is medically
qualified but not au fait with natural justice. They cannot call
someone to give evidence with regard to fairness and things of that
nature while they are hearing a
case.</div><a name="09020411000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
makes some sense to have only lawyers as coroners. Nevertheless, doctor
coroners have provided an excellent service and fortunately, because of
the transitional arrangements, all doctor coroners will be able to
continue in office. We could have a provision whereby doctors took some
kind of qualification or went on a course relating to judgecraft and
things of that nature. In the future, doctors may well be capable of
carrying out coronial office&#151;that is a possibility. However, in
the main, the society&#146;s view is that it should probably be
predominantly a lawyer
post.</div><a name="09020411000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
society believes that the chief coroner should be a High Court judge,
not a circuit judge. If a circuit judge is capable of carrying out that
office, they should be promoted to High Court judge. It will require
quite a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column39" />Column number: 39</div>bit of clout to get things moving as chief coroner, and only a High
Court judge will have
that.</div><a name="09020411000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">Regarding
the deputy chief coroner, I am concerned about schedule 7 because most
High Court judges&#151;leaving aside those who are involved as
designated care judges in the family division&#151;come from an
adversarial background. They are not au fait with an inquisitorial
jurisdiction and would not necessarily have a feeling for the coronial
process. Furthermore, it is outrageous in this day and age to have an
apparent discrimination against senior coroners and a glass ceiling
that means that they can never become more than a coroner. A tribunal
chairman can eventually end up as Lord Chief Justice. Why should
coroners stay as coroners for their whole career?</div>
<a name="09020411000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">The chief
coroner will have a responsibility to keep coroners informed about
changes in law and things of that nature. Those are matters that the
Coroners&#146; Society currently deals with. The chief coroner will
also have a responsibility for the training and development of
coroners, which the Coroners&#146; Society is also involved with. In
fact, the Coroners&#146; Society delivers training to coroners. If
the chief coroner is going to be responsible for that, senior coroners
will still be involved in those things. We may need one deputy chief
coroner responsible for training, one for keeping coroners up to date
and so
on.</div><a name="09020411000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
you look at clause 30, on appeals, the first six items are about
whether there has been a post mortem, whether a determination is
correct, whether evidence has not been heard that should have been
heard and things of that nature. Any senior coroner of 10 years&#146;
standing or more is capable of turning those round very
quickly.</div><a name="09020411000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
concern is that the chief coroners office will be staffed by civil
servants and that some of those appellate judicial functions will be
delegated to non-lawyers working to a script and rejecting or allowing
appeals based upon pro formas. Part-time assistant deputy chief
coroners working to clear backlogs would be far better, would give the
chief coroner the capacity to deal with lots of things in lots ways and
would keep
flexibility.</div><a name="09020411000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
does not seem right that a glass ceiling will imposed by legislation in
2009. This country does not approve of glass ceilings in any other area
and coroners are quite distressed by it&#151;not because it affects
our career development, but because the service would be better if
coronial experience were used to help and develop the
service.</div>
<a name="09020411000032"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020411000374"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Would anyone else on the panel like to come in
on those specific questions?</div>
<a name="09020411000033"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Helen
Shaw:</b></i> On the question of the deputy chief coroner, in
a sense, we agree with the Coroners&#146; Society about the chief
coroner being a High Court judge. We think that that is an important
and welcome element of judicial oversight in the system. We understand
that, if someone is to deputise for the chief coroner, they have to
have the same standing, but we also understand that there is the
possibility in the Bill of a number of deputy chief coroners. We are
concerned about some of the very good work that is being done in the
existing coroners system and the need for that to be fed into the new
structure. We very much support any changes that could be made to allow
existing coroners of, as Andr&#233; says, 10 years&#146; standing
or more to apply for one of those
posts.</div><a name="09020411000034"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Alison
Cox:</b></i> I would endorse that view very
strongly.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column40" />Column number: 40</div><a name="09020411000035"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
84</b><a name="09020411000375"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Tim Boswell</b> (Daventry) (Con): My first question,
Mr. Rebello, is, do you envisage that the chief coroner or
somebody else will mediate or adjudicate, as it were, if a dispute
arises between a local authority and its
coroner?</div><a name="09020411000036"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Andr&#233;
Rebello:</b></i> This is regarding how the chief coroner will
influence local authorities to comply with, I think, clause
23&#151;the duty on the local authority to provide the
infrastructure, accommodation and staffing that the coroner needs to
carry out coronial administrative and investigative duties. One
difficulty is, of course, that power is devolved to local government
and local governments have to set their budgets. As well as being
responsible for the coronial system, they are also responsible for
children&#146;s services, services for the elderly and lots of other
essential things. From the media, we know about the tragic cases of
essential services falling short. One can see that local authorities
have a difficult
job.</div><a name="09020411000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
cannot see a chief coroner turning round to a local authorities and
saying, &#147;That coroner needs a court to hear this inquest and a
room for the jury. The jury need separate toilet facilities. There are
12 properly interested persons and each has a solicitor or barrister
who needs conference rooms, and the witnesses need privacy and
bereavement rooms. You will have to provide those.&#148; If the local
authority turned round and said, &#147;Sorry, we can&#146;t afford
it,&#148; I do not see what the chief coroner could do. Presumably,
the chief coroner could apply for judicial review. It would be very
strange legislation that had built into it a safeguard giving the chief
coroner the power to enforce a sanction by judicial review. One would
have thought that if Parliament was considering that, it would put some
sanctions in to allow the chief coroner to deal with the situation. I
cannot think of any method whereby the chief coroner could control a
local authority budget. It is an invidious
position.</div><a name="09020411000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
my submission notes, I say that there is a danger of the chief coroner
being made a scapegoat because we will not have a national service even
with this Bill. We have a national tone to the service and national
leadership, but we still have 110 or so separate legal jurisdictions
serving their own local infrastructure. Of course, every coronial
jurisdiction is different. Some have prisons, some have special
hospitals and some have large teaching hospitals. The infrastructure
and services required in each are
different.</div><a name="09020411000039"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Professor
Furness:</b></i> From the perspective of the Royal College of
Pathologists, may I pick up on a point that Mr. Rebello
made? We are a little concerned that the Bill seems to put the emphasis
for the office of the chief coroner on the resolution of disputes and
appeals. That is clearly important, but our concern is the variation in
practice in coroner&#146;s courts around the country, which
Mr. Rebello touched on. We hoped that the coroner&#146;s
office would bring a degree of harmonisation. We, too, are concerned
that we cannot see the teeth or the drive in the Bill to produce that
harmonisation.</div><a name="09020411000040"></a>

about your evidence, Mr. Rebello. First, you talked about

Absolutely.</div><a name="09020411000048"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
89</b><b class="B"><a name="09020411000380"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> I have a blank on whether my final point is
referred to in the papers. Do you have any strong views that you wish
to share on the age of retirement of
coroners?</div><a name="09020411000049"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Andr&#233;
Rebello:</b></i> My wife does. The big difficulty I see is
that each coroner, even with the Bill, has to negotiate locally for
terms and conditions. It surprises the Bar and the main judiciary that
I have to work for 40 years to get my pension. The judiciary has a
judicial pension after 20 years. It is not surprising that, apart from
the more senior members of the judiciary, most judges retire in their
early 60s. Most coroners have to keep going until they are 70 or nearly
80 because they cannot afford to retire. That is an historical
issue.</div><a name="09020411000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
I left private practice in 1999 to become a full-time coroner, after
having been a part-time coroner, my income halved. At that stage, I was
buying into my partnership. The money I got from my partnership paid
off my loans and I had no pension. I started from scratch. If I was a
circuit judge or a High Court judge, after 20 years I would have a full
judicial pension. I could retire and leave it to other people to get on
with the work. As a coroner, I have to pay into the local government
pension scheme for 40 years. It seems nonsensical that nothing in the
Bill sets national standards for terms for coroners. Parliament has an
opportunity to put things right and to set the right tone. That
opportunity should be
taken.</div><a name="09020411000051"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020411000381"></a>The
Chairman:</b> You had the opportunity to do some lobbying and
you have done
it.</div><a name="09020411000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
should have said this at the beginning, so, before we move on, I remind
hon. Members and witnesses that we are bound by the internal knives
that the Committee agreed under Mr. Cook&#146;s
chairmanship this morning. That means that this evidence session must
finish at 5.30 pm, the second at 6.15 pm and the third at 6.55 pm,

have to interrupt anybody mid-sentence, but if I have to I

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
90</b><a name="09020411000382"></a><b class="B">Jenny
Willott</b> (Cardiff, Central) (LD): To follow on from
Mr. Boswell&#146;s questions, and before going on to the
next subject, I have a couple of questions about
resourcing.</div><a name="09020411000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">Mr.
Rebello, you were talking about what could be done to ensure proper
resourcing for local coroners. What would you like to see introduced?
You talked 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column42" />Column number: 42</div>about judicial review, which is clearly not an ideal scenario. What
would you like to see in the Bill that you think would get around
that?</div><a name="09020411000055"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Andr&#233;
Rebello:</b></i> The Bill says that the local authority must
do various things, but it does not set any standards. If the Bill
referred to rules that were to be made later with regard to that type
of accommodation&#151;what needs to be provided&#151;and if the
chief coroner, when in post in shadow, could start a shopping list, if
that was possible, saying that on such a date, when the law comes in,
this is what we would expect every local authority to have and this is
what the law expects them to provide, local authorities would have time
to get ready.</div>
<a name="09020411000056"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
91</b><b class="B"><a name="09020411000383"></a>Jenny
Willott:</b> As precise as
that?</div><a name="09020411000057"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Andr&#233;
Rebello:</b></i> But I do not know what sanctions there are,
because we are not having a national service. There is no point
devolving power to local authorities and then telling them what to do
with their money. That is the difficulty.</div>
<a name="09020411000058"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
92</b><b class="B"><a name="09020411000384"></a>Jenny
Willott:</b> If that were not to happen, do you think that
some dispute resolution mechanism should be introduced? At the moment,
coroners are pretty much left to argue with their local authorities,
are they not?</div>
<a name="09020411000059"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Andr&#233;
Rebello:</b></i> They are. To be fair to officials in the
coroners unit in the Ministry of Justice, when the situation becomes
extreme officials intercede and on many occasions local authorities
have provided what they refused to provide in the
past.</div>
<a name="09020411000060"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
93</b><b class="B"><a name="09020411000385"></a>Jenny
Willott:</b> Is that
official?</div><a name="09020411000061"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Andr&#233;
Rebello:</b></i> No, it is not official. Basically, coroners
could embarrass their local authorities. You could summon the chief
executive to give evidence and ensure that all the media were there.
You can be very hard headed about it. That would be my style; most
coroners are very nice and would not do it.</div>
<a name="09020411000062"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Alison
Cox:</b></i> To endorse what Andr&#233; says, I want to say
that some of our bereaved families would be very happy to do that. If
there was a failing of the service, they would be the ones to suffer.
The coroners put the issue in place, but I do not want anyone to forget
that the people at risk here, if the service is not improved, are the
families. I tell you this&#151;they would not hesitate to cause
embarrassment, especially with a bit of encouragement from
me.</div><a name="09020411000063"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
94</b><b class="B"><a name="09020411000386"></a>Jenny
Willott:</b> I have a couple of questions about the issue of
certified inquests, or secret inquests. I wonder if anyone on the panel
can give us any examples of &#147;real harm&#148;, as the wording
is in the Bill, that has been done to the public interest by holding an
inquest in public, or if there are any examples that anyone can give of
inquests that were unable to reach a satisfactory conclusion as a
result of information that could not be made
public.</div><a name="09020411000064"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Helen
Shaw:</b></i> In answer to your question, no, there are no
inquests that we know of that have not been able to reach a
satisfactory conclusion. That is inquests that we know of, in terms of
clause 11. There are a number of cases that have involved sensitive
material and the  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column43" />Column number: 43</div>combination of existing provisions has been sufficient to deal with
those inquests concluding properly. Can you remind me of your question
about &#147;real
harm&#148;?</div><a name="09020411000065"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020411000387"></a>Jenny
Willott:</b> Yes. The Bill says that one of the reasons that
an inquest could be held in secret would be on the grounds of</div>
<a name="09020411000341"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;real harm to
the public
interest&#148;.</div><a name="09020411000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">Can
the panel think of any examples of
that?</div><a name="09020411000067"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Helen
Shaw:</b></i> No. We were thinking through our 20
years of working at inquests around a lot of contentious custody deaths
and we could not think of any examples. We know that this clause has
arisen because of two particular cases and there are very particular
issues that need to be addressed. We think that the clause is much too
widely drawn and we hope that we can speak to the Secretary of State
for Justice and Lord Chancellor to find a more sensible solution. The
clause is a hugely wide proposal, which we think is not necessary. We
hope that we can find something that is much more precise, that deals
with the matters that arose in those two particular cases and that will
refer to issues under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act
2000.</div><a name="09020411000068"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Deborah
Coles:</b></i> Look at the inquest into the death of Jean
Charles de Menezes&#151;we will be supplying the Committee with a
detailed briefing, including a case study, on that&#151;which was a
very high profile case involving many interested parties, a family who
were desperate to find out the truth and a lot of public interest. That
inquest managed to perform its vital function in terms of
accountability and a jury narrative that identified any
concerns.</div><a name="09020411000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
was evidence heard as part of that inquest that had to find alternative
mechanisms other than being held in public&#151;public interest
immunity certificates and the like. If we look at that inquest as being
an extremely good example of a high profile case where people might
have suggested that there could be harm in terms of security and the
issues in which it was engaged, it is an example of the coroners
inquest system being able to deal with a case of such
complexity.</div><a name="09020411000070"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
95</b><b class="B"><a name="09020411000388"></a>Jenny
Willott:</b> My final question is about the role of families
in secret inquests. Are you happy with the provisions in the Bill for
the protection of families and their involvement in certified inquests?
Are you reassured by what the Government said, or do you have concerns
about the impact of certified inquests on the families
involved?</div><a name="09020411000071"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Helen
Shaw:</b></i> We have huge concerns because the proposal
effectively excludes the family and their chosen legal representatives
from the part of the inquest dealing with the sensitive material. We
think that that means that the inquest would not comply with article 2
of the Human Rights Act 1998. On a more human level, the family would
be excluded even if the material goes into exactly why somebody died.
We think that is wrong in terms of an inquest process that they are
caught up in through no choice of their own, but through which they
obviously want to find out why their loved one
died.</div><a name="09020411000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
feel that family involvement in those cases is not sufficient, and
neither is the proposal that there be special counsel to the inquest.
Special counsel to an inquest is, in a sense, a friend to the court.
Their role is to assist the court. They do not have a role to take up 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column44" />Column number: 44</div>the interests of any particular person who is represented in that
inquest. That is not a sufficient safeguard to ensure that the
family&#146;s legitimate interests are properly protected. We really
hope that some different proposals will come forward and we are
encouraged by the comments made by the Secretary of State for
Justice&#151;he also found this quite a difficult set of proposals
and was minded to look at amendments. At the moment the Bill does not
allow the family to have access to some of the most important
information about how their loved one
died.</div><a name="09020411000073"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
96</b><a name="09020411000389"></a><b class="B">Ian
Lucas</b> (Wrexham) (Lab): If we can turn briefly to
resources. When I dealt with coroners&#146; inquests in my somewhat
distant and limited previous role as a solicitor, they tended to be
held in magistrates courts&#151;that is the way it is set in my mind.
Looking at the circumstances for witnesses, for example, is there a
variation in the venues? If there is, what kind of venues are used for
coroners&#146;
inquests?</div><a name="09020411000074"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Andr&#233;
Rebello:</b></i> Absolutely. If I could explain: I am
co-located with the registration service in Liverpool&#151;I have a
purpose built courtroom with a jury room off the courtroom. My personal
office is about a third the size of this room. We have interview rooms
for families, five interview rooms upstairs for advocates and two other
ceremony rooms. We have lots of space for registrars to report deaths
to me, we have a video presenter in court, all the
equipment&#151;loop systems&#151;anything you want, we have got. My
authority is
brilliant.</div><a name="09020411000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">Other
coroners, if they hold a long inquest, will move from village hall to
village hall. There is nowhere for anyone to go, they borrow
magistrates courts&#151;with families mixing with criminals in the
court corridor. The inquest that has been mentioned was held at
Kennington Oval, which is totally inappropriate for a coroner&#146;s
court. I am sure that within the court service there could have been a
proper court for an inquest of such importance. The system is
outrageous. In 2009 coroners should not be borrowing the same type of
venue to hold a court that people would use for a silver wedding or
21st birthday party. It is just not on. Of course, the law is now there
for local authorities to provide it. The difficulty is that such are
the demands on local authorities that the budget is already accounted
for. They are inspected in other areas and they have to deliver in
other areas. There is not the spare money for them to develop a
coroners system. This is all new money that needs to be found to build
an infrastructure. We have also had the closing down of magistrates
courts and the grouping together of magistrates benches, such that
courts are no longer available because the land has been sold off. Yet
we have magnificent places such as the civil justice centre in
Manchester and a smaller centre in Liverpool. We have these across the
country and many of them are grossly under-used. The difficulty with
the current law is that coroners cannot hear a case outside their own
jurisdiction. Hopefully, with this Bill coroners will be able to hear a
case anywhere even if it means going across a couple of
boundaries.</div><a name="09020411000076"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Deborah
Coles:</b></i> In terms of the number of inquests that we are
involved with at the moment, one is taking place in a football ground
and another in a room that is probably about a third of the size of
this. There are four interested parties to that inquest and there is no
private 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column45" />Column number: 45</div>waiting space for the family. We did some research where we talked to a
lot of families who have been involved in inquests over the years and
so many of them mentioned how difficult it was to attend an inquest, as
you would imagine, but not have any kind of private waiting space
before they were about to give evidence&#151;nowhere to have a cup of
tea, nowhere to meet with their lawyers. It is a real issue. We did
welcome the fact that the boundary limits are going to be relaxed and
maybe there can be better use. If we were talking about the ideal
system, there would be purpose-built coroners&#146; courts that were
able to engage with the bereaved in particular on a much more personal
and humane
basis.</div><a name="09020411000077"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
97</b><a name="09020411000390"></a><b class="B">Mrs.
Madeleine Moon</b> (Bridgend) (Lab): Do you think it would be
appropriate for a chief coroner to have powers to request or require
additional resources and facilities where perhaps there needs to be a
greater in-depth investigation, perhaps where there has been a cluster
of deaths, so that further examination can take place&#151;I am
thinking in particular of my own constituency where we had a cluster of
deaths by suicide&#151;so that the families could have a better
understanding of why those deaths took place, that could inform local
services, that could give some satisfaction to families as to why
people have died but also do some work to help prevent future deaths?
Should that be a nationally or locally based
study?</div><a name="09020411000078"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Andr&#233;
Rebello:</b></i> What you are describing is the
coroners&#146; system in New Zealand and Victoria, Australia. This
Bill is an awful long way from there. Like we exported cricket, we
exported the colonial system with the empire. Everywhere else moved on
but we have stayed back in 1887. Even under this Bill, coroners look at
individual cases, an individual body. There is not the facility to hold
more than one inquest into one case at a time. If you have a train
crash&#151;one incident that has caused many deaths&#151;there will
be different registrable particulars and a different cause of death
with regard to each of the individuals. However, the means and
circumstances in which those deaths occurred will be the same, so it
would be a nonsense to hear that evidence several times. It is not
really possible for a coroner to cluster together cases. The other
thing is that individual families might not welcome it because each
death is as special as any other. It does not matter if your child
falls downstairs and dies or if your child dies in the street. It still
hurts as much as anything can ever hurt. We are dealing with
individuals here&#151;individual people and families&#151;and to
cluster cases together is not
right.</div><a name="09020411000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
there is a trend and if a few cases perhaps need an overview, it may be
possible to have a public inquiry, or something of that nature looking
at those circumstances together, but I am not sure that the coroner
system, as mentioned in the Coroners and Justice Bill, will be able to
achieve that. Perhaps the chief coroner might be able to pull together
findings from a few cases and hold some kind of inquiry, but there is
not the mechanism or facility for that to
happen.</div><a name="09020411000080"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Deborah
Coles:</b></i> The coroner is right. The current
system could not cope with that. But inquests are really
interested in that kind of proposal. We certainly looked at this when
there was a cluster of deaths in Styal women&#146;s prison, where six
deaths occurred in a period 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column46" />Column number: 46</div>of a year. We felt that rather than having a separate inquest into each
of those deaths that would take place over a period of years, because
of the delay in the system, an inquiry would have benefited everybody
concerned.</div><a name="09020411000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">I take on
board the coroner&#146;s point about each individual death being
personal to that family. Of course, you should not lose sight of the
fact that you would need an inquiry into the individual death. But
where those deaths point to possible systemic failings and a pattern of
concerns, certainly you could have a broader inquiry that
would be meaningful for everybody
concerned.</div><a name="09020411000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
leads me to an additional point on the purpose of the inquest system.
The coroner mentioned the system in Australia and New Zealand. What we
really like about that system is that its priority is death
prevention&#151;that is its key purpose&#151;and learning lessons.
All the families that we talked to said that, although nothing will
bring their relative back, they take comfort in knowing that lessons
are, perhaps, learned. We are disappointed that there are not effective
mechanisms in the Bill to ensure that there is accountable learning, so
that something is done with regard to the outcomes of inquests: the
coroners&#146; rule 43 reports and important jury narrative verdicts.
There is no proposal in the Bill to deal with the collation, monitoring
and publication of those things. That is an important
omission.</div><a name="09020411000083"></a>

98</b><b class="B"><a name="09020411000391"></a>Mrs.
Moon:</b> On the system that is in use in Australia, two
studies, coming out of Manchester and Oxford, have dealt with
psychological autopsies, where the individual is the focus. So it is
not a case of moving away from the individual and their death at all,
but of exploring that person&#146;s death much more, to provide an
understanding about why the person is dead and to look at the common
links. Do you think that it would be appropriate for the psychological
autopsy system, which I am particularly interested in, to sit behind
the coroners&#146;
system?</div><a name="09020411000084"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Andr&#233;
Rebello:</b></i> At the moment, in my jurisdiction, we have
co-operated with researchers looking back through inquest files for
trends. They have looked at death by self-harm, which I have not been
able to say is suicide, and they have come to different conclusions,
for epidemiology purposes, to prevent
harm.</div><a name="09020411000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not know. All I know is that at the moment we have got to determine
who died, when or where the person died and by what means, and, in some
cases, in what circumstances the cause of death arose. We can hear
evidence and decide the facts. If there has to be some bridging between
trends in different types of cases, that is not in the Bill and not in
the current law. This would be something new. Whether that would be
beneficial or not, I do not know. I presume that the Office for
National Statistics and the General Register Office pull together some
of these things, otherwise we would not have any information for
politicians to make decisions on. There must be something pulling it
together
somewhere.</div><a name="09020411000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
lessons that we have learned and the provisions that we have now in
respect of rule 43 do not have any teeth. We can write letters raising
issues and we can get a reply, but there are no teeth for situations
where people do nothing&#151;apart from public humiliation&#151;if
the incident recurs.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column47" />Column number: 47</div><a name="09020411000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">You are
talking about something that is completely new, which is not in the
current law and is not in the Bill. The chief coroner might be asked to
appoint a deputy chief coroner to overview several inquests. That would
be a new structure and it is not there at moment. I do not know whether
it would be worthwhile because it is beyond what the coroner does
now.</div><a name="09020411000088"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
99</b><a name="09020411000392"></a><b class="B">Mr.
George Howarth</b> (Knowsley, North and Sefton, East) (Lab): I
want to ask three questions: one to Deborah Coles, one to
Mr. Rebello and one to Alison Cox. First, to Deborah Coles,
have I misunderstood or are you mixing up two separate objectives? On
the one hand there is an inquiry into the cause of death and on the
other an inquiry into the systems themselves. That is what you appeared
to be saying a few moments
ago.</div><a name="09020411000089"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Deborah
Coles:</b></i> No. The example I gave was death in prison.
Obviously inquests into those cases have to be article 2 compliant, so
there is the opportunity to look at the broader circumstances beyond
just the means by which the person died. So that involves an
examination of policies and procedures. For example, the deaths at
Styal raised a lot of concerns about the treatment of vulnerable women
who were drug dependent. The majority of those women took their own
lives by hanging themselves. The means of the death were quite clear.
We knew how they died. It was the broader circumstances that were of
key concern. That involved a lot of issues and looking at potential
system failings. Those article 2 cases look at broader issues than the
means.</div><a name="09020411000090"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
100</b><b class="B"><a name="09020411000393"></a>Mr.
Howarth:</b> Thank you. Mr. Rebello, you made the
point, and I agree with you, that even in cases where there may have
been multiple deaths in one incident, each case is different. Each
inquest should be about a different death, even though the overall
event may have caused all of the deaths. That is an important
distinction to make. There have been exceptions to that. There were a
series of mini-inquests into the Hillsborough deaths which meant that
they were doing eight per day. Although there was an inquest into each
death, it was a shortened version. As the Liverpool coroner you will
know that that caused a great deal of anguish, particularly given the
insensitivity of the conduct of the coroner in those inquests. Do you
think these new arrangements will do anything to improve those sorts of
inquest or do you think there is scope for some further improvements
for cases where there are multiple deaths arising from one
incident?</div><a name="09020411000091"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Andr&#233;
Rebello:</b></i> Stefan Popper lived and worked in a
different era. I suspect that what he did would have happened in nearly
every jurisdiction at that
time.</div><a name="09020411000092"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020411000394"></a>Mr.
Howarth:</b> I am sure he was well
intentioned.</div><a name="09020411000093"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Andr&#233;
Rebello:</b></i> I am absolutely certain he was well
intentioned. The other thing I would say is that my deputy acted for 96
families in the Hillsborough inquests. There were not batches of
inquests. When the inquests were opened the coroner had to receive
evidence of identification. You can do that in lots of different ways.
You can give everyone an appointment and have one person at a time
hearing evidence about who that person was, register all the
particulars so that you can issue an interim death certificate and a
certificate of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column48" />Column number: 48</div>disposal for burial or cremation and then adjourn the case until the
full evidence can be heard. Or you can deal with them in batches of
eight at a time. When a coroner was dealing with cases, particularly in
those days, people did not stop dying. Other people were dying at the
normal rates.</div>
<a name="09020411000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">On a Monday
morning in Liverpool, 60 deaths can be reported to me from the weekend.
I will have spoken to the police. I work 24/7. I work in the middle of
the night and still work the next day. Even when I am on holiday I am
working. When the coroner is faced with 96 or more deaths that occurred
in one incident, the number of people who normally die in the weeks it
takes to deal with those will remain the same. From a pragmatic point
of view, I understand that a decision might have been made in order to
continue giving a service to everyone else.</div>
<a name="09020411000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">Today, that
might be dealt with very differently, in the sense that coroners are
enabled and encouraged, particularly by the Coroners&#146; Society,
to appoint additional assistant deputy coroners. In those days, the
advice from the Home Office&#146;s coroners&#146; unit, the
predecessor of the Ministry of Justice&#146;s coroners&#146; unit,
was that the deputy and assistant deputy coroners could only work if
the coroner was not working. That was the advice given by the
Government. Therefore, if Stefan Popper was in court and working as
coroner, no deputy or assistant deputy coroner could deal with the
other cases, and that is what caused those problems. Today, you would
appoint additional assistant deputy coroners to deal with work while
you give time to each family to deal with the opening of the
inquest.</div><a name="09020411000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
looking at by what means and in what circumstances those deaths
occurred, you cannot hear the evidence 96 times with 96 separate
juries, because you will get 96 different versions of the means and
circumstances. The witnesses will give evidence differently each time
and the different juries will come to different conclusions, even if
they have heard the same evidence. You have to hear the bulk of the
evidence for all the deaths that occurred in one incident at once, but
when you open the inquest, you can open it for each individual. Today
the trend would be to open the inquest for each individual, but of
course those were very different times and I am sure that today
coroners have moved on an awful
lot.</div><a name="09020411000097"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
102</b><b class="B"><a name="09020411000396"></a>Mr.
Howarth:</b> I still think that you have not addressed the
particular issue of the appropriateness of the way it was conducted.
The Taylor inquiry had already concluded that the cause of the disaster
was inadequate policing, yet undue attention was paid to the alcohol
intake in each individual inquest. Given that the cause of the accident
was already known, that was largely irrelevant. It is as much about the
perception of the coroner in those circumstances as about the procedure
itself.</div><a name="09020411000100"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Andr&#233;
Rebello:</b></i> That is a new point that you did not raise
before. Clearly, I cannot second-guess how a coroner would deal with
that case because that coroner is of course independent and has
judicial discretion. The safeguard&#151;Deborah Coles mentioned this
point&#151;is to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column49" />Column number: 49</div>ensure that families are enabled and represented. It might not be
popular, but when I am holding an article 2 inquest, I find it very
strange when the family might be unrepresented or represented on a
legal aid certificate, to use the old language, and the barrister is on
&#163;500, and if the prison or health services are involved, they
will be represented in the same case by top barristers on top pay, and
the state will be paying for everyone.</div>
<a name="09020411000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">If we need to
level the playing field and ensure that the coroner gets the justice
and balance right, we have to achieve a level playing field. Part of
the coroner&#146;s role is to ensure that there is a level playing
field. I am probably far more proactive when people are unrepresented
than when they are represented, in an attempt to level that field, but
if we are to deal with that issue, legal aid should certainly be
available for inquests. It is only in the individual cases when
submissions can be made with regard to the scope of the inquiry that
things you raise can be dealt with. I cannot go back in history and
deal with something that has
occurred.</div><a name="09020411000102"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
103</b><b class="B"><a name="09020411000397"></a>Mr.
Howarth:</b> All the legal aid in the world would not resolve
the problem that if a coroner starts with a particular prejudice in his
or her mind, it will affect the conduct of the
case.</div><a name="09020411000103"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Andr&#233;
Rebello:</b></i> There was and still is a right of appeal
with regard to a particular decision. I am not sure whether this is the
right forum in which to deal with that appeal. We do not have all the
facts and I cannot address the issues you are raising. I have no papers
from the case before me. I understand where you are coming from. What
you are saying is alien to my jurisdiction and to what I do. You are
more than welcome to come along and sit in at any time you
like.</div><a name="09020411000104"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Deborah
Coles:</b></i> On recognising the distress that inquests
cause to such families, we were involved with many of the families and
some of the academics involved in Hillsborough. What failed to happen
there was proper family representation and an agreement on the scope of
the inquest from the outset. That would have meant that it would not
focus on aspects to do with the insensitive treatment of those
families. In a sense, the bereaved were blamed for what happened. That
is completely
unacceptable.</div><a name="09020411000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having
said that, we have seen the same things happen in other cases. The
system works best when families are represented and when there are
pre-inquest reviews. Discussions about scope and what the inquest will
look into are then agreed beforehand. That gives lawyers representing
the families the opportunity to prepare them. Families recognise that
there will be occasions when deeply sensitive, personal and distressing
information needs to come out in public. The issue is about preparing
the families for that. The relevance of that information and how it
assists the process of finding out what happened must also come out
publicly. Ideally, it will prevent such things happening in the
future.</div><a name="09020411000106"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
104</b><b class="B"><a name="09020411000398"></a>Mr.
Howarth:</b> I have a quick point to put to Alison Cox. From
your point of view, are there any improvements that ought to be made to
these provisions? If that is a rather big question to answer today, you
may by all means submit a memorandum.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column50" />Column number: 50</div><a name="09020411000107"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Alison
Cox:</b></i> I will do that, but I do not think that the
question is too big. To me, the aspiration of the Bill is fantastic.
The revised draft has made a big difference. The whole thing is
dependent on the issue of appeal. I am aware that the appeal process is
to do with the coroner&#146;s verdict. That is important to cardiac
risk in the young and sudden cardiac death. However, point 54 suggests
that there is a wider opportunity. It is a question of the quality of
the coroner. Andr&#233; and I have had a short conversation about
this. There is a legacy of coroners embedded in the system who struggle
to keep up with the standards that we would expect in
2009.</div><a name="09020411000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
issue is how the appeal process can be facilitated for bereaved
families for whom, following a sudden cardiac death, it will take two
years to register that that person has died. I would like some kind of
evaluation or registration form that they can fill in which will feed
into the question of whether the coroner understood their situation,
was empathetic and showed sensitivities in many ways, such as how the
media were dealt with. There is enormous scope for coroners to be seen
by the families either as legends or as doing less than they could and
should have done. Whether you can use the appeals process to register
whether an inquest has been dealt with in a way that bereaved families
feel to be right is very important in overseeing the ambitions of the
service.</div><a name="09020411000109"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
105</b><b class="B"><a name="09020411000399"></a>Mr.
Bellingham:</b> I have a quick follow-up question on something
that has already been covered. Could paragraph 6(1) of schedule 4 on
action to prevent other deaths be improved where it says
that</div><a name="09020411000342"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
coroner may report the
matter&#148;</div><a name="09020411000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">when
something is revealed that gives rise to concern? Should it not be an
obligation to report the matter to a person who may have the power to
take action? Under the schedule, that person must make a written
response. What I should like to see is some follow-up, perhaps in the
form of a report to Parliament. Perhaps one of the deputy chief
coroners could have a specific role in collating such reports and
ensuring that there is follow-up and accountability. We have touched on
that matter already, but will you elaborate on how that could be
improved?</div><a name="09020411000111"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Andr&#233;
Rebello:</b></i> We could not do better than follow the
Victorian Institute of Forensic Medicine&#146;s &#147;Fatal
Facts&#148; bulletin in which all the equivalent rule 43s are pulled
together. I get a monthly communiqu&#233; from Victoria setting out
all the trends that have occurred, how they have been responded to and
things of that nature. That will cost money and will need people to
work on it. Parliament has the opportunity to invest in the
system.</div><a name="09020411000112"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
106</b><b class="B"><a name="09020411000400"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> Would that also cover cases of epidemic or
systemic problems? I am thinking of mesothelioma, and not simply cases
in which there might be some implied delinquency on the part of
anyone.</div>
<a name="09020411000113"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Andr&#233;
Rebello:</b></i> There could be a report that pulls together
inquest findings, provided that there is a requirement for the
inquisitions to be communicated not only to the registrar general
through the Register Office, but to the chief coroner, so that someone
in the chief coroner&#146;s office can write a report about inquest
trends.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column51" />Column number: 51</div><a name="09020411000114"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Deborah
Coles:</b></i> The other strength of the Victoria system is
that there is a national database of coroners&#146; inquest findings,
so that if a coroner is conducting an inquest into a restraint-related
death in custody, he or she could access the recommendations and
reports that other coroners have made.</div>
<a name="09020411000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">In response
to the question about coroners, I think that the Bill should impose a
duty on the coroner to make a report when there are issues of concern
with regard to preventing other deaths. Moreover, we need sanctions
against authorities that fail to respond to any report. There is not
much point in coroners writing reports if they are not going to get
proper responses. Likewise, we should like to see enshrined in the Bill
some kind of mechanism for the monitoring and scrutiny of such reports,
to ensure that action has been taken to address the issues that
coroners have raised. As I said to Ms Moon, that is something that is
sadly missing from the Bill and would go towards the death prevention
that we were talking about
earlier.</div><a name="09020411000116"></a>

107</b><b class="B"><a name="09020411000401"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> Is there a national IT system, or do we need one
to enable this information to be collated and
shared?</div><a name="09020411000117"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Andr&#233;
Rebello:</b></i> There is not a national IT system. Many
coroners still have manual databases. Many do not have a computer
system, but most are going towards one. There is one main system that
most coroners use. I am very enthusiastic about having a web-based
database, for which we can have a national server, mirrored several
times over, so that all coroners work to that and know, at the push of
a button, exactly where death investigations and inquest hearings are
up to at any moment in time. That will cost money. If that is provided,
there is no reason why it is not possible to introduce as soon as the
system comes in.</div>

108</b><b class="B"><a name="09020411000402"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Justice (Bridget

anything missing in the Bill or in the charter for the bereaved, or

Cox:</b></i> To reiterate, I should like to see some kind of
evaluation for the bereaved. That would liberate every bereaved person.
Perhaps we could have a tick box of four or five basic questions, which
I could submit to Bridget, and, if you can be brave enough&#151;and
this is quite a big
step&#151;</div><a name="09020411000120"></a>

me.</div><a name="09020411000121"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Alison
Cox:</b></i> An &#147;Any other comments&#148; section
would make a colossal difference. For example, a stamp addressed
envelope would provide a straightforward opportunity to find out how
the system was working for the bereaved. At the end of the day, that is
what the service is for. An &#147;Any other comments&#148; section
might be more complicated, but it would give the bereaved an
opportunity to respond. It is up to them whether they take it up. There
should not be a limitation. We cannot say that the response must come
back in six weeks; we should allow two years, for example, or perhaps
leave it open so that people can reply any time as long as they put the
date on it. That would make an enormous difference to our bereaved
families, and it is something that I would very much encourage them to
use to vocalise their feelings.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column52" />Column number: 52</div><a name="09020411000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">As you
mentioned, it is really important for people to come back and tell us
whether the service has been good, and I know that our bereaved
families would do that. It is very humbling to hear how much they
praise a coroner who has given them the opportunity to be part of that
whole service. It is also frightening to see how much of a service they
accept from a coroner who is perhaps questionably hanging on to his
place by his eyebrows.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
109</b><b class="B"><a name="09020411000404"></a>The

any of our witnesses like to make any other observations?</div>
<a name="09020411000124"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Helen
Shaw:</b></i> We welcome the charter for bereaved families.
However, under this new system we are concerned about how families will
be given access to the support and information that they need to get
through an inquest. No national service provides support to bereaved
families. Although our expertise is in deaths in custody, we provide an
information pack for people going through any kind of inquest. It was
downloaded 15,000 times from our website last year and we are a small
charity. We hope that in the new system, some thought will be given to
what support is needed by bereaved families, short of legal support. A
lot of people just need to be given guidance and information about what
is going to happen at a very distressing time in their lives. We hope
that that does not get overlooked due to the more legal issues that
arise.</div>
<a name="09020411000125"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Professor
Furness:</b></i> I was hoping to discuss the medical examiner
section of the Bill. Is this an appropriate point to raise
that?</div>
<a name="09020411000126"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
110</b><b class="B"><a name="09020411000405"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Absolutely. The fact that you have not been
asked a question about it does not mean that you cannot answer
it.</div>
<a name="09020411000127"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Professor
Furness:</b></i> We are very concerned about the way that
this has been proposed. We strongly support the medical examiner system
but it needs to bridge the health services and the coroner services. At
the moment, we are not convinced that the balance is right. As
described in the Bill, medical examiners are essentially to be
appointed by primary care trusts and will be responsible to them. There
is nothing on the face of the Bill about that linking into the coronial
system.</div>
<a name="09020411000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">I know that
concerns have been expressed about the independence of medical
examiners. I understand that, but we feel strongly that medical
examiners must have strong links to the national health service in
order to support clinical governance and ensure that they are linked in
and can feed material back to the NHS. We are not disagreeing with
that, but we had hoped for much better links to the coronial system. We
know that it is proposed&#151;although it is not in the
Bill&#151;to have a national medical adviser to the chief coroner. We
hoped that that individual could play a role in harmonising the way in
which medical examiners work, much as the chief coroner is asked to
harmonise the way in which coroners work. As we understand it, that
link has not been made.</div>
<a name="09020411000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">We also hoped
that the medical examiners would have a strong role in providing a
first line of medical advice to coroners locally, and that the two
would work together and provide a seamless system. Although that may be
expressed as a wish, it does not appear to be set 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column53" />Column number: 53</div>out in any way. As far as I can see, coroners are not involved in the
appointment or governance of medical examiners.</div>
<a name="09020411000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
practical point is that medical examiners will be doctors and the
General Medical Council will have to recertify their expertise. How is
that going to be achieved? We hoped that that would all be done through
the office of the national medical adviser to the chief coroner, but we
do not see anything that reassures us that those links and connections
will actually be made. Perhaps it does not need to be on the face of
the Bill, but that leaves me a little worried. The medical adviser to
the chief coroner will need powers to carry out the sort of roles that
we hope he will perform. If he needs powers, perhaps that should be
more explicit.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
111</b><b class="B"><a name="09020411000406"></a>Mr.
Bellingham:</b> If you look at clause 19, you will see that
the Secretary of State will be able to make a lot of regulations. In
fact, throughout chapter 2 there is a lot of talk about regulations
that can be made under statutory instruments. Maybe we have a skeleton
here, but it needs to be built on
substantially.</div><a name="09020411000132"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Professor
Furness:</b></i> I have had discussions with members of staff
in the Ministry of Justice, which, although informal, led me to believe
that this connection was not planned in those regulations. If that
position changes, I will be delighted. Perhaps it does not need to be
in the Bill; my concern is that the links need to be there and
functioning when the system is
working.</div><a name="09020411000133"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Alison
Cox:</b></i> May I make one more point, to endorse what I
said? To offer bereavement support is extremely expensive because it is
very time-consuming, and I would hate the coroners to feel that they
were going to have to offer extra services of that sort to the family.
I did not mean that when I said that things could be improved in the
coroner service. To further Helen&#146;s point, the families could be
referred to the appropriate support groups for that
service.</div><a name="09020411000134"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
112</b><b class="B"><a name="09020411000407"></a>Jenny
Willott:</b> A lot of the changes to the certification of
death and so on have come in the trail of the Shipman case. Are you
satisfied that the proposals in the Bill do enough to solve the
problems highlighted in that
inquiry?</div><a name="09020411000135"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Professor
Furness:</b></i> I think that the development of the medical
examiner system would do more to prevent or at least catch early the
next Harold Shipman than all the work that the British Medical
Association is doing on medical re-certification, and it would cost a
lot less. I am strongly supportive of that, but I remain concerned that
there is the potential for generating great variation across the
country in how these people work, because of the lack of an overall
management system, and I would like to see that
resolved.</div><a name="09020411000136"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
113</b><b class="B"><a name="09020411000408"></a>Jenny

clearer national

Boswell:</b> On the certification points, you referred to the
quinquennial certification of competence by the GMC as being welcome in
general terms, but you emphasised the different weight you gave to the
importance of that matter. What I am not clear about is whether you
were saying that under the present concept the GMC would look at the
person&#146;s competence as a doctor rather than as a registered
medical officer dealing with a particular case in connection with
coroners, and that the specific expertise would not be examined
sufficiently.</div><a name="09020411000143"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Professor
Furness:</b></i> If I understand you correctly, in specific
relation to the Shipman case, Harold Shipman was an intelligent doctor
who was much liked by his colleagues. It was the statistics that should
have caught him much earlier, because he was doing his own

118</b><a name="09020411000413"></a><b class="B">Dr.
Brian Iddon</b> (Bolton, South-East) (Lab): May I ask the same
witness how much attention he thinks we should give to providing the
medical examiner with detailed accounts of what
medication&#151;whether legal or controlled drugs&#151;the person
was on immediately prior to death, bearing in mind that quite a number
of people now purchase their drugs through the
internet?</div><a name="09020411000147"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Professor
Furness:</b></i> I have been involved with staff in the
Department of Health and with the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges in
drawing up proposals for training medical examiners and for the
procedures that they will in general terms be expected to follow. We
have anticipated that they should have complete access to the medical
records and details of any prescribed drugs. In relation to access to
details of other sorts of drugs, if you are referring to illicit drugs
being involved in the cause of death, the medical examiner should
surely refer such a case immediately to the coroner and not try to
investigate it him or herself. Similarly, if a noxious substance may
have contributed to someone&#146;s death, the medical examiner should
not be examining that case&#151;it should be passed to the coroner,
and I suspect Mr Rebello would agree with
that.</div><a name="09020411000148"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Andr&#233;
Rebello:</b></i> This is a separate point but I would be
grateful if the professor would comment. I heard of a case the other
day where a family were disgruntled and dismayed. A relative had died,
and after the medical practitioner had written the cause of death down
on the death certificate, the family pushed for a post mortem. There
was one, which revealed a different cause of death. However, the
registrar could not change the original cause of death on the
certificate; he could only add an annexe or an addendum. The family
have told 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column55" />Column number: 55</div>me that that has caused great distress, because the post mortem revealed
that he died of a particular cause. It just completely staggers them
that the change cannot be made on the certificate. I would be grateful
if the professor could comment. Is it something we should be looking
at?</div>
<a name="09020411000149"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Professor
Furness:</b></i> My understanding is that the proposed
reforms should resolve that sort of situation, in that the death
certificate will initially be filled out by the certifying doctor, but
will then be passed to the medical examiner for scrutiny. That scrutiny
will involve discussion with the relatives, if appropriate, so that
concerns could be raised at that point, before the certificate of the
cause of death was finalised. In terms of gathering national
statistics, there is already a route through which additional findings
as to the cause of death can be fed appropriately into the statistics.
However, I defer to your experience of what happened in terms of what
was written on the piece of
paper.</div><a name="09020411000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of
course, the other aspect is that if the relatives are concerned that
the cause of death is inaccurate, that could well be a good reason for
the medical examiner to refer the case to a coroner for appropriate
investigation, depending on the discussion that happened at the time. I
would hope that the medical examiner would be in a position to discuss,
mediate or resolve problems and avoid the whole scenario that you have
described, to the benefit of all concerned.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
119</b><b class="B"><a name="09020411000414"></a>Mr.
Bellingham:</b> That is helpful, if a certificate has already
been issued with the cause of death on it. I am talking about having
that certificate changed.</div>
<a name="09020411000152"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Professor
Furness:</b></i> In future, the certificate would not be
issued until the relatives have had the opportunity to discuss it with
the medical examiner. One of the key questions the medical examiner
will be expected to put to the relatives is whether anything on the
proposed death certificate is a
concern.</div><a name="09020411000153"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Andr&#233;
Rebello:</b></i> Coroners since 1887 have become inventive
and imaginative, because we have had to make the law fit the era in
which we work, and not Victorian times. If that scenario happened in
Liverpool, given that I am co-located with the registration service,
once a death has been registered, the registrar&#146;s rules say that
the registrar can only put a marginal note in if there is a correction.
What I would do in those circumstances is hold an inquest after
ordering the post mortem and before getting the result. I would then
use the result to conclude the inquest, and a new death certificate
would supersede the old one. That is possible now, and it would be even
more possible with the Coroners and Justice Bill. Those sorts of
practices will be one way to fix an error, if the registration system
is not changed so that errors of that nature can be
altered.</div><a name="09020411000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is no point in giving a family an old death certificate with lines
drawn through it and marginal notes around the outside. The family want
&#147;the&#148; cause of death, not &#147;any&#148; cause of
death. It is fixable now, certainly in my jurisdiction, because of the
resources that Liverpool gives me, because I am co-located with the
registration service, and because you can be imaginative by ordering
the post mortem, not knowing the cause of death and opening an inquest.
You then get the cause of death and conclude the inquest. It is a
fiction, but it is a way of correcting the death certificate. That will
be possible in the future.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column56" />Column number: 56</div><a name="09020411000155"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Deborah
Coles:</b></i> Can I just mention something that Andr&#233;
touched on earlier, which is not in the Bill at all, namely the
question of public funding for families to be represented at inquests,
particularly in those cases involving public authorities or article 2
cases. I raise that because we welcome the fact that the Government
have recognised the rights of bereaved people through this process and
the importance of ensuring that families have access to information
about how to negotiate the coroners&#146; inquest system. But there
is nothing in the Bill about non-means-tested public funding for
families, which is in stark contrast to the situation of
Government-appointed lawyers, who represent the state at inquests all
over the country and who are paid for out of public funds. You can have
a situation such as Andr&#233; described where you have counsel
representing the state interests, while the family are unrepresented
and alone. Although there is exceptional public funding, it is
extremely difficult for families to access. It is means-tested, which
essentially means that anyone living in London who happens to own their
own home does not qualify. That is something that causes untold
distress. We have had families who have withdrawn from an inquest,
which, after all, is what they have been given as their opportunity to
find out what happened. But they have withdrawn from the process
because it is so intrusive and bureaucratic. I urge the Committee to
give that some attention, because we feel strongly that that would go
towards making the inquest system a much better one for bereaved
people.</div><a name="09020411000156"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Andr&#233;
Rebello:</b></i> I have three short points. The first is that
I support Professor Furness with regard to medical examiners. I am sure
that the statutory instruments, regulations and guidance will ensure
that coroners are involved in medical examiner appointments, because,
unless there is a close relationship, the new system will not
work&#151;certainly the Coroners Society will make sure that it
works.</div>
<a name="09020411000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, I
have concerns regarding matters to be ascertained at an inquest in
clause 5, because the draftsman has taken the words of Lord Bingham in
the Middleton case and enshrined them in clause 5(2). If the House of
Lords or the European Court were to in future change what is necessary
for convention rights to be recognised in the inquest process, this law
will be out of date. It is far better to leave clause 5 as
&#147;how&#148;, where how means in some inquests &#147;by what
means&#148; and in other inquests &#147;by what means and in what
circumstances&#148;, if article 2 of the European convention on human
rights or other articles of the Human Rights Act 1998 are engaged, to
enable the common law to develop that area of human rights legislation.
The human rights legislation came in and by enshrining in what
circumstances in this statute, if the House of Lords found that article
2 required something different, coroners would be stuck with the
statute because of the primacy of Parliament.</div>
<a name="09020411000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
difficulty that I see is that there would then have to be a public
inquiry in each and every case to deal with the procedural obligations
on the states to comply with treaty obligations under human rights
legislation. It would be far better to leave out clause 5(2), so that
&#147;how&#148; means whatever the common law says it means for the
time being. If we are now reforming the 1887 legislation, I am fairly
sure that in 2051 the law will have developed somewhat, and I do not
think it right to tie the hands of the European Court and the House of
Lords with regard to developments.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column57" />Column number: 57</div><a name="09020411000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">At the moment,
we have a two-tier system. It may well be that one of those is the
right system for all, and it may well be that the law needs developing.
We do not know what Europe will say. I am fairly sure that Coroners
Bills are not like buses&#151;there will not be another one along in
a minute. I advise very strongly that clause 5(2) should be left out,
because this Bill complies with convention rights&#151;it says so at
the front. Therefore, &#147;how&#148; means whatever it means for
the time being.</div>
<a name="09020411000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">The other
point that I raise&#151;it is very personal to my
jurisdiction&#151;is that of anonymity and investigation provisions,
whereby justices of the peace can make a witness anonymity order. Rhys
Jones was killed in my jurisdiction, and a person has been convicted of
murder and is serving a life sentence. Had that person died in custody
before trial and had people giving evidence against him had one of
these orders made because they were members of a gang, where would I go
to hear the full evidence when I had to hear an inquest as to the means
and circumstances in which Rhys had died to give justice not only to
the family, but to the whole community? This provision was spotted in
the back of the Bill, and there has been no consultation with regard to
it. Once a justice of the peace has made that order, the criminal
process can stop for many reasons, including the accused dying or some
other reason why the trial cannot go ahead. Currently, under section
16, the coroner would resume the inquest and the coroner&#146;s
jurisdiction would hear by what means and in what circumstances that
cause of death has
arisen.</div><a name="09020411000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">Are
coroners going to be designated as people involved in public
administration, so as to be able to be given that information, if such
an order has been made? At the moment, we can deal with public
privilege immunity&#151;section 11 deals with secret inquests. There
is a sliding scale in that respect, and it is a judicial function to
decide whether such matters are heard behind closed doors and whether
some people are excluded or not excluded. In extreme cases, a full hit
will be needed, but no one has yet been able to give me one example
where that would
apply.</div><a name="09020411000162"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020411000415"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Thank you, Mr. Rebello. You have left
the Committee with a certain amount to think
about.</div><a name="09020411000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">Mr.
Rebello, Helen Shaw, Deborah Coles, Alison Cox, Professor Furness,
thank you all very much indeed for coming and for affording us the
benefit of your opinions and your experience. Parliament is indebted to
you.</div><a name="09020411000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">I

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020411000416"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I welcome Anita Coles and Isabella Sankey from
Liberty. I invite David Howarth to put the first series of questions to
you.</div>
<a name="09020411000166"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
120</b><a name="09020411000417"></a><b class="B">David
Howarth</b> (Cambridge) (LD): I want to ask about secret
inquests, data protection and the information-sharing orders in the
Bill. I invite you to give the Committee your view of clauses 11, 12
and 13 on certifying jurorless inquests.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column58" />Column number: 58</div><a name="09020411000167"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Isabella
Sankey:</b></i> We have grave concerns about the clauses 11
to 13 governing secret inquests. We regard these as breathtaking
measures, which have been reintroduced after being deleted from the
Counter-Terrorism Bill last year with very little consultation. Our
view is that the grounds on which a certification can be made have been
broadened, despite the cross-party opposition to the proposals when
they were first brought in. Our concerns about these proposals are
manifold.</div><a name="09020411000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
starting point is that we are talking about Executive control over
whether juries can be convened at inquests. We do not see any cause for
the Executive to be involved. We think that it would breach article 2,
which requires investigations to be impartial, and it would also mean
that the bereaved and the public were excluded, also breaching article
2. We do not see how the proposals could be compatible with
it.</div>
<a name="09020411000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
safeguards, there is a provision for judicial review in the Bill,
although, that was always possible under the previously drafted
provisions. As the judicial review would be on whether something was in
the public interest, we think that it would be extremely difficult to
challenge the inquest in practice. We do not regard it as a safeguard
at
all.</div><a name="09020411000170"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
121</b><b class="B"><a name="09020411000418"></a>David
Howarth:</b> On the relationship between the publicity of the
inquest, whether the family is allowed in and article 2, are there are
any circumstances in which an inquest could be held in camera or, as
the Government say, are there extreme circumstances in which it could
happen, but you believe that it needs more safeguards or
conditions?</div><a name="09020411000171"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Isabella
Sankey:</b></i><i class="I"><b class="B"> </b></i>We are saying that there are no
circumstances in which an inquest in an article 2 scenario could be
helped with a blanket prohibition on a jury. There are, of course,
measures to exclude certain bits of information from the public, from
families or from any individuals whom the coroner decides need to be
excluded in the interests of justice We do not take issue with the use
of the special measures available to coroners, but we do not see how
any of the reasons put forward justify the blanket prohibition of a
jury and the involvement of the Executive in deaths, which are likely
to be extremely politically
contentious.</div><a name="09020411000172"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
122</b><b class="B"><a name="09020411000419"></a>David
Howarth:</b> So you are distinguishing between the exclusion
of the jury and measures to keep information out of the public domain.
Those are two separate
issues.</div><a name="09020411000173"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Isabella
Sankey:</b></i><i class="I"><b class="B"> </b></i>Absolutely. In our view there
is nothing really that should distinguish the operation of
coroners&#146; courts from how juries operate in a criminal context,
where, of course, public interest immunity certificates can be issued
and there are special measures for witnesses. We have seen that
operating in the coronial system for decades, and we do not see any
arguments to justify any more exceptionality in that
area.</div><a name="09020411000174"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
123</b><b class="B"><a name="09020411000420"></a>David
Howarth:</b> What about the suggestion that juries could be
vetted, as they are in the criminal justice system, for espionage and
terrorism trials? That is a possibility under the
Attorney-General&#146;s guidelines on jury checking. Could that be
applied to the coroner&#146;s court?</div>
<a name="09020411000175"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Isabella
Sankey:</b></i><i class="I"><b class="B"> </b></i>In principle, we would not take
issue with measures that already exist in the criminal justice system
being introduced into the coronial system. We do 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column59" />Column number: 59</div>not see that there is a principled area to differentiate, as it were.
With the measures that are already possible&#151;excluding certain
persons or pieces of information&#151;we do not see why further
measures are necessary in that
context.</div><a name="09020411000176"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
124</b><b class="B"><a name="09020411000421"></a>David
Howarth:</b> Can I move on to data protection and the
information sharing aspects of the Bill? What do you think of those
information-sharing aspects? Are they compatible with human rights
protection?</div><a name="09020411000177"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020411000422"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Just before we move on to data protection, are
there any other questions relating to the first line of
questioning?</div>
<a name="09020411000178"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
125</b><b class="B"><a name="09020411000423"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> I wonder whether there is an alternative approach
to what you say, as I understand it, must include an absolute right to
have jurors and the handling of evidence within already set
precedents&#151;I think that that would be a summary of where you
are. I am relatively fresh to it, but one of my concerns is that the
Secretary of State is the certifying authority. Would it be at least a
compromise, if not a halfway house, to say that the Secretary of State
could not certify, but could apply to a High Court judge to certify
that such an inquiry was appropriate? That would be a safeguard, as it
were, so that one would not have the potential moral equivocation of
the two capacities&#151;the Secretary of State as a member of a
Government which might have authorised something which led to a death
in custody, for example, and at the same time being able to fix the
inquiry so that it would not cause embarrassment to that Government.
Could you take the decision process, if the Government think it is
essential, out of the hands of Government
itself?</div><a name="09020411000179"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Isabella
Sankey:</b></i> The involvement of the Executive in the way
that you describe would still be extremely problematic in terms of
independence. In terms of public perception, as I said earlier, we are
talking about inquests into what are often the most contentious of
circumstances&#151;where people have died at the hands of the state.
Any involvement of the Executive in trying to keep the surrounding
circumstances of those deaths secret would be hugely publicly
contentious and would have enormous implications for public trust and
public
confidence.</div><a name="09020411000180"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
126</b><a name="09020411000424"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Edward Garnier</b> (Harborough) (Con): The Secretary of State
for Justice, Mr. Straw, and, I believe, Ministers on this
Committee, have from time to time batted the matter back to those of us
concerned about the principle of these secret inquests, including
yourselves, asking what we would suggest; there must be occasions when
it is in the national interest, for one reason or another, that certain
information that might be relevant to the inquest is not disclosed to
the public, and sometimes not even to the families. Do you have a
bedrock principled objection to the types of inquest suggested under
clause 11, or may there be occasions when some form of inquiry into a
death has to be conducted without full public knowledge of what is
heard by the tribunal&#151;be that a High Court judge or another form
of
coroner?</div><a name="09020411000181"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Isabella
Sankey:</b></i><i class="I"><b class="B"> </b></i>In terms of what is currently
available under public interest immunity certification&#151;I think
that really answers the point that you are making concerning 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column60" />Column number: 60</div>knowledge of matters which are a cause of enormous sensitivity when it
comes to national security and so on. We do not see why there should be
any difference between the arrangements that are currently in place in
the criminal justice system, whereby the judiciary can hear ex parte
applications from the prosecution as to why the existence of certain
information cannot be revealed to the defence, let alone the subject
matter of that information. I do not really see a problem with keeping
certain information secret, and that can be accommodated within the
system of jury
inquests.</div><a name="09020411000182"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
127</b><b class="B"><a name="09020411000425"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> You were not in the Chamber of the House of
Commons this afternoon during Justice questions, but one of the answers
that the Secretary of State gave when Opposition Members were putting
precisely those points to him went broadly along these lines: with a
prosecution, if the Crown wanted to keep something secret and the judge
or the criminal court is not amenable to an application for PII or any
equivalent, the prosecution has the discretion not to proceed with the
prosecution. There is no such discretion with an inquest; the coroners
system requires that the death is looked into. Do you think there is
anything in that distinction, or do you think the Secretary of State is
perhaps not thinking this through carefully
enough?</div><a name="09020411000183"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Isabella
Sankey:</b></i><i class="I"><b class="B"> </b></i>I think definitely the latter.
It is completely illogical to argue that the state is entitled
potentially to breach its article 2 obligations in order to fulfil its
article 2 obligations because they have to continue with the inquest.
That argument is tautological and does not really hold up. I would also
argue that the state does not have the prerogative to stop judicial
review proceedings, where PII certificates are issued. We are talking
about exactly the same kind of scenario that you have in inquest
proceedings, so I do not think that that distinction holds any
water.</div><a name="09020411000184"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
128</b><b class="B"><a name="09020411000426"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> Have you been able to enter into any direct
discussions with officials or Government Ministers about your concerns,
other than by kindly supplying the Committee with you written
concerns?</div><a name="09020411000185"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Isabella
Sankey:</b></i> We always engage with the Government on
anything that they are bringing forward, and we try as far as possible
to offer alternatives and to get them to hear our
suggestions.</div><a name="09020411000186"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
129</b><b class="B"><a name="09020411000427"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> What has their response been to your
suggestions?</div><a name="09020411000187"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Isabella
Sankey:</b></i> I understand that, as with any Bill, there
will be a chance for amendment and a chance to look again at some of
the provisions introduced. We hope to engage further on
it.</div><a name="09020411000188"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
130</b><b class="B"><a name="09020411000428"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> But you have not had face-to-face discussions
with Ministers or
officials.</div><a name="09020411000189"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Isabella
Sankey:</b></i> Yes, we
have.</div><a name="09020411000190"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
131</b><b class="B"><a name="09020411000429"></a>Mr.

the
Bill.</div><a name="09020411000191"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Isabella

process.</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column61" />Column number: 61</div><a name="09020411000192"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
132</b><b class="B"><a name="09020411000430"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> You must be hugely confident that what you are
proposing will be included in the
Bill.</div><a name="09020411000193"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Isabella
Sankey:</b></i> We are hugely confident that there will be
enough cross-party opposition to the proposals contained in clauses 11
to 13 that we will be able to negotiate with the Government on their
proposals.</div><a name="09020411000194"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
133</b><a name="09020411000431"></a><b class="B">Mr.
David Kidney</b> (Stafford) (Lab): Are you saying that if the
stakes are extremely high&#151;for example, a person&#146;s life
depends on their identity not being disclosed, or a terrorist might
learn how to avoid detection if he learns how another person was
detected&#151;the inquest should go ahead with a jury, and that the
jury would not disclose such information to anyone at the end of the
inquest? Or are you saying that there are sufficient safeguards for
such information to be kept from the jury? I am not clear on that
crucial
point.</div><a name="09020411000195"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Isabella
Sankey:</b></i> Absolutely. Often there are very high stakes
in such proceedings. Our point is that safeguards are already in place
to ensure that certain individuals are not identified and
that various bits of information are kept from the jury or the public
when such inquests are held. In fact, it was in the case of
McCann and others <i class="I">v. </i>United Kingdom that article 2 obligations
in circumstances where somebody has died at the hands of the state were
first developed by the European Court of Human Rights. In that case, an
inquest had taken place and certain information about the security
personnel involved in what was, ultimately, the killing of suspected
IRA terrorists was kept from the jury. There were no problems in that
case in respect of how the inquest had proceeded. Article 2 obligations
were fulfilled, people&#146;s identities were protected, and the
balancing act was achieved under the current inquest
system.</div><a name="09020411000196"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
134</b><a name="09020411000432"></a><b class="B">Mrs.
Moon</b><b class="B">:</b> I would like to ask a question about a
situation that is not at all politically contentious. If a child dies
or a child commits an offence, their identity would be kept
confidential in the court proceedings. The media would be excluded from
the court and would not be able to report on their identity. Families
have told me about being extremely distressed when their child&#146;s
death was reported in the media. Do you think there could be a scenario
in which families could request that confidentiality in respect of
reporting be upheld in a coroner&#146;s hearing in a case where a
child has
died?</div><a name="09020411000197"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Isabella
Sankey:</b></i><i class="I"><b class="B"> </b></i>I do not see any problem with
family involvement or the opportunity for families to make
representations. In fact, although we object strongly to clauses 11 to
13, as I have outlined, we welcome the way in which the Bill recognises
the involvement of the bereaved with the charter and so
on.</div><a name="09020411000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
kind of judgments where confidentiality is at stake are often best left
for judicial control. Judges can undertake a balancing exercise in the
interests of justice and decide whether certain pieces of information
about the identity of the person or the circumstances in which they
died should be revealed and how much information should be given. Such
matters should be assessed on a case-by-case basis and coroners should
have
discretion.</div><a name="09020411000199"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
135</b><b class="B"><a name="09020411000433"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> I am grateful for these exchanges. Given my lay
status, could you walk me through the situation that might apply? We
know that there is sensitive information, and that there may be
individuals whose 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column62" />Column number: 62</div>identity is sensitive and may be more readily protectable, but, of
course, the evidence is important. If it is under a public interest
immunity certificate, depending on the nature of that certificate, it
will not be disclosed to the jury. If that is the case, how can the
jury come to a verdict if they have not heard all the evidence? I take
it&#151;I am trying to complete my own thought process&#151;that in
a criminal case, a judge will have heard that information and will
incorporate it into his or her summing up to the jury. In a
coroner&#146;s inquiry, there is obviously a slightly different
procedure. That would concern me not least because we still
have&#151;and the Bill will provide for&#151;vested rights for some
non-judicially qualified coroners to continue. Perhaps that would not
apply in this special case because it requires the appointment of a
High Court judge. Is there a worry that you would not be able to get
the information out of protection to whoever was making the decision
with regard to the inquest? First, can you confirm that I have more or
less understood what is happening, and, secondly, give me your
assurance that it could
work?</div><a name="09020411000200"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Isabella
Sankey:</b></i> Yes, you have absolutely understood the
position. Obviously the situation in which a jury is not able to have
access to all the information is not a perfect scenario for an inquest
to take place. The key to reflecting the lack of knowledge of the jury
is in the verdict and the way in which it is phrased. That brings me on
to some of our other concerns about the Bill, which include allowing
for short verdicts to continue. In our experience, narrative
verdicts&#151;particularly in situations in which the state has been
implicated or responsible for the death of a person&#151;are a lot
more satisfactory for the bereaved and really help with their sense not
necessarily of closure but that justice has been done and that their
hurt has been recognised. In the situation that you are talking about,
a narrative verdict given by a jury could state that not all the
information was put to them or that certain things were excluded. That
could be an exercise that is negotiated between a coroner and a
jury.</div>

Prentice:</b> Going back to clauses 11 to 13, I disagree with
your description of it being exactly the same as a criminal case. I
fundamentally disagree with you that a coroner&#146;s inquest could
be treated in exactly the same way and that PII certificates could be
used. Given that two inquests are stalled because of sensitive
information, are you saying that there is never an occasion when that
can happen, or do you accept that there is a problem, but disagree with
the way in which we are trying to fix
it?</div><a name="09020411000202"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Isabella
Sankey:</b></i> We disagree with the way in which you are
trying to fix it. I do not have the details of the two cases that you
are talking about to hand, but I imagine that they might potentially
involve the use of intercept evidence, and that might be one of the
reasons why they are being stalled. I understand that under clause 15
of the Bill, although the bar on intercept is being removed in the case
of inquests, the general bar remains. The removal of that bar would do
a lot to allow inquests containing sensitive information to go ahead.
We would argue that public interest immunity certificates could enable
that material not to be compromised. We fundamentally disagree that the
Executive should be involved in certifying that juries should not sit
on a particular inquest along the lines of a principled opposition to
the responsibility of the state under article 2. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column63" />Column number: 63</div>The Government are extremely hopeful in the explanatory notes. They say
that they do not imagine the court will find a breach of article 2. I
find it impossible to understand how article 2 would not be breached
under the provisions that are included in the

Sankey:</b></i> Without knowing who you are talking about, it
is difficult to say. Given the concerns that the Government have, it
seems that the Government want to have some sort of control in vetoing
juries. So, whether it is an application to a judge or not, we do not
see how the removal of juries in article 2 cases could ever be
compliant. I guess that the involvement of the Executive is one of two
principal concerns, along with the public scrutiny that is also
required under article 2. So, Executive involvement and the lack of any
kind of public scrutiny in the process would be the two principal
concerns.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
144</b><b class="B"><a name="09020411000445"></a>David

order.</div><a name="09020411000222"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Anita

proposed in the Bill.</div>
<a name="09020411000223"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020411000446"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I am sorry. Can I ask you to move up to the
microphone? It is awfully difficult for the <i class="I">Hansard</i> reporter if
you do not move up to the microphone.</div>
<a name="09020411000224"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Anita
Coles:</b></i> We are concerned about this broad
information-sharing power. The way that it is drafted at the moment is
that it enables any person to share any information, which not only
includes personal data but other data such as company information,
simply by ministerial order. Basically, we feel that that could
override all the protections contained in the Data Protection Act.
There is the ability for the order to modify any enactment, which
basically means the ability to amend or appeal any Act of Parliament by
ministerial order. We think that the use of secondary legislation in
this way is problematic and that secondary legislation can enable the
overriding of protections that are currently contained in the Data
Protection Act, and potentially enable the overriding of the Human
Rights Act.</div>
<a name="09020411000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are
concerned about the breadth of the order. Many aspects of
people&#146;s lives are included in personal data: medical
information, DNA, genetic information, company records, personal
confidential information. The order can override, remove or modify any
prohibition or restriction on the sharing of information. Potentially,
that could include confidential information, common law protections and
professional privilege&#151;there is no end to the possibilities. On
the face of it, the way it is drafted, there are no restrictions in any
way apart from that of securing a Government policy objective, which
could be anything. It must be proportionate, but only proportionate to
that objective, so there is not a proportionality argument generally.
It must also strike a fair balance between the public interest and the
interests of the persons affected, but that balances the greater good
against the single individual. It is always hard to show that the
single individual overrides the public interest, but there is the
aggregate as to how many people are affected.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column65" />Column number: 65</div><a name="09020411000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are not
opposed to data sharing because there are instances where it is
enormously important, but the Data Protection Act seeks to ensure that
there are safeguards surrounding this. The Human Rights Act is also
important&#151;article 8, the right to privacy. If you wish to be
able to share information that you obtained for a different purpose you
should, through an Act of Parliament, say exactly what your purpose is,
because on the face of it we do not know. We do not know if it is a
purpose that fits within the exceptions, in order to be compliant with
article 8. If the Government want to share the information in this way,
they should set it out in an Act of Parliament, explain fully and have
a parliamentary debate as to why it is
needed.</div><a name="09020411000227"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
145</b><b class="B"><a name="09020411000447"></a>David

entirely changing the purpose for which the data were
collected.</div><a name="09020411000228"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Anita
Coles:</b></i> Yes. The whole purpose, I think, of this order
is to override the principles in the Data Protection Act. One of the
principles is that if data are obtained for a particular purpose, they
should not be shared for other purposes. We think that a lot of the
objectives could be met through consent, so if a person consents to
information being shared in this manner, that is perfectly acceptable.
If they do not consent, Parliament needs to explore fully the options
of how it could be
shared.</div><a name="09020411000229"></a>

146</b><b class="B"><a name="09020411000448"></a>David
Howarth:</b> The Thomas and Walport report said that there was
an argument, which they have accepted, for a fast-track way of allowing
data sharing in some circumstances. Do you think that what is in the
Bill can be cured by being tightened up or do you think that it is
inherently
bad?</div><a name="09020411000230"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Anita
Coles:</b></i> We do not see having secondary legislation
amending primary legislation as a way of achieving the outcomes. We
disagree with the recommendation in the first place, but we also think
that this has not implemented fully what they recommended. They said
that it was to be in exceptional circumstances, with more limits
involved. We disagree that there should be a mechanism of having an
order-making power to amend primary legislation. If there is an issue,
put it in a Bill and Parliament can debate
it.</div><a name="09020411000231"></a>

147</b><b class="B"><a name="09020411000449"></a>Mr.
Bellingham:</b> Following that last question, we tend to
understand why the Government want to bring in clause 151, which does
not contain a great deal that we have problems with. Clause 152 is
extremely wide-ranging and is going to lead to a great deal of power
being given from the private sector to the public sector and vice
versa. Following on from Mr. Howarth&#146;s question,
clause 152 is long and it would be my instinct to try to strike it out
completely, but is there any way, short of that, that it could be
improved? Could it be amended in any way? One of the problems to which
Mr. Howarth alluded is that it will trigger quite a few
opportunities for statutory instruments, which cannot be amended. Is
there any way in which the clause as it stands could be improved? Would
it be your intention to suggest amendments to it, or do you take the
view that it is totally beyond the pale and needs to be struck out
completely?</div>

Coles:</b></i> We disagree with it in principle, in the sense
that allowing secondary legislation to amend primary legislation in
this way is very problematic. While, of course, anything can be made a
bit better, we disagree in principle that it should be included in this
Bill at all. There are no safeguards that I can see and the principle
behind it is just
wrong.</div><a name="09020411000233"></a>

fall-back
position?</div><a name="09020411000234"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Anita
Coles:</b></i> It is not improvable. It should not be
included in the Bill. It should be removed. It breaches article 8 in
the sense that the purposes are not set out in the Bill. We do not know
what reasons will be used for sharing this information. They are not
set out. As they are not set out, you cannot decide whether they fall
within the exceptions under article 8. Until you know those purposes,
you cannot say that something is compliant with the
article.</div><a name="09020411000235"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
149</b><b class="B"><a name="09020411000451"></a>Mr.
Bellingham:</b> To be fair to the Government, we have agreed
with them that, with regard to some categories of data, sharing is
beneficial, and our lives and the lives of our constituents could be
made better, safer, healthier and so on through the sharing of
information. It is a question of how you isolate those examples and
separate them from a mischief that could be caused by other data being
shared.</div>
<a name="09020411000236"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">A</b></i><i class="I"><b class="B">nita
Coles:</b></i> The Government already know a lot of the areas
where there is a problem. So if there is an identifiable problem, it
should be set out in the Bill so that you can see what it is, agree and
debate it and decide whether the power is necessary. The Government
should come forward and say that these are the areas where they have an
issue. If they come up with others later, they could introduce another
Act to deal with that. The Data Protection Act already has a lot of
exceptions built into it to deal with all different types of
information. We do not see why this power is necessary. Acts are
amended all the time to include information-sharing powers. We think
that if this is necessary it should continue, and privacy impact
statements should be included to see what the problems are. The issue
is that the public are not on board with what the Government want to
do, in the sense of sharing information for purposes for which they did
not provide it. They do not necessarily trust the Government to hold
their information. Allowing not just the Government but private
companies or any person at all to share their information, with no real
restrictions, is unnecessary and wrong in
principle.</div><a name="09020411000237"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Isabella
Sankey:</b></i> As my colleague, Anita, has highlighted, if
there are specific examples that the Government can identify where they
believe information sharing is required, they should bring those out in
the Bill, or another piece of legislation. They should include their
purposes, the people who would be able to share the information and all
the necessary detail, to see what the Government&#146;s intentions
are and whether they are
proportionate.</div><a name="09020411000238"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">

level and be clear. You have explained your objections in principle. Do
you also anticipate that there may be damage or difficulty in practice
if these clauses are accepted? If so, could you give us some
examples?</div>

Coles:</b></i> The problem is that we do not know what these
order-making powers will be used for. The Government say that they will
have perfectly benign purposes. That may well be the case, but
obviously if this becomes legislation it will be for any future
Government to use as they will. We do not think that order-making
powers should be given so broadly, just trusting that the Government
will use them benignly. The national identity register will come into
force soon with piles of information on people. That could be shared
with companies. You could get sharing between private companies and
between banks and credit card companies for TV licensing.
People&#146;s medical records could be shared for research purposes.
The British Medical Association has expressed its concerns about the
potential for private and confidential medical information being

151</b><b class="B"><a name="09020411000453"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> A subset of concerns exists on that matter. While
matters are within the public sector, there are certain obligations
over and above the Data Protection Act in terms of confidentiality. At
one level there is the Official Secrets Act. There are certain criminal
procedures in the Taxes Act about the disclosure of people&#146;s
personal files. Is there a danger that as this material is available to
people within the private sector under the data-sharing order, the
controls that are built into legislation would be attenuated? That is
point one. Point two is that if the information were further
disseminated within the private sector, perhaps improperly or outside
the terms of the order, it would leak out widely and become public
knowledge.</div><a name="09020411000241"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Anita
Coles:</b></i> Yes, there are protections in a lot of other
legislation but there is the power here for an order to modify any
enactment, which could mean that it could amend any other safeguards.
There is already the potential for those safeguards not to apply. We
also have problems, as we have seen, with the Government&#146;s
handling of sensitive information. We have seen losses, and the more
the information is disseminated the more potential there is for it to
go missing or for other problems to arise. We think that extending the
measure even further, including extending it to potentially require
private companies&#146; confidential commercial information to be
distributed, is not necessarily
helpful.</div><a name="09020411000242"></a>

Coles:</b></i> There is nothing to say that it could not.
Nothing in the Bill states how the order is to be monitored. The
Information Commissioner does not necessarily have any powers to
monitor the carrying out of the order and how it is effected. The code
of practice in clause 153 will not necessarily apply to the order
because the order can modify anything, including the code of

153</b><b class="B"><a name="09020411000455"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> Do you agree that behind all this stuff in part 8
to do with data sharing, there are some concerns? First, the Government
have an appalling record on the keeping of private data private. They
have lost millions of pieces of information over the past few years.
The public ought to be allowed to press the Government on
that.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column68" />Column number: 68</div><a name="09020411000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, I am
glad, Miss Coles, that you mentioned the Identity Cards Act and the
national identity register. On that Bill, in 2005-06, we had, from my
point of view, utterly fruitless discussions about the register. It
became clear that the Government would require huge volumes of private
information to be stored on that register, and that that information
would be shunted about between Government agencies and also
potentially, according to the Office of Government Commerce, between
40,000 private companies about whom the public would have no knowledge.
The movement of that information could not be audited by the public. So
here we have something that is designed for the convenience of the
Government rather than for the protection of the citizen. Do you not
see in part 8, as well as in other legislation such as the Identity
Cards Act, a rather hideous shift in the balance between the state and
the individual, a balance that we as legislators ought to be extremely
careful to
protect?</div><a name="09020411000246"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Anita
Coles:</b></i> Yes. I think that you have put it well, in
that to start with we are very concerned about data loss, the security
of people&#146;s private information and the erosions of privacy over
the past couple of years. Liberty has been concerned about the national
identity register and ID cards ever since they were proposed. We think
that they alter the relationship between the individual and the state.
There is now the presumption that we have to share all our information
rather than being able to keep something private unless it is required.
Everything has to be shared. The limits are expanding and there are
problems with how they have expanded over the past decade or so. So
this is just part of that process and we are seriously concerned about
it.</div><a name="09020411000247"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
154</b><b class="B"><a name="09020411000456"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> Do you share&#151;I think that you do&#151;my
concern that the way in which the legislation, particularly in part 8,
is constructed provides Ministers with the power to make legislation
without proper scrutiny by either House? Have you noticed the growing
habit of Government Departments to create legislation within which they
give themselves powers to create secondary legislation? Here we have a
particularly egregious example because this is secondary legislation
that amends primary legislation. Does your organisation find that
worrying?</div><a name="09020411000248"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Anita
Coles:</b></i> It is very worrying that secondary legislation
can amend primary legislation. The point is that Parliament is meant to
be involved in making legislation and that any amendments to it should
go through a proper parliamentary procedure where it is properly
debated. The use of Henry VIII clauses where primary legislation can be
amended through secondary legislation is extremely concerning. There
has been far too much of it in the last few years. Parliament itself
should be concerned about
that.</div><a name="09020411000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">Order-making
powers are used by the Executive, whereas legislation should be made by
Parliament. Obviously such measures are subject to the affirmative
procedure, but that means that Parliament cannot amend the proposed
orders. Parliament may agree with 90 per cent. of what is in the order
and not the other 10 per cent., but it has no way of amending it.
Parliament may then consider on the basis of a very short debate that
it is better just to pass the order so that certain laudable objects go
through rather than oppose it so that the matter that it is concerned
about does not. We think that Parliament should have the ability to
decide what legislation should be amended.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
155</b><b class="B"><a name="09020411000457"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> Do you also agree with me that we are highly
unlikely to see any of these orders in draft before the Bill is
enacted? We are therefore being asked to give the Government powers to
create secondary legislation to do all sorts of things that we may or
may not approve of through a procedure that we may or may not approve
of without knowing precisely what powers the Government will take unto
themselves. Is that not equally
worrying?</div><a name="09020411000251"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Anita
Coles:</b></i> The problem with having legislation that would
enable such broad-ranging powers is that you will never know what it
will be used for in the future. If it is passed, the Bill will be on
the statute book for who knows how long. You will never know what
powers will be used until the orders are made, at which point
Parliament does not have an amendment process or a full debate on the
issues involved. Even if you saw some draft orders now, it would not be
sufficient because we do not know what orders might come up in 10
years.</div><a name="09020411000252"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020411000458"></a>The
Chairman:</b> We have three minutes left of this
session.</div><a name="09020411000253"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
156</b><b class="B"><a name="09020411000459"></a>Mr.
George Howarth:</b> One of the witnesses earlier invoked
public opinion and said that they thought it was opposed in principle
to the use of data sharing. Was it Miss Sankey who said
it?</div><a name="09020411000254"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Isabella
Sankey:</b></i> We have found, as an organisation that does a
lot of work on privacy and rights in this area, that the public are
becoming more and more concerned about the way in which their
information is held by Government, who has access to it, and the
security of
it.</div><a name="09020411000255"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
157</b><b class="B"><a name="09020411000460"></a>Mr.
Howarth:</b> Thanks, that is a helpful clarification. Do you
accept that public concern about data sharing is practical rather than
a matter of principle? They are afraid that personal data will be lost,
which we have seen some examples of in Government Departments, or that
it might be used inappropriately. Do you accept that in cases where it
helps to pursue somebody involved in serious organised crime, the
public would probably take an entirely different view of the use of
data
sharing?</div><a name="09020411000256"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Isabella
Sankey:</b></i> Absolutely. The example you gave is in an
area in which information can be passed without consent. There is no
question that in certain circumstances, for the prevention and
detection of crime, information can be shared. We see that between
different policing bodies all the
time.</div><a name="09020411000257"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
158</b><b class="B"><a name="09020411000461"></a>Mr.
Howarth:</b> So it is not an absolute principle
then.</div><a name="09020411000258"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Isabella
Sankey:</b></i> Well, there is a principle that information
needs to be shared only where it is necessary and proportionate. In
that sense, the principle is
absolute.</div><a name="09020411000259"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
159</b><b class="B"><a name="09020411000462"></a>Mr.
Howarth:</b> But it is a qualified principle, is it
not?</div><a name="09020411000260"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Isabella
Sankey:</b></i> Of course, privacy is qualified, as are most
of the rights in the Human Rights Act. That does not mean that an
order-making power that asks you to rely on the Government striking
that balance themselves in any given situation without the
scrutiny  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column70" />Column number: 70</div>of Parliament will be okay. The proportionality as to when and how
information can be shared is something that must be scrutinised by
Parliament.</div><a name="09020411000261"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
160</b><b class="B"><a name="09020411000463"></a>Mr.
Howarth:</b> You put it to the Committee earlier that it is an
absolute principle.</div>
<a name="09020411000262"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Isabella
Sankey:</b></i><i class="I"><b class="B"> </b></i>Liberty would never say that
privacy is an absolute principle. We said that the public are concerned
about their privacy, which is entirely different from saying that
privacy is
absolute.</div><a name="09020411000263"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020411000464"></a>Mr.
Howarth:</b> Well, the record will show
differently.</div>
<a name="09020411000264"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020411000465"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. I am sorry to interrupt, but the
Committee has decided that this session must end at 6.15 pm. Anita
Coles and Isabella Sankey, thank you very much. The Committee has
benefited from your advice and information, and we are indebted to you.
I hope that you have a safe journey home. Can we call the next
witnesses please, as quickly as possible?</div>
<a name="09020411000349"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.15
pm</div><a name="09020411000265"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020411000466"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. Let us welcome Barbara Esam from the
National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, Martin
Narey, chief executive of Barnardo&#146;s and Peter Robbins, the
chief executive of the Internet Watch Foundation. Thank you for joining
us and giving us your time. I will ask Jenny Willott to open the
questions.</div><a name="09020411000266"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
161</b><b class="B"><a name="09020411000467"></a>Jenny
Willott:</b> I have got a couple of questions about the
provisions in the Bill that relate to child pornography and images of
child sex abuse. First, I would be grateful if one of you could tell us
what evidence there is that harm is caused by people owning
non-photographic depictions of pornography involving
children.</div><a name="09020411000267"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020411000468"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Who would you like to respond? Put a question to
somebody.</div><a name="09020411000268"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020411000469"></a>Jenny
Willott:</b> I do not mind. When there are photos of children
being abused, it is very clear that abuse has taken place and that
there is a victim. However, when it is a non-photographic image and no
direct victim has been affected, the purpose of making that illegal
would be because looking at such pictures causes some sort of behaviour
change, which then causes harm. I would be grateful if you could
provide any evidence to back that up in respect of why looking at such
pictures should be made illegal, given that there is no direct victim.
Does that make sense?</div>
<a name="09020411000269"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Martin
Narey:</b></i> That is not a subject about which I am able to
advise the Committee. I understood that I was here to speak about the
sentencing council provisions. I am afraid that I know very little
about that subject&#151;I did not expect to be asked about
it.</div><a name="09020411000270"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Barbara
Esam:</b></i> I am afraid that I am in the same position.
This is my first day back from holiday and I expected to be asked about
young witness issues. There are other people within the NSPCC who are
briefed on that, but I am not one of them. I apologise for that. I can
certainly get a written response from the
NSPCC.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column71" />Column number: 71</div><a name="09020411000271"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020411000470"></a>Jenny
Willott:</b> That would be
great.</div><a name="09020411000272"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Barbara
Esam:</b></i> I understand that there is generally considered
to be a process whereby paedophiles escalate their activities. There is
therefore a concern about that type of material, even where there is no
victim. It would be more appropriate for me to ask another member of
the NSPCC who has been dealing with that issue directly, as I have not
been.</div>
<a name="09020411000273"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
162</b><b class="B"><a name="09020411000471"></a>Jenny
Willott:</b> I have a question about the distinction between
possessing and viewing images, which is probably most relevant to
Mr. Robbins. The Bill deals specifically with the possession
of certain types of images, but as I understand it, one of the biggest
areas of development is that people can go online and view those images
there&#151;they do not necessarily have to physically possess them.
With regard to the internet, should a distinction be made, and does
that need to be clarified, so that it is possible to
prosecute?</div><a name="09020411000274"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Peter
Robbins:</b></i> The Protection of Children Act 1999 includes
the making of an image as an offence, and generally speaking the law
prosecutes people in such cases with the offence of making indecent
images of children, but that does not apply in this case because the
Government obviously intend to make possession an offence. That mirrors
the recent legislation relating to extreme pornography, as the
Government were faced with the fact that there are many thousands of
websites of that type outside the UK&#151;we very rarely find any of
those sites hosted in the UK.</div>
<a name="09020411000275"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government decided that there needs to be a strategy for dealing with
the possession of those images. That cannot be handled with a global
partnership approach for taking down and removing those images, because
in many countries hosting extreme pornography and computer-generated
images is not a crime. We do not have a partnership with other
countries that would allow us to do something about it, unlike the
indecent images, which we can do something about. That is why there is
a distinction between the offence of possession, which the Government
propose in the Bill, and the offence of making an indecent image, which
is what applies in a real
trial.</div><a name="09020411000276"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
163</b><b class="B"><a name="09020411000472"></a>Jenny
Willott:</b> If the harm is done by looking at the images, do
you have concerns that the offence will mean that people will simply
not possess the images, but would still be able to look at
them?</div><a name="09020411000277"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Peter
Robbins:</b></i> That becomes a legal argument about what is
tantamount to a possession offence on a computer device. If you keep
something you have downloaded, it becomes a possession offence and you
can be prosecuted for it. If you are accidentally exposed to it and
then delete it, that is fair enough and no one would expect you to be
prosecuted. However, if you regularly download such material and
continue to delete it, your computer history will show that and you
will be prosecuted. Constructive possession on a device can be proved
by forensic
analysis.</div><a name="09020411000278"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
164</b><b class="B"><a name="09020411000473"></a>Mrs.
Moon:</b> I have two separate questions. The first is for the
NSPCC and Barnardo&#146;s, and it relates to the deaths of children
and the capacity for coroners to exclude the media from inquests.
Parents have complained to me that if a child commits a criminal
offence, the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column72" />Column number: 72</div>details are confidential, but if they take their own life, their history
and death are exposed in the media. The parents felt that there is an
injustice in that. What is your
view?</div><a name="09020411000279"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Barbara
Esam:</b></i> The NSPCC shares that concern. We think that
families have a right to privacy in such situations. We would like the
family at least to be asked what their position is on it and to be
given an opportunity to make representations to ensure that their
details are kept
private.</div><a name="09020411000280"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Martin
Narey:</b></i> I am afraid that, once again, I do not know
enough about the issue to comment on it. It is not an issue on which we
are lobbying. Indeed, we are not lobbying on the Bill at
all.</div><a name="09020411000281"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
165</b><b class="B"><a name="09020411000474"></a>Mrs.
Moon:</b> My second question is for the IWF and relates to
encouraging or assisting suicides. You have some experience in
controlling images that appear on the internet and are one of the few
organisations dealing with matters of control of information and data
on the internet. What is your view on the legislation and how do you
see it being best
implemented?</div><a name="09020411000282"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Peter
Robbins:</b></i> I have not studied the provisions in the
Bill that relate to suicide, because I listen to other organisations,
such as Papyrus and the Samaritans, which have done a considerable
amount of work in that area. I take an interest in the work that they
do, but it is not part of our remit, which is to deal with child sexual
abuse content and obscene content. Suicide websites, however, do come
across our radar, as indeed do many other topics that relate to
illegality in connection with anorexia, bulimia and other things. We
have tried to keep a focus around illegality. We do not deal with
inappropriate content as such&#151;our remit is the
illegal.</div>
<a name="09020411000283"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
terms of suicide websites, if there are such things&#151;I have not
looked into that detail to be able to sit here and say that they would
fail the test&#151;but speaking as a representative of a notice and
take-down organisation, we are not sure that there are any of those
websites in the UK. If there were, they would be something that
internet service providers would actually take a view on and remove
anyway. If they are abroad, and I am told there may be some, then it
would be important to have a partnership with a body we could refer
things on to. We cannot issue notices to take down content in other
countries&#146;
jurisdictions.</div><a name="09020411000284"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
would be important, as it is with indecent images of children, that we
have hotlines in other countries which would mirror our legislation and
our activities, so we could have that content tackled, either by police
investigation or notice and take-down to the internet service provider
or the service provider. The issue of suicide websites and the question
whether the law is correct or needs to be clarified are important, but
I would say there are difficulties in terms of how you deal with it
outside the
UK.</div><a name="09020411000285"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
166</b><b class="B"><a name="09020411000475"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> I wonder whether I could ask Mr. Narey
about the sentencing questions, both from your current position within
Barnardo&#146;s and also from your earlier experiences as someone who
played an important role within the Prison Service. I am concerned by
the clauses in the Bill which deal with the setting up of the
sentencing council. You will perhaps realise that the sentencing
council guidelines must be followed, if this Bill goes through as
currently drafted.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column73" />Column number: 73</div><a name="09020411000286"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 107
states:</div><a name="09020411000343"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Every
court must, in sentencing an offender, follow any sentencing guidelines
which are relevant to the offender&#146;s case, and must, in
exercising any other function relating to the sentencing of offenders,
follow any sentencing guidelines which are relevant to the exercise of
the
function&#148;.</div><a name="09020411000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is then a little let-out that
states:</div><a name="09020411000344"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;unless
the court is satisfied that it would be contrary to the interests of
justice to do
so&#148;.</div><a name="09020411000288"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i>
I am sure that the Minister can cross-examine once I have finished
asking these
questions.</div><a name="09020411000289"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
does not seem to be much discretion left there, but the position
becomes in my view, more worrying when one adds clause 107 to clause
109, which deals with &#147;Resource implications of
guidelines&#148;. We are told that the council has to publish draft
guidelines under the earlier clauses. As well as issuing other
documents, the council must publish a resource assessment in respect of
the guidelines, which will deal
with</div><a name="09020411000345"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
demand for prison places, the resources required for probation
provision, and the resources required for the provision of youth
justice
services.&#148;</div><a name="09020411000290"></a><div class="hs_Para">Presumably,
those resource implications and assessments are to be published for a
purpose, namely to influence the sentencer. Do you think that this is a
proper way to construct a sentencing regime, or are you concerned about
what impact the Bill, as drafted, will have in relation to the
sentencing
council?</div><a name="09020411000291"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Martin
Narey:</b></i> My understanding of the Bill and certainly,
the intention of the working party that made the recommendations to the
sentencing council, of which Mr. Howarth and I were both
members, was very clear. Discretion should be retained and judges, in
the interest of justice, should be able to depart from a guideline for
particular reasons. However, it was considered and agreed by the
working party that the guidelines should have rather more force than
the current guidelines for the sentencing guidelines council. The
provision of discretion was central to the working party&#146;s
conclusions.</div><a name="09020411000292"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the second point, about resource implications, while I very much
welcome the conclusions of the working party, when I was a civil
servant and advising various Home Secretaries, my advice was, and the
agreements made with the previous Lord Chief Justice were, that we
should go further to restrain the use of custody. That was not
necessarily to drive the prison population down, but to put the Prison
Service in a position in which it could reasonably plan for the decent
care and perhaps even rehabilitation of those in its care. Personally,
I regret that the new council will not have to take account of the
penal and probation resources at any one
time.</div>
<a name="09020411000293"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
167</b><b class="B"><a name="09020411000476"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> I think that you know this already, but let me
say in parenthesis that I think the purpose of prison should be not
only to lock someone up for the period of the sentence, but to reform,
to rehabilitate, to educate, to get people off drugs and all the other
positive things that do not seem to happen enough in the present
overcrowded prison estate. I was very fortunate that Mr.
Howarth came with Lord Justice Gage&#151;I do not think that you were
able to come, Mr. Narey&#151;to give a presentation to the
Opposition justice team last summer, which was very useful. Are you
saying that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column74" />Column number: 74</div>what we now have in the Bill meets some of, but not all of, your hopes,
or does it contradict some of the things that you had hoped
for?</div><a name="09020411000294"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Martin
Narey:</b></i> The answer is that I think that it goes some
way towards what I would have preferred the working party to recommend.
I know your view on prisons, and I know that you consider
rehabilitation to be important. In my view, the reality is that many
people whom we send to prison go for such short periods that any form
of rehabilitation is impossible. There are others we send to prison
who, if we were using the place more coherently, would stay rather
longer to ensure that we had effected rehabilitation or at least a
reduction in dangerousness. I had hoped that the council might have
gone further and taken greater hold of those whom we send to prison, as
opposed to those whom we put on community
sentences.</div>
<a name="09020411000295"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
168</b><b class="B"><a name="09020411000477"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> Do you think that the resource assessments ought
to be studied more carefully by the Ministry of Justice than by
sentencers? It ought to provide the facilities to accommodate those who
need to go to prison and to provide the resources, through the
probation service and other community punishment sources, for those who
do not need to go.</div>
<a name="09020411000296"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Martin
Narey:</b></i> I am sure that ex-colleagues in the Ministry
of Justice will study the resource assessments carefully. Rather than
the courts or the sentencing council simply telling the Government what
resources are needed&#151;although they may still do it in future
years&#151;I would prefer that in any one period they try to manage
within the current constraints of prison and probation places. Why we
ration almost every other public service, primarily health, but we have
no rationing of penal or probation resources has always puzzled me. The
result is that prisons are considerably less effective than they might
otherwise be.</div>
<a name="09020411000297"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
169</b><b class="B"><a name="09020411000478"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> I can see that. Are you therefore suggesting that
there could be circumstances in which in year X, because of resource
constraints, for example, defendants who might have been sent to prison
the year before would not be, not because the justice of the case does
not require it, but because there is simply no room in the prison
estate? The following year, by which time another few hundred places
might have been provided to the Prison Service or there was better
provision of community punishment systems, a defendant who committed
the same offence on broadly the same factual basis could go to prison,
because the estate was in a better position to receive that prisoner.
Are we not in danger of creating a form of inconsistency in
sentencing?</div><a name="09020411000340"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent"><i class="I"><b class="B">Martin
Narey:</b></i> I understand your concern, but I am confident,
from the tone of the report and everything that the chair of the
committee said that there is an absolute determination in every
individual case to ensure that the judge or magistrate is able to take
the decision and give the sentence that they feel is
appropriate.</div><a name="09020411000298"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
greater danger is that, if sentencing guidelines do not have to pay any
attention to the resources that the Government of the day decide to
dedicate to prisons or probation, there could be a significant
dislocation.</div><a name="09020411000299"></a>

Garnier:</b> Let me give you a current example. I have been
told that magistrates in Staffordshire are not able to send defendants
on community sentence 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column75" />Column number: 75</div>programmes because they are full up. As a consequence, the magistrates
are sending to prison people who they believe ought not to go to
prison. They are sending people to prison for six-month sentences or
less when they would be better dealt with and more positively and
progressively dealt with outside prison and under the supervision of
the probation service. That is happening now. How do you think the Bill
will help to provide more
resources?</div><a name="09020411000300"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Martin
Narey:</b></i> I do not know whether it would be a matter of
providing more resources. I realise that this is politically difficult,
but I think that there is a good case for putting a limit on the amount
that we spend on prisons particularly, but also on probation. I am
genuinely staggered at that example. In my 23 years working with
offenders, I do not think that I have ever come across a situation in
which the court has given a more severe sentence because of capacity
problems. Many cases have gone the other way.</div>
<a name="09020411000301"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
remind the Committee that, until 1982, a child of 17 or under could not
be sent to a detention centre unless there was a place. The clerk of
the court phoned a detention centre every day to ask whether there was
a place. If there was not, the court did something else. The world did
not come to an end. We just accepted that we should have a limit on the
number of children in custody. I would be delighted if we returned to
that
principle.</div><a name="09020411000302"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
171</b><b class="B"><a name="09020411000480"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> I am afraid that the Staffordshire example is a
true one. In my experience sitting as a recorder in Nottingham in the
summer of 2008, instead of starting their sentences at once, those
sentenced to community sentences occasionally had to wait for three or
four months before a place on a community punishment course became
available. That creates all sorts of difficulties and prevents the
offender from having the incentive to get on with work. One can
physically see when the prison estate is overcrowded, but not when the
community punishment system is overcrowded. That is the problem that we
face.</div><a name="09020411000303"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Martin
Narey:</b></i> The answer is that you must flex resources.
That is not for me any more; three or four years ago it would have
been. The head of the National Offender Management Service or the
Justice Secretary need to ensure that resources are redistributed, so
that there are extra facilities in the community sector. It is nonsense
to send anybody to prison who the court determines is suitable for a
community
penalty.</div><a name="09020411000304"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
172</b><b class="B"><a name="09020411000481"></a>Mr.
George Howarth:</b> I have a couple of quick points before I
get on to a slightly larger issue. Do you agree that the principle of
consistency is even more important when dealing with young people than
with older
offenders?</div><a name="09020411000305"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Martin
Narey:</b></i> I
agree.</div><a name="09020411000306"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
173</b><b class="B"><a name="09020411000482"></a>Mr.
Howarth:</b> Secondly, do you agree from your experience at
Barnardo&#146;s and in previous incarnations that it is important to
have an element of predictability about not only the number of cases
going through, but the seriousness of those offences and the
sentences&#151;whether community or custodial&#151;that they are
likely to
attract?</div><a name="09020411000307"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Martin
Narey:</b></i><i class="I"><b class="B"> </b></i>Accepting that you should always
allow significant discretion for individual cases, I agree with that,
too.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column76" />Column number: 76</div><a name="09020411000308"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
174</b><b class="B"><a name="09020411000483"></a>Mr.
Howarth:</b> That leads me to a further point. Do you agree
with me that Mr. Garnier was wrong to dismiss as unimportant
the qualification that what happens must be in the interests of
justice? It is a very important qualification
indeed.</div><a name="09020411000309"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Martin
Narey:</b></i> Certainly, the working party saw it as such.
The working party was clear that there should be no restraint on an
individual judge or bench of magistrates in an individual
case.</div><a name="09020411000310"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
175</b><b class="B"><a name="09020411000484"></a>Mr.
Howarth:</b> Unless that was in the interests of
justice.</div><a name="09020411000311"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Martin
Narey:</b></i>
Yes.</div><a name="09020411000312"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
176</b><b class="B"><a name="09020411000485"></a>Mr.
Howarth:</b> Finally, can you confirm one of the conclusions
that we arrived at, which was that insufficient data are available at
the moment to enable the Ministry of Justice or anybody else to predict
with any certainty the correctional capacity, to use a phrase that my
ministerial colleague finds slightly ugly? Do you agree that there are
insufficient data to predict with any certainty what the capacity of
the Prison Service, the young offenders&#146; service, the probation
service or community sentences needs to be in 12 months&#146; time,
or two or three years&#146;
time?</div><a name="09020411000313"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Martin
Narey:</b></i> The data are imperfect and I welcome the
commitment to improve the quality of data gathering, but I think that
we have sufficient data to make a reasonable fist of judging what will
be the outcome of certain sentencing guidelines. When I was a member
not of the working party, but of the original Sentencing Guidelines
Council&#151;I am sorry, but technically, because I was a civil
servant, I was an observer on that council&#151;with the help of
statisticians from the Home Office, it was able to adjust sentencing
guidelines to try to ensure that their consequences would be neutral in
terms of prison places. It might not always have got that right, but I
think that it got it reasonably correct, and it is better, in my view,
that it does that, rather than producing guidelines that bear no
relevance to the resources that the Government of the day are able to
dedicate to prison places, for
example.</div><a name="09020411000314"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
177</b><b class="B"><a name="09020411000486"></a>Mr.
Howarth:</b> Would you agree that it is right to say that if
you do not balance the sentences that are handed out with the
correctional capacity to deliver those sentences, there should be a
safety valve somewhere in the system that inevitably leads to early
release
schemes?</div><a name="09020411000315"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Martin
Narey:</b></i> I agree with every word of that,
Mr. Howarth. Moreover, it also means that prisons cannot
achieve what they can. I spent seven years leading the prison and
probation services and failed, on any significant level, to make them
genuinely rehabilitative. I believe to this day that prisons could be
decent, caring, compassionate and rehabilitative institutions, but the
pressures of numbers invariably mean that they are failing
institutions.</div><a name="09020411000316"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
178</b><b class="B"><a name="09020411000487"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> Where do you think the pressure is currently
coming from? I fully understand that it is sensible for a Government
and a Department to know what impact sentencing is having on its prison
estate and the probation service, and I fully understand that it is
sensible for a Government to plan on the basis of evidence and sensible
projections for what will be needed 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column77" />Column number: 77</div>in years to come. You cannot just create a prison or employ 1,000 new
probation officers at the drop of a hat. But is the Bill in danger of
confusing us by bringing resource assessments into a part of a Bill
that deals with sentencing
guidelines?</div><a name="09020411000317"></a><div class="hs_Para">Is
not the resource matter something for the Executive to think about, and
is not sentencing, through the courts, to be dealt with independently
of what the resource implications are? I am not suggesting that people
should be sentenced inappropriately&#151;to come back to the
Staffordshire case, I think that that is a poor example of how we
sentence people&#151;but, surely, if the courts are to do their job
and are to have genuine discretion, the resource part of the equation
must be settled by the Government and the Executive outside the
courtroom. It is for the court to deal with the appropriate sentence,
given the resources provided for it by the
Executive.</div><a name="09020411000318"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Martin
Narey:</b></i> I do not agree with that, Mr.
Garnier. I do not understand why, in a world where we expect consultant
physicians to operate within the investment available to run the health
service and to make decisions based on clinical need where we have
waiting lists, there is no rationing whatsoever in the realms of prison
and anyone sent to prison today must be absorbed, no matter what the
consequences for the effective running of those institutions. I think
that it is for the Government to determine the resources that they will
dedicate to any public service. In this case, while having the freedom
to say that those resources are inadequate, it is for judges at any
particular time to match sentencing to those resources. I realise that
that is an unpopular view, but I believe that we would have a much more
effective criminal justice system if we had that in
place.</div><a name="09020411000319"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
179</b><b class="B"><a name="09020411000488"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> I do not mind if it is unpopular; I just want to
see how it will work. If it is unpopular and it works for the benefit
of the public and the criminal justice system and for the betterment of
offenders, so much the better. Can you give me one or two practical
examples of how you see it working, because I appreciate that,
traditionally, courts sentence people irrespective of available
resources and leave it to the Government to find, or not, the requisite
places. How do you see a judge in Kingston Crown court in outer London
sentencing on the basis of a resources estimate?</div>
<a name="09020411000320"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Martin
Narey:</b></i> The guidelines would give the judge or
magistrate some direction about what appeared to be the proper sentence
in a particular case. They would adjust it, depending on the
circumstances, and the working party carefully avoided recommending any
rigid sentencing grade. I do not shy away from the fact, however, that
the judge should be influenced by what the Sentencing Guidelines
Council considers appropriate in a particular case, and I think that,
to some extent, there is a chance of depoliticising sentencing. For
example, last year in England, we sent into custody 820 children aged
12, 13 and 14. It would have been illegal to send 760 of them into
custody in 1995, so why we feel it necessary to do that now is beyond
me. A good sentencing guideline would make it plain that the sentencing
to custody of children as young as that should be wholly
exceptional.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
180</b><b class="B"><a name="09020411000490"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Yes. I hesitate to interrupt any line of
questioning, because hon. Members are here to ask questions, but we
have less than 15 minutes left. There will be a Division at 7
o&#146;clock and two witnesses have scarcely had the chance to say
anything at all. Mrs. Esam and Mr. Robbins,
without asking you to make lengthy statements, I propose that if you
wish to draw any matter quickly to the Committee&#146;s attention,
you had better do so. If there is time, I shall then revert to
questioning.</div>
<a name="09020411000323"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Barbara
Esam:</b></i> I would like to mention a couple of matters
regarding vulnerable and intimidated young witnesses. I was pleased to
see the provisions on young witnesses. A review of child evidence was
announced back in December 2004, following the launch of the NSPCC
report, &#147;In their own words: the experiences of 50 young
witnesses in criminal proceedings&#148;, which involved speaking
directly to young witnesses. Out of the review, several recommendations
were made, and these provisions were among them. A consultation paper
was issued in June 2007, called &#147;Improving the criminal trial
process for young witnesses&#148;, which came out of the 2004
steering group. The results of, and responses to, the consultation
paper have yet to be published, however, and I do not understand why,
given that it has been such a long time since the response period
closed. That is one point.</div>
<a name="09020411000324"></a><div class="hs_Para">My second
point relates to a disappointment about one recommendation that was
made by the steering committee, by the Pigot report back in 1989 and by
the &#147;Speaking up for Justice&#148; report, which the then Home
Office prepared. The recommendation was to introduce a provision that
would allow young witnesses to give their cross-examination by visual
recording, away from the court setting, and it has been around since
1989, following the recommendations of Judge Pigot. The Bill was an
opportunity at least to pilot the provision, but I recognise that it is
not a straightforward or easy piece of legislation. In fact, it is
already in legislation, but section 28 of the Youth Justice and
Criminal Evidence Act 1999 has never been implemented, and we are
disappointed.</div><a name="09020411000325"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having
spoken to a number of young witnesses for the report that was published
in 2004 and for a report that is about to be published&#151;we
interviewed nearly 200 witnesses across the country&#151;we feel that
such legislation would be a very positive step for them. I am
disappointed that there is not an opportunity to pilot it as a
possibility.</div><a name="09020411000326"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Peter
Robbins:</b></i> In terms of the possession offences, the IWF
does not have a role in relation to suspects or potential offenders who
may be in possession of such images. That is a law enforcement
responsibility. However, the definitions are important to us, if there
were any websites hosted in the UK that depict non-photographic images.
We urge the Committee to ensure that the law is very clear on that
subject. The clearer it is, the easier it is for everybody who has to
work with
it.</div><a name="09020411000327"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
number of websites that are hosted abroad of a cartoon fantasy in
computer generated imagery-style is significant. Therefore, the number
of people who can download such images is significant as well. Cartoons
and fantasy stuff are the sorts of images that children can access
rather easily. Again, there is an implication for the criminalisation
of young people. Should they be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column79" />Column number: 79</div>looking at cartoons, they could find themselves in areas in which there
are particularly graphic and sadistic cartoon
images.</div><a name="09020411000328"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
181</b><b class="B"><a name="09020411000491"></a>Jenny
Willott:</b> You have said that you would like the law to be
as tight as possible and the definitions to be really clear. Are there
any definitions in the Bill that you do not think are clear enough and
that you would like to see tightened
up?</div><a name="09020411000329"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Peter
Robbins:</b></i> I understand that the desire of Government,
in this instance in particular, is to catch content at the upper end of
sadistic levels. There are examples of images that we have
seen&#151;the Committee is welcome to see them as well&#151;where
it is not clear whether or not they would fail the current test,
because they show people in preparation for sex with a child depicted
in a CGI image. The way in which it is described in the legislation is
about sexual intercourse. There are acts preparing for and afterwards.
There is a grey area in the middle involving the types of images that
we can show the Committee, where you can see the difficulties in making
a judgment, if such images were hosted in the
UK.</div><a name="09020411000330"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
182</b><b class="B"><a name="09020411000492"></a>David
Howarth:</b> I want to come back to Mr. Narey on
one point. It is about how this works rather than what its purpose is,
although it is related to the purposes. The Bill quite rightly says
that in drawing up the sentencing guidelines, one of the things that
the council has to have regard to is the relative effectiveness of
sentences in preventing reoffending. Mr. Michael and I share
the view that in a way the most important aspect of sentencing is that
reoffending is reduced, and I think that you implied something similar
in your remarks. Therefore, what works is very important. What I cannot
see is how that feeds into the sentencing ranges that the council will
be asked to produce. From clause 103, it appears that they will be
about the offender&#146;s culpability in committing the offence and
the harm caused or intended to be caused by the offence, rather than
the capacity of the sentence to improve the likelihood of the offender
not offending in the future. How is it envisaged that restorative
justice, for example, in which I am very interested, would fit into the
guidelines?</div><a name="09020411000331"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Martin
Narey:</b></i> My understanding, which is limited on this, is
that effectiveness is to be taken into account, but it is acknowledged
that the potential for rehabilitation is not the only purpose of
sentencing. Punishment and deterrence are also important, and the court
will always take them into
account.</div><a name="09020411000332"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
understanding is that once the requirements of punishment and
deterrence are met, effectiveness will have some significance. I
believe that the effect of that&#151;the way that that could
work&#151;might be a guideline that considers effectiveness. There is
not much difference between, say, an eight-year sentence and a six-year
sentence. Given that very short custodial sentences are almost always a
waste of time and resources, a community 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column80" />Column number: 80</div>sentence would be better. However, I accept entirely that there will
always be some individuals who are sent to prison with short sentences,
because the court primarily wants to deal with the need for punishment
and
deterrence.</div><a name="09020411000333"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
183</b><b class="B"><a name="09020411000493"></a>David
Howarth:</b> Is there not a danger in the way in which clause
103 is designed that what you just described will be built into the
system? In that case, the court will, in effect, be required to look
first at pseudo-deterrent but ineffective sentences and not at
sentences which do not have a particular metric of more or less, like
restorative justice, but which will protect the public better in the
long term, because they will reduce
reoffending?</div><a name="09020411000334"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Martin
Narey:</b></i> I am not a sentencer, but I think that that is
how sentences are approached right now. The court has to look first at
the need for punishment and deterrence, and what is appropriate for the
crime based on the damage caused to the victim and so on. Only then can
it look at effectiveness. In my view, that still leaves a considerable
amount of scope for prison sentences in particular that might allow
prisons to be used rather more constructively and thereby make a much
bigger impact on
crime.</div><a name="09020411000335"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
184</b><a name="09020411000494"></a><b class="B">Alun
Michael</b> (Cardiff, South and Penarth) (Lab/Co-op): I very
much share David Howarth&#146;s concerns, and I wonder whether you
can help us. It appears that we will have a sentencing council that
will be dominated by court experience and legal expertise rather than
by what works. Can you make any suggestions about how we might persuade
the Government to deliver into that mix people who can focus on
outcomes rather than
processes?</div><a name="09020411000336"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Martin
Narey:</b></i> There might be an easy solution. When the
original Sentencing Guidelines Council was created, there was a great
deal of sensitivity about my joining it, because I was a civil servant
and a non-judicial member. The previous Lord Justice got around that
very easily by inviting me and occasionally others to be full members
of the council, but, technically, as observers. I hope that on this
occasion somebody who is able to give serious advice on the
effectiveness of alternative sentences will be able to take part;
otherwise, I fear that we will get into a situation where sometimes the
potential impact of very short sentences, for example, may be
overestimated.</div><a name="09020411000337"></a>
