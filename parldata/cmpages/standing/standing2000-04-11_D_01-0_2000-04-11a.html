<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department </B>(Mr. Mike O'Brien): I beg to move,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>That, during proceedings on the Race Relations (Amendment) Bill [Lords], the Committee do meet on Tuesdays at half-past Ten o'clock and at half-past Four o'clock and on Thursdays at Ten o'clock and at half-past Two o'clock.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is a great pleasure to welcome you, Mr. O'Hara, as Chairman of this Committee, and Mr. Sayeed, your co-Chairman. If you and he find the Committee's proceedings tedious or prolonged you can exchange seats. However, I expect our proceedings to be neither prolonged nor tedious. The issues involved are of great importance and there should be a fair amount of agreement across the Committee. Under your firm hand and tutelage, we should engage in a speedy but considered exploration of the issues. Despite the shared support for the broad thrust of the Bill, it must be discussed carefully.
<P>
It gives me great pleasure to be associated with the Bill, which is short but of great significance. It is the first major updating of our race relations legislation for almost 25 years and it implements a key recommendation of the Stephen Lawrence inquiry report. We will need adequate time to discuss that and I hope that the sittings motions will be broadly acceptable. It suggests that we sit at 10.30 am and 4.30 pm on Tuesdays and at 10 am and 2.30 pm on Thursdays. That will allow us to discuss a number of important issues that impinge on the Bill, especially the Government's equality statement of 30 November 1999, which set out our intention to transform Britain into an inclusive, prosperous society, in which equality of opportunity becomes a reality for all.
<P>
All our public institutions should be free from discriminatory procedures and practices and should set the pace in the drive towards equality. We want to show how we seek to achieve that. The Bill is a significant part of our programme in terms of introducing the right legislative and administrative framework. It sends the clearest possible message that discrimination by public authorities, as in other spheres, is unacceptable and will not be tolerated.
<P>
We will have to discuss the original main purposes of the Bill. First, it extends the provisions of the Race Relations Act 1976 to discrimination and victimisation by public authorities. Secondly, it makes chief police officers vicariously liable for racial discrimination by police officers. Thirdly, it amends an exemption for acts done for the purposes of safeguarding national security. Hon. Members will be aware that we are also committed to an additional purpose--an enforceable statutory duty on public authorities to promote race equality. I hope that the sittings motion will also allow us to discuss that.
<P>
The first purpose that I set out is achieved by inserting new sections 19B, 19C and 19D into part III of the 1976 Act. New section 19B will make it unlawful for a public authority to discriminate against or victimise a person on racial grounds in carrying out any of its functions. It will apply to all functions of specified public authorities that are not already covered by the existing provisions. Therefore, law enforcement, whether by the police, local authorities or tax inspectors, will for the first time be subject to our discrimination laws and the Committee will need to examine the implications of that.
<P>
Certain public appointments, too, will for the first time be subject to discrimination laws, as will the activities of immigration and nationality staff when they exceed what is expressly authorised by statute or Ministers. The core functions of the Prison Service and the probation service will also be covered, as will the implementation of the Government's economic and social policies. The Bill is broad and the Committee will want time to consider it.
<P>
As promised following debates in another place, the Government have tabled an amendment to include indirect discrimination in section 19B, thus further strengthening the Bill. I am sure that that proposal will be welcomed, but hon. Members will no doubt want to probe how the provision will be implemented in practice.
<P>
The second purpose of the Bill relates to the vicarious liability of chief officers of police. Under the 1976 Act, employers are held vicariously liable for the discriminatory acts of their employees. Therefore, when an employee racially discriminates against someone, the person who has been discriminated against can bring proceedings against both the employee and the employer. The employer has a defence if he took reasonably practicable steps to prevent employees from undertaking the act in question, and we shall need to examine how that operates in practice. However, police officers are office holders, not employees, and chief officers of police are not vicariously liable for the discriminatory acts of their officers. The Bill tackles that anomaly, as was recommended by the Stephen Lawrence inquiry report, by providing that chief officers of police are made vicariously liable for acts of discrimination carried out by officers under their direction and control.
<P>
The third purpose of the Bill is to amend provisions in the Act that provide that an act of racial discrimination is not unlawful if it is done for the purposes of safeguarding national security, and our sittings motion will enable us to discuss that too. Under the Act, a ministerial certificate constitutes conclusive evidence that an act was done for that purpose. However, in examining equivalent provisions in different legislation, the European Court of Human Rights found the power to issue such conclusive certificates to be incompatible with article 6.1 of the European convention on human rights.
<P>
The Bill removes that power from the Race Relations Act and amends the national security defence so that it will no longer constitute a complete defence to show that an act was done for the purposes of national security. Many issues arose in our discussion of the Human Rights Act 1998, and the sittings motion will give hon. Members the opportunity to discuss them.
<P>
The Government regard the promotion of equality as a positive way to eliminate discrimination and, in particular, what the Stephen Lawrence inquiry drew attention to as institutional racism. Setting targets for ethnic minority recruitment, retention and promotion, and guidelines for mainstreaming race equality into policy development and implementation are examples of how race equality can be promoted in public services. We have therefore tabled an amendment to the Bill, again to strengthen it further, to place a statutory duty on public authorities to promote race equality and provide for its enforcement.
<P>
I am sure that we shall have a healthy and constructive debate on all those issues. I look forward to that debate and to working with you, Mr. O'Hara, and with Mr. Sayeed, to ensure that the Bill makes a marked contribution to the legislative framework necessary to help create the inclusive society that we all want, with the public sector leading by example, as it should.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Lidington </B>(Aylesbury): First, I am pleased to echo the Minister's comments in welcoming you, Mr. O'Hara, and Mr. Sayeed to the Chair. I am sure that you will ensure that we conduct ourselves in a way that is appropriate to the seriousness of the matters under discussion and will not let us stray too far not only from the paths of virtue but from the content of the Bill.
<P>
I am content to accept the sittings motion that the Government are proposing. The Opposition share the stated objectives of the Bill to deal with discrimination against people on the grounds of race or ethnic origin. We, too, wish to see a country where all citizens, regardless of race, colour, creed or ethnic origin, have equality of opportunity and feel that they are welcome and entitled to play a full part in the main stream of every aspect of British life. As I said on Second Reading, at times the Government place too much trust in the efficacy of Acts of Parliament to change public attitudes that are perhaps more susceptible to change through evolution.
<P>
Putting that to one side for the moment, I occupied some of my time between Second Reading and the beginning of the Committee proceedings by looking at the leading cases on race relations matters. I was struck by the uncertainty of the law at present. Following a number of High Court and Appeal Court judgments, it must be unclear to those in charge of major public services which aspects of their activities are subject to the 1976 Act and which fall outside its scope. I noted that both Lord Scarman, in his minority judgment in the Amin case, and Lord Denning in his judgment in the Savjani case, said that they would interpret the 1976 Act as having a much broader scope in respect of the public service than majority opinion in the Court of Appeal or the House of Lords has been prepared to uphold. I concede that, on grounds of the need to provide certainty, there is a strong case for reconsidering this aspect of the law.
<P>
We want to explore in detail the implications of the Bill for the practical operation of various arms of the public service--most notably the police--but also of other aspects of the public sector. We will press the  Government to explain in more detail why they have reversed the opinion that they held in the other place when defending their reluctance to include indirect discrimination into the Bill. The Liberal Democrats have been consistent on this point in both the other place and here. I find it odd that one Home Office Minister could take a firm position in resisting that type of amendment in the other place, but now that the Bill has come to the Commons, the Government have done a volte face without yet having given a detailed explanation. That is something that we want to explore in greater detail.
<P>
I also hope that at some stage the Committee can debate the relationship of this Bill and of the 1976 Act in general to the proposed European Union draft directive against discrimination. That directive may have an admirable objective, but certain aspects of it, such as the provision to reverse the burden of proof in certain circumstances in cases of alleged racial discrimination, would have a significant bearing on our domestic law and on how the Bill would be applied by the courts. I hope that we will be given the opportunity to explore that matter, too, in greater detail. We shall approach the Bill in a probing, but constructive fashion. I look forward to our debates in Committee.

<P>

<B>Mr. Simon Hughes </B>(Southwark, North and Bermondsey): I join the welcome that has been expressed to you, Mr. O'Hara. I have served under your chairmanship and I am happy to do so again. I also look forward to serving under the chairmanship of Mr. Sayeed, under whom I have not served before. I am happy to work again with the Minister whose work in such areas I pay tribute to, as I am with the hon. Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Lidington), with whom I worked for a long time in Committee on another Home Office Bill. This morning, my press office asked how many members of our home affairs team were available to undertake matters outside the Committee Corridor, the answer was none. The same probably applies to the Conservative and Labour parties, too, so the media will have to organise themselves better and do things before 10.30 am.
<P>
I welcome other colleagues to the Committee, some of whom I have not served with before. I welcome in particular my hon. Friend the Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine (Sir R. Smith)--the only Scottish member of the Committee, which reminds us that we are to discuss a United Kingdom Bill. It is principally a Great Britain Bill, but with a Northern Ireland add-on. It is important that we do not forget that such matters are as likely to arise in Scotland, Northern Ireland or Wales as they are in England or urban Britain, in particular.
<P>
We shall continue the constructive debate that we had on Second Reading and follow the work that was done in the other place. Although it is a little invidious, I wish to refer to three members of another place who worked hard on the Bill: my colleague, Lord Lester, who has huge experience in such matters, Baroness Prashar and Baroness Howells, who is a new, but much-appreciated member of the other place with great professional experience of community involvement. Their work ensured a proper debate and run around the course, as a result of which the Government have not only started with a Bill that was welcome, but one that has been strengthened. Like the hon. Member for Aylesbury, I pay tribute to them for accepting the extension of indirect discrimination to the public service as is manifested in Government amendment No. 5. We argued for such a provision and are grateful that our request has been accepted.
<P>
Given the general political assessment of such matters and from looking back at cases since 1976, I, like the hon. Member for Aylesbury, want such legislation to work well. When I was in Strasbourg, I worked on human rights cases and one issue was how to reconcile domestic legislation in any countries of the Council of Europe with the convention on human rights. One of the Committee's first debates will be on trying to ensure that the Bill will fit best with the current legislation. I pay tribute to the Government for introducing the Human Rights Act 1998, which will come into force in October. Given that it is on the statute book and coming down the track quickly towards us, there may be an opportunity for us to ensure that the Bill fits well with that Act. I ask the Committee to ensure that we end up with legislation that is accessible for non-parliamentarians, non-lawyers, employers, employees or those who simply have an interest in such matters. One of the troubles with trying to amend an Act is that one must start hunting around to see where things can fit in, like a jigsaw.
<P>
This is a welcome opportunity to debate race relations and bring legislation up to date. I am looking forward to much more constructive and less antagonistic debates in Committee than we sometimes have in Parliament on such matters. I hope that they will be a welcome escape from exchanges such as those in the House yesterday, which do not do Parliament any great credit.
<P>
I have not an antagonistic but a constructive question about the sittings motion. It is clearly sensible that we make good progress, not least because of all the other legislation that occupies our time. I am not aware that any of us are minded to take undue time over the Bill--we want to get through it as quickly as is compatible with reasonable debate. Therefore, do we need to sit on Tuesday mornings and afternoons for two sittings of two and a half hours and for similar periods on Thursdays? Now that business in the House starts at 11.30 am on Thursdays, colleagues have difficulties trying to reconcile obligations, questions, business questions and debates. I should be happy if that matter could be considered.
<P>
It might be for the convenience of the Committee to agree a point by which we hope to finish. My hon. Friend the Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine and I would be happy to do that; we would prefer it. It would be in everyone's interests, as it would help us all prepare more, so that we can be more focused on coming issues. I offer that opportunity to our Conservative and Labour colleagues and, if it is taken up, perhaps we can have only one sitting on a Thursday. The Committee could discuss which, but the option might be to sit at something like 2.30 pm or after business questions have finished. It might be more convenient for some hon. Members--colleagues from outside London, especially those from Scotland--to sit on Thursday morning, rather than Thursday afternoon.
<P>
In the spirit of conciliation and practical co-operation, I would be grateful if the Minister would respond to the proposition that we agree an expected timetable outside the Committee, possibly during today and tomorrow. Some slippage must be allowed but, in broad parameters, that would be sensible. Colleagues--not only Front Benchers, but Back Benchers from both sides of the Committee--should be able to say, "I am troubled about that, so can we spend more time on it?" We could manage a three-sittings-a-week timetable and still get the Bill on the statute book, having sent it back to the Lords, in good time for it to come into force.
<P>
With those comments, my colleague and I look forward to a purposeful and constructive debate on an extremely important piece of legislation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> First, I shall deal with the question about the sittings motion asked by the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey (Mr. Hughes). I can always remember the Bermondsey, but not Southwark, North.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> We have changed the name three times.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Yes. The time that we sit will to some extent be a matter for the usual channels to discuss. I note that most of the amendments have been tabled by the Liberal Democrats rather than the Conservatives or ourselves, so I suspect that we shall be in their hands in terms of making progress. Our objective is to deliver the Bill in good shape and good time for its debate on Report. Providing that we make constructive progress, I am sure that the usual channels will be able to work out the detail of when we need to sit, bearing in mind issues such as local government elections and the Easter break, so the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey can proceed with matters via the usual channels.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I am happy to do so. I assume that the Minister is implying that if it can be accommodated to meet everyone's convenience, including the Chairman, a three-sitting-a-week arrangement with a timetable might theoretically be possible.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I am fairly relaxed about that, provided that we can discuss the Bill constructively. That would be a matter for the Committee. Our obligation is to ensure a good Bill within good time; an end date would assist in that process.
<P>
Briefly, on the matters raised by the spokesmen for the Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives, I am grateful for their broad indications on the principles, which we will need to explore during the debate. We will no doubt examine issues such as the draft directive and the ways in which indirect discrimination can be brought within the Bill--and the reasons why we believe that that should happen. We were given the clear view that that would cause difficulties for certain policy areas; we explored<P>
the question with various Departments. It quickly became clear that in practice it would not cause the difficulties anticipated and that the legal theory would not--as so often--add up to the practice. Departments are already pursuing policies that comply with our proposals and are not discriminating indirectly, even in terms of positive discrimination. We therefore looked at the detail of the legal argument and listened carefully to the arguments of those in the other place.
<P>
I join the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey in congratulating the members of the other place to whom he referred, particularly Baroness Howells, whom I know well and who made quite an impact shortly after entering the Lords--as we who know her expected she would. They persuaded us of the need for change.
<P>
We have also introduced a statutory duty to promote race equality, which was another area in which the Bill could be strengthened. I am sure that with the assistance of my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary, Privy Council Office--whom I also welcome on behalf of the Government--and under your tutelage, Mr. O'Hara, we will make good progress.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Resolved,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>That, during proceedings on the Race Relations (Amendment) Bill [Lords], the Committee do meet on Tuesdays at half-past Ten o'clock and at half-past Four o'clock and on Thursdays at Ten o'clock and at half-past Two o'clock.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that there is a financial resolution connected with the Bill, copies of which are available in the Room. I also remind hon. Members that adequate notice should be given of amendments. As a general rule, my co-Chairman and I do not intend to call starred amendments, including any that may be reached during an afternoon sitting.
<P>
Resolved,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>That the Bill be considered in the following order, namely, Clause 1, Schedule 1, Clauses 2 to 8, Schedules 2 and 3, Clause 9, new Clauses, new Schedules.<P>
