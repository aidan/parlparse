<B>Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory </B>(Wells): I beg to move amendment No. 49, in page 9, line 36, at end add 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(1A) In discharging the functions transferred to them under this section the Authority shall have regard to the principles of 
<P>
(a) accountability,
<P>
(b) transparency,
<P>
(c) the avoidance of duplication, and
<P>
(d) information exchange.".
<P>
</UL></FONT>Alert Committee members will notice that the terms of the amendment follow closely the text of the opening paragraph of the memorandum of understanding between the Treasury, the Bank of England and the Financial Services Authority. That was deliberate, because we want to put into law the non-statutory principles that are set out in a signed memorandum, which has no legal force.
<P>
The Financial Services Authority may have been created, but it has not yet been backed by an Act of Parliament. Indeed, such legislation is some way off. Much consultation is being conducted at present. We have been promised that a Bill will be drafted next year that sets up and defines the FSA. It is anticipated that the Bill will come into effect in late 1999. Given that we are about two years away from having in place a full statutory system, we want to take the opportunity provided by this Bill to put into law some defining conditions and objectives governing the supervision of banks, which otherwise would fall into the interregnum and fail to be regulated by law.
<P>
Dangers can arise. My hon. Friends have alluded to several examples of the mistakes and problems that occur in other banking and financial systems during the transfer of responsibilities from one organisation to another. Different examples of that come to mind. I have noticed, for instance, that a rail crash often occurs after signals on a stretch of track have been upgraded. Before the supposed improvements are bedded in, tested and understood by operators, there is a period of danger. I foresee that occurring with banking supervision.
<P>
Until now, supervision has been undertaken by the Bank of England. It would be first to admit that it has fallen down on occasions when regulation was less than perfect. Opposition Members do not want to obstruct genuine improvements; nevertheless, the Bank has a great deal of expertise and experience, and it has a good vantage point for carrying out the task.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ross Cranston </B>(Dudley, North): Will the right hon. Gentleman explain how the amendment fits in with part III of the Bill, which is entitled:
"Transfer of Supervisory Functions of the Bank to the Financial Services Authority".
<P>
As he rightly said, within the next two years major legislation will be in place to deal with the operation of the FSA. No one disagrees with the principles espoused in the amendment, but is it not more appropriate to deal with that issue at that time rather than now? The part of the Bill that we are discussing is concerned simply with the mechanical transfer of functions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> That was an interesting and helpful intervention. The hon. Gentleman clearly accepts the intention behind the amendment. If he can suggest a better place for it, I shall consider returning to the question on Report.
<P>
In that same spirit of helpfulness, perhaps the Economic Secretary will suggest an alternative if she finds that the amendment is defective. We are not expert draftsmen and I accept that the amendment may not fit naturally in this part of the Bill, but it must go in somewhere. This is our last opportunity to legislate on the matter. If we miss this bus, we must wait until late 1999 before an Act of Parliament governing the Financial Services Authority will come into effect. We must take action to cover those two years, but I do not claim that this is necessarily the perfect way of doing it.
<P>
I stress the dangers that we face during the changeover. The Bank of England has carried out its task honourably and, on the whole, with great skill, but it is to be transferred to the FSA. Inevitably, the FSA will not concentrate on banking supervision to the exclusion of other matters. How could it? It will have to cover the entire waterfront. That is a little unusual. For instance, in America and Germany regulatory functions are taken from the central bank, but they are not combined in a single regulatory body. Separate institutions carry out banking supervision and the supervision of other financial systems.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cranston:</B> Will the right hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> If the hon. Gentleman wishes to confirm what I have said, I shall give way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cranston:</B> I will not confirm that. It is not the case in Germany, where the regulatory authority deals with both securities and bank supervision.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> Clearly, we must refer to a higher authority. Perhaps the Economic Secretary will comment on the question. I pray in aid Professor Gowland, who has been mentioned before. I know him, because we were at university together. I believe that he once worked for the Bank of England. When I knew him as an undergraduate, his ambition was to join the Bank, but since then he has become an academic. I cannot find the exact place in the pamphlet, but I shall find it before the end of our debate. He asserts that it is unusual, and poses a risk, to proceed as the Government intend, although he concedes he makes considerable play of the fact that there are considerable advantages in combining the regulatory functions, provided that certain conditions are met.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Ruffley (Bury St. Edmunds):</B> I have found the relevant place in that pamphlet. At page 29, my right hon. Friend will discover that Professor Gowland, who may or may not have more knowledge than the hon. Member for Dudley, North (Mr. Cranston), says that in Germany the functions are separated.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> My hon. Friend helpfully points us to the page in question. I can therefore illuminate the hon. Member for Dudley, North. Professor Gowland states that in the American model,
"the banks are regulated by the comptroller of currency who is separate from the Federal Reserve system, but the rest of the financial system is regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission."
<P>
Hon. Members will be familiar with that. Professor Gowland then states that
"A similar regime prevails in Germany with a Banking and a Securities Commission being totally separate."
<P>
Either the hon. Gentleman is mistaken, or Professor Gowland is wrong. Perhaps the Economic Secretary can arbitrate over that difference of fact.
 <P>
I assert that there are dangers. I do not want to start off on the wrong foot with the Financial Services Authority. We all have high hopes that it will fulfil its admirable objectives. Perhaps it will have a different regulatory culture, possibly concentrating more on the retail than the wholesale. It might be more concerned with consumer protection that the Bank of England's more traditional approach to banking supervision.
<P>
There are pros and cons in the various approaches. However, there will be a difference: banking supervision will be part of a much larger organisation, which might become cumbersome. There is suspicion that the Government have opted for a single regulatory body, encompassing the entire financial spectrum, simply for tidiness and that there might be dangers in doing so.
<P>
We want to put those objectives into the Bill. The memorandum of understanding is an attempt to regulate the relationship between the Bank, the Treasury and the FSA. The principles referred to in the amendment accountability, transparency, the avoidance of duplication and regular information exchange should to be used not only to regulate relations between the institutions but to govern how the FSA discharges its functions. In the absence of the amendment, or something similar, no law will be approved by the House ensuring that the FSA pursues those principles until the financial services Bill arrives next year, when we can debate at greater length the duties, obligations and context in which the FSA will work.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> I support what my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory) said about the separation of banking supervisory functions from the regulation of securities and financial services. I hope that the Economic Secretary will tell us her views on that matter. However, just after the Chancellor's statement of 20 May, the chairman of the European Credit Rating Agency IBCA said that the proposal to merge banking supervision with securities regulation
"had not been undertaken in this shape, in any major banking centre"<P>

<P>
in the world. That goes to the heart both of what my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells said and of what I alluded to during this morning's sitting.
<P>
We must consider the logic underlying the proposal that is, that there is something inherently right and proper in stripping the Bank of its supervisory functions, duties and role, especially those under the Banking Act 1987, and giving them to a new super-Securities and Investment Board.
<P>
We should examine in a brief tour around the block, as it were the reasons why the Government have sought, in the statement of 20 May and in the Bill, to strip the Bank of its supervisory functions and why they have not sought to put the new SIB's functions a statutory footing, but prefer, for the time being at least, merely to have them enshrined in the memorandum. As my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb) said, there are grave defects in that approach. We believe it sensible and prudent to enshrine the memorandum's principles in legislation, especially as that would enable us to scrutinise them.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Cranston:</B> Can the hon. Gentleman say where the Bill states that the Banking Act 1987, which deals with the regulation of banks, will be repealed? I suspect that he will not be able to do so.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> We might find it in clause 21, which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The following functions of the Bank are hereby transferred to the Authority 
<P>
(a)its functions under ... the Banking Act 1987".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Mrs. Helen Liddell):</B> The Act is not being repealed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> Yes, but the Bank will no longer exercise its functions under that statute. No one is disputing the fact that, under the Bill, those functions will be transferred to the Securities and Investments Board. If the hon. Lady wants to challenge that, I would be delighted to hear why she believes that I am wrong. It should be perfectly clear to the Committee that clause 21(a) will strip the Bank of its supervisory powers as set out in the 1987 Act.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> As an amateur lawyer the most dangerous kind may I ask for a point to be clarified, perhaps when the Economic Secretary responds? The Committee needs to be absolutely sure that the powers under the 1987 Act that will be transferred under the clause are indeed transferable. If it is ultra vires to transfer the powers, that would create a considerable difficulty and a legal hiatus. I hope that, in framing his remarks, my hon. friend will bear that in mind.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> As always, my hon. Friend makes a telling point and I ask the Economic Secretary to give her views on it. We have a duty to examine the logic that leads the Government to propose transferring the supervisory functions of the Bank under existing legislation to the newly formed SIB and to propose that, in the interim, the relationship be governed by a memorandum of understanding, which has no statutory force.
<P>
I want to take the argument forward. On grounds of logic and practice, why do the Government want to merge the functions of supervision and securities regulation in the newly configured SIB? One reason it is an understandable one may relate to the seeming conflict that occasionally arises between the macro-economic management of monetary policy and the obligation of Governments and central banks to deliver a stable banking system.
<P>
Tietmayer and Schlesinger, the distinguished German economists, bankers and politicians, are right to argue that the British experience has been to give excessive weight to the second of those perceived obligations that the maintenance of a stable banking system is the chief object of policy management. Their argument relates to the period when the former right hon. Member for Blaby, Lord Lawson, was in control of these country's economic management. They made the observation that while he was keen to have a liberalised banking regime, it was probably at the expense of a slackness in monetary policy, given the interest rate policy that he was running. This is obviously not a party-political point or, if it is, it is not one that helps my party. There is a perceived conflict or tension between the desire for a stable banking system and the desire for a tight monetary policy that will deliver the anti-inflationary discipline that most Governments seek.
<P>
The second example is the American experience of 1982. There is perennial concern about third-party debt and the exposure that American banks have to third-world countries. The high interest rates which the American domestic economy needed at that time led to a great deal of instability. That is another example of the perceived conflict between delivering anti-inflation objectives and at the same time providing an interest rate conducive to a stable domestic banking environment. As we know, Mr. Volcker decided to relax anti-inflationary discipline in pursuit of what he perceived to be a strengthening of the domestic banking system in the United States.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman is regaling us with an interesting tour d'horizon of the banking system. I hope that he will shortly address his remarks to the four principles set out in the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> I shall indeed, Mr. Butterfill. I was coming to the point.
<P>
Those two examples illustrate the fact that such tensions are inevitable and will not be solved by the structural solution proposed in the Bill. Stripping a central bank of its supervisory function will not resolve that policy dilemma. It is often thought that a change in structural configuration will resolve that tension, but it cannot. If the Government think that stripping the Bank of its supervisory function will resolve the dilemma, they are sadly mistaken, which is why we take issue with their decision to do so.
<P>
It follows that we are concerned that the new arrangements, which are intended to achieve an improvement, will do nothing of the kind. I return to the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, who made an impassioned plea, not on a party-political basis, but on the basis that the arrangements should not be the subject of a memorandum with no statutory force. That is why we seek to enshrine the principles which I am sure every member of the Committee agrees with in statute.
<P>
An important change is being made to the character of the Bank. My hon. Friend the Member for Guildford (Mr. St. Aubyn) talked most eloquently about the supervisory function. The chief reason that the Government adduce for making the change is that it will resolve the policy dilemma that I described; the change will not achieve that result.
<P>
The amendment is important because we need to set down in statute a set of relationships that clearly define what the Bank, in its new form, is meant to be doing. The Bank will always be the lender of last resort. The problem with regulating the relationship through a non-statutory memorandum is that all sorts of complicated mechanisms will need to be put in place before the Bank can, under the new arrangements, properly supervise the banking system in this country.
<P>
Clearly, money is needed to bail out a failing bank that will always be the case. Does that mean, for instance, that large banks may ultimately require guarantees from the central bank or that larger banks that assist in the bailing out of failing banks may require extra liquidity? How is the Bank to deliver that in such a circumstance? There are all sorts of complicated mechanisms and relationships into which the Bank will have to enter in pursuit of its supervisory function. It is difficult to see how we can determine how those relationships will work without them being set in statute. It is in that spirit that I support the amendment, for the reasons that my hon. Friend and I have adduced.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cranston:</B> I was provoked into speaking by the speech of the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds (Mr. Ruffley) because I did not see how what he was saying was relevant to the amendment. The amendment enshrines certain principles and, as I said in an intervention, we would have no objection to them. However, I would have to ask the Opposition why, having enacted the Financial Services Act 1986, over the following 11 years they never took the step of introducing those principles into the Act.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> We have adduced many arguments today and the hon. Gentleman seems always to fail to grasp the point. He cannot see why our speeches are relevant to the set of amendments. To make it easy for him, I should explain that we are basically saying that this should be a matter of statute. I am sure that he can accept that. That is the burden of our argument, which he needs to address.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cranston:</B> I am not especially impressed by that. The Opposition had 18 years to enshrine the principles in legislation. We are putting them in the memorandum and, ultimately, we will have to address the issue when the Financial Services Act is amended or reintroduced. However, I should like to make a few points about what the hon. Gentleman said about the transfer of functions. That is an important issue, involving a major policy shift, and the Opposition were right to raise it. However, as the Chancellor rightly said at the time, the nature of financial institutions has changed and they are now multi-functional. It is[Mr. Cranston]
therefore more rational to try to regulate them through the one institution. Until now we have tried to do that through several institutions and there have been agreements about who might be the lead regulator in any one case. The issue of co-ordination is difficult.
<P>
There is also concern about the quality of regulation and there have been several occasions over the past decade on which that has been addressed. The Government's intention is to improve the quality of regulation and one way of doing that is by establishing a totally new institution, the FSA, which will start afresh and will develop new, improved standards of regulation.
<P>
My third point is that banking regulation has not been with the Bank of England for any length of time. Regulation was always done informally. It was not until the Banking Act 1979 that it was put on a statutory basis. So it is not as though the transfer of functions is a radically different departure from what has happened in the past. It is only over the past 20 years that bank regulation has been firmly in the hands of the Bank of England. For hundreds of years before that, it was not.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The hon. Gentleman is making a helpful speech by giving us an historical perspective. He says that bank regulation was not formally the responsibility of the Bank of England for a long period before 1979, but will he concede that, functionally, the Governor and the Bank exercised an informal and, perhaps, unofficial form of regulation on the nation's behalf for many years and centuries before that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Cranston:</B> The hon. Gentleman is partly right. However, at one stage, some banks were regulated through what is now the Department of Trade and Industry. There were special provisions in the Companies Acts whereby certain institutions had to be recognised as banks.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
This is an important policy. The Government have got it right. They acknowledge the nature of financial institutions these days and recognise that they are multi-functional. We must get the regulation correct. The memorandum of understanding rightly accepts that responsibility for financial stability should remain with the Bank. The overall stability of the financial system is always the responsibility of a central bank, and it is exercised through the lender-of-last-resort facility.
<P>
Earlier, it was pointed out that bank regulation in the United States is dealt with by a number of institutions. Because of the federal structure there, the position is even more complicated than was suggested. However, the Federal Reserve bank still has an important role for financial stability. That was demonstrated in 1987 when it provided liquidity in the economy.

<P>

<B>Mr. Geraint Davies </B>(Croydon, Central): Does my hon. Friend agree that the problem is not just with the number of institutions involved, but with the number of financial products available. They create tensions by blurring definitions. The enormous opportunities that there are to develop financial products will inevitably lead to problems in regulation if a number of institutions continue to regulate markets which are diversifying rapidly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cranston:</B> My hon. Friend makes a good point he is absolutely right. There is a blurring of financial products with loans, for example, now being sold in secondary markets. When loans are sold in secondary markets, they become more like securities. It is not possible to say that there are banks on the one side and securities activities on the other. Functions have become blurred.
<P>
I support the transfer of functions. We can look forward to more effective regulation of financial institutions.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I welcome you, Mr. Butterfill, to the Committee this afternoon. We had a lively sitting this morning in bright sunshine. You referred to the tour d'horizon that we heard from the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds, and we covered broadly similar ground this morning. It is unfortunate that the right hon. Member for Wells was not able to join us then; I am sure that he had other pressing parliamentary business to do. Many of the points the right hon. Gentleman made were discussed extensively this morning. If members of the Committee wish, I shall willingly remake the speech I made towards the end of our previous sitting. I shall do that at the drop of a hat. I brought my harp to the party, but nobody asked me to play.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> It was good, but not that good.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> The hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds is quite excited this afternoon, and, no wonder, after appearing in the gossip columns of the public prints. I would have been feeling rather excitable, too.
<P>
We did go round the houses this morning on why it was thought necessary to transfer banking supervision to the Financial Services Authority. The Bill will transfer the Bank's existing supervisory functions to the Financial Services Authority. We have already heard Second Reading speeches on the financial services Bill to be introduced next year, but today we are discussing the specific movement of the Bank of England's responsibilities for banking supervision to the Financial Services Authority.
<P>
It is impossible to disagree with the general principles of amendment No. 49. I am sure that no plagiarism is intended, but the amendment merely repeats the memorandum of understanding drafted by the three organisations involved. The memorandum ensures that the Bank, the Treasury and the Financial Services Authority co-operate over financial stability, and clarifies matters considerably. It sets out concrete measures and the implications for all three signatories in giving them effect.
<P>
Nothing will be added by incorporating the amendment into the Bill willy-nilly; it relates to some, but not all, of the functions of the parties involved. The amendment is, therefore, unnecessary. It is not clear from Conservative Members' speeches how the inclusion in the Bill of the principles proposed in the amendment will affect the discharge of the Bank's functions. My hon. Friend the Member for Dudley, North hit the nail on the head: if it is so important to enshrine these principles in statute, why did not the previous Government enshrine them in the 1987 Act, when they had the possibility of doing so?
<P>
The hon. Member for Daventry asked whether the Bank's supervisory functions were transferable. Parliament gave the powers to the Bank by statute, through the Banking Act 1987; Parliament is now, by statute, providing that the powers should be vested in the Financial Services Authority, and Parliament is supreme.
<P>
The Bill is not intended to increase the Bank's supervisory functions; it will merely transfer the existing functions. The fuller matter of financial services regulation on which I also have a stock speech is covered in our second Bill, which will introduce a wider and more coherent regime across the financial services sector.
<P>
This morning, the right hon. Member for Wells will have heard me discussing the differences between retail and wholesale regulation and the importance of getting the right balance across those sectors. I am willing to enlarge on that matter if he wishes me to do so.
<P>
The objectives of the Financial Services Authority have already been announced by the Chancellor, and will be outlined by statute. It might help the Committee if I describe those objectives. They are to sustain confidence in the UK financial sector and markets; to protect consumers, by ensuring that firms are competent and financially sound, giving their customers confidence in their integrity, while recognising that customers have responsibility for their own financial decisions; to promote improved public understanding of the benefits and risks associated with financial products; and to monitor, protect and prevent financial crime. We discussed those matters this morning.
<P>
The Financial Services Authority also has a statutory duty to be efficient and economic, and that relates to another matter that we discussed this morning the costs of financial regulation. We must ensure that the costs and the restrictions on firms are proportionate to the benefits of supervision. The authority will facilitate innovation in financial services and take into account the international nature of financial supervision and of the financial services business. We discussed those matters this morning, too.
<P>
The wording of the objectives might not be precisely that used in the Bill, but it provides a general picture. The objectives will give the new supervisor a clear sense of purpose, and provide a benchmark against which the new regulator's performance can be measured.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Wells spoke about the danger in transition of the eye being taken off the ball another issue debated this morning. The chairman of the Financial Services Authority has already dealt with that matter. Here we are dealing both with banking supervisors and supervisors from existing self-regulatory organisations who are themselves professional regulators. The suggestion that they would lose their professionalism in the interim is insulting to the great service that they provide for the community.
<P>
We had an interesting exchange about Professor Gowland's publication by Politeia. That is not a dispassionate or independent organisation, since it has more than a nodding acquaintance with Conservative Members. There is nothing wrong with that, but it is an important part of the context. Professor Gowland is also rather critical of the previous Prime Minister and the conduct of previous economic policy.
<P>
References have also been made to international examples, but we are trying to create a regulatory regime that suits the British case. We want to give Britain a competitive advantage in financial services. Yes, we learn from international examples, but at the end of the day we must establish a financial services regulator which can provide us, as I say, with a competitive advantage.
<P>
In the United States there is a wide range of authorities with responsibility for banking supervision the Federal Reserve for bank holding companies, the Office of the Comptroller for the currency of the national bank, and individual state authorities, such as state-registered banks. Indeed, the banking community in the United States has become concerned about the proliferation of regulators.
<P>
The amendment is unnecessary and I cannot commend it to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> The hon. Lady has not connected with the amendment at all. The fact that she has had two goes at it this morning and this afternoon makes that doubly disappointing. The arguments of Conservative Members have not been answered but ignored.
<P>
The hon. Lady said that the terms of our amendment closely copy the memorandum, with the implication of plagiarism. I said in my opening remarks that the words were copied from the memorandum, so the hon. Lady did not make a remark of much perception.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I was merely making the point that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. I was complimenting the right hon. Gentleman for being so respectful of our good sense in drafting the memorandum of understanding.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> That makes my point. It is precisely because we want the principles and objectives written into law that we are proposing the amendment. The hon. Lady did not discuss the interregnum between now, when the transfer from the Bank to the FSA is imminent, and two years' time when the FSA Bill comes into effect. For two years, then, the FSA will be operating without a statutory framework. That is why we want to take the opportunity to build these admirable objectives into law.
<P>
The economic Secretary read out the FSA objectives. They are fine; we have no quarrel with them. However, words are one thing and laws another. Conservative Members have learnt from experience that the Government cannot be trusted with their words. If words are enough, why have a Bill at all? The whole thing could have been achieved with a memorandum of understanding and we could have dispensed with the inconvenience of sitting here and discussing clauses. Clearly, the Government have presented a Bill because[Mr. Heathcoat-Amory]
they consider it important to define obligations and relationships in law. That is what we are asking for with regard to the important issue of banking supervision, until the Financial Services Authority can be discussed in detail.
<P>
If words are to be trusted, why did the Labour manifesto fail altogether to warn us of the system for a half independent Bank of England that the Government have set up? They concealed that intention during the general election campaign. Indeed, their business manifesto proposed a completely different structure, with an advisory committee that would not set interest rates.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Words are not enough. We require the objectives to be put into law. We are concerned not simply about the need to regulate the relationship between the Financial Services Authority, the Treasury and the Bank, but about the definition of the authority's objectives.

<P>

<B>Mr. Cranston:</B> I am completely puzzled now, because, under the Financial Services Act 1986, for which a Conservative Government were responsible, regulation was concluded, in the main, by the self-regulatory organisations. They operated under rules not law made by the self-regulatory organisations. The right hon. Gentleman says that he believes in law, not words. Can he explain that paradox?
<P>
Incidentally, one of the reasons for the new regulatory regime is that the SRO regime became a shambles, with problems of co-ordination and the need, over time, to reduce the number of organisations. However, my main point is that I am very puzzled by the right hon. Gentleman's great concern with law, when his party did nothing about enshrining the principles about which he is concerned in the relevant Act.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> The point is, as I have said, that the Government are disturbing a relationship that has worked for many years, whereby the banks were supervised by the Bank of England. In the past, that was done without statutory regulation. The Government are transferring the powers of supervision and enforcement from the Bank to the new body, which they intend should be subject to legislation. They are consulting on that matter and the memorandum of understanding refers to it. We want to adopt the Government's logic and, in anticipation of the legislation, use the first vehicle at our disposal the Bank of England Bill to specify the objectives. In that way, during the next two years, the Financial Services Authority, in so far as it undertakes banking supervision, will be guided by clear objects not in a memorandum with no legal force, but in the Act of Parliament.
<P>
That is a modest request and it fits well with the Government's proposals. It is perhaps another reason for the hon. Member for Dudley, North to vote with the Opposition on this issue, when we divide the Committee.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before we move to the next amendment, I wish to say that although I served on the Committees considering the Financial Services Act 1986 and the Banking Act 1987, with the clarity of hindsight I found today's debate illuminating.
<P>
The Committee has ranged fairly wide. I therefore remind right hon. and hon. Members of Mr. McWilliams decision this morning that, under Standing Order No. 89, there will be no clause stand part debate. We have already had a full debate, so I hope that when we come to next group of amendments, the Committee will confine itself to the content of the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 51, in page 9, line 36, at end add 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(1A) All parties to the Memorandum of Understanding of June 1997 between the Treasury, the Bank and the Authority shall have regard to the efficiency and effectiveness of the financial services sector and, in particular, to its international competitiveness; provided that the Bank shall have the primary responsibility for promoting those objectives.".
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 52, in page 9, line 36, at end add 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(1A) All parties to the Memorandum of Understanding of June 1997 between the Treasury, the Bank and the Authority shall make arrangements to gather and exchange information appropriate to the discharge of their functions.".</font></ul>

<P><ul><font size=-1>
"(1A) The parties to the Memorandum of Understanding (of June 1997 between the Treasury, the Bank and the Authority) may publish details of any service level agreements between them.".
<P></ul></font>
New Clause 2 Standing Committee on Memorandum of Understanding 
<ul><P><font size=-1>
". (1) There shall be a Standing Committee consisting of representatives of each of the parties to the Memorandum of Understanding of June 1997 between the Treasury, the Bank and the Authority, which shall meet at least on a monthly basis.
<P>
(2) The function of the Standing Committee shall be to improve liaison between the parties to the Memorandum of Understanding in their conduct of financial regulation.
<P>
(3) The Standing Committee may publish minutes of its deliberations and of any decisions relating to market support operations arising therefrom.".
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I shall be mindful of your stricture, Mr. Butterfill, although it will be easily perceived by the most acute members of the Committee, including the hon. Member for Dudley, North, that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, and that we have copied the Government's intentions as set out in the memorandum of understanding even more slavishly than on the previous occasion.
<P>
I do not want to revisit at length our debate about the principles under which the Financial Services Authority should operate and how banking supervision should be undertaken in the FSA's run up to being fully established. The amendments form a complex of points arising from the memorandum of understanding, and we wish to probe the Government a little more.
<P>
Amendment No. 51 emphasises that all parties to the memorandum of understanding should<p>
<ul><font size=-1>
"have regard to the efficiency and effectiveness of the financial services sector and, in particular, to its international competitiveness".<P>
</font></ul>
<P>
There is a saving end to the amendment, to which I shall not return, which is that<ul>
<font size=-1>
"the Bank shall have the primary responsibility for promoting those objectives".</ul></font><P>

<P>
That, too, is set out in the memorandum.
<P>
We wish to reinforce the point, which bears a modest degree of repetition, that it is most important that we do not over-regulate, especially in relation to wholesale business that is footloose and, if not conducted in London, may be conducted in Luxembourg, Dublin or even further afield. It is important that we should be able to host those services, by providing not a soft and weak regulatory structure but one that is modern, streamlined and as economical as is humanly possible. That is a shared responsibility between the Treasury, the Bank and the FSA.
<P>
I do not intend to speak further about that, except to say that we attach a great deal of operational importance to it. If the Economic Secretary has a stock speech to make or even some further remarks on the subject, we would appreciate hearing them.
<P>
Amendment No. 52 is about information exchange. At the centre of our concerns about the tripartite regulatory structure is our wish that there should be a free and full exchange of information between the parties. Again, we have debated that subject before, and it was an important element of the principles that we have just debated.
<P>
The amendment emphasises the importance that we attach to the exchange of information. I would express only one reservation, and I hope that the Economic Secretary will ponder it. Is there a level playing field between the various participants? The FSA is a non-departmental public body. It has slightly different rules from the Bank of England, which is a chartered body wholly owned by the state. The Treasury, of course, is a Government Department. We have already discussed the matter and the Economic Secretary helpfully replied about the acquisition of information.
<P>
I am anxious to ensure that each of the three parties to the memorandum can freely exchange among them information that had been properly and relevantly obtained. I do not want a different category of information that can be exchanged, which may make the flow easier in one direction than in another. It would be helpful to have the hon. Lady's reassurance on that point. It is important that all the parties have access to all relevant and necessary information to carry out their important duties.
<P>
Amendment No. 53 refers to service agreements between the parties, which are also set out in the memorandum of understanding. Such a proposal is not difficult in principle; it is sensible. If an organisation has spare resources or a particular body of expertise, it should be drawn on. An agreement should be made that such resources or expertise be used in that way, rather than creating a new body of people to undertake such functions in an unfamiliar context.
<P>
In a sense, the amendment is a probing one in respect of paragraph 19 of the memorandum of understanding, which states:<ul><font size=-1>
"service agreements will be established ... setting out the nature of the service to be provided, together with agreed standards, details of timing, charges (if any), notice periods, and so on."</font></ul>
<P>
The hon. Lady will note that our amendment is modest enough, in that instead of it using the word "shall", it uses the word "may". It would cover circumstances when the details of the agreement were fit to publish and did not relate simply to a trivial housekeeping matter or to something that was confidential. Perhaps the hon. Lady would refer to that in her response.
<P>
However, if the agreements were of public interest and there was some way of giving, for example, the Treasury Select Committee an understanding of what was going on, the nature of the agreements and whether they were reciprocal or fair, it would be helpful to all parties if details were published. One way in which to deal with that provision of information could be by a footnote in the annual accounts of the Bank of England. I leave it to the hon. Lady to decide the mode in which that can be done.
<P>
In case the Economic Secretary thinks that I have overlooked the point, I must say that I am not talking about a tripartite leg to the stool, but about relations between the Bank and the authority. We want the information to be freely exchanged and for the operation of that exchange to be flexible. The hon. Lady spoke at some length this morning about flexibility.
<P>
Although new clause 2 is slightly different from amendment No. 53, it has the same provenance. It would enshrine in statute a provision for the establishment of a standing committee. Opposition Members attach great importance to the firm establishment of working relations and that should not be dropped. Current relations between the parties may be excellent I do not ask the hon. Lady to deny or confirm that but I can imagine there being clashes of personality or difficulties arising. For example, in extreme cases, people might decline to turn up to a meeting if invited under the memorandum of understanding. I suppose that that would be a breach of an agreement, but it is not the same as a breach of law. The new clause would set in place a mechanism for regular liaison.
<P>
We want there to be a statutory monthly meeting, which is within the spirit of the memorandum. As the hon. Lady will remember from an earlier debate, we have not suggested a weekly meeting, as the court has to undertake at present. Meetings could be held more frequently, if required. Our main objective is to improve liaison. We also invite the standing committee to[Mr. Boswell]
publish minutes if it wishes to do so. Given that some information will relate to market support operations, it may not be able to do so at the time. However, it is much in the public interest that such details are published and accounted for in due course.

<P>

<B>Mr. Cranston:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman acknowledge that the exchange of information will often involve particular institutions? Would it not be disastrous for information about potential breaches of regulatory provisions to become public knowledge?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> That is precisely why the word "may" is used rather than "shall". There will be times of extreme market sensitivity, in the identification of individual institutions, for example, when it would be unhelpful and even improper for minutes to become public knowledge during the regulatory process. The regulators the Financial Services Authority and the Bank would be inhibited in the conduct of their several responsibilities if they felt that they had one hand tied behind their back because everything they did had to be made public immediately.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Earlier, we discussed the importance of privilege in a somewhat different context. To use another example, it is equally important that, when officials advise Ministers, the advice and exchanges should be confidential unless released. The Committee should at least consider whether there should be publication with the strong inference that it should be invited wherever possible where it is in the public interest and where there is no particular sensitivity over confidentiality.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman accept not only that publication of such sensitive information could lead to disruption in the market but that, if minutes are published on one occasion, failure to publish them on a future occasion could give rise to widespread speculation, which would also be disruptive? The publication of minutes, as proposed by the hon. Gentleman, would not just breach confidentiality but make the regulator into an active player in disrupting market activities.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The hon. Gentleman is imagining a somewhat implausible scenario. I have been careful to use the words "may" rather than "shall" in everything that I have said about publication. The implication is that, if it were felt helpful to publish minutes of exchanges perhaps some time after the event, although that is a separate issue they could be bowdlerised or edited to exclude particular information that is market sensitive. I am prepared to concede if this is the problem that the technical wording may not secure that.
<P>
I do not want my remarks to be construed as suggesting that there must be publication of the penetrating exchanges on the viability and conduct of particular institutions which arise in the normal process of regulation. Our concern, which lies within the spirit of the memorandum of understanding, is to ensure that minutes are published in some form wherever possible when the matter under consideration is wide and individual companies or institutions are not involved, and when publication is felt to be in the public interest so that people can have a flavour of what is going on.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman have in mind the idea of a trade-off between public interest and a permissible level of market disruption resulting from the disclosure of information? The arguments over whether the speculation or disruption was caused by the disclosure, and whether that was acceptable, would be value judgments based on the notion of public interest. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that going down that path would be an impossible strategy for regulation?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> With respect, I beg to differ from the hon. Gentleman. Unless one believes that nothing should be published, one will inevitably have to make a judgment. Like the hon. Gentleman, I suspect, I would not want to make that judgment, for exactly the reasons of sensitivity that he mentions.
<P>
I am not talking about matters that are pinnable on an individual institution. I am talking about cases that are aggregated and refer to a particular situation the collective exposure of the British banking system to potential failures in south-east Asia, for example. That is not the same as saying, "XYZ bank is in trouble and we must do something about it."
<P>
It should be open to the regulatory authority and the Bank to publish the exchanges between them where they judge that there is no likelihood of inflaming the market or threatening an individual institution, and that it would be genuinely helpful to put the minutes in the public domain. I seek no more than such a permissive power as proposed in the amendments, which I commend to the Committee. They would provide some transparency and openness, which we all want to see in principle, in the regulatory system.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick Gibb </B>(Bognor Regis and Littlehampton): This morning we were discussing at what point we should debate the contents of the memorandum of understanding. I was assured, Mr. Butterfill, by your co-chairman, Mr. McWilliam, that this would be the suitable place to do so. So as not to try your patience, or that of the Committee, I shall be brief and confine my remarks to paragraph 4 of the memorandum of understanding, which talks about the Treasury's responsibilities.
<P>
It is important briefly to debate the memorandum, because it is being brought into play by the Economic Secretary as part and parcel of the regulatory regime of the Bank of England and the FSA. I am concerned that the Government are regulating and legislating by letter and by memorandum of understanding, not by statute.
<P>
Paragraph 4 of the memorandum states:<ul><font size=-1>
"The Treasury is responsible for the overall institutional structure of regulation, and the legislation which governs it. It has no operational responsibility for the activities of the FSA and the Bank, and will not be involved in them."</font></ul>
<P>
It springs to mind that paragraph 13 to schedule 3 states:<ul><font size=-1>
"A representative of the Treasury may attend, and speak at, any meeting of the Committee" <P></font></ul>

<P>
that is, the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of England. So there will be Treasury involvement in the operational functions of the Bank of England.
<P>
To parody the Prime Minister, it is a bit rich for the Labour party to set in place a split between operational responsibility and responsibility for policy or law, because that was part and parcel of the attacks that the Labour party in Opposition made on the Government prior to 1 May on issues such as home affairs and the Prison Service. Yet in one of their first major Bills and in their memorandum of understanding the Government resort to that split between policy and operational activities.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cranston:</B> I am provoked; that is absolute nonsense. That paragraph of the memorandum simply says that the Treasury should not interfere with regulation on a day-to-day basis. That is perfectly proper; we would not expect the Treasury to become involved in the regulation of any particular bank. I return to the point that I made earlier: if what the Opposition are now proposing is such a great idea, why did not they introduce it 18 years ago?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> To answer the second point first, the reason why there was no need to enshrine such a memorandum in legislation is that, as the memorandum says in paragraph 1, it is all about the division of responsibilities between the Bank of England and the FSA. Under our Government, there was no such division of responsibilities. All the activities were conducted by one unit, the Bank of England, so there was no need to set out a division on the basis of accountability, transparency, no duplication and regular information exchange. The Government have created the need for that.
<P>
To address the hon. Gentleman's first point, the memorandum does not just cover day-to-day operations, it says that the Treasury<ul><font size=-1>
"has no operational responsibility for the activities of the Bank"<P></font></ul>

<P>
at all. It goes on to say that even if there is wider economic disruption, or if foreign relations problems arise, the Treasury should do nothing; it should wait to hear from the Bank, which will decide if the Treasury needs to be alerted. So we could be at war or have a major stock exchange collapse and the treasury would be meant to sit there and wait to be alerted by the Bank or the FSA.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I seem to remember the hon. Gentleman getting dreadfully excited the other day because clause 19 referred to emergency powers. Has he changed his mind again? Are we again seeing that consistency is the hallmark of mediocrity?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> If I am inconsistent in my attacks, it is because what I am attacking is also inconsistent. If I am attacking the same thing from a different angle, the thing itself must be inconsistent.
<P>
When the basis of all the Labour party's attacks for so long was such a division of responsibility, it is a bit rich that the Government should come along and create just that. I would appreciate a Government response to my points because they are serious. The Government are trying to legislate through memorandum and the important question of the status of the Treasury vis-\ga-vis the Bank is set out in one mediocre paragraph in the memorandum of understanding, which is not part of our legislative process or of parliamentary scrutiny.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I will put the hon. Gentleman out of his misery. He has taken up a fair amount of the Committee's time by talking about the memorandum of understanding and confusing it with the changes to monetary policy. The memorandum of understanding is about financial stability and the first part of the Bill is about monetary policy. The Monetary Policy Committee and its Treasury representative is part of the legislation that we discussed in parts I and II of the Bill. I understand that people can get confused about those matters, but it is important that we establish clearly that we are dealing with the second part of the Bill and that we are talking about financial stability.
<P>
We were talking this morning about the Governor's eyebrows I am now wary about your eyebrows, Mr. Butterfill and we have already made it clear that the terms of the memorandum of understanding should not be enshrined in legislation. I shall not repeat those arguments, other than to repeat that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery in that the terms of the memorandum were repeated in the amendments. The memorandum of understanding is dated October 1997, not June 1997. It would have been helpful if the Opposition had managed to get it right. I hope that the Committee will forgive me for being nit-picking about that.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> As the hon. Lady will appreciate from her experience in opposition, it is not always easy to get things absolutely right, as one hopes the Government will though they sometimes do not. Would not she agree that the outline document of the FSA has been available for some time and that the signing took place in October? We knew roughly where we were going by June.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I shall not labour the point other than to say that the memorandum of understanding was constructed in great detail and was drawn up in a very considered way in order that it could be published in October 1997.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 51 and 52 reiterate what is in the memorandum of understanding. Amendment 53 is, however, a different matter; it goes further than the memorandum. I have a more serious concern about that amendment. It would allow the publication of service level agreements between any of the three parties to the memorandum of understanding. That goes beyond paragraph 19 of the memorandum, which provides for such agreements between the Bank and the FSA. It could lead, for example, to the revealing of the provision of information technology services or premises during transition, or the provision of research and market analysis or statistical information collected under clause 17. That could be quite dangerous and leaves a balance of judgment on what it would and would not be appropriate to publish. Indeed, we could end up with a situation in which most unwelcome information had to be published or perhaps of someone making a judgment that information, such as the[Mrs. Liddell]
discretionary level of intervention that the Bank can make or the terms of borrowing foreign exchange, should be published. That would not be acceptable.
<P>
The hon. Member for Daventry talked about the exchange of information. It is important that there are equal and adequate gateways to permit co-operation and we fully accept that the three institutions must have adequate powers to gather and to exchange information. The hon. Gentleman will find that schedules 5, 7 and 8 include provisions to ensure that there are no unnecessary obstacles to the free flow of information, bearing in mind that we do not want to create opportunities for fishing exercises.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
New clause 2 fails to take into account the extent to which the three signatories to the memorandum of understanding have given great weight to its terms. Indeed, the committee's purpose is to facilitate the exchange of extensive, sensitive information about institutions the point made by my hon. Friends the Members for Dudley, North and for Croydon, Central (Mr. Davies). In certain circumstances, the committee might have to discuss covert operations that are necessary to support the market, so it would be entirely unsuitable to require publication of those deliberations. Such publication could create the instability that we want to avert and effect confidence in institutions or markets.
<P>
It is fair to say that such disclosures could be prohibited under United Kingdom or European Union law. So much information would have to be excluded that the disclosures would be worthless. Even the fact that the committee met before the normal monthly sequence of meetings could be sensitive information, which could cause instability and nervousness in the market place. Therefore, I urge the Committee to oppose this group of amendments and new clause 2.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I shall not advise my hon. Friends to press the amendment to a Division; I shall seek leave to withdraw it. However, I am disappointed in some of the Economic Secretary's remarks. We took some pains, even with our modest resources, to use the permissive "may", rather than the obligatory "shall", in new clause 2. There is a working distinction between meetings directed towards the consideration of a particular institution and those that have a public interest and might be published.
<P>
The Economic Secretary might rightly say that, subject to the rules of confidentiality, the Bank and the FSA might publish the exchanges between them. I hope that she will, at least, flag up to them that they should consider publication when it would be in the public interest and when it would not impinge on an institution's private affairs in a way that would damage confidence.
<P>
It is an example of how the official mind works that the Economic Secretary has used precisely the argument that she rejected when we used it on the weekly meetings of the Bank's court. I specifically said that there was a case for considering whether weekly meetings should be part of the schedule. If that were so, there would be no alarm if it were necessary to hold weekly meetings. The Economic Secretary has said that there would be alarm and confusion if the committee were to meet more than monthly because people would smell a rat. I shall simply say that we have had a useful debate on the relationships, which both the Government and the Opposition want to get right, between the institutions. I therefore beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 54, in page 9, line 36, at end add 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(1A)This section shall not enter into force until the Chancellor of the Exchequer has 
<P>
(a) conducted consultations with practitioners in financial services, including in particular representatives of persons carrying on retail and wholesale financial business, and published details of any representations made to him in that regard; and
<P>
(b) carried out and published an estimate of the cost to businesses of complying with the regulatory requirements of the Authority under this section.".
<P>
</UL></FONT>This amendment is about the importance not only of consultation but of compliance cost assessments being carried out and published before the clause comes into force. I know that the FSA document refers to consultation, and that consultation on some aspects of the issue is taking place. However, will the Economic Secretary tell us exactly what is being done and what will be published? Will she also assure us that consultation will be acted on?
<P>
Yesterday, the Prime Minister provided a startling example of what can happen in a consultation process. He said that the details for individual savings accounts had been published and that there would be a limit of 50,000 on what an individual could build up. After repeated questioning, he refused to budge and say any more, even though my right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition pointed out that all the information was in a consultation document. The pre-Budget was designed to be open to comment and consultation, but the Government are developing an attitude. They say, "This is what we have decided; now we are going to consult; but, whatever the result of the consultation, we shall do it anyway." That is not genuine consultation.
<P>
We want an assurance that the proposals for consultation will bear fruit, and will be acted on. That is especially important for the transfer of functions, because, as we said earlier, we are travelling without maps. It is a new departure that relates to important functions. Never before has an attempt been made to put them together under a single regulatory body. The Bank of England has a great deal of expertise in carrying them out in the traditional manner. Of course, many staff will be transferred, but a huge change will take place with large sums of public and private money being at stake. Consultation and an assessment of the costs that could be loaded on to the private sector are important, but we have yet to receive an assurance from the Economic Secretary on the scope, rigour and genuineness of the consultation exercise.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cranston:</B> Is the right hon. Gentleman aware of the consultation document entitled "Paying for banking supervision"? When will he make a submission to the FSA about a subject in which he has shown such an interest?
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I am aware of the document. Our amendment goes much wider than anything in it. I recognise that the document contains an intention to consult, and the hon. Gentleman will not surprise me if he refers to it, should he catch your eye, Mr. Butterfill. We have gone a little further than the document. We want to know that the good intentions are genuine and will be carried forward into a response by the Government and the FSA. That is why the Bill should say that the transfer will not take effect until that has been done.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick St. Aubyn </B>(Guildford): I support my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells especially on paragraph (b), which deals with the cost to business of complying with the regulatory requirements. I share my right hon. Friend's scepticism that the Government will engage in a genuine consultation process, but the amendment would make it more likely that they will do so on all the details.
<P>
The Economic Secretary has given us some pleasant reassurances this week, and they have been very welcome. Other Ministers, however, have been noticeable by their absence. It would have been a great comfort for us to know that they share the hon. Lady's views on the matter. The Chief Secretary has been unable to attend the Committee today because of a Cabinet meeting, which is entirely understandable. I presume that the Paymaster General could not be here because his detailed knowledge is confined to the banking system in Guernsey.
<P>
There is a parallel. Just as the Paymaster's family trust was driven to Guernsey by excessive taxation in Belgium, threatening his benefactor who escaped to Switzerland, so the flight of capital could mirror the flight by markets from this country to Guernsey, Switzerland or some other centre. That will happen if the costs of complying with the new regime proposed by the Government get out of hand.
<P>
The effect of paragraph (b), which provides for an estimate of the costs to be published, would be to reassure those participating in London markets that they will not face critical increases in costs, which might otherwise persuade them to move their business offshore. The amendment would ensure that the Government fulfilled the spirit of the Economic Secretary's earlier comments.
<P>
The Government seem to want to have their cake and eat it. They enjoy attacking the previous Government for setting up a self-regulatory system, but whenever they face a difficulty, they are forced back to the principles that underlined that system that everything cannot be enshrined in law and that some matters have to be left to regulation between the various participating bodies.
<P>
We have already heard the Government's resistance to incorporating a memorandum of understanding in law. If they now reject the amendment, they are saying again that they want to be self-regulated in the matter of consultation, not subject to statutory control. Our philosophy we are not trying to have it both ways before the Bill was introduced stressed a foundation of self-regulation. We now say that if we are to move from that to a statutory system, we cannot afford to be half-hearted about it.
<P>
We cannot legislate only on the easy parts after all, setting up a separate banking supervisor demands statutory provision but we need to legislate on the difficult parts. That demands spelling out the relationship between the parties to the memorandum of understanding and, subject to the clause, spelling out the obligation to consult the industry.
<P>
Conservative Members have a dilemma over the clause: the more we impose a statutory obligation to consult, the longer it will take before the measures can be brought into effect. However, we must face that dilemma and we would rather have a period of comprehensive consultation and a comprehensive Act that will set up the new regulatory regime as well as make changes to the financial services business, which, as we already know, will require another Act of Parliament.
<P>
When we debated earlier clauses we suggested a means by which the whole process could be accelerated. Our first preference with this clause is for proper consultation. Implementation of the Bill should be delayed until a date nearer the enactment of the other measures necessary to deal with financial services.

<P>

<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I thought that I understood the amendment until the hon. Member for Guildford got to his feet: now I am thoroughly confused. He may be referring to the wrong part of the Bill. He should also know that the doctrine of collective responsibility is an important part of the British constitution. If I, as a Minister, commit the government to something, I shall be in deep shtook if the Government do not agree. Perhaps I should say that I shall be in difficulty; the Hansard writers may have difficulty in working out "deep shtook", which is not a Celtic expression.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> Is the hon. Lady telling us that if any markets or banks declare that they must leave London because of the cost of the new regime, she will consider her position?
<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> The hon. Gentleman is talking baloney again. It must be getting late. We also had a wee tinge of the politics of envy, with regard to the Paymaster General, but I shall gloss over that.
<P>
I do not understand why the amendment has been tabled and I cannot accept it. The Opposition are trying to compel the Government to launch a consultation exercise now on whether to transfer banking supervision. We have already made it clear that the Bill is the right measure by which to effect the transfer, because it is the first Bank of England Bill for 50 years and the arguments for the transfer are compelling. As I have said repeatedly, we are transferring the existing structure of banking supervision.
<P>
As to the further stage of financial services regulation, extensive consultation will take place. A consultation process, begun by the Financial Services Authority, has already been referred to. It has been[Mrs. Liddell]
welcomed by practitioners in the City and in financial services. In summer 1998 the Government will launch the draft Bill, which will be subject to consultation. I have also made it clear to the various institutions connected with the financial services industry that if they want to give us advice now to guide us in drafting a Bill, we are open to suggestions. There has been a fairly steady flow of information and advice. We are anxious for a financial services regulation structure that will give us competitive advantage in the 21st century. That requires the involvement of practitioners. I always say that effective financial services regulation requires the advice of streetwise people, who know what happens and what dodges people get up to.
<P>
The cost of regulation is very important. Disproportionate cost reduces the impact of regulation and can be a disincentive to the settling of global money in the United Kingdom financial services industry. Already, the Financial Services Authority has made it clear that it will engage in full consultation about the cost of financial services. It has also made it clear that it will take into account industry's views on banking supervision.
<P>
A consultation exercise is under way at the moment on cash ratio deposits. Establishing a statutory basis in that respect means that organisations such as mutuals, which are not classed as banks but which benefit from the liquidity of the Bank of England, will be brought into the net of cash ratio deposits. It would not be appropriate for me to suggest the level at which cash ratio deposits would end up to do so would negate the point of a consultation process but it is not inconceivable that a consequence would be savings. I do not know at present.
<P>
The aspects of the matter that I have mentioned are important and the Government and the Financial Services Authority are alert to them. When my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer launched the authority at the end of October he referred to the cost of regulation. My right hon. Friend the Chief Secretary said in this Committee that<ul><font size=-1>
"We are conscious of the cost, and the Governor and Howard Davies ... are aware that the Government want to bear down on the costs." [Official Report, Standing Committee D, 20 November 1987; c. 76.]<P></font>
</ul>
<P>
He also referred to cash ratio deposits and the supervisory fees that will be payable to the Financial Services Authority, in the hope that the overall burden in the relevant sector would be no heavier than it is at present, and preferably lighter.
<P>
I have answered the points made by hon. Members. I cannot see the point of the amendment and I urge the Committee to resist it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> In the light of the assurances given, or hinted at, by the Economic Secretary, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Clause 21 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Clause 22 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Schedule 4</center></H4>
<H4><center>Transfer of functions: supplementary provisions</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That this schedule be the Fourth schedule to the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I rise briefly to reassure the Committee that the Opposition even look into the small print. The devil is often in the detail, and I notice that we have four Government amendments on the selection list. That reflects the fact that amendments and corrections have to be made right up until the last moment, despite the best endeavours of the parliamentary draftsmen. Neither the Economic Secretary nor I can put our hands on our hearts and claim that schedule 4, or schedule 5 which changes the enactments are absolutely right. There is always the danger that something has been overlooked.
<P>
I want to make two points in relation to schedule 4. The first is about the transfer of property, rights and liabilities. There is no reference in the provisions to the publication of any relevant material. I appreciate that matters of commercial confidence might be involved, but given that many of the Bank's assets will pass to a new body, it is important that they should pass at a proper valuation, or that we should be aware of their status when they are passed. These matters might at least in the FSA's terms attract the attention of the National Audit Office. Will the Economic Secretary give the Committee some detail about accountability for these matters?
<P>
When a scheme of arrangement is made for the merging of two companies, there is a wealth of published material about the assets, the valuation and so forth. The companies are often advised by separate merchant banks to ensure that the arrangements are transparent, at arm's length and fair. I do not raise these points in order to trip up the Economic Secretary, but because I seek clarification.
<P>
My second point relates to schedule 4 paragraph 5(3), which refers to a rather slippery enabling provision. It states that<ul><font size=-1>
"A transaction of any description effected in pursuance of a provision included in a scheme by virtue of sub-paragraph (1)(d) or (e) ... shall have effect subject to the provisions of any enactment which provides for transactions of that description to be registered in any statutory register."<P></ul></font>

<P>
Secondly, that it<ul><font size=-1>
"shall be binding on all other persons" <P></font></ul>

<P>
this is the provision that it is at least worth pausing on 
"notwithstanding that it would, apart from this provision, have required the consent or concurrence of any other person."<P>

<P>
My concern is that some innocent third party might get trapped by these provisions. I suspect that the Economic Secretary's response will be that it would be necessary for that transaction to form part of a provision of a scheme, but I have in the back of my mind that someone may have included in the provisions of his will something on the lines of "for so long as there is a Bank of England" it might be that he felt conforted by the existence of the Bank of England. The phrase, "safe as the Bank of England" has a certain resonance; the phrase, "safe as the Financial Services Authority", however commendable, may not have the same resonance.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cranston:</B> In an attempt to be helpful to the hon. Gentleman, it may be that where there is a register of some kind that is binding because of the constructive knowledge that is imposed on outside parties, the intention here is to provide that the transfer of functions would not affect that constructive knowledge, which would still bind those other parties despite the fact that the register had been transferred. Later, we will come to the provisions about the gilts office, and so on.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> That may be helpful; I defer to the hon. Gentleman's legal expertise and am not sure that I can comment on what he says.
<P>
If I may speak from the point of view of a humble peasant, if I usually have to give consent for a transfer, the provision removes the need for me to do so. The Economic Secretary will no doubt say that that is on the purely technical grounds that in law and in private contract, for Bank read FSA; I understand what is intended. However, I might feel strongly about that not merely by accident but because of a principled dislike of the FSA, and I might not give my consent if I were asked. My right to give or withhold my consent is being taken away by statutory provision.
<P>
I assure the Economic Secretary that what I say is not intended as a raid on a small point in a schedule, but I would appreciate hearing her elucidation.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> The hon. Gentleman has an intriguing habit of asking a question and then saying what my answer will be, which is useful at this stage in the day, because it saves my voice.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman raised several interesting points, the key to which is the publication of a scheme referred to in paragraph 3 to schedule 4. If he reads paragraph 3(3), he will see that the scheme must be approved by the Treasury, and that the terms of such a scheme or agreement will be reflected in the accounts of both bodies. If he wants further elucidation on those points, I will happily write to him, so that we do not delay the Committee further.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am most grateful to the hon. Lady for that assurance. For the record, my concern is that some private arrangement outwith the provisions of a scheme might be caught up in them accidentally, because of provisions for the transfer of undertakings. That is a hypothetical question, but I would be grateful to receive the hon. Lady's assurance on that point in due course.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<P>

<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 43, in page 10, line 3, at end insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(3)If a reference in a relevant provision to the Bank is predicated on the continuing exercise by the Bank of any of the transferred functions, it shall, in relation to any time after the coming into force of this Act, have effect as a reference to the Authority.
<P>
(4)In subsection (3), `relevant provision' means a provision which 
<P>
(a)has effect before, as well as after, the coming into force of this Act, and
<P>
(b)is contained in a document other than an Act or an instrument made under an Act.".
<P>
</UL></FONT>In a strange way, the amendment may answer some of the points made by the hon. Member for Daventry in relation to schedule 4. It is a technical amendment that makes the necessary changes to the relevant statutes consequential on the transfer of banking supervision, which is the purpose of scheduled 5.
<P>
Inevitably, given the history of the Bank, there is a class of document that refers to the Bank in its current supervisory role that is not adequately covered by the Bill as drafted. Such documents, which are typically private contracts to which the Bank is not a party, refer to the Bank because it performs supervisory functions. An example would be the documentation relating to an issue by a bank of subordinated debt, where, if the debt is to count as capital for regulatory purposes, a provision will be included that the debt cannot be repayed early without the Bank's consent.
<P>
The amendment would insert two new subsections, 23(3) and 23(4), which ensure that, following the transfer of supervisory functions, such references will be read as referring to the Financial Services Authority. It is a purely technical arrangement to tidy up necessary parts of statute and I commend the amendment to the Committee.
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Again, I do not wish to make trouble for the hon. Lady she might like to reflect on what I shall say and incorporate it in her reply to the earlier point. My concern is the small one that a private document that might have nothing to do with the Bank directly, never have been near the Bank or been part of its banking supervision, could refer contingently to the Bank as a supervisory body. One could imagine a will that was written in colloquial terms which included a phrase such as, "While we still have a Bank of England which is running the finances of this country" and which might very loosely be said to have something to do with banking supervision. It could just be that if the amendment were swept up into the clause, it might trigger something that was not anticipated. I am sure that the hon. Lady does not want that to happen, and nor do I, but could she reflect on the point? We shall not oppose the amendment, but we want to ensure that it does not need a little further safeguarding at a later stage.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> By no stretch of the imagination am I a constitutional lawyer I am not a lawyer of any kind. However, I understand that the amendment would cover the very point to which the hon. Gentleman referred. If, however, consultation with the Treasury's solicitors proves that that is not the case, I will happily write to the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Clause 23, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Schedule 5</center></H4>
<H4><center>Transfer of functions: consequential amendments</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I beg to move, amendment No. 45, in page 28, leave out lines 36 and 37 and insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"38. (1)Section 101 of the Building Societies Act 1986 is amended as follows.
<P>
(2)In subsection (4), for `Bank', in both places, there is substitued `Authority'.
<P>
(3)In subsection (6) 
<P>
(a)for the definition of `the Bank' there is substituted 
<P>
`"the Authority" means the Financial Services Authority', and
<P>
(b)in paragraph (c) of the definition of `financial institution', for `Bank' there is substituted `Authority'.".
<P></font></ul>
This is another technical amendment. Because schedule 5 has an impact on several consequential amendments to other enactments flowing from the transfer of supervisory functions from the Bank to the FSA, paragraph 38 substitutes reference to the Bank of England with reference to the FSA in section 101 of the Building Societies Act 1986. However, the Building Societies Act 1997 amended that section and that also has an impact on those areas. The purpose of theamendment is to ensure that the Bank of England is substituted by the FSA in the new section 101 of the 1986 Act.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 46, in page 37, line 29, leave out "149(6)(e)" and insert "145(6)(e)".
<P>
Again, this is a technical amendment which is also very specific and which also relates to the consequential amendments. Its purpose is to correct a reference in paragraph 69(2) of schedule 5 to subsection 149(6)(e) of the Pension Schemes (Northern Ireland) Act 1993 to subsection 145(6)(e) of the 1993 Act. I commend the amendment to the Committee.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Schedule 5, as amended, agreed to.

Further consideration adjourned. [Mr. Robert Ainsworth.]

Adjourned accordingly at nineteen minutes past Six o'clock till Tuesday 9 December at half-past Ten o'clock.
