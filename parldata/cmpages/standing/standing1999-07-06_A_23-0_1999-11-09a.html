<H2><center>Standing Committee A</center></H2>


<H4><center>Tuesday 9 November 1999</center></H4>


<H4><center>(Morning)</center></H4>

<H4><center>[Mr. Peter Atkinson in the Chair]</center></H4>

<H3><center><a href="/pa/cm199899/cmbills/121/1999121.htm">Financial Services and Markets Bill</a></center></H3>

<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before we begin, I should tell the Committee that we are approaching a moment of parliamentary precedent in that this will be the first Government Bill ever to be carried over into a new Session. I thought that it would be worth making a short statement about the procedures and practicalities relating to the carry-over, which the House agreed on 25 October. I hope that the Committee will bear with me.

<P>
Under the terms of the House's resolution, the Committee is obliged to report the Bill as so far amended to the House by no later than Thursday 11 November. It is expected that either this morning's or this afternoon's sitting will be the last in the current Session. At an appropriate point today, therefore, I shall call the Government Whip to move,

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``That further consideration of the Bill be now adjourned.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
Assuming that the motion is agreed to, I shall call the Minister to move,

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``That the Chairman do now report the Bill, as so far amended, to the House.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
Both motions are debatable. If the second is agreed to, no further proceedings can take place this Session.

<P>
The Bill will not be reprinted this Session. However, an informal text that incorporates all the amendments that have been made thus far will be available from the Public Bill Office tomorrow—it will be essential reading for the short recess.

<P>
I understand that the Government intend to reintroduce the amended Bill on the second day of the new Session—that is, on Thursday 18 November—with a view to resuming Committee proceedings on Tuesday 23 November at 10.30 am.

<P>
There is no need to re-table outstanding amendments from this Session in the new Session. Such amendments will automatically be carried forward and published in an amendment paper the day after the Bill is reintroduced. New amendments can be tabled from the moment that the Bill is formally re-presented in the new Session.

<P>
The Committee, which will consist of the same members, will resume its consideration of the Bill at the point that we reach at the conclusion of proceedings in this Session.

<P>
Clause 122 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<H4><center>Clause 123</center></H4>

<H4><center>Rule-making instruments</center></H4>

<P>
<B>Mr. Howard Flight </B>(Arundel and South Downs): I beg to move amendment No. 465, in page 56, line 20, at end insert

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`sent to all authorised persons'.
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
This is a purely drafting amendment, which would make it clear that all authorised persons should be sent a copy of the rule-making instrument proposals.

<P>
<B>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Miss Melanie Johnson):</B> Under amendment No. 465, the Financial Services Authority would send copies of each and every rule-making instrument that it made to each and every authorised person. That is an important addition to the hon. Gentleman's remarks.

<P>
The amendment is neither necessary nor feasible. Under clause 123, the FSA will need to publicise its rules properly. However, that is different from requiring it to send each and every rule to each and every authorised person. For example, would it be right to send a one-man independent financial adviser practice all the rules about bank prudential requirements, or how banks are to treat derivative positions in their trading books? Similarly, should banks be sent all the rules regarding asset allocation—for example—that apply to insurance companies? The result of that would be not light-touch regulation but people being bombarded with literature that might overwhelm them.

<P>
The important point, which the clause addresses, is that the authority should send copies of documents to the people who need to see them. Authorised persons may be persons with specific categories of permission, but the list may also include people who are not authorised. It is much better to let the FSA decide who are the right people, and it has a real incentive to get the distribution of its rule-making instruments right, as subsection (6) provides that, if a rule-making instrument has not been made available to the public in accordance with the clause, a person who does not comply with the rule will not be considered to be in breach of it. I do not see the point of trying to apply rules to persons who are not even aware of them.

<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell </B>(North-East Bedfordshire) rose—

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Is the Minister giving way?

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> No. I had finished.

<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> Just for clarification, I take it from what the Minister said that the FSA recognises its responsibility to ensure that those who need to know receive the relevant rule changes. If that were confirmed, I should be content.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I can confirm that. We expect the FSA to make available new rules by publishing regular updates for persons to whom the new rules will apply, and those who may be interested in them, and also by providing appropriate information on the website. I hope that in the light of that assurance, the hon. Gentleman will withdraw his amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> In the light of the undertaking that the Minister has just given, which essentially achieves the objective of our amendment, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
Clause 123 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<P>
Clause 124 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<H4><center>Clause 125</center></H4>

<H4><center>Consultation</center></H4>

<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 453, in page 57, line 6, after `make', insert `any'.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, we may consider Government amendment No. 454.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> Clause 125 is one of the key procedural provisions relating to the exercise of the rule-making powers in this part of the Bill. The importance of consultation cannot be overestimated, and I am glad that we now have the opportunity to consider that area more closely. I should remind the Committee that we are currently considering the various consultation provisions in the Bill once again, to see whether better consistency can be achieved between various consultation provisions specified in different circumstances—for example, in relation to publication of codes. Any necessary changes will be proposed together with any other necessary technical improvements to part IX.

<P>
Of course, the regulatory system will work best if all parties concerned are happy with its operation—that includes not only the FSA, but regulated firms and consumers. Given that, in practice, the rules will be such an important feature of the regulatory regime, it will be essential that full and detailed consultation is carried out.

<P>
Amendments Nos. 453 and 454 cover technical drafting points. They should clarify how the provisions will work, and I hope that they are not contentious. Amendment No. 453 makes clear that the FSA's proposals may relate to any of its rules, rather than to all of them. Amendment. No 454 will remove the word ``Authority's'' from the first line of clause 124(2)(d), because it is already evident that the clause concerns the authority's proposals. I hope that the Committee will support the amendments.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> As the Minister says, this is an important clause. We are happy with the Government's amendments. As we shall discuss later, the crucial element of the clause is that there should always be thorough cost-benefit analysis; this is one area in which the industry is keen that the Bill should provide for some control of costs where that is difficult to achieve in other ways.

<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 466, in page 57, line 10, leave out

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(except in the case of a proposal to impose fees)'.
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, it will be convenient to take amendments Nos. 467, in page 57, leave out lines 18 to 20.

<P>
No. 468, in page 57, leave out lines 32 to 39.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> As I said a moment ago, it is important not to omit the cost-benefit analysis justification of the proposals in all circumstances. At present, there is no requirement for draft rules imposing fees to include cost-benefit analysis where the Financial Services Authority believes that costs might be less onerous. It would be cleaner and simpler if all proposed rules were subject to cost-benefit analysis requirements.

<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> I shall deal with all three amendments together. They relate to the cost-benefit analysis and would achieve two purposes. First, they provide that a cost-benefit analysis must be published when a particular rule relates to the raising of fees. Secondly, in respect of non-fee rules, they provide that a cost-benefit analysis must be published, even when the proposed rule imposes a reduction in costs or there is no change or only a minimal increase.

<P>
First, it is obvious what the cost of a particular rule will be when the rule purely imposes fees. Secondly, as hon. Members will recall, the Financial Services Authority is given fee-raising powers in order to meet the expenses incurred in the performance of its functions, as paragraph 17 to schedule 1 makes clear. It is sensible that when the FSA consults on fees in the forthcoming year, it should do so in the context of its proposed expenditure. How else would it explain any changes to the proposed fees?

<P>
I am surprised that the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs (Mr. Flight), has sought, in amendment No. 467, to remove the current safeguard in subsection (3). Furthermore, the difficult qualitative judgments on costs and benefits that apply to other rules—for example, those designed to protect the interests of consumers—are not of such prime relevance to fees rules. The main question with fees rules is whether imposing the fee falls within schedule 1 constraints on the purposes for which the FSA can impose fees. Obviously, in considering its fees rules as a whole, the FSA would be expected to have regard to the objectives and principles, and in practice we certainly expect the FSA to bear in mind how its fees compare with those of other international regulators and whether its fees are proportionate.

<P>
The rules themselves, however, are not directly comparable to other rules where additional non-monetary costs may be imposed for the broader purposes of consumer protection. I hope that Opposition Members will appreciate those distinctions and withdraw amendments Nos. 466 and 467.

<P>
Amendment No. 468 would impose a requirement on the FSA to publish a cost-benefit analysis where there are no, or minimal, new costs arising from a rule change. That is unnecessary. Where there are only minimal additional costs, a requirement for cost-benefit analysis could simply add to the FSA's costs and it is difficult to see what added benefit would arise—either for practitioners or consumers. Taken to its logical extreme, the effects of the amendment could be that where a rule actually reduced costs, the FSA would be required to publish a benefit-benefit analysis.

<P>
Clearly, the FSA will need to consider costs before consulting and in order to justify not producing a full cost-benefit analysis, it will have to be satisfied that the rules do not impose new or additional costs other than the minimal ones, or even that existing costs will be reduced. In practice, were the FSA to decide that the requirements of subsection (7) were met so that it would not need to publish a cost-benefit analysis, we would expect it to say so in the consultation document that it would nevertheless still have to publish, setting out the proposed rule changes and the FSA's reasons for believing that they are compatible with its general duties.

<P>
I hope that I have persuaded Opposition Members to withdraw amendment No. 468. If not, I urge my hon. Friends to reject it.

<P>

<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I thank the Minister for her explanation, but it misses the point. It must be healthy to provide a cost-benefit analysis in all circumstances. For example, some proposed rules may reduce costs, but the question arises as to whether the rule is worth having in itself. Is it cost-efficient? If no cost-benefit analysis is necessary because there are no changes in costs, how does that test whether a rule is worthwhile in cost-benefit term? In our view, subsection (3) does not entirely cover the points raised by amendments Nos. 466 and 467. We think that the principle should remain that, where fees are imposed, a clear cost-benefit analysis should always be produced. We do not accept the Government's argument, and wish to press the matter to a Division.

<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory </B>(Wells): I support my hon. Friend's observations. The requirement on the FSA to produce cost-benefit analyses is most important. We are glad that the Bill has a requirement for them but we would like to widen it. Can the Economic Secretary say a little more about how they would be drawn up, and by whom, and tell the Committee whether criticism and suggestions will be accepted from, for example, the practitioner committee. There is a natural suspicion in the market that these cost-benefit analyses will be self-serving to some extent, and that the FSA will produce them to justify its own actions. It is therefore important for the authority to be open to suggestions from others about the methodology, raw material and data that it uses, so that these can be refined and be open to challenge. In particular, if an analysis proves to be misleading or inaccurate, the subject should be able to be revisited so that a better estimate of the precise costs and benefits can be produced in due course. That of itself might lead to a change in the rules to correct any excessive unforeseen costs. These are complex rules and it is a problem for anyone to anticipate all costs. Can the Minister confirm that the FSA will be open to outside bodies, for them to suggest changes and refinements and elaborate a little on that and on the involvement of the practitioner committee?

<P>
The purpose of our amendments, as my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs explained, is to widen the provision and to ensure that there is consultation, when there is a supposition that costs will be reduced, simply because the FSA ought always to be looking at opportunities for cost reductions. That should be an important element in the authority's thinking; it should be required to show precisely what cost reductions would be.

<P>
The Economic Secretary said at an earlier sitting that the FSA will be reporting on matters of cost in its annual report, and at its annual meeting. Therefore it will be necessary for the authority to keep a running total of cost increases and reductions so that over time the market can gauge the cumulative effect of its rules and regulations.

<P>
To facilitate this, it would be helpful, where, in the authority's judgment, rules have led to reductions, if that judgment were supported by a formal analysis along the lines of the requisite cost-benefit analysis, when costs increase.

<P>
Who will judge when the FSA should be exempted from the requirement to produce a cost-benefit analysis under subsection (7)?

<P>
As matters stand, it is the FSA; therefore everyone will rely heavily on its opinions about cost reductions and about what constitutes a change of minimal significance under subsection 7(b).

<P>
All that is now the task of the FSA. Our amendments would require the authority to substantiate its judgements about costs. On the example of minimal costs, something may be minimal for a very large firm, and the FSA, which is used to dealing with the big banks in London, may regard a rule change as being of minimal significance, but a sole practitioner or independent financial adviser elsewhere in the United Kingdom might not see it that way and consider that significant costs were involved. Our amendment would allow them to challenge the arrangement and offer them protection.

<P>
Finally, in relation to fees, the amendment would require the deletion of subsection (3). It would apply the same procedure in relation to fee changes and rule changes. Fees are a real cost on firms, although they are a revenue cost, not a compliance cost. Nevertheless, they are still a cost, and it is appropriate for that cost to be subjected to the same analysis and reporting as will apply to rule changes. I hope that when the Economic Secretary responds to my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs she will comment on my additional observations and respond to my questions. That will help us to decide whether to press the amendments.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I do not think that the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs fully appreciated the situation. The point is that no cost may be involved. Some of the circumstances in which he envisaged the use of a cost-benefit analysis would in fact involve a benefit-benefit analysis. Cost-benefit analyses are so-„called because costs are attached. The Opposition's proposal would increase the FSA's costs to no good purpose. Clearly, it would have to undertake some initial work to establish whether a cost was involved. The proposal involves publication, and obviously the results of a complete exercise would have to be published. The involvement of minimal or no costs will entail very different creatures. I still maintain that the Opposition's position does not make good sense.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> The point is that in such an analysis it is the FSA that decides what are the supposed benefit-benefits, and under further analysis its opinion may be challenged or turn out not to be correct. We want to impose on the FSA the discipline of justifying its subjective view. Otherwise, the decision will be entirely at the discretion of the FSA, which will make the rule change in the first place.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I shall come to that matter, and to others, presently.

<P>
I am sure that the FSA will adopt best practice when it carries out cost-benefit analyses and that it will be open to constructive suggestions from all quarters. Consultees will be able to question the relevant methodology during the consultation process. That will involve the sort of dialogue that Opposition Members want, but it will not involve publishing statements that maintain that a change has resulted in a reduction in costs.

<P>
Perhaps I should have said earlier that we believe that the current definition of costs that is implied by subsection (7) is unduly narrow. I shall say more about that when we discuss the competition scrutiny procedures in chapter III of this part of the Bill, which we shall do presently. I have nothing further to add at this stage.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> We believe that because the clause will create a new system—it will not continue the present system—every rule will be new. Our view is that all rules need to be tested by cost-benefit analysis. With the introduction of completely new financial services industry legislation, none of the existing rules per se will continue. This is a key proposal, which could involve forcing the FSA to undertake a cost-benefit analysis of everything.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> First, we beg leave to withdraw amendment No. 383. Amendments Nos. 469 and 149 would control costs. The statement has to take into account clause 2.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. It would be much more convenient for the Committee if the hon. Gentleman proposed his amendment and subsequently withdrew it. That would make life easier for everyone.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Amendment No. 383 is proposed by us. May we subsequently withdraw it?

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am sorry to confuse the hon. Gentleman. If he withdrew the lead amendment now, it would cause confusion in the debating order, as subsequent amendments would fall into different places on the Order Paper. The hon. Gentleman should speak to his amendments—he does not have to speak to amendment No. 383—and if, at the end of the debate, he withdraws it, and then wants a Division on any other amendment in that group, he can request that through the Chair.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Thank you for your guidance, Mr. Atkinson.

<P>
The amendments have been tabled for the purposes of thoroughness. Amendment No. 469 would require the FSA to take into account the provisions contained in clause 2(3) of the Bill, including those concerning competition, when making its rules. As drafted, clause 125 merely requires the FSA to have regard to its general objectives. It is appropriate that, when making rules, the authority should have regard to its principles, which is how we have come to describe the provisions in clause 2(3).

<P>
Amendment No. 149 would require the FSA to explain why it had ignored any representations in consultations when new rules came into force, and to publish its reasons for so doing. Government amendment No. 455 appears similar to that amendment, and we should like confirmation from the Minister that that is the case.

<P>
Amendment No. 384 is a drafting amendment, designed to tweak the sloppy use of the word ``consumers''. We require clarification from the Government as to its meaning in the clause, as it seems to be defined in different ways in various parts of the Bill.

<P>
We are prepared to withdraw amendment No. 383 because, on consideration, we believe that the wording of the Bill is satisfactory.

<P>

<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I support my hon. Friend's observations, particularly with regard to amendment No. 469, which would require a draft to be accompanied by

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a statement of the extent to which, if at all, the Authority has taken into account the matters in section 2(3) in making the proposed rules''.
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
The amendment would beef up clause 125(2)(c), which currently requires that the draft proposed rules must be accompanied by

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a statement of the Authority's reasons for believing that making the proposed rules is compatible with its general duties under section 2''.
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
Although reference is already made to the authority's general duties in clause 2, which was debated some months ago, our amendment would prove a little bit more demanding, in that it would require the authority to explain the extent to which it has taken those matters into account.

<P>
I shall give an example. The Committee will recall that, according to clause 2(3)(e), a general duty of the FSA is to have regard to

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the desirability of maintaining the competitive position of the United Kingdom''.
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
As it stands, clause 125 will require the authority to show that proposed rule changes are ``compatible'' with that aim, but not the extent to which that aim has been taken into account. That is a significant difference. Our amendment would require the authority to show the likely effect of a particular rule change on the competitive position of the United Kingdom. In other words, the authority would have to assess the degree to which a rule change might prove onerous for our own market, compared to traders in other parts of the world.

<P>
The matter is of great interest to the market. We have observed many times that, in respect of financial services, we are not an island. Firms face global competition, so very small cost or rule differences can affect the location of businesses or transactions. For that reason, the rules should be scrutinised carefully by market operators and the FSA.

<P>
I urge the Economic Secretary carefully to consider strengthening the clause by redrafting it, or by adopting our amendment, which would impose slightly more discipline on the FSA in this vital respect.

<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I support the comments of my hon. Friend and my right hon. Friend. The purpose of cost-benefit analysis is to ensure that the FSA thinks about the burdens that it places on those whom it regulates before imposing further regulatory rules and changes. The point is easily expressed, but if it is forgotten, serious burdens could be imposed. People could fail to understand that the rules have changed, or to recognise the importance of a particular change, notwithstanding the fact that, according to the previous group of amendments, the matter should be properly explained and publicised to the relevant people.

<P>
On looking at the rules of the Financial Intermediaries, Managers and Brokers Regulatory Association, which I have in front of me, one notes that they are very complex. Individual rules seem quite sensible, but the way in which they snake in and out, with constant cross reference, makes following them a full-time job. The lawyers who advised us work with financial institutions large and small, and with networks, which is a new phrase to me, if not, perhaps, to the Financial Secretary. As I understand it, networks are trade-funded bodies who provide guidance on the complexities and duties under the rules. Independent financial advisers, unless they are very large, are unlikely to employ their own compliance staff; they are likely to rely on the networks to tell them what to do.

<P>
Compliance with all the detailed rules is a necessarily burdensome task, and, in a sense, I despair of the leviathan that was created by the Financial Services Act 1986. Compared to the leviathan that will be created by the Bill, however, it is a quite modest animal. The burden of costs can be huge—I asked what one of the larger and better known financial services firms in the City would be likely to spend on compliance, and I was told, with a shrug of the shoulders, that it would run into several million pounds a year. I imagine that the networks spend very large sums on behalf of IFAs, who pay more modest but still fairly substantial subscriptions. The clause, which deals with cost-benefit analysis, should therefore not merely be paid lip service. I asked whether anybody had read a cost-benefit analysis, and I was told that it contained a lot of general terms—to describe it as waffle would perhaps be unfair—which did not provide much detail on the extent to which the benefit justifies the cost.

<P>
No one in the Committee can wave a magic wand to change the world, but would it not be better to have simpler, more straightforward rules, which people could read and understand? That would not be impossible, as many of the rules—such as those that I read overnight—relate to the simple, straightforward and sensible concepts that one would expect to find. We have a choice between comparatively simple rules, which leave a great deal of discretion to the FSA in terms of implementation, or a rather regimented, closely defined, rule-based system. Those who operate in the market have become used to such a system, and, in some senses, are happier with it. If they obey the letter and, broadly, the spirit of the rule, they feel that they will be safe from criticism and, possibly, penalty.

<P>
Where does that lead us? It leads to the constant dilemma of where to strike the balance. That will not be achieved by creating grossly over-elaborate rules—for which I do not blame the Financial Services Authority or the previous regulatory authorities. The Bar Council's disciplinary rules and codes of conduct are a model of complexity. I doubt whether many members of the Bar, in 20 or 30 years of practice, ever attempt to read them en bloc, but consult them in detail on the rare occasions that it is necessary to do so.

<P>
Given this background of leviathan complexity, it is important, whenever the rules are changed, for the FSA to think carefully about whether it will be worth the extra cost that is likely to be imposed. It must also think carefully about whether it is possible to simplify and drive down compliance costs incrementally with those rules. Furthermore, in the context of the amendment, it should consider the costs that apply in other competitive countries, as it is required to do by clause 2(3) of the Bill. An over-expensive system should not be created in this country. When I asked the people who are advising us how our system compares with continental systems, I was told that in most cases—France and Greece were cited as examples—regulation is far simpler and briefer. Germany, which tends to prefer detailed regulations, is an exception.

<P>
We cannot change the course that has been embarked upon—the Government are not going to withdraw the Bill and the FSA is not going to rethink the structure on which it seeks to build for the future. However, the Government should, where possible, try to simplify procedures, keep down costs for users and remember that we have to compete in terms of costs with other countries in the European Union and worldwide. The cost-benefit analyses are therefore important.

<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> I shall respond to the points that the right hon. and learned Member for North-East Bedfordshire (Sir Nicholas Lyell) made about complexity. We must strike a balance between detail and flexibility. The purpose of the Bill is to rationalise the regulatory rules, which is bound to improve the position. It is better to have one body, instead of nine bodies, to oversee the rules—from one point of view rather than many separate points of view—and put them in place with the aim of tying them into a sensible overall framework.

<P>
I turn first to amendment No. 384.

<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> What the Minister said about having one body sounds very good. However, if one looks up in the encyclopaedia the Personal Investment Authority rules in the sector that was previously covered by the Financial Intermediaries, Managers and Brokers Regulatory Organisation, one finds that they are the adopted rules of FIMBRA. Putting them all under one hat does not in itself produce any simplification.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> Those are matters for the FSA to consider as it works towards producing the rules. At least it will be able to operate across the entire financial services sector; the existing bodies no longer relate properly to certain segments of the market. This is a great improvement on the Financial Services Act 1986. I remember remarking to the Committee how that Act had been so substantially amended by secondary legislation that it is difficult to follow the provisions now being made under it. We are doing all we can to make the Bill as simple and limited as possible.

<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
I am not sure that we would want our financial services industry to be compared with some of the countries mentioned by the right hon. and learned Member for North-East Bedfordshire. We must maintain the credibility of our standing in that regard which is due in good measure to our ability to ensure that competition is available and that the regulations are the right ones. We must cherish and maintain that.

<P>
Amendment No. 384 relates back to our old friend, the best interests of the consumer. It seeks to introduce a definition of the consumer for the purposes of subsection (6). As hon. Members know, there are varying formulations of persons who might loosely be described as consumers in the Bill which vary subtly according to the clause, purpose and context in question. The hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs regarded that subtlety as sloppy. I hope that he has enough subtlety to realise that this is subtlety and not sloppiness.

<P>
Subsection (6) is intended to cover the people whom the various rules are aimed to protect. The distinctions are fine ones but no less important because of that. We have already said that we would consider the case for a more consistent approach to defining ``consumer'' in the Bill and we will include subsection (6) in our deliberations. The essential thing is to provide the right protection for the right group in the right circumstances. I hope that in the light of those remarks the Opposition will not press the amendment.

<P>
I also hope to persuade them not to press amendment No. 469 which proposes that when publishing draft rules, the FSA must include a statement of the extent to which the authority has taken into account the regulatory principles set out in clause 2(3). I cannot see that that is necessary given the rather broader statement that subsection (2)(c) already requires the FSA to make on its reasons for believing that the proposals are compatible with its general duties. I find it hard to see how the FSA could fail to consider the objectives and principles when making the statement contemplated by subsection (2)(c). In fact it should not fail to consider the objectives and principles in anything that it does. That is one of the points of the Bill.

<P>
I am grateful to the Opposition for tabling amendment No. 149 which, as the hon. Member for Arundel South Downs remarked, follows the same path as Government amendment No. 455. These amendments deal with feedback statements on consultation. An aspect of the consultation process is the question of the transparency surrounding its outcome. People should know what the FSA thought of consultation responses, whether it changed its mind because of them and, if not, why not.

<P>
Amendment No. 455 reflects our intention to require the FSA to give information in the form of feedback statements following consultation. As those who have followed closely the FSA's current approach to consultation will be aware, the FSA has already produces feedback statements following consultation exercises. I am sure that the Committee will find it reassuring to know that the FSA is following best practice in order to achieve maximum transparency, even when it is not under a statutory duty to do so.

<P>
Amendment No. 455 puts a statutory requirement on the FSA to produce the feedback, and its effect is somewhat more general than that of amendment No. 149. It nevertheless requires the FSA to produce a broad statement in response to the representations that it has received. The authority would have to explain why it has agreed with some representations but not with others. While I would expect the feedback statement to give a fair reflection of the outcome of the consultation exercise, it might not be practical for the FSA to address every point raised in every letter it receives during consultation which could be the effect of amendment No. 149.

<P>
The approach that we have adopted will require the FSA to address the most important issues raised. That practical provision will go some way to meet the concerns that the Joint Committee raised about the need for feedback on matters raised by the consumer and practitioner panels in the context of their role in consultation under clauses 7 to 9.

<P>
Another effect of amendment No. 455 is that, when the panels make a significant contribution to the consultation exercise, the FSA must say how far it has taken account of their representations.

<P>
I have told the Committee of the Government's intention to reconsider the procedural requirements on consultation in the Bill to achieve greater consistency. As part of that exercise, we intend to introduce the requirement for feedback statements into the consultations for both codes issued under clause 62 and for the market abuse code in part VII. In the light of that, I hope that the amendment will be withdrawn. I shall ask my hon. Friends to support amendment No. 455.

<P>
On the point made by the right hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory), I do not think that the amendment would produce a substantive improvement. In explaining the reasons for believing that the rules are compatible with its objectives and principles, it seems inconceivable that the FSA would not include an assessment of the extent to which they have been taken into account.

<P>

<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I am grateful to the Economic Secretary. I have been listening carefully and hope that I have not misunderstood. Under amendment No. 469 the FSA would have to take into account all the matters in clause 2(3) when changing the rules. It should be made clear that the FSA must take into account the internal character of financial services and markets and the desirability of maintaining the United Kingdom's competitive position. The Economic Secretary agrees. I should like her to clarify a further point. Let us suppose that, in the consultation that will take place on the rule change, the consultees say, ``This is very onerous. We would have to do much less if we were operating out of Paris or Athens.'' How will the FSA show that it has taken those representations into account? Under amendment No. 469, the FSA would have to do so publicly. If she is saying that that will happen, will she explain how?

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> If such representations were a major aspect of the comments that the FSA received, they would need to be covered in the feedback statement.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> The Economic Secretary responded to my belief that our amendment would place a slightly tighter, more demanding obligation on the FSA by saying that it was unnecessary because the FSA would report on the extent to which it had taken account of such matters. If that is so, I do not understand why she cannot accept our amendment, so putting the matter beyond doubt.

<P>
There is a small but important distinction. As I said earlier, an obligation to report on the extent to which the rule changes have taken into account other matters is better than simply having to assert whether they are comparable. The Economic Secretary may say that the work will be done, but we want it to be reported on. Our amendment focuses on a subset of matters in clause 2, whereas, under the clause, the FSA must make a statement only on the compatibility of its rule changes with clause 2.

<P>
Our amendment is superior and represents a small but significant tightening of the requirement on the FSA. It will comfort market operators, who want to be assured that the FSA will not make rule changes for its own convenience and, in some cases, to cover its own back. The FSA will have to be continuously aware of and make public the extent to which it has regard to wider considerations, particularly of competitiveness.

<P>
Regulators can always find wonderful reasons for requiring more information, passing more rules and imposing more regulations on everybody else—that is the nature of the world in which they operate. To an extent, they see regulation as what economists call a free good, because the costs are borne elsewhere, often invisibly. When they finally filter through to the market, those involved respond—not openly, but nevertheless in a real way—by migrating. After a year or two and after due consideration, they will quietly set up or expand their businesses in Dublin and Frankfurt, but not London. That will not be clear at the time, and the damage will be done before action can be taken.

<P>
I want the Minister to revisit the matter. She says that she has no principled objection to amendment No. 469. However, if she cannot respond more positively, I shall urge my hon. Friends to vote for it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Our point goes back to the debate under clause 2 about the importance of competition, about not impeding it domestically and about supporting Britain's internationally competitive position.

<P>
The four objectives in clause 2(2) rank ahead of the matters in clause 2(3). If there is any conflict between the objectives and those matters—of which the two most important deal with competition—the objectives take precedence. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells said, our amendment is designed to beef up the provisions in line with clause 129 and with that on which the Office of Fair Trading will be required to report. Through the amendment, we would be telling the FSA, ``When you make rules, you need to focus on competition and to tell people the extent to which you have done so.'' That, in turn, would introduce an element of discipline as regards what my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for North-East Bedfordshire saw as the problems and dangers of the proliferation of rules, particularly for smaller organisations in the industry. Such proliferation often occurs to an extent that is well beyond what is justified or what is intelligible to those participating.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> The hon. Gentleman is straying on to wider questions of competition. We shall come to those when we reach later clauses, and I shall have quite a lot to say when we do. In the meantime, however, I shall deal with the comments made by the right hon. Member for Wells.

<P>
We expect the FSA to give its reasons for believing that its rules will be compatible and not just to say that it believes that they are. It will have to set out a reasoned case. We also fail to see why the Opposition do not want the FSA to consider the extent of compatibility with the objectives, which would be the effect of the amendments. That is an important point.

<P>
On the practicalities, several Opposition Members mentioned feedback. On occasion, one can deluge people with far too much detail and feedback. We want to ensure that the main points made to the FSA are addressed and reported. It is not practical, for example, to respond to every letter sent to the FSA, as that would make it impossible to see the wood for the trees. That is the danger of the amendment. As I said, Government amendment No. 455 is not substantially different and I am advising my hon. Friends to vote for that and to oppose the Opposition's amendment.

<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> We broadly accept the argument that Government amendment No. 455 is essentially the same as our amendment No. 149. However, we want to put amendment No. 469 to the vote for the underlying reasons that we have explained.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I take it that the hon. Gentleman wishes to withdraw amendment No. 383.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> This raises the question of cost-benefit analysis. The Minister rightly says that we need to see the wood for the trees. It is a question of order, if I remember correctly, that in the middle of a Bill's Committee stage, one cannot put down written parliamentary questions to establish information that is capable of being debated as the Bill proceeds.

<P>
As to the Minister's wood or forest, does the FSA have an overall figure relating to the costs of City regulation? Can that figure be broken down between the different components for which it will be responsible? Can the Minister tell me where I could find such a figure? If not, I would be most grateful if she would send me a letter with that information.

<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Tyrie </B>(Chichester): I have to admit that I had not studied the clause carefully before I arrived today, but I have done so for the past hour or so and I do not like it. Let me explain why.

<P>
First, it is sloppily drafted. Let us consider subsection (8):

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`` `Cost benefit analysis' means an estimate of the costs together with an analysis of the benefits''.
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
Is there any difference between an analysis and an estimate? Why is the word changed half way through? Are we not looking at an estimate of the costs and an estimate of the benefits? Are they not both predictive rather than objectives? We are examining cost-benefit analysis—[Interruption.] The Minister does not consider that a serious point, but all these issues must at some time be taken extremely seriously by the FSA, which will have to implement them.

<P>
We need cost-benefit analysis for the same reason that we need independent reviews—which we are not getting—and countervailing pressures on the FSA. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells said, we are dealing here with a free good from the FSA's point of view. The authority can pass on the cost of this work and is under no obligation to do what it does not wish to do—with the risk that analysis will take place only when the authority thinks it appropriate. That is unacceptable.

<P>
It is essential to have in the Bill counterweights to the huge powers being given to the FSA. The new regulation of cost-benefit analysis which will, to some degree, be subject to review under clause 125, is part of the process. I have heard virtually nothing today to indicate what constitutes the cost-benefit. The fact that my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for North-East Bedfordshire asked a question only moments ago—and the lack of any document to give us that information—indicates how sparse is our knowledge of the way in which these analyses will proceed.

<P>
It might be helpful if I sketched out what I think a cost-benefit analysis of this type should, as a minimum, contain, in the hope that the Economic Secretary will be able to confirm it. I understand that she may not yet have examined all this in detail so may not be able to reply immediately. I am happy for her to explain in a letter just how it would work.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> The Minister has kindly offered to write to me on a number of matters but, so far—unless I have missed my post—I have not received any such letters.

<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> If the hon. Lady does not respond, we will have to stop asking for letters and request immediate answers, however I do not think that we have reached that point. I am hopeful that she will give the Committee a full description of how the analyses will be undertaken. I realise that the information may run into many pages, and be extremely detailed. These analyses go right to the heart of a crucial issue in the Bill—to ensure that we regulate not merely to save the skins of regulators, but for the good of the industry and, ultimately, the consumer.

<P>
The easy part of the examination will be to take a look at the compliance departments of the major City firms. They have lawyers and others engaged in this work, and they cost money. So the first building block of a cost-benefit analysis will be to ask how much is being paid to these people to run the compliance department. After that, a little time needs to be added for people in senior management positions who come away from working on deals or whatever to liaise with the compliance officers.

<P>
After that, there is the fairly identifiable cost of lawyers whom compliance officers approach for advice. The lawyers will send in bills, which will be available fairly readily, so that will be quite easy. Then comes the cost of the FSA in all this: its costs should be added in because, ultimately, they will be passed on to the industry.

<P>
Life then starts to get more difficult. What would be the opportunity cost for business lost as a result of the imposition of the regulation? Will some business go overseas? When Howard Davies was dealing with that in the Joint Committee he cited the lack of evidence that firms were moving out of the UK as a reason for supposing that the burden of regulation was not yet too heavy and that Britain was still a relatively low cost regulation location.

<P>
That is only half the story. Another component in assessing that part of the opportunity are the costs that may be caused by firms who decide to expand not in the UK but overseas. That would not be picked up by Howard Davies as recorded on page 21 of the Joint Committee report. The third element of opportunity costs are geographically footloose foreign firms that can locate in many jurisdictions and may decide not to come here.

<P>
There is increasing talk in the City of regulatory arbitrage, which is moving the different functions between different locations to minimise the regulatory burden. If that is the case, a great deal of work has to be done to make an intelligent cost-benefit analysis to find out exactly what that arbitrage consists of. That is not an easy job. It cannot be done on the back of an envelope or with a couple of phone calls. It is a major undertaking requiring some serious, full-time professional economists.

<P>
I do not suggest for a moment that what I have just listed there as an analysis of the costs is easy. Indeed, it is worth bearing in mind the difference between this form of analysis and cost-benefit analysis in a hospital, for example. Hospitals have the advantage of a huge body of existing information and questions such as whether spending money on one operation rather than another will save lives can be answered using the figures for deaths per 1,000 in various operations.

<P>
In this area we are largely in the world of prediction and a predictive cost-benefit analysis is extremely difficult to undertake. I have not referred to the difficulties in analysing the benefits and I would not want for a moment to suggest that the benefits of regulation are sparse or difficult to spot. There is a large public good element to the assessment of the benefit. Everyone loses out if the good name of the City or the zone of regulation is damaged in some way because a malpractice has crept in. That is the public good argument for having high-quality regulation. That too is a difficult concept and a difficult area to assess but it must be done in the context of a Bill as intrusive and powerful as this.

<P>
Having thought it through for an hour or two, I have come to the conclusion that the clause on its own does not fit the bill. I regret that I have not had more time to think about it. If I had, I would have tabled an amendment to ensure that the cost-benefit analysis set out in the clause was subject to independent scrutiny. The Institute for Fiscal Studies might have sufficient people to do it and London Economics might be capable of doing it. There are some highly skilled cost-benefit analysis specialists and one of those bodies should examine these issues.

<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
I have a few simple questions for the Economic Secretary. Will she give a thorough analysis of the way in which cost-benefit analyses will be drawn up? Is the sloppy wording irrelevant or meaningful? Does she sympathise with the view that the FSA's approach to cost-benefit analysis should be subject to independent scrutiny?

<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> I want to begin by tackling the question that the right hon. and learned Member for North-East Bedfordshire asked about costs. The Bill was accompanied by a regulatory impact assessment—indeed, it had to be—and I refer the right hon. and learned Gentleman to it. The FSA agreed to include a report on comparative compliance costs in its annual reports.

<P>
In relation to letters, I shall endeavour to ensure that the right hon. and learned Gentleman receives responses to his points as soon as that can be done. I believe that the replies that are due do not precede the summer recess, and that only a few, which I accept, are now due a reply, were received after the recess.

<P>
The remarks of the hon. Member for Chichester (Mr. Tyrie) do not move me to discuss the clause's exact wording or the merits of the words ``estimate'' and ``analysis''. The intention is perfectly clear in this context. Given the hon. Gentleman's approach, we could also discuss the meaning of ``representation'', ``prejudicial'', and many other words. Although I am happy to do so, that would keep us here for a very long time.

<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> That is partly what scrutinising legislation is all about. The Economic Secretary may well be right about the fact that there is no significant difference between the two words. However, in relation to cost-benefit analysis, there is a difference between an estimate and an analysis—one is predictive and the other is not. In this context, will she confirm whether the two words are interchangeable?

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I confirm that those words are contained in the Bill. I shall not give the hon. Gentleman the meaning of all of the words in the clause or in the Bill. The meaning of the words, as they are used in the English language, is clear in the legislation.

<P>
The FSA must act in a way that is compatible with its regulatory objectives, and decide on the most appropriate way to meet those objectives. It must also discharge its general functions in accordance with the principles that are contained in clause 2(3). That is important, because those principles will bind the FSA to, for example, avoid making over-burdensome rules.

<P>
One of the clause's most significant proposals is the requirement on the FSA to state why it believes that its proposals are compatible with its general duties. The FSA has to consider whether its proposals are compatible with its duties and publicly give reasons for its view. The draft document must be accompanied by a statement that the FSA made representations about its proposals within a specified time. Indeed, the FSA is required under subsection (4) to have regard to those representations before making the proposed rules.

<P>
Additionally, if rules that are made by the FSA differ significantly from the published draft, the FSA is obliged under subsection (5) to publish a statement about the difference, along with an updated cost-benefit analysis.

<P>
However, there are certain exceptions to the consultation procedure that I described. In relation to emergencies, if the FSA believes that the delay that would be involved in complying with the consultation requirements would be prejudicial to the interests of consumers, the detailed consultation requirements will not apply. I am sure that Committee members recognise the need for that exclusion. I give an assurance that that is intended to be used only in exceptional circumstances.

<P>
Another exception involves the requirement for cost-benefit analysis, which will not apply when the FSA considers that the cost to be incurred in complying with the new rules will be equal to or less than the current costs of compliance—we discussed that earlier—or when it will result in only a minimal increase in costs. Again, I hope that the Committee will agree that we should not impose unnecessary burdens on the FSA. To judge by their recent remarks, Opposition Members are forgetting that it is firms and consumers who ultimately must pay the price.

<P>
Any consultation draft must be accompanied by details of the proposed expenditure, by reference to which the increased fees are to be charged. In the context of schedule 1, the Committee discussed certain additional checks and balances relating to fee-raising powers. In particular, I remind the Committee that, according to paragraph 17 to schedule 1, the authority may raise fees for certain purposes only. It may raise fees to meet expenses incurred in discharging its functions, including incidental expenses, to make good payments on loans that it has taken out for certain purposes and to maintain adequate reserves.

<P>
Committee members will be aware that we propose that the consultation requirement in clause 125 should also extend to certain types of general guidance. I shall deal with that during our discussion of guidance under clauses 127 and 128.

<P>
No. 472, in page 58 line 15 leave out from `matters' to end of line 16.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> This is an important clause that deals with the arrangements through which the FSA will give guidance. The provision is relevant to clauses 118 and 120, which concern waivers and potential rights of action. In general, guidance given by the FSA should be binding on all.

<P>
We would like the clause to operate in a manner somewhat analogous to no-action letters, as they are called in the United States, where the industry is made aware of important guidance elements that might alter the way in which rules and regulations are interpreted. A specific consultation requirement on the issuing of guidance should be included. The availability of guidance should not be limited by charging, and should be funded from central costs. In general, the industry supports the view that charging guidance costs creates a barrier to the major objective of preventive regulation. The FSA is a monopoly provider, and it is difficult for it to charge fairly.

<P>
Amendment No. 470 would require the FSA to include, in the territories in which it is giving guidance, its statement of principles or code rather than merely its rules. There are a number of areas relating to its statement of principles or code that could, to some degree, be regulatory offences, and we cannot see the logic of not including those in the guidance as well as specific rules.

<P>
Similarly, amendment No. 471 would require the authority to give guidance on rules relating to its general duties under clause 2, which we talked about earlier. In the context of the entire regime, much of what the FSA policies derives from clause 2.

<P>
We shall not press amendment No. 472 because, on due consideration, we are satisfied with the inclusion of the matters that we sought to exclude.

<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> I acknowledge the hon. Gentleman's comments about amendment No. 472.

<P>
We support, to some extent, amendment No. 470, which proposes that the FSA can issue guidance on the statements of principle or code under the Bill when it is enacted. As members of the Committee will be aware, certain types of statements of principle, such as the FSA's principles for businesses, will in fact be rules on which the FSA can give guidance in any case. The intention is that the FSA should be able to give guidance in other desirable areas. That could, in appropriate circumstances, include guidance on the code. We will consider whether any further changes are necessary to put the matter beyond doubt. On that basis, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will see fit to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment No. 471 would provide that the FSA can give guidance in relation to its general duties under the Bill. That would potentially involve it giving guidance on the discharge of the objectives and regulatory principles. I am not sure that that would be necessary. There is no reason why the FSA should not—under clause 127(1)(d) or without relying on any express statutory authority—explain the policies that it has adopted in order to meet its general duties under clause 2. I therefore hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Given the Minister's comments about amendment No. 470, we will be happy to withdraw it. Regarding amendment No. 471, could the Minister tell us the precise meaning of clause 127(1)(b) in terms of giving guidance in respect of any matter relating to functions of the authority? In our view, functions and objectives go together.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I shall come back to the hon. Gentleman on that point in due course.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> On the basis that the Minister will conclude that functions and objectives are suitable in this context, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 456, in page 58, line 19, at end insert—

<P>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss, the following amendments:

<P>
Government amendment No. 457.

<P>
No. 482, in page 58, line 30, after `authorised', insert `or approved'.

<P>
Government amendment No. 458.

<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I should like to say a few words about the Government amendments before discussing amendment No. 482.

<P>
Amendment No. 456 makes an important improvement to the consultation obligations to which the FSA will be subject when its powers under part IX of the Bill are brought into force. The amendment imposes an obligation on the FSA to consult on guidance that it proposes to issue to authorised persons generally, or a class of persons, in relation to the rules. On looking at the amendment, especially bearing in mind the amendments with which it has been grouped, one might ask why only guidance on rules is to be subject to consultation, or why all general guidance should not be subject to consultation.

<P>
In practice, the kinds of guidance that may be issued by the authority under its powers in clause 127 may vary considerably. At one extreme, it may be guidance in the wide sense—directed not only at authorised firms but, more generally, at consumers. That might be regarded as a kind of public information service—in pursuit of the public awareness and consumer protection objectives—which would tell consumers what to look out for when buying a particular financial product, and, indirectly, suggest how authorised persons selling such products might aid their customers to make the correct decisions.

<P>
Alternatively, the FSA might alert the public and authorised persons to a confidence trick that has been identified. A recent example involved members of the public receiving telephone calls from people claiming to work at their bank. The callers said that they were checking systems for year 2000 compliance, and asked for account details and PINs. Giving guidance to consumers in such a context is not a matter on which the FSA should need to consult, and it would be wrong to impose a burden that required them to do so. At the other extreme, the FSA will give guidance to individual firms on how to comply with the rules, or how to include certain information on one of its standard forms. Alternatively, it might receive inquiries from individual consumers about particular problems that they have experienced, about how to find an independent financial adviser and so on.

<P>
Clearly, consultation will not be appropriate for some forms of general or, indeed, specific guidance. Amendment No. 456 therefore focuses on guidance on the FSA's own rules, which is given to regulated persons generally, or to a class of them. There is a good reason for such a focus—guidance on rules can impose burdens in a similar way to the rules themselves.

<P>
Government amendments Nos. 457 and 458 cover a minor drafting point, which arises in clause 127(4) and 128(5). The amendments make it clear that guidance can be given generally to all regulated persons rather than simply to a class of them. I hope that the Committee will agree that they are an improvement to the Bill.

<P>
Amendment No. 482 seeks to make it clearer that part IX of the Bill—especially the clauses under discussion—applies to guidance given to approved persons, such as certain managers who are approved under part V of the Bill. We intend the FSA to be able to give guidance to approved persons under the part V regime, and we shall reconsider the drafting in order to make that clear.

<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I am very grateful to the Economic Secretary for her comments on amendment No. 482. I am comforted that she will look at the matter again.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I thank the Economic Secretary for her comments on Government amendment No. 456, which is helpful. It introduces a consultation procedure requirement for guidance, which is similar to those for rule-making under clause 125. However, what is the nature of the recommendations that are contemplated under clause 127(4)?

<P>
We are also happy with Government amendment No. 457. As the Economic Secretary pointed out, amendment No. 482 is designed to ensure that approved persons, as defined under clause 56, are included as relevant. I am pleased to note that the Economic Secretary will consider whether the Bill covers that, or whether changes to the wording might be necessary.

<P>
Government amendment No. 458 merely follows the drafting changes of Government amendment No. 457.

<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 385, in page 58, line 20, leave out `may' and insert `shall'.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, it will be convenient to consider amendment No. 386, in page 58, line 21, after `its' insert `general'.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> The amendments are intended to open up guidance to the industry by requiring the FSA to publish its general guidance. The FSA should be capable of differentiating specific and general guidance, as the clause requires. As the Committee heard, United States no-action letters are analogous in that respect. Many in the industry have had unsatisfactory experiences in the past, in that contradictory guidance may have been given to different organisations. This area requires the maximum transparency. Amendment No. 386 covers the same issue.

<P>

<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> I am grateful to Opposition Members for tabling these amendments. Their combined effect on clause 127(3) would be to require the FSA to publish its general guidance, and also to charge people for copies of that guidance.

<P>
On amendment No. 386, and the requirement to publish general guidance, it is our policy objective that the FSA should publish such guidance—indeed, it is proposed that it should do so. Moreover, given that clause 128 defines general guidance as being in ``legible form'' and capable of having a ``continuing effect'', it is implicit that general guidance is intended to be published. I do not, therefore, consider the amendment necessary.

<P>
A side-effect of amendment No. 385 which I find surprising would be that the FSA would be required to charge for general guidance. I am not sure whether the hon. Gentleman intends, for example, that visitors to the FSA's website should be charged, and possibly even required to pay before they view the general guidance there. I hope that we all agree on the proposed effect of the clause, which we propose as a mechanism for establishing the FSA's powers to publish guidance and to make a charge for it in appropriate cases. If we agree, I hope that Opposition Members will see fit to withdraw amendments Nos. 385 and 386.

<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I am disappointed that the Minister finds it unnecessary to change the word ``may'' to ``shall'' on the grounds that clause 128 requires the Treasury to be given a copy of the guidance, which must, therefore, by definition, be something that one could copy and must, therefore, have been published. That seems an obscure line of reasoning, and I ask the Minister to think again. If the authority is to produce guidance that can be passed on to someone else in copy form, it will have to publish it. It would, therefore, be better if clause 127(3) stated that clearly.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I do not have anything further to add. Clause 128(5) states that ``general guidance'' means guidance that is ``intended to have continuing effect'' and which is ``given in writing or other legible form.''

<P>
That does not refer specifically to the Treasury, although the Treasury is mentioned in the earlier subsections of clause 128. It is, therefore, a general provision, already incorporated in the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> We do not entirely accept the Government's argument against changing ``may'' to ``shall'', partly for the reasons put forward by my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for North-East Bedfordshire.

<P>
We do not perceive any incompatibility between the amendment and the rest of the clause. It is up to the authority whether it will give the guidance, and our proposal is not incompatible with the question of whether one has to pay for it. More generally, we believe that it is wrong that one should have to pay for guidance. I wish that amendment No. 387 had been grouped with these amendments, because their intent is to open up access to guidance—potentially via the internet—to all markets, so that one would not have, as one has in the past, conflicting guidance or instances in which one firm did not know what advice had been given to another.

<P>
We are not, therefore, willing to withdraw amendment No. 385. However, we will not press amendment No. 386 to a vote.

<P>

</FONT>Question accordingly negatived.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 387, in page 58, leave out lines 23 to 25.

<P>
The amendment would delete paragraph (3)(c), which enables the authority to charge a fee to those seeking guidance. That could be a barrier to firms seeking clarification of complex rules, and runs counter to the FSA's professed policy of preventive regulation. It is better that firms should understand the obligations on them, and seek to comply with the rules, rather than that they be caught out breaking them, especially if they are complex.

<P>
It is difficult for the Committee fully to appreciate the burden on small companies constituted by such extensive rule books. I wish that I could bring to the Committee the volumes of rules and regulations to which firms are already subject. It should be an aim of the Bill to reduce the volume of paper that firms must digest. Regulators—those who work for the FSA—will be full-time professionals. In many cases, regulated firms will be full-time financial advisers—not themselves regulators, but part-timers in relation to reading and understanding the rule books. It is therefore essential that when something is not understood, the individuals or firms concerned can seek rapid clarification and guidance. That is in everyone's interest. If a charge is levied, it could be a barrier.

<P>
It is reasonable for the FSA, when setting its fees, to build in provision for answering queries and giving guidance. In a clause that we considered less than an hour ago, we decided that when setting its fees, the authority should supply details of the expected expenditure to be covered by them. It should also build in an allowance for people seeking clarification. Does the Minister envisage that the authority will use the charging provision frequently? Perhaps she will tell us a little about the circumstances in which it will be used.

<P>
We should bear in mind that in that respect the FSA will be a monopoly supplier. There will be no-one else to whom people can turn; it will be the one regulator, and the regulated community will by definition be tied to the FSA. Firms must be authorised by the FSA, and are in that sense captive. It is therefore important that, where possible, charges are not levied, and that they are levied only in defined circumstances and at a reasonable level.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I second the views of my right hon. Friend. The crucial point is that we seek to provide under subsection (3) the free availability of general guidance. We can debate whether the wording fully achieves that. That is the principal that we are after and we feel that the regulator himself would welcome it to avoid confusion.

<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> Can the Economic Secretary say whether a firm that is subject to value added tax can be charged for asking HM Customs and Excise for guidance on the operation of VAT?

<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> The amendment draws attention to questions about the FSA's ability to charge for specific guidance given in response to a request from a firm. It is clear from the recently published policy paper that the FSA's current policy is not to charge for specific guidance under clause 127(3)(c). The paper states that

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``individual guidance will continue to be given on a relatively informal basis and without charge''.
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
It is good for the firm and the regulator, therefore for consumers, for the FSA to be engaged in regular dialogue with the firms that it regulates, to ensure compliance with the rules. In many respects this communication should be covered by part of what might be described as the overhead authorisation charge, which would be recovered under the FSA's fee-raising powers under paragraph 17 to schedule 1 of the Bill.

<P>
Two concerns, however, do have some weight, and point to our retaining paragraph (c) to enable the FSA to charge for specific guidance. The first, which was raised by the industry, is about potential cross-subsidy. Where different sectors had their own regulators, this was not much of an issue. But it is not difficult to imagine that some sectors or classes of firm may in future seek guidance more often than others. While I understand that no-one is actively trying to discourage particular categories of authorised person from seeking guidance, there is thought to be a need to ensure that the costs are allocated on a fair basis: this could include the introduction of a specific charge for guidance.

<P>
The industry's second point was that it would not wish the FSA to be forced to use its discretion and refuse guidance on the basis of excessive cost. It pointed to the example of a firm that was developing a complex new product—perhaps a derivative product—which could raise questions on which the firm wanted the regulator's views before launching it commercially. In such circumstances, the industry thought that it would be desirable for a firm to pay for relevant advice. Indeed, although this has not been common practice, some self-regulatory organisations under the Financial Services Act 1986 have in the past arranged with firms that they should provide complex guidance only if the firms agreed to cover the regulator's costs. If the FSA refused to give advice, firms would probably need to take further professional advice, for which they would be charged anyway.

<P>
A further concern of the FSA's is that it cannot predict the number of inquiries that it will receive from the authorised community. But, with its open approach to giving guidance, it is concerned that costs might rise as it attempts to cope with demand, so it will need to be able to provide adequate resources to deal with inquiries. Having a charging mechanism available on a ``user pays'' basis would enable the authority to devise a better mechanism for reducing the amount of routine inquiries and/or cover its costs for responding to them rather than simply increasing fees for the whole regulated community. I hope that I have helped the Committee by describing the way the FSA envisages using its powers to charge for specific guidance.

<P>
I repeat that the general presumption, for the time being, is that the FSA will not charge. I hope, therefore, that hon. Members will withdraw amendment No. 387.

<P>

<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I cannot help noticing that the Minister has not answered my question. Is there a precedent for charging for this type of advice, or is this the first time that it has appeared in statute?

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I have just cited the arrangements that were introduced under the Financial Services Act 1986 and its provisions on innovatory products and the activities of individual regulators. I assume that that constitutes a precedent: it certainly happened under the 1986 Act.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Is it or is it not the intention that the FSA publish openly items of general guidance on this matter? That remains unclear.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> Yes, I made that point at some length earlier this morning.

<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I apologise. I must have missed what the Minister said, but I am still not absolutely clear about it. Is she saying that similar charging systems exist at present? Can Customs charge for VAT advice? I was not aware of that.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I should like to help the Minister. As an ex-Paymaster General, I can confirm to my right hon. and learned Friend that no charges are usually made when people seek clarification or guidance about the rule, so this provision is a new departure.

<P>
The Minister's responses have been inadequate in several respects. If the FSA issues a huge volume of opaque rule changes and the markets respond in the only way they can—by seeking guidance—they may be hit by a charge. There is thus no incentive for the FSA to get it right. We want to put maximum pressure on the authority to make its rules simple and transparent. That should minimise the necessary guidance.

<P>
I am inclined to press the matter to a Division. We shall return to charging later in the Bill or on Report, but at this stage I remain uneasy about placing another obligation on the regulated community to pay charges when it merely seeks clarification to avoid breaking the rules. There is nowhere else to go. It would be an unfortunate deterrent if small firms failed to seek clarification and guidance because of the extra expense. They are effectively paying twice: once through the fee structure and again through discretionary charges that could be levied.

<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> The objective of the amendments is to give a person a safe harbour with regard to the potential contravention of any rules if he complies with the FSA's general guidance or with the particular guidance that it gave him. The wording of the two amendments overlaps. I shall, therefore, withdraw amendment No. 388 and leave amendment No. 428 standing because it says roughly the same as amendment No. 388, but in a more compressed form.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> If the hon. Gentleman withdraws the lead amendment, we cannot debate the one that has been grouped with it. It would help the Committee if he withdrew it later.

<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> I had assumed that amendment No. 428 superseded amendment No. 388, so I shall address myself primarily to amendment No. 428. That obviously fits in with the hon. Gentleman's thinking.

<P>
Both amendments raise the interesting question of whether a particular status should attach to the FSA's guidance on rules. This is another issue that has attracted comment, and members of the Committee will no doubt recall that Lord Burns's Joint Committee specifically considered it. The Joint Committee did not recommend any absolute safe harbours for compliance with guidance. Its reasoning was that providing an absolute safe harbour risked opening up the potential for loopholes and abuse, and I entirely agree. Indeed, even in the US, under the much-vaunted no-action letter procedure, formal status does not attach to the issue of a no-action letter.

<P>
That is not to say that guidance cannot be relied on—far from it. Guidance already carries weight and, in practice, already plays a role in our regulatory system. If someone acts in accordance with, for example, the FSA's general guidance or, in appropriate cases, individually issued guidance, I find it hard to see how the FSA could then reasonably take action. If it did, the tribunal would be interested to hear about it.

<P>
In its policy statement of September 1999 on giving guidance and waivers, the FSA itself clearly says of general guidance that

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``if a firm acts in accordance with general guidance in the circumstances contemplated by that guidance, then the FSA will proceed on the footing that it has complied with the aspect of the rule to which the guidance refers''.
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
In respect of individual guidance, the paper says:

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the FSA would not take regulatory action against a firm for behaviour in line with current written guidance to it in the circumstances contemplated by the guidance''.
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
It is pretty clear that the guidance is taken seriously.

<P>
There are other reasons why it could be inappropriate to give guidance special status. There might, for example, be particular difficulties with individual guidance, such as telephone guidance. If we were to ascribe guidance a special status in such a case, the system could lose flexibility and informality.

<P>
It is vital to the efficiency of the new regime that there is an open and responsive dialogue between the FSA and those whom it regulates. We expect the everyday operation of the system to be flexible and informal. That means that, in appropriate cases, we envisage firms or their advisers being able to ring the FSA with a query and to discuss over the telephone its general approach and views on a particular matter. We would not want to do anything that could impact adversely on that arrangement.

<P>
There is a danger that ascribing a more formal status to guidance, and to individual guidance in particular, could create on overly legalistic and formal approach, which would tend towards a climate of carefully choreographed contact between regulator and regulated. That would have a negative effect on the FSA's willingness and ability to give quick and informal guidance.

<P>
As the Government noted in response to the Joint Committee, the combination of high-level, detailed and evidential rules and non-binding guidance gives the FSA a range of tools, which could be weakened by changing the status of guidance.

<P>
I appreciate that amendment No. 428 appears to be broadly similar to the change that we proposed in relation to compliance with the market abuse code under part VII. However, there are key differences between the nature and purpose of the general guidance on rules on the one hand and the market abuse code on the other.

<P>
The market abuse code is concerned with interpretation of the primary legislation. It is inevitably widely drawn, as are similar laws elsewhere. It sets the outer boundary to the mischief of market abuse. That will not change over time. The purpose of the code was to provide greater certainty from the outset as to what is and what is not market abuse. The code can also change in the light of market developments. The FSA cannot, of course, change the definition of market abuse, because it is in the primary legislation. Nor can it make rules to underpin it.

<P>
We decided, therefore, in the light of consultation and of the Joint Committee's recommendations, that there were good arguments for giving the market abuse code an enhanced status. If it perceives the need to create greater certainty, the FSA can change its rules. The arguments for giving general guidance further weight are not as compelling as the case for giving the market abuse code greater weight. I hope that in the light of my remarks the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> We are pleased to note that it is intended that the FSA should follow a policy that there will not be a contravention of any rule where an individual had complied with general or specific guidance. While understanding some of the reasons why the Government do not want this to be in the Bill, we feel that there are some powerful arguments in the other direction. It is implicit that in the event of a dispute any such guidance would have to be proven, and therefore it is almost certain to be in the form of the written word.

<P>
In recent years, firms that have employed lawyers and aggressively proved that they acted in accordance with guidance from the FSA have won their argument and others, that have acted in accordance with the guidance but have chosen not to fight have for somewhat superficial reasons agreed to fines. That is wrong. There is a principle here analogous to the market abuse code. We cannot see that the arguments against it being in the Bill outweigh the positive arguments of making it absolutely clear. We do not wish to withdraw the principle. We will withdraw amendment No. 388 but we would like to vote on amendment No. 428. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

We are also interested to know whether the Government have any proposals to beef up the Office of Fair Trading in relation to the responsibilities given under the Bill. As the Committee will know, we previously proposed changes to make competition an objective and we feel that our amendments may offer a better way of doing that. Amendment No. 473 would require the Office of Fair Trading to report on policies as well as practices. As reflected in amendment No. 474, we see the need to include practices and policies in relation to the FSA's general duties, as well as its functions.

<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> Chapter III of part IX contains the arrangements for the competition scrutiny of the FSA's rules and practices by the Director General of Fair Trading. The provisions in this chapter are based on those in chapter XIV of part I of the Financial Services Act 1986.

<P>
However, we are taking this opportunity to extend the current arrangements to all areas of the FSA's activity. So, for example, the rules which the FSA makes to regulate banks, building societies and insurance companies will, for the first time, be subject to checks of their effects on competition. We believe that these arrangements for external scrutiny, coupled with the obligations which the Bill places on the FSA in its internal rule-making and regulatory processes, provide a robust and sound system for ensuring that competition concerns are given their full weight.

<P>
We have, however, reviewed the Bill in the light of Don Cruickshank's helpful interim report of his review of banking services in the United Kingdom. As a result, we have identified a number of further improvements that will strengthen the internal and external arrangements. I shall come to these as we discuss the clauses in this chapter. However, it might be useful at this point for me to remind the Committee of the rationale underlying the provisions of the chapter.

<P>
The starting point is our commitment to facilitating competition generally. Competition is one of the main drivers of economic growth and prosperity, leading to greater efficiency, innovation and choice. Greater competition at home is the key to greater competitiveness abroad. However, competition is not the be all and end all. If it were, we should not need a financial services regulator. The point of regulation is that there are issues to be addressed that cannot be dealt with by competition alone.

<P>
To take an extreme example, it could be argued that the entire system of authorisation is a barrier to competition, in that it prevents firms that might otherwise do so from entering the financial services industry. However, no one would seriously argue that authorisation should be abandoned for that reason.

<P>
The FSA will have good reason for wanting to keep certain firms out of the industry. Those firms' entering the industry would be bad for consumers and, by damaging consumer confidence, bad for the industry as a whole. When firms are within the regulatory fold, it is right that they should be allowed to carry on certain activities only within a regulatory framework. If consumers and markets are to be protected, financial services firms must, for example, have proper systems and controls in place and must have adequate financial resources.

<P>
The key point is that while the consumer is the ultimate beneficiary of competition, to secure this benefit he also needs to feel confident that he is not dealing in a market in which he is exposed to unethical, incompetent or unacceptably risky behaviour. For that confidence, he will look to the regulatory system.

<P>
In clause 2 we have set out the FSA's four objectives: the protection of consumers, market confidence, public awareness and the reduction of financial crime. These are the aims of regulation, the raison d'etre of the FSA. In meeting these objectives, the FSA may have to make rules or adopt policies that potentially impede or distort competition, such as imposing conditions on the way in which people can carry out financial services business. In order to ensure that, where it impacts on competition, regulation does not place burdens on firms or create market distortions greater than is necessary to achieve the regulatory objectives, the Bill puts in place both internal and external constraints.

<P>
I shall quickly outline the internal constraints, before turning to the external oversight arrangements with which this chapter is concerned. It is important to understand the way in which the two work together. There will inevitably be a number of ways in which the FSA could achieve its objectives. In making its choice, the FSA will have the duty of paying regard to what we referred to earlier as ``principles'', which are contained in clause 2(3). The objectives are about the purpose of regulation, and the principles are about the manner of regulation.

<P>
I am sure that Committee members are familiar with the principles, but I shall remind them of clause 2(3)(f), which contains the competition principle. That subsection states:

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``In discharging its general functions the Authority must have regard to . . . the principle that competition between authorised persons should not be impeded or distorted unnecessarily.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
We fully agree with Don Cruickshank, who said that it is essential to get right the regulator's statutory duties. As he said, they drive the way in which the regulator recruits, organises and rewards its staff.

<P>
We are therefore reviewing the principle's operation—we said that we would do so in earlier debates—to ensure that it will constrain the FSA in the way in which we intend that to be done. The intention is that the FSA should be committed to choosing the regulatory solutions that appear to it to have the least anti-competitive outcome that is consistent with the need to protect consumers. We will in due course bring forward any necessary amendments.

<P>
In addition to the duty that will be placed on it by clause 2(3), the FSA will, of course, have to consult under clause 125 on any proposed rules and policy statements that are provided for in the Bill. We are proposing to make a change that will bolster further the consultation arrangements, which are part of the processes that the regulator goes through.

<P>
We propose to bring forward amendments to make it clear that a cost-benefit analysis that is produced during the consultation process will cover the direct costs to regulated businesses and the wider economic costs.

<P>
As was (mentioned in the debate on clause 125, clause 125(7) currently has the effect of limiting the meaning of costs to compliance costs that are incurred by regulated firms in complying with the rules in question. We propose to widen that requirement—the new definition will include the effects of a rule or policy on competition in the financial services industry generally.

<P>
We also plan to ask the FSA to produce an analysis in its annual report of the effect of its rules on competition in the financial services market. The market changes over time and what is appropriate at one point may no longer be so at another, given market developments. The FSA will obviously need to address that on an on-going basis. Asking it to report on that matter in its annual report simply reinforces that requirement.

<P>
Those two changes will help to ensure that the FSA will continue to give competition considerations their full weight when formulating rules and policies and in their day-to-day regulatory activities.

<P>
The other side of the coin involves the external competition scrutiny arrangements, which we have put in place. That matter is the subject of chapter III of part IX, which we are currently considering. The reason for having that special regime is simple. If we did not have it, there would be no external scrutiny of FSA rules and practices. The Competition Act 1998 does not cover the rule-making functions of statutory bodies. The fact that we have this special regime is testament to the importance that we attach to competition in the financial services sector. It is important to have external scrutiny, but I would expect it to be called into play infrequently.

<P>
The FSA's own processes, which are highly transparent under the Bill provisions, form, as it were, the first line of defence in ensuring that competition is given full weight. The provisions of this part of the Bill form the second line of defence.

<P>
I suggest that we should debate the relevant mechanics in subsequent clauses. Broadly speaking, the procedure is that the Director General of Fair Trading has a duty to report to the Treasury on rules or practices of the FSA that are significantly anti-competitive. The Treasury then decides whether the rules are justified. We are proposing to make some changes to the arrangements in the light of Don Cruickshank's report, but I will deal with those matters when they come up.

<P>
The purpose of the clause is to define the scope of the competition scrutiny regime, by clarifying what falls within it. It brings within the regime all rules, standing guidance, statements of principle or practice, or codes issued by the FSA. Those matters are classified as being ``regulating provisions''.

<P>
The competition scrutiny arrangements also cover the ``practices'' of the FSA, which in this respect mean the procedures and methods that the FSA may adopt in carrying out its functions.

<P>
Finally, this clause makes it clear that regulating provisions or practices are regarded as having a significant anti-competitive effect if they have, or are intended or likely to have, to any significant extent, the effect of preventing, distorting or restricting competition.

<P>
I have described the background to this important and sometimes misunderstood area, and I hope to be able to deal with the relevant amendments at rather less length. Amendment No. 473—

<P>

<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Atkinson. The Committee is grateful to the Minister for giving such a long and detailed background statement. Would not it be preferable if we were supplied with that statement beforehand, so that we could have time to digest it? The statement is massive and deals with general principles; it does not directly relate to the amendment.

<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> That is not a point of order, but a matter for the Economic Secretary, who will have heard what has been said.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I have already made the statement, so the question of what might have been has passed us by.

<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> On several previous occasions, the Economic Secretary has read into the record long statements on detailed matters. I made the point that it would be enormously helpful if such statements could be made available beforehand, so that we could have time to consider them, and I believe that she said that she would do her best in that regard. She has made not merely a few additional references to a particular clause, but a very thorough Treasury statement of the Government's position.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I will continue to do my best to meet the hon. Gentleman's request.

<P>
With regard to amendment No. 473, I fully agree that the competition scrutiny arrangements should cover the FSA's policies. I am pleased to say that such provision is already made in the clause. The clause will cover policy statements made by the FSA under the Bill, whether they are statements that are required to be issued—for example, statements on penalty policy—or issued as guidance. In any case, to discuss policies in abstract terms is not particularly helpful; we are concerned instead with what the FSA will actually do. This will include what the clause refers to as ``practices'': the publication of documents such as rules and codes and the manner in which it carries out the day-to-day regulation of firms.

<P>
Those practices may not necessarily be written down, but may emerge over time as a result of the way in which the FSA approaches its tasks. Clearly, effect will be given to such internal policies—for want of a better description—through the FSA's practices. As such, they will already be susceptible to competition scrutiny. Therefore, the competition scrutiny regime will cover those practices that reflect policy and principles formally set out by the FSA, as well as any informal practices.

<P>
Although I understand and sympathise with the purpose of amendment No. 473—

<P>
THE CHAIRMAN'S attention having been called to the fact that nine Members were not present, he suspended the proceedings; and other Members having come into the room and nine Members being present, the proceedings were resumed.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I will start at the beginning of the paragraph that I had begun.

<P>
Although I understand and sympathise with the purpose of amendment No. 473, I hope that Opposition Members will agree to withdraw it, in the light of my reassurances that the Bill already deals with the matter. I also hope that they will agree to withdraw amendment No. 474. The answer to their point is that reference to the FSA's functions will include its general duties under clause 2.

<P>
As I have said, the competition scrutiny regime will provide a second line of defence, in addition to the FSA's internal processes. That will help to ensure that the FSA complies with its general duty in relation to the competition principle.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight rose—</B><P>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Before the hon. Gentleman replies, I should say that, as has been pointed out, the Economic Secretary's statement has ranged widely, which is never helpful to the Committee's proceedings.

<P>
If hon. Members want to respond in a wider way, that is acceptable, so long as they do not want a clause stand part debate later.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> The opportunity to give a wider response to the Minister's statement—for which I thank her—would indeed be valuable, but I should like to read and digest it before I do so. I therefore hope that we can relate the matter to a later clause or return to it on Report.

<P>
As we have said, we would still prefer competition to be elevated to an objective. Apparently, the best that the Government can do is to beef up the use of competition and the disciplining of the FSA in relation to not acting in an anti-competitive fashion. I am not sure whether the Minister responded to my question about whether the Government intend to beef up the Office of Fair Trading to cope with that territory. Perhaps I did not hear her reply.

<P>
In response to the Minister's comments on our amendments, there is a subtle point in relation to the words ``policy'' and ``practices''. The Minister described practices as being policy put into action. Some issues of policy, which have not yet become practices, may be a direction in which the FSA seeks to take its regulatory powers under the Bill. Given the Minister's assurance that, for the purposes of the Bill, the word ``practices'' is intended to include ``policy'', and the word ``functions'' is intended to include the general duties laid down in the Bill, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 475, in page 59, line 21, at end insert

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`or prejudicing the competitive position of the United Kingdom'.
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss amendment No. 477, in Clause 130, page 59, line 32, at end insert

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`or the competitive position of the United Kingdom'.
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> The amendments raise the same issue as the previous group of amendments. They concern the reporting function of the Office of Fair Trading to the Treasury and the notices that the authority makes in response. The references to competition in clauses 129 and 130 appear to be limited to domestic competition. We believe that it has always been understood, as in clause 2(3), that the territory of competition includes not prejudicing—indeed, potentially enhancing—the competitive position of the United Kingdom. The amendments would ensure that that aspect of competition is included in both clauses.

<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I listened carefully to the Minister's long statement about the previous group of amendments. I endorse the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester: it is essential that long and important policy statements of that kind are provided in advance so that we can have serious debates about them.

<P>
Insofar as it was possible to take in the statement—which the Minister read clearly but at understandably high speed—it appears that, on a Pepper v. Hart basis, the incorporation of the amendments will affect part of the substantive construction of the clause. As I understand it, amendment No. 475 would also have that effect. The Minister should accept the amendments because they express, in only 15 words or so, an important part of the 15-minute statement that she read into the record. I hope that she will clarify the matter by saying that the incorporation of amendment No. 475 into clause 129 is comprehended by her statement. If she says that it is not, we should be given an opportunity to read the statement before we debate the matter further.

<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> The amendments raise interesting points. I am grateful to the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs, but I hope that I can persuade him that they are unnecessary.

<P>
Clause 129 defines a significant anti-competitive effect as one that has

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``to any significant extent the effect of preventing, restricting or distorting competition.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
Amendment No. 475 would widen that definition to include

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``prejudicing the competitive position of the United Kingdom''.
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>

{**?twb=.30w**}I have no doubt about the importance of the FSA having regard to the competitive position of the United Kingdom—we have inserted such a provision in clause 2(3), which requires the FSA to have regard to

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the international character of financial services . . . and the desirability of maintaining the competitive position of the United Kingdom''.
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
Therefore, although I have sympathy with the aim of amendment No. 475, it is unnecessary. If the FSA were to regulate in an anti-competitive way, it would undoubtedly impact on the competitive position of the UK, given the competitiveness of the global marketplace in financial services.

<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> Can the Minister imagine any circumstances in which global competitiveness could be enhanced, which would restrict domestic competition?

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I do not think that the Bill should have regard to that. The question needs to be considered from the other way round, which is how we are addressing it. We have already covered the matter in clause 2(3).

<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> Is the Economic Secretary saying that the inclusion of amendment No. 475 would have exactly the same effect as clause 2(3)? If so, I am not sure that I agree with her.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> If the FSA were to regulate in an anti-competitive way, it would undoubtedly impact on the competitive position of the UK. Clause 2(3) covers that, so there is no need for a separate provision.

<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> If there were an anti-competitive effect on different providers in the United Kingdom, which had no effect on our competitiveness abroad, how would that be covered?

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> It is just about possible that international competitiveness might pull the other way from competition concerns in the short term. In such circumstances, we would want competition concerns to come out on top, as that would be in the longer term interests of competition and competitiveness. I shall provide a somewhat fanciful example to illustrate that point. The FSA might favour applications by firms seeking to do international business in a particular market, at the expense of firms seeking to do the same business in the domestic market. The Director General of Fair Trading would investigate the matter and would undoubtedly find it to be an uncompetitive practice. Under the Bill, it would be up to Treasury Ministers to decide whether the practice was nevertheless justified for a permitted purpose. The permitted purposes set out in clause 132 are the protection of the users of financial services, maintaining confidence in the financial system, and ensuring compliance with an international obligation of the United Kingdom. The international competitive position of the UK is not such a permitted purpose. Ministers could not therefore say that a rule was justified on that ground alone. That is how it should be—it is not the FSA's job to promote UK competitiveness at the cost of properly functioning competitive markets.

<P>

<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Although I am pleased to note that the Economic Secretary believes that the Bill covers international competitiveness and domestic competition, clause 2(3) uses the word ``competition'' in connection with the domestic marketplace and the principle that domestic competition should not be impeded. The international position is described separately:

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the international character of financial services and markets and the desirability of maintaining the competitive position of the United Kingdom''.
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
The Office of Fair Trading is used to looking at matters of domestic competition and not the extent to which the UK is competitive in international markets. I cannot see why the Government should object to adding the amendments, which make it absolutely clear that the OFT has a duty to look at and report on what the FSA is doing in relation to international competitiveness. The Bill does not make that clear.
