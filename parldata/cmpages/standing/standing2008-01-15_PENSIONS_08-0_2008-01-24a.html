Selous:
						</b> Amendment No. 136 was tabled in the same spirit
that informed some of our earlier debates around pay-as-you-earn:
trying to simplify things for employers, and making the administration
of personal accounts as small a burden as possible for
employers.</div>
					<a name="08012476000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">I fully
accept that the pensions regulator will need access to information
about personal account schemes that are set up by employers up and down
the country. The purpose of this amendment is to determine whether
there is a less burdensome way for employers to get that information to
the pensions regulator. The assumption underlying the amendment is that
there is, or could be, an information gateway between Her
Majesty&#146;s Customs and Revenue and the regulator. Can the
Minister confirm that?</div>

							<a name="08012476000196"></a>Andrew
Selous:
						</b> The Minister is helpfully nodding at me, so I will
assume that that is the case or that it could easily be the case,
although I do not wish to pre-empt anything that he might say when he
replies.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column208" />Column number: 208</div>
					<a name="08012476000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">Putting that to one side for a
moment, the Minister may well be aware that Sir David Varney conducted
a review into integrated government in late 2006. The proposal that
information could be routed through HMRC to the pensions regulator was
exactly the type of recommendation that he had in mind when he wrote
that report. The amendment would make life a lot
easier.</div>
					<a name="08012476000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">We should not
lose sight of the extra regulatory burden, in terms of both cost and
time, that will be put on employers, especially smaller ones. We all
agree that this is something that should be done and that the cost is
worth while for the result that we all hope to see: many millions more
people with a decent pension income in retirement. It is important,
however, that we do not inflict any unnecessary burdens on the economy,
which is set for a slightly more problematic year.</div>
					<a name="08012476000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is the purpose behind this
amendment, which arises from a recommendation made by the Institute of
Chartered Accountants in England and Wales. The institute&#146;s
members audit employers up and down the country and are very familiar
with processes of transferring information. They are also well aware of
the needs of employers and businesses. I hope that what I am
proposing&#151;even if not in the exact form of words used in
amendment No. 136&#151;will find favour with the
Minister.</div>
					<a name="08012476000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="08012476000197"></a>
							<b class="B">Paul
Rowen</b> (Rochdale) (LD): I support the comments made by the
hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire about the inclusion of HMRC. We
all want to ensure that information is collected and made available as
simply and straightforwardly as possible without being a burden to
employers, especially small employers.</div>
					<a name="08012476000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to speak primarily to
amendment No. 88, which has been suggested by the TUC. I hope that it
will find favour with the Government. It would ensure that all pension
schemes were properly registered with the pensions regulator. Although
the vast majority of employers will run excellent schemes that benefit
their employees, it is a sad fact&#151;as we have seen in relation to
people with second pensions&#151;that there has been some mis-selling
and people have lost out. A very tiny proportion of employers might
seek to have a scheme that does not meet the best objectives of the
Bill. All we are asking is that each scheme is properly registered with
the regulator.</div>
					<a name="08012476000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
will obviously have to be a change to the way in which the regulator
operates. I know there has been some discussion about whether the
regulator or HMRC should have that role. The Government have taken the
view that it should be the pensions regulator, and that body will need
beefing up and to change. The amendment just seeks to ensure that
registration is one of the first things to happen to a scheme.
Therefore, the compliance mechanism that the pensions regulator will
introduce would ensure that all employers, not just the best ones,
would meet the standards that we expect.</div>
					<a name="08012476000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012476000198"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:
						</b> May I confirm to the hon. Member for South-West
Bedfordshire that I have the agreement of HMRC and its Ministers to
share the required information, particularly on the numbers of people
who are employers? To carry out the exercise, we will 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column209" />Column number: 209</div>need to know who are employers and who has a pension scheme. As a
result, we will know who has not registered as having a pension scheme
and whether they are an employer who has not registered. That is a
crucial piece of
information.</div>
					<a name="08012476000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">This will
work by the employer registering with the regulator on the internet to
say that they have a pension scheme and what it is. That should be a
fairly straightforward way of giving the information. They will not
need to register with HMRC, just with the regulator. Most of them will
be able to do it on the internet, but if they do not have that
facility, other facilities will be available. They will be able to
ensure that the information is provided. HMRC will be able to say who
is registered as an employer and we can then compare the data. That
sort of information exchange can be carried out fairly
straightforwardly.</div>
					<a name="08012476000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
very much appreciated the straightforward way in which the hon.
Gentleman spoke to amendment  No. 136. The amendment would make
HMRC responsible for collecting the information from employers, while
the responsibility for delivering the rest of the compliance regime
would rest with the pensions regulator. Involving two bodies in the
compliance regime would result in not reduced costs, but increased
costs and additional IT system requirements, because the two
organisations would need to be equipped to work with employers on
different aspects of the compliance regime. It could also result in an
increased burden for employers, who might have to deal with both HMRC
and the pensions regulator in relation to the new duties. We would
rather keep the obligation on employers to deal with HMRC as they have
always done, while dealing with the pensions regulator in relation to
the new duties. Employers would know that on pensions they were to deal
with the pensions regulator. That is fairly
straightforward.</div>
					<a name="08012476000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
practice, most employers running pension schemes should have to do very
little other than to inform the regulator that they have a
self-certified pension scheme. That would be one that takes them
outside the requirement for registration for personal accounts, or one
involving an alternative kind of pension scheme. The system should be
fairly straightforward for the
employer.</div>
					<a name="08012476000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
understand that amendment No. 88 has been sponsored by the TUC. While
we all have a great deal of respect for the TUC, I think that here it
is just clarifying the requirement that every employer must register
their qualifying pension scheme with the regulator. We intend that in
any event, but we would rather achieve it through regulations, and have
the obligations set out for employers in regulations. That would be the
better way of dealing with
this.</div>
					<a name="08012476000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given
the reassurance that we intend to have a fairly easy way for employers
to register their pension scheme with the regulator, I hope that that
the hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire will withdraw the
amendment.</div>

Division.</div>
					<a name="08012476000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
was never our intention that there should be two bodies with which
employers had to deal in respect of personal accounts. The Minister has
given the Committee an assurance on the sharing of information between
the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column210" />Column number: 210</div>two bodies, and I am satisfied that that will reduce the burden on
employers. I beg to ask to ask leave to withdraw the

Selous:
						</b> As we are dealing with clause 9, I think that it
would be apposite to ask the Minister to say a little about the
provision of resources for the pensions regulator. Obviously, the body
will have to deal with a vastly increased number of pension schemes and
will be responsible for a very different landscape. How will the
pensions regulator be geared up to deal with that, and how will it be
financed and
resourced?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012476000201"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:
						</b> We took the view that the pensions
regulator&#151;TPR&#151;was the best organisation to carry out this
work. It has a very good reputation with the pensions industry and is
broadly supported. However, it does a different job from the one that
we are now asking it to do, so the hon. Gentleman is right to press me
on how it will carry out its
duties.</div>
					<a name="08012476000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are in
discussions with TPR about the new budget that it will require. It has
been allocated the role relatively recently, and it is scoping what it
will need. The way in which it will develop its procedures will be, to
some extent, dependent on the outcome of the Bill. Assuming it passes
broadly intact, the regulator will be in a position to look at what
extra facilities and staff it needs. Then, during the course of this
year and probably into next year, we will be doing detailed work on its
budget. The straight answer is that some of this is still to be
decided.</div>
					<a name="08012476000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are,
however, very conscious that we are asking TPR to carry out a different
role. It has an excellent reputation for what it currently does, and we
expect that to carry over to the new work. The role will not be highly
burdensome. It is not anticipated that TPR will interfere with the work
of employers or cause lots of regulatory problems for them. There will
be a simple model whereby TPR will deal with specific complaints and
cases in which it is clear that someone is registered as an employer
with HMRC, but not with TPR. TPR will then aim to find out whether that
was an oversight by the employer, who will be asked to register. No
penalty for late registration is envisaged. If the employer still
failed to register, they would be given reminders, and then some of the
penalties would be brought into
effect.</div>
					<a name="08012476000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">In terms of
the organisation of TPR, we will need a basic structure to get the
information and an administrative structure to ensure that contact with
employers can be established in cases in which people are not
registered as having a scheme. We also need to be able to take action,
if that should become necessary. I am sorry that I cannot give much
more detail, but the hon. Gentleman will understand that we are still
in the business of trying to establish the scope of the work that TPR
will do.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column211" />Column number: 211</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012476000202"></a>Paul
Rowen:
						</b> I am grateful for the Minister&#146;s comments.
It is important that the Bill goes through, and then we can work
towards setting up the system. He spoke about problems with
non-compliance, and clearly the regulator has a very different role now
from the one that it will have. We might be dealing with a whole
battery of different types of employers who have not previously had
contact with the pensions regulator. Has he considered what additional
powers the regulator might need to carry out that particular
function?</div>
					<a name="08012476000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012476000203"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:
						</b> TPR will need new powers, some of which are
flagged up in the Bill. The detail of the administrative steps that TPR
will be able to take to deal with recalcitrant employers will be
developed, in regulations, in due course. We will have opportunities
later in our proceedings to consider some of the
issues.</div>
					<a name="08012476000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">The aim is to
ensure that TPR is satisfied that it will have sufficient powers to
carry out its duties and to deal with recalcitrant employers who simply
refuse to register or to provide a pension scheme. It should have
access to the appropriate penalties, or be able to bring into effect
procedures that will result in those penalties. Hopefully, employers
will see that there is a fairly straightforward system under which we
know who the employers are and who is registered, and we then identify
those who have failed to register, tell them that they need to do so,
and, if they do not, draw up sanctions to deal with that. The regime is
fairly straightforward but, as the hon. Gentleman says, we will need to
put in place the capacity for the administrative steps and penalties
that will be necessary for those who fail to
comply.</div>

							<a name="08012476000207"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:
						</b> Clause 10(2) has been drafted to give effect to
the Government&#146;s policy of enabling employers to phase in the
requirements of employers&#146; duties so that they can better manage
the additional costs that the reforms will bring. Consultation with
small employers demonstrated that there was keen support for the
phasing of the requirements. In particular, the Federation of Small
Businesses&#151;I note that its member is in his place in Committee
Room&#151;responded positively by saying that it welcomed the phasing
in of the
contribution.</div>
					<a name="08012476000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
the clause as drafted did not give employers certainty about the
phasing arrangements that they would need so that they could start
planning how they would discharge their duties. We have thus tabled one
amendment and two new clauses to give employers a greater degree of
certainty about the phasing arrangements for their qualifying
schemes.</div>
					<a name="08012476000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
138 proposes removing the broad power that would allow the Secretary of
State to set out regulations on how employers&#146; duties would be
phased in over a transitional period. The amendment will facilitate the
introduction of the two new clauses, which set out the phasing
arrangements for employers operating qualifying
schemes.</div>
					<a name="08012476000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 12
will improve on clause 10(2) by giving employers that operate
qualifying money purchase schemes the certainty that they need to plan
how to manage any additional costs associated with their new duties.
The phasing arrangements, which have been welcomed by employers&#146;
representatives, involve a three-stage increase in the minimum
contributions required of money purchase schemes. Essentially, with a
direct contribution or money purchase scheme, the system is phased in
over three years, with a percentage increase in each year. New clause
12 establishes that contributions in the first phase must be at least 2
per cent. of qualifying earnings, with at least 1 per cent. coming from
employers. That will rise to 5 per cent. in the second phase, of which
the employer must pay at least 2 per cent. Finally, the contributions
will reach their permanent level of 8 per cent., including a 3 per
cent. contribution by the employer. This will mean that employers will
be able to meet the additional contribution costs in a series of
steps&#151;they will be given time to phase in the
change.</div>
					<a name="08012476000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 13
sets out our intention to allow employers using the other main kinds of
pension scheme&#151;defined benefit and hybrid schemes&#151;to be
able to adjust gradually to the costs of the reforms. Existing
legislation requires that defined benefit and hybrid schemes maintain
appropriate funding for their liabilities. So, in effect, the scheme in
new clause 12 of phasing in the amounts that employers would have to
pay would not be able to work because the obligation on employers would
be to maintain the appropriate funding level for their liabilities.
However, employers must not reduce the contributions that they are
committed to pay. Any provision that allowed employers to phase in
contributions would interfere with the existing rules of the schemes
and open up risks of under-funding. As such, it is not possible for
employers with defined benefit or hybrid schemes to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column213" />Column number: 213</div>pay reduced contributions in the same way as new clause 12 will allow
employers using money purchase schemes to
do.</div>
					<a name="08012476000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">For those reasons,
new clause 13 sets out an alternative approach. Employers offering
final salary or hybrid schemes will be permitted to delay automatic
enrolment into such a scheme for those jobholders who are eligible to
join, but have not yet chosen to do so. They must automatically enrol
those jobholders by the end of the transitional phasing scheme. Those
who are currently in employment and have chosen, despite this being
available to them, not to join a defined benefit or hybrid scheme would
thus not have to be enrolled until the end of the transitional period.
They would have already made their judgment: they could have joined,
but decided not to. However, all other jobholders&#151;new workers
and those who were previously ineligible to join the defined benefit or
hybrid scheme&#151;must be automatically enrolled in the usual way at
the start of the phasing period. There will therefore be a three-year
phasing period before which an employer would have to sign up existing
employees who had decided not to join the pension
scheme.</div>
					<a name="08012476000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope the
Committee will feel that, particularly with regard to defined benefit
and hybrid schemes, we have sought to give some flexibility. It is not
possible to do the same for the employers in relation to DB schemes as
it is in relation to DC schemes, but we have tried to provide some
degree of flexibility to allow a certain degree of phasing in. We are
also conscious that, as part of the process of automatically enrolling
employees, we want all new workers enrolled and to ensure that those
who were previously ineligible to join a pension scheme were able to
join one. I hope that hon. Members will be able to agree to both
amendment No. 138 and new clauses 12 and
13.</div>

							<a name="08012476000211"></a>Andrew
Selous:
						</b> Clause 11 is very important, and sets out the band
in which wages will be subject to the personal account scheme. At the
moment, the vast majority of pension schemes use total basic earnings
when they calculate contributions. This is not true in all cases, but
certainly in the vast majority of cases. In my former life, my pension
was calculated on my basic salary, rather than on any additional
payments that I was fortunate enough to be paid from time to
time.</div>
					<a name="08012476000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand
the concern, raised by the TUC and others, that there may be some
employers&#151;unscrupulous or otherwise&#151;who will seek to
avoid paying the correct amount into personal accounts by transferring
what would ordinarily be paid as salary into commission, bonuses and
overtime. I am aware of that, and I would be sympathetic to anything
the Government could do to stop employers doing so, in a way tantamount
to deliberate manipulation of normal commercial practice, with the aim
of not paying the appropriate contributions into personal accounts.
Does the Minister know of any evidence of that sort of avoidance
happening now? Are employers paying remunerations that would ordinarily
be part of salary or wages as commission bonuses or
overtime?</div>
					<a name="08012476000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">How does the
Government currently treat bonuses paid to civil servants and other
public sector workers? The whole area of bonuses in the public sector
is somewhat new to me, but one reads from time to time of significant
bonuses paid to civil servants&#151;not always civil servants who
have done an amazing job. There are one or two examples of people being
given bonuses when that, perhaps, was not justified, but I am sure that
in the vast majority of cases it is richly justified. What happens in
relation to public sector pension schemes where this is current
practice?</div>
					<a name="08012476000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a
worry that clause 11, as drafted, may lead to some form of levelling
down, for the following reason. The administrators of current pension
schemes generally supply the information on the schemes&#146; members
in relation to the basic salary that those individual employees
receive. As I read clause 11, it looks like there is going to be an
onus on the administrators of current pension schemes to get in touch
with employers and find out the exact amount of commission, bonuses and
overtime paid to each employee. Administrators of current pension
schemes will not ordinarily have that information.</div>
					<a name="08012476000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">The requirements of clause 11
will place significant additional burdens on employers who have to
provide the information, information that is likely to change from
month to month because employees and employers cannot say in advance
exactly how much overtime will be worked. Pension scheme providers do
not hold that level of detail on earnings and so the employer will need
to perform the check. If that results 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column215" />Column number: 215</div>in employers getting bogged down in the monthly bureaucracy of having to
provide a pension administrator with that level of detail on the
overtime of every employee, which they currently do not have to do,
some employers might decide that it causes too much difficulty and will
perhaps level down from their current
scheme.</div>
					<a name="08012476000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">A further
complication is that administrators of current pension schemes need to
know whether their scheme meets the quality requirements in clauses 18
to 24, which we will debate shortly. How will they be able to tell
whether their scheme meets those quality requirements if they do not
have to hand that level of detail on overtime, bonuses and commission
that individual employees might be receiving month by month? It will be
complicated, and it will be difficult for them to know whether existing
schemes meet the quality requirements that the Government have quite
properly put in the Bill. I understand exactly why commission, bonuses
and overtime are included here, and I am mindful of the need to prevent
employers deliberately manipulating the way in which they pay their
workers to avoid contributions that they should be making&#151;the
Government would be right to ensure that those contributions were made.
However, there are a number of technical and practical difficulties on
which we need some assurances from the Minister. If he is not able to
give full reassurance now I would be grateful if he would take the
issue away to consider at greater
length.</div>

Rowen:
						</b> The Government, in drafting clause 11, have been
mindful of some of the concerns. We have all talked about wanting to
ensure that we develop a quality scheme that is simple and easy to
administer. As the hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire said, that
has the potential to be a bit of a minefield, which could present some
difficulties. Nevertheless, the safeguard is important for employees,
so that the less scrupulous employer will not see if there is a way of
saving money. Those companies that do not have schemes at the moment
will be introducing a scheme and will have to pay the 3 per cent.
employer&#146;s contribution. If they can switch some of what someone
earns into bonuses or not count overtime as actual
earnings&#151;predominantly affecting those on low pay&#151;that
will enable them to get below the &#163;5,035 threshold, resulting in
less of an employer&#146;s
contribution.</div>
					<a name="08012476000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government have got it right by making sure that the clause is in the
Bill. Nevertheless, I would be interested, as the hon. Gentleman said,
in how they would intend to operate it. Clearly we want an easy-to-use
system, which does not impose too great a regulatory burden on
employers, but the safeguard is important. I support the clause as
currently
written.</div>
					<a name="08012476000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012476000213"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:
						</b> I am grateful to the hon. Member for South-West
Bedfordshire for his amendments, allowing us to look at the clause in
more
detail.</div>
					<a name="08012476000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause defines qualifying earnings by establishing an earnings band,
and by setting the range of pay components for the purposes of
calculating those qualifying earnings. Qualifying earnings, in
conjunction with the minimum 8 per cent. overall level of contributions
for 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column216" />Column number: 216</div>money-purchase saving, as set out in clause 18&#151;which we will come
to&#151;establish the new minimum level for pension saving and
underpin the whole package of reform. Together, they should enable a
median earner with solid state entitlement&#151;a good number of
years&#151;to achieve a retirement income at a replacement rate of
around 45 per cent. Those arrangements, including the minimum employer
contribution of 3 per cent., only work if the calculation is based on
the full value of gross earnings, as was pointed out by the Pensions
Commission in its report of
2005.</div>
					<a name="08012476000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">Pension
contributions need to reflect the full value of underlying earnings if
workers are to stand a real chance of saving for an adequate income in
retirement. However, both amendments Nos. 17 and 19 would reduce the
range of pay components that need to be taken into account when
calculating the minimum level pension contributions due to a worker. On
average, commission, overtime and bonus payments make up around 8 per
cent. of the earnings of those jobholders who will be eligible for
automatic enrolment. If pensionable earnings became limited to basic
pay, as would be the affect of applying the amendments, the overall
value of pension saving would fall. We estimate that the reduction in
savings could be around &#163;900 million a year at a steady state,
once the impact of the phased introduction of the employer duty has
passed through the system. That would mean that people who save
throughout their working lives will fall below the replacement rate
that they are otherwise expecting to
achieve.</div>
					<a name="08012476000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is a
core problem with the hon. Gentleman&#146;s amendment. Although he
said that he supported the obvious intention to deal with any potential
unscrupulous practice by which employers might seek to prevent payment
from qualifying for their contributions to the scheme. In a sense the
hon. Gentleman is trying to have it both ways, by watering down the
protection, which would potentially open up the opportunity for
unscrupulous employers. I think that we have the balance right and that
the affect of the amendment would be to unbalance it in ways that I am
sure he would not
wish.</div>
					<a name="08012476000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some workers
rely on commission and overtime payments. To exclude such pay
components would reduce the benefit of the reforms for such workers.
For example, commission payments often form a significant proportion of
the overall income of those people who work in retail, telesales and
parts of the motor
industry.</div>

pm</div>
					<a name="08012476000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 18 would prevent the Government from being able to react to any pay
practices that developed simply as an attempt to avoid pension
contributions. The hon. Gentleman asked if I thought that that practice
was widespread at the moment, but there is no evidence to suggest that
it is. It is important, when legislating in this way, to anticipate
possible developments and to choke off those that would be undesirable.
The amendment would open up a loophole that could be used for
unscrupulous avoidance by enabling employers to reclassify their
workers&#146; earnings, thereby reducing the contributions that the
employer was required to
pay.</div>
					<a name="08012476000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
core pay components set out in the Bill already cover the majority of
workers&#146; earnings, so any additions 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column217" />Column number: 217</div>to the list are unlikely to have much impact for most employers.
Nevertheless, we want to be able to consider additions such as
allowances that relate to the skills that workers have, or to the
working patterns that they adopt, such as data processing and shift
allowances.</div>
					<a name="08012476000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to
reassure the hon. Gentleman and other hon. Members that we appreciate
that many employers with existing schemes tend to define pensionable
pay using fewer pay components&#151;here I come to his point about
the possible burden. We shall, therefore, provide guidance to help
employers to work out whether their arrangements meet the minimum
requirements. We could perhaps base that on look-up tables and other
simple tests, which should address the point that he rightly raised
about the potential for difficulties in computation. However, I should
add an important point: no employer will be required to change their
definition of pensionable pay because qualification relies on the value
of contributions paid, not the basis on which they are
calculated.</div>
					<a name="08012476000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">At
present, the median employer contribution for workers in defined
contribution schemes is 7 per cent. That provides those employers with
considerable head room in the test. We therefore fully expect many
existing arrangements to qualify, even if, for example, they do not
take account of overtime as part of the pension calculation, because
that could easily be offset by a higher employer contribution than the
minimum 3 per cent. We plan to provide, I am pleased to say, a plain
English guide for employers and schemes to assist them when applying
the tests. That might involve simple illustrations of how the earnings
band or higher contributions could be offset against a different
definition of pensionable pay. There will be plenty of scope for
further discussion as part of the normal regulation-making
process.</div>
					<a name="08012476000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">In addition,
qualifying earnings form part of the definition of jobholder. Tinkering
with the definition of qualifying earnings would have an impact on the
eligibility for automatic enrolment, and might mean that some people
would miss out on workplace pension
saving.</div>
					<a name="08012476000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think that I
have addressed all the points made by the hon. Gentleman and I hope
that he will now feel free to withdraw the

useful debate because there are concerns among current scheme providers
about some of the computation difficulties that the Minister spoke
about. I am glad that he is seized of the salience of these issues for
those providers. He said that there could be &#163;900 million less
in contributions if the amendment were accepted&#151;I would
certainly not want that, and that was not my intention. I would,
however, say that if the Minister was not on to the computation
difficulties and was not able to do something about them, there would
be a real possibility of levelling down from existing good provision
above the level of personal accounts. There could have been a reduction
had those computation difficulties not been taken  into

ensure that whatever discretion the Secretary of State used on
uprating, the limits would be reported to the House. That would be an
important safeguard to ensure that savings and the amounts paid keep
their value. I am not saying that a future Secretary of
State&#151;whoever that might be&#151;would not ensure that they
would maintain their value, but we believe there should be a mechanism
to ensure that Members are able to respond to the proposals put forward
by the Secretary of State. I look forward to hearing how Ministers will
ensure that Members are kept informed of the rates proposed

							<a name="08012476000219"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:
						</b> The reforms have been structured to enable a
median earner with solid state entitlement to achieve a replacement
rate in retirement of around  45 per cent., in line with the
Pensions Commission&#146;s
recommendations.</div>
					<a name="08012476000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
limits of the qualifying earnings band&#151;the lower limit of
&#163;5,035 and the higher limit of &#163;33,540, in terms of
2006-07 earnings&#151;have been set in conjunction with the default
minimum contribution rate for defined contribution pension saving: 8
per cent. Having established a relationship between working-life income
and income in retirement, it is important to establish a mechanism to
maintain that, as the hon. Gentlemen said. That is right, and it is the
exact purpose of the
clause.</div>
					<a name="08012476000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">We plan to
review the limits of the qualifying earnings band once a year to
determine whether they have maintained their value, as the Bill says.
Our expectation is that future changes to the limits of the qualifying
earnings band will follow changes in the general level of earnings.
Tracking earnings is important for two reasons: first, to ensure that
the value of contributions going into money purchase schemes remains
stable in relation to earnings, which will help to maintain the balance
between working-life income and income in retirement; and, secondly, to
avoid enrolling even higher numbers of workers with low earnings for
whom state provision will already offer high income replacement
rates.</div>
					<a name="08012476000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">Pension reform
involves making policy for the long term, however. Average earnings
might not always be the only, or the most suitable, measure with which
the Government should assess whether the limits of the qualifying
earnings band have maintained their value. In the absence of complete
foresight, which no Government can have, we have taken the prudent step
of retaining some flexibility over the measures that the Government
must consider when assessing whether the limits of the qualifying
earnings band have maintained their
value.</div>
					<a name="08012476000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">All the
amendments would, in various ways, reduce that flexibility by removing
elements of the Secretary of State&#146;s discretion in uprating the
lower and upper limits of the earnings band. Amendments Nos. 20 and 73
would remove the discretionary ability to uprate the earnings band
limits using a more appropriate measure than earnings, should the need
arise. Amendment No. 86 would require an assessment of the change in
the value of the band limits to take place by two separate methods: an
approach approved by Parliament for the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column220" />Column number: 220</div>lower limit, and using average earnings for the upper limit. Amendment
No. 21 would make it mandatory to carry out a review of the qualifying
earnings band in line with rises in average earnings only, and
amendment No. 74 would remove the Secretary of State&#146;s
discretionary ability to change the limits of the qualifying earnings
band, even when he judged that their value had not been maintained.
Amendment  No. 75 would make it mandatory to review and revise
the qualifying earnings band limit in line with rises in average
earnings.</div>
					<a name="08012476000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
all of their various ways, the amendments would curb the discretion of
the Secretary of State and reduce flexibility in the system. It is
clear that the real test of whether the bands have retained their
value, in terms of ultimate income in retirement, is value
vis- -vis earnings. It would not be sensible to be
over-prescriptive about which measure of earnings could be used,
although it is perfectly clear which ones are used at present in
respect of other benefits that are earnings uprated. Given that the
provision will be in the Bill and that it is conceivable that, due to
statistical developments or changes in future Government policy, the
way of measuring earnings might change and new indices might evolve, it
would not be wise at this time to prescribe with great specificity the
index that should be used. We are establishing the principle that the
value is maintained in relation to earnings, and the appropriate
earnings index will be
used.</div>
					<a name="08012476000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is also
important to leave open the possibility&#151;this is not
inconceivable&#151;that earnings in any given year might not be the
right measure by which to assess value. There have been periods in
which prices have risen faster than earnings. We want to leave the
possibility open because the important thing, as the Bill says, is to
maintain the value of those bands. The objective is to ensure decent
levels of income in retirement and to maintain the balance of income
obtained through work and income derived in retirement as a result of
that work. That is the reason why the clause is drafted in such a way,
and why we would not want to see it restricted in any way. Given that,
I hope that the hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire will withdraw
the
amendment.</div>

					<a name="08012476000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">This amendment seeks to
elucidate from the Minister the Government&#146;s intentions relating
to pay reference periods. The wording on the face of the Bill in clause
13 is quite open, and given the understandable concerns that employers
have about how they are going to make the calculations relating to
these payments, it would be useful to hear that the Government intended
to make their pay reference periods as simple and straightforward as
possible so as not to add to their administrative burdens in any
way.</div>
					<a name="08012476000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope for the
vast majority of employers it will be quite clear and simple: either
their financial year or the tax year. But I wish to be reassured by the
Minister that the Government do not intend to impose on employers any
strange or unusual periods that would cause them any
difficulties.</div>
					<a name="08012476000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012476000222"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:
						</b> The hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire
seeks my reassurance on this in respect of simplicity and I hope I will
be able to give that to him. Clause 13, an important clause in the
Bill, enables Government to set the period, or range of periods, during
which qualifying earnings are to be assessed for the purpose of
calculating contributions to workplace pension saving. Many headline
figures associated with these reforms are expressed in annual amounts:
the limits to the qualifying earnings bands, for example. That is why
the clause provides for a default pay reference period of 12 months, so
that those annual limits make
sense.</div>
					<a name="08012476000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
as set out in clause 11(2), the annual limits of the earnings bands are
to be varied on a pro rata basis when qualifying earnings are being
assessed for a pay reference period that is more or less than 12
months. Therefore, in line with the preference of employer lobby
groups, especially the CBI and the Engineering Employers Federation, we
have included the flexibility to establish an array of pay reference
periods, so that the assessment of qualifying earnings and the
calculation of contributions for the purposes of workplace pension
saving may be aligned with the range of pay periods used by employers
today, which in some instances are weekly or monthly. In essence, we
are asking employers to do what they are already doing. That is the
common-sense
approach.</div>
					<a name="08012476000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
an employer pays its workers monthly, that is the period it should use
for the purposes of calculating pension contributions. The amendment,
however, would remove that flexibility by locking employers into a pay
reference period of 12 months&#151;only 12 months&#151;which would
delay the point at which some jobholders qualified to be automatically
enrolled. The flexibility to be able to prescribe pay reference periods
as a week or a month is important for another crucial reason: it
simplifies the administration for employers by making the calculation
and collection of contributions to pension saving part of those
companies&#146; normal pay cycles. Clearly, forcing companies into
administering that out of line with their ordinary pay cycle would be
an added burden. We will work with stakeholders to ensure that the
linkage between pay reference periods is tailored to achieve the best
fit for
employers.</div>
					<a name="08012476000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
measure brings forward the point of automatic enrolment, to the first
pay period for most workers, enabling them to save as they go and to
take advantage of compound investment returns. It avoids the need for
larger periodic or reconciliation payments, which would 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column222" />Column number: 222</div>affect affordability at the individual level and might deter people from
saving. Finally, and importantly, it enables temporary workers, who
move frequently between employers, to be able to take advantage of
workplace pension saving with an employer contribution, even if the
total earnings with that employer fall below the default annual
threshold&#151;in other words, if they earn &#163;3,000 for three
months&#146;
work.</div>
					<a name="08012476000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that I have demonstrated the importance of retaining the
flexibility. The measure fits with employers&#146; current practices
and best serves the interests of the people that we anticipate will
come into the schemes. With those reassurances, I hope that the hon.
Gentleman will feel able to withdraw his
amendment.</div>

schemes. I am aware that there has been a significant demise in such

widely average salary benefit schemes are being used. Therefore, I am
seeking some elucidation from the Minister on that point and, in
particular, on the likely impact&#151;on the possible payments

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012476000225"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:
						</b> In answer to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
question, there are 9.6 million people active in occupational schemes,
of whom 8.5 million are in defined-benefit schemes, and 1.1 million are
in defined-contribution schemes. Around 200,000 people are in defined
benefit schemes where pension benefits are based on a fraction of the
individual&#146;s average earnings across their career. These
earnings are generally uprated in line with prices. This seems to be a
probing amendment. Let me set out what we are seeking to
do.</div>
					<a name="08012476000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
14 is the first of a series of clauses that set out the minimum
standards for schemes to be used under the employer duties. This clause
introduces the concept of qualification. Qualifying schemes must be
occupational personal person schemes, tax registered under the Finance
Act 2004, and must meet the relevant quality criteria in relation to a
jobholder who joins the scheme. It is crucial to ensure that there is a
statutory duty for  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column223" />Column number: 223</div>schemes offered by employers to provide suitable contributions or
benefits to those who join them. This amendment would remove a key
element of the protection required to safeguard the quality of
qualifying and automatic-enrolment
schemes.</div>
					<a name="08012476000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 14(2)
gives the Secretary of State the ability to disqualify, through
regulations, certain schemes that would otherwise meet the quality
requirement. That would allow regulations to disqualify schemes that
require prohibitively high member contributions&#151;ones where the
employer will contribute so much, but the member must contribute a very
large amount&#151;and those which levy excessive administrative
charges. It would also allow regulations to disqualify career-average
schemes of a certain type, as set out in paragraph (c).</div>
					<a name="08012476000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">I can reassure the ACA, and
others who have raised the issue, that we will allow career-average
schemes to discharge employer duties. We are aware that career-average
schemes are becoming increasingly popular, and provide a compromise for
employers who want to retain defined-benefit provision, but do not want
to do so through final salary schemes. Many career average
schemes provide generous benefits to members and help employers control
the cost of pension provision. We want to support and encourage such
schemes.</div>
					<a name="08012476000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is our
intention, however, to apply these regulations to career average
schemes that do not appropriately revalue the earnings on which the
pension is based. We have designed the quality requirements for defined
benefit schemes to be as easy as possible for employers to apply. The
intention is that this can be done by assessing the value of the
benefits payable at a particular point in time. Some schemes may meet
the quality requirement based on the value of benefits at that time,
but those may not maintain their value over time to retirement without
revaluation of earnings. I am sure Members will agree that, given the
risk that such schemes would lose their value over time, they should
not qualify to accept members under the statutory duty established by
the Bill.</div>
					<a name="08012476000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are
providing reassurance that we have the ability to prevent employers
using schemes that are not of the sort that Parliament intends: poor
schemes that will give poor value, or schemes that are intentionally
created to discourage people from joining them. That is the aim
of the powers we are taking in the Bill to bring forward regulations. I
hope on that basis that the hon. Gentleman will feel able to withdraw
his
amendment.</div>

them into the scheme. As subsection (2)(b) is worded, it would seem
that the employee, bizarrely perhaps, might be able to refuse to give
such information. I am sure that I am probably wrong and that the
Minister will leap to show me some other part of the Bill where it
states that employees can be required to give basic information about
who they are, their date of birth and so on. If they could refuse to
give that information it would obviously cause complications and I
therefore seek the Minister&#146;s
reassurance.</div>

							<a name="08012476000228"></a>Mr.

						</b> An employer would be able to obtain from an

Gentleman described. The basic information about who the person is,
where they live, and what their national insurance number and date of
birth are is the sort of basic information that in any event ought to
be in the possession of most employers. They would get that information
and they would have that
information.</div>
					<a name="08012476000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">What we
seek to do, however, is to prevent a situation arising where the
employer would be able to say, &#147;Before I can automatically enrol
you and get you involved in my pension scheme, you have got to give me
a vast array of very detailed information about your
background&#148;. Some employees might not wish to give that
information and it might be utterly irrelevant to the particular
scheme. It is possible that some schemes might be created to help
employers who do not wish to operate in a bona fide way with automatic
enrolment.</div>
					<a name="08012476000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">Almost all
employers would approach this in a straightforward and bona fide way.
However, if there were any suggestion that employers required from an
employee information that they already had, or would normally have for
the purposes of employment, merely for the purposes of joining a
pension scheme, we would want to ensure that they would not be able to
require that additional information. I hope that with that reassurance,
and the reassurance that the employer would be able to ask reasonable
questions in a normal way but not be able to use requests for

					<a name="08012476000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is
obviously a difference in categorisation between occupational and

pension schemes that are outside the European Economic Area is not
clear. I am sure that international pension law is probably even more
complicated than United Kingdom pension law but, given that we are
bringing in such a significant Bill, it is important to be clear about
what happens in the different jurisdictions, not least because more and

							<a name="08012476000233"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:
						</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for the
constructive way in which he has put the questions. He is right that
more people than ever before are working internationally, travelling
abroad and coming to work in this country. Both clauses 16 and 17 set
out the definition of occupational and personal pension schemes. He has
noted the difference between these two clauses, namely, that we take a
power to specify occupational schemes based outside the EEA, but he
will not that we do not do the same for personal pensions. We believe
that there are sound reasons for the distinction, which I will now
explain.</div>
					<a name="08012476000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">A key
requirement of all qualifying schemes, occupational and personal, is
that they must be appropriately regulated. Occupational pension schemes
based in the UK are regulated through domestic law, which implements
the European directive on the activities and supervision of
institutions for occupational retirement provision&#151;IORP. Schemes

<div class="Column"><a name="Column226" />Column number: 226</div>administered within the European Economic Area, the EEA, are also
regulated under the same directive, providing assurance that scheme
standards and regulation are comparable to those in the UK. However,
for schemes based outside the EEA there is no universal regulation that
we can use as a basis for ensuring that schemes are suitable to be used
for the purposes of the employer duty. Far from international law being
complicated, to some extent it is non-existent or not particularly
existent. There are some provisions and agreements, but of a limited
nature.</div>
					<a name="08012476000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">So, we will
have to consider the circumstances where people sign up to a
foreign-based scheme&#151;perhaps a scheme based in the United States
or elsewhere, for a worker who has come over here or a worker working
for an American company. We will look at those on a more individualised
basis to ensure that any scheme that is used as a pension scheme is
able to be used for the purposes of the employer duty and is therefore
appropriately
regulated.</div>

						</b> Just to put a specific example to the Minister, if
an American came to this country with a 401(k) scheme&#151;a personal
pension scheme in the United States&#151;that was a good scheme with
a high level of contribution, what would be the effect if he were then
working for a UK
employer?</div>

							<a name="08012476000235"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:
						</b> I do not want to give carte blanche to all 401(k)
schemes. We would look at the particular scheme to identify whether it
would comply with the nature of our pension schemes. I know a bit about
those schemes, and I would have thought that, in most cases, they
probably would. Let me not give a ministerial imprimatur to all those
schemes. I will just say, in broader terms, that that is the sort of
scheme we want to be able to allow. Assuming it is properly regulated
by US domestic authorities, it would probably&#151;I use that word
advisedly&#151;comply with the requirements, particularly if the
employee coming here from the US was satisfied that that was the sort
of scheme he wished to use and maintain, and was returning there. That
would probably be fine.</div>
					<a name="08012476000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would advise a little
caution, however, if a UK-based company decided that it was going to
use foreign-based pension products for their domestic employees. We
would want to look at that with some care, and ensure that the specific
pension scheme fully complied. I suspect that operators of 401(k)
schemes would not allow themselves to be put in that position. It may
well be that in other countries there are schemes, probably privately
run, which would be in the market for taking on pension provision here.
If they were in the EEA, we would know how they are regulated. If they
were outside the EEA, we would want to be able to say that certain
schemes are appropriate and others are not. We are proceeding on that
basis. The amendment would interfere with that. However, given the way
the hon. Gentleman put his point across, I do not think I need to spend
time in rebuttal: I needed only to explain the purpose of the way in
which we are addressing the various
schemes.</div>

many people who will look at them in <i class="I">Hansard</i> tomorrow and in the
weeks to come. We are in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column227" />Column number: 227</div>an increasingly global economy. Many workers can expect to spend part of
their careers working elsewhere, and there are many foreign workers
coming in and out of this country. These are the sorts of practical
issues we need to be quite clear about in order to give guidance to
employers and employees alike as to what the new regime is likely to
allow and not allow. Having
