                  </span> I beg to move
amendment 25, in schedule 1, page 18, leave out line
18.<a class="bkMark" name="11091387000013">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It
is a pleasure to welcome you back to the Chair, Mr Amess.
This is the second of two important issues for rural communities that
the Committee will consider. The amendment seeks to remove the
Commission for Rural Communities from schedule 1.<a class="bkMark" name="11091387000014">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It is
impossible to overlook the essential work that is done by the
Commission for Rural Communities, and it is important for the Minister
to assure the Committee, members of the public and rural communities
that the interests of rural communities will not suffer by the
abolition of the CRC. As we know, it was created by section 17 of the
Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006. As some hon.
Members will remember, debating that legislation took a lot of time,
and that serious and important debate took place just over five years
ago.<a class="bkMark" name="11091387000015">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The CRC is a
statutory body, funded by the Government, to help ensure that policies,
programmes and decisions take proper account of the circumstances of
rural communities. That is essential to our discussion, with a
particular focus on disadvantaged people and areas suffering from
economic under-performance. The CRC has three main functions: it
provides an expert adviser, giving objective, evidence-based advice to
Government and others; it acts as an advocate; and it acts as an
independent watchdog, monitoring and reporting on the delivery of
policies nationally, regionally and locally.<a class="bkMark" name="11091387000016">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I first wish
to focus on the process by which the Government have reached their
position on the CRC, and offer the Minister the opportunity to address
the issues that have arisen, particularly due to a lack of consultation
and undue haste on the part of the Government to put the body into
schedule 1. Will the Minister comment on the consultation with rural
communities and their representatives? What has been the outcome of the
consultation, and have the Government taken any of the points raised
into consideration?<a class="bkMark" name="11091387000017">&#160;</a>
               </p>  
               <div class="columnNumber">

               </div>
               <p class="tabbed">Will he also
tell us whether he is confident that those affected by the changes will
have been given the opportunity to voice their opinion before any
decision in Parliament is enacted? A concern raised by a number of
people in rural communities is the undue haste by the Government to
centralise the functions of the CRC into the Department, and that that
may ultimately be to the detriment of rural
communities.<a class="bkMark" name="11091387000018">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Secondly,
I wish to focus on arguably the main reason for the Government’s
abolition of the CRC—the projected savings that will be made by
bringing its responsibilities in house. The Government briefing
published last year suggests that, by abolishing the CRC, savings of
£4.5 million will be made, after the transitional
costs of £2.5 million are covered. That is a large sum,
particularly considering that the CRC’s budget before the recent
cuts was £5.8 million. Will the Minister provide the
precise and current estimated savings, including transitional costs, of
the CRC’s
abolition?<a class="bkMark" name="11091387000019">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Once
taken in house, the forecast DEFRA spend is estimated to be just
£1.3 million a year. That is £4.5 million less
than the CRC spent in 2009-10. That is a big difference and clearly not
simply a result of efficiency savings. Will the Minister assure the
Committee that all the statutory duties and work of the CRC will be
carried out to the same standard by DEFRA, given the huge difference in
the budgets allocated to the CRC and to the Department to undertake
that
activity?<a class="bkMark" name="11091387000020">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">As
I have highlighted, the CRC was subject to massive cuts in March 2011,
when its budget was slashed to just £450,000 for the year and it
was left with a skeleton staff. It is clear from the CRC’s
evidence that, although many cuts have already happened, some of its
responsibilities have not yet transferred to DEFRA or been allocated to
new bodies. How many staff of what remains of the CRC are in place at
the moment? What duties, if any, does the CRC retain? Given that the
CRC had statutory duties, will the Minister assure us that those duties
are being undertaken during the transition period? Who is undertaking
those duties? Is the new department within DEFRA up and running, and is
it running at full capacity? What is the size of the new department? Is
there any further information about the department’s staffing
and its level of
responsibility?<a class="bkMark" name="11091387000021">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
problem with the Minister’s hasty plan to abolish the CRC is
that there is no mention of how the new arrangements will ensure that
the Government’s policies are rural-proofed to the same extent
as they were when they were subject to the independent and expert
analysis of the CRC. Dr Stuart Burgess was, until his post went, the
rural advocate and head of the CRC. He is, as the Committee is aware, a
man with many years’ expert experience of rural affairs, and he
has raised one example of such a problem. In traditional statistical
sources, such as the indices of deprivation, deprivation is not shown
as a significant issue for rural areas because of rural areas being
geographically substantial and with low populations. We need someone
with expert knowledge to argue that such a definition disguises the
needs of the rural poor and can sometimes lead to such areas being
overlooked.<a class="bkMark" name="11091387000022">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
am sure the Minister is aware, given his constituency, that a large
number of rural households lived in fuel poverty in 2008 and that the
average rural house price was six times average household
income in 2009. How will DEFRA address such issues when at least some
of the subject matter is clearly external to the DEFRA
brief?<a class="bkMark" name="11091387000023">&#160;</a>

Mark Williams</strong> (Ceredigion) (LD):<a class="bkMark" name="11091387000264">&#160;</a>
                  </span> The hon. Lady’s
point on the independent voice is critical. Frankly, many of our rural
communities lack confidence that political parties of either persuasion
are addressing their concerns. Looking at the work of the rural
advocate, one such concern is rural fuel poverty, on which my hon.
Friend, the Minister, has done a huge amount of work. An independent
voice is needed, but it cannot be covered alone if the work is subsumed
into DEFRA as part of a
unit.<a class="bkMark" name="11091387000024">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> The hon. Gentleman makes an excellent
point, which I will address in more detail in a moment or
two.<a class="bkMark" name="11091387000025">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Much
of the CRC’s work is research-based, and I am sure the Minister
is aware that the CRC has published an annual state of the countryside
report that is key to measuring and monitoring social, economic and
environmental trends in rural areas. How will DEFRA maintain that level
of research? The cost of producing such reports can be considerable and
requires proactive evidence-finding visits and engagement at local
level. I am not confident that DEFRA civil servants, who are largely
based in London and who have numerous other demands on their time, will
be able to carry out this work and understand the communities that they
are dealing with.<a class="bkMark" name="11091387000026">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">My third
point concerns the value that transparency gives to the CRC in enabling
it to fulfil its role as an independent voice for rural communities.
Since its creation, the CRC reports have been made public at every
stage on its website and in hard copy, which has maximised the
participation of rural communities in the policy process. Can the
Minister guarantee that that practice will continue at DEFRA? In
contrast, as many members of the Committee will be aware, advice to
Ministers is often confidential, and civil servants sign the Official
Secrets Act. There are vast differences between the abilities of a
Department and of a statutory body such as the CRC to be fully open.
The Government say that ministerial accountability to Parliament will
ensure transparency, but can the Minister explain to us how that will
be any different, in practical terms, from the current situation for
Departments?<a class="bkMark" name="11091387000027">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Finally, and
most importantly, is the significant matter of independence. The CRC
and, in particular, the Rural Advocate, valued their independence from
Government because it offered many

powerful case. Many Members will have read at least a summary of the
Joseph Rowntree Foundation report on rural communities, which
highlights the differences between rural communities and those in urban
and suburban areas. One fact in the report that was striking—in
addition to the differences in income levels—was that in terms
of population, our rural communities will always be a minority in the
UK. Does my hon. Friend agree that when it comes to questions such as
fuel poverty and bus deregulation, the independent and slightly
different perspective of the Rural Advocate is a key part of the
situation for rural communities?<a class="bkMark" name="11091387000029">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> My hon. Friend makes an excellent point.
She highlights some of the specific areas in which it is essential to
have a Rural Advocate, and in which the independent voice has been so
powerful. There has been an independent voice for rural communities 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 76<a class="bkMark" name="Column76">&#160;</a>
                  </div>in Government since the Rural Development Commission was established in
1909. The commission has traditionally had a constructive and advisory
role; it is not a pressure group, although it works alongside pressure
groups; and it has been able to ask uncomfortable questions of
Government, which in-house civil servants may not always have been able
to do. With that in mind, the Rural Advocate ensured that he was at the
forefront of debate on rural issues and had a close working
relationship with a range of different communities in the countryside.
Dr Burgess, who was the most recent Rural Advocate, has worked
tirelessly for many years to champion the countryside and those who
live in rural areas.<a class="bkMark" name="11091387000030">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">When the Bill

               <p class="tabbed">Government
Members have argued that it is up to MPs to be champions of their rural
communities. I agree, and I think that MPs have an important role to
play in advocating for their constituencies. However, as the Committee
is aware, MPs do not necessarily speak with one voice, which means that
if we simply rely on MPs, some messages that come from rural areas will
be diluted. In addition, it is not possible to say that Ministers can
take on that role in government, because they change positions,
sometimes quite often, and they take time to get to grips with their
brief. There might, therefore, be a lack of coherence and consistency
if we simply rely on Ministers.<a class="bkMark" name="11091387000033">&#160;</a>

               </h4>
               <p class="tabbed">There
is a further point about this matter. Even the most junior Ministers
have many considerable, wide-ranging responsibilities within their
remit, as things stand. They simply may be unable to put the amount of
time into this area that the Rural Advocate and the Commission for
Rural Communities could. It is evident that the Government have not
fully considered the implications of the addition of a role, previously
done by a dedicated, focused individual, to a Minister within DEFRA.
Will the Minister explain how the consistency achieved with the CRC
will be continued within DEFRA? In particular, I am keen to know, as
are many people who are following the debate, how DEFRA will
accommodate the role of the Rural Advocate within the
Department.<a class="bkMark" name="11091387000034">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">There is a
further, linked issue, which was raised in the other place
and remains unanswered, about the ability of junior Ministers to press
a case and carry the same authority that an independent
advocate, such as Stuart Burgess had, when
dealing with other, often more powerful, Departments. Ministers in a
Department—in this case, DEFRA—may find it difficult to
put pressure on more senior Ministers in other Departments. A key role
of the Rural Advocate, therefore, may be lost with the transfer of
functions.<a class="bkMark" name="11091387000035">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Following on
from the issue of independence, there is a question about the ability
of DEFRA to fulfil a vital cross-departmental role, and about the
person who will be given this new role within the Department. In recent

<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 77<a class="bkMark" name="Column77">&#160;</a>
                  </div>years, the CRC has produced a number of reports, which hon. Members have
mentioned today, on varied topics including the rural economy,
affordable housing, the digital divide, and “The state of the
countryside”. Those have been very influential on Government
policy, but the topics clearly extend well beyond the DEFRA remit. Will
the Minister ensure that the department within DEFRA is given the same
scope and the necessary resources to continue producing such
wide-ranging reports? From the information that we have at present, and
taking into account the huge budget cut, it does not look as though the
Government intend that such resources will be available in future. Will
the Minister comment on that point?<a class="bkMark" name="11091387000036">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Significantly,
the CRC has also advised a number of Government Departments—not
only DEFRA—on a range of policy issues. Some examples of those
have included: promoting the interests of local people in the
decision-making processes for rural communities; highlighting several
examples of community-led plans and services, similar to those
envisaged in the Localism Bill; leading the establishment of the rural
coalition, to bring together formerly disparate organisations that
represent rural interests into a single national forum to enable and
encourage discussion; and championing, across Government, the need for
digital access in rural areas, which is reflected in the
Government’s commitment to extending broadband across the
country and the recent announcement by Ofcom that it will insist that
broadband becomes cheaper in rural areas. On that last point, the
Government’s recent removal of the 50p tax on bills to fund
rural broadband demonstrates the acute need for an independent
adviser.<a class="bkMark" name="11091387000037">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Ministers are
extremely busy and juggle responsibilities for more than one area of
Government policy. Without the setting up of an independent rural
adviser, I do not see how DEFRA can take on the duties and
responsibilities of the CRC to the extent and to the same standards
achieved by the CRC before it was affected by pre-emptive Government
cuts.<a class="bkMark" name="11091387000038">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Dr Stuart
Burgess has investigated in full the costs of maintaining an
independent rural adviser. He concluded that the establishment of an
adviser could be achieved on a small annual budget of no more than
£400,000 and would provide an independent rural voice at the
heart of Government. Will the Minister ensure that disadvantaged rural
communities—a minority voice even with the excellent work and
assistance of the CRC and Stuart Burgess—will not be
disadvantaged by the Government’s proposals? Will the Minister
assure us that an independent voice representing the interests of rural
communities will remain?<a class="bkMark" name="11091387000039">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">To conclude
my remarks, I will quote the Liberal Democrat rural affairs spokesman,
the hon. Member for St Ives (Andrew George), who said just two months
ago:<a class="bkMark" name="11091387000040">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“The
big risk is that the small and weak voices tend to get ignored. They
have the added problem of trying to persuade the powers-that-be that
the superficial image of the countryside as a rather well-heeled place
of rural tranquillity is not true. You have to punch your way through
the chocolate-box image. It is that important role that I think will
simply get lost if the Rural Advocate is
removed.”<a class="bkMark" name="11091387000226">&#160;</a>

do not know what happened, but there seems to be a Welsh flavour to the
Committee. I am lucky in that I have visited the constituency of the
hon. Member for Preseli Pembrokeshire for the past 10 years. Anyone who

what it is like when rural areas are protected and where there is one

               <p class="tabbed">I
am privileged to have served the previous Government as an independent
lawyer at the Treasury Solicitor’s department. The National
Assembly for Wales, later known as the Welsh Assembly Government, was a
client on planning issues. We knew that the national park had to be
preserved for everyone as an independent body that looks after the
interests of Wales. Standing on top of Garn Fawr and looking out across
the Atlantic or seeing the Preseli hills one realises that there are
things bigger than we are and things that have to be preserved. It is a
beautiful area of Wales—just as other parts of Wales are
beautiful—and I encourage everyone to visit it. The surfing is
absolutely
excellent.<a class="bkMark" name="11091387000046">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Going
to St David’s, one can see change; where there was a
greengrocer, there is now Window on Wales—a gift shop. Little
businesses should be encouraged and protected. All around the area are
people who come from all over the world—Germany and everywhere,
even England. It is a well-preserved area and that should be
maintained.<a class="bkMark" name="11091387000047">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">My
hon. Friend the Member for City of Durham mentioned another aspect,
however, which is poverty. People do live in poverty, and they must be
protected. The Commission for Rural Communities, as most hon. Members
may have seen, does several useful things. It looks at housing,
planning, transport and children and young people. It is important that
we are here not just for ourselves, but also because we want to leave
something good behind for following generations. We know that people in
rural communities are having difficulty living in their areas. Housing
and jobs are major
problems.<a class="bkMark" name="11091387000048">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">People
are beginning to realise that children in cities need to go outside.
Michael Morpurgo has set up a city farm. Wales has many wonderful
farms, which children should visit. They need to know that apples do
not just come from Tesco, but from trees, but many children do not
understand that. It is part of the Prime Minister’s general view
of well-being that one goes to the countryside to get a sense of
perspective about what our lives are like and to get a sense of
well-being. Again, my sense of well-being for the last term has come
from visiting
Wales.<a class="bkMark" name="11091387000049">&#160;</a>

consultation. As a lawyer, I know that the High Court will throw
everything out in judicial reviews. There must be consultation before
any body is abolished and before a Minister makes a decision. It cannot
be the other way around. Consultation must be first, and the decision
must come after that. I have seen no consultation at all with some
bodies. We will come on to the other major bodies that do important

am grateful to the hon. Members for City of Durham and for Walsall
South for their comments on this important issue. It is certainly
important for me, because some of us have sometimes felt that we were
ploughing a lonely furrow—to use a rural expression—over
the past decade or so when pressing the interests of rural communities.
It is great to hear members from both sides of the Committee expressing
their concern about issues such as rural poverty, because, exactly as
the hon. Member for City of Durham has said, the idea that we all live
in beautiful cottages with roses around the doors belies the fact that
many people in rural areas not only live in degrees of poverty, but
also do not have access to many of the support mechanisms that are
available to people in similar circumstances in towns. How we ensure
that the Government have a proper realisation of the interests of rural
communities is, therefore, important. The hon. Member for City of
Durham set me a challenge right at the beginning when she said that I
need to persuade her that the interests of rural communities will not
suffer, and I will do my best to do that in my comments and responses
today.<a class="bkMark" name="11091387000053">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">I
will address the first of the central concerns about the
Government’s proposal to abolish the CRC, which is the loss of
an independent voice to ensure that the Government are held to account
on their rural policy making. It is an important point of
principle—this is not the last time that the Committee will hear
it enunciated—that democratically accountable Ministers should
take direct responsibility for policy functions. Ministers in DEFRA
feel that a single centre of rural expertise operating within DEFRA
will be able to engage more effectively and at an earlier stage in the
development of policy across Government, ensuring that rural needs and
opportunities are properly understood before decisions are made. It is
no criticism of either the CRC or the Rural Advocate to say that I
think having that strong voice within Government is absolutely
essential to  making sure that other Departments hear what is
being said by the advisers who are working directly with rural
communities.<a class="bkMark" name="11091387000054">&#160;</a>

absolutely clear that nothing can be done as a result of the inclusion
of a body in this part of the Bill without a proper public consultation
process. Assuming that the Bill reaches the statute book, there will be
a 90-day public consultation which will be published this autumn. The
Bill provides that there cannot be secondary legislation bringing into
effect the abolition without that consultation process and then
Parliament’s consent. It is axiomatic that Ministers will want
to look at the responses to those consultations before taking a step

                  </strong> I do not want to retrace steps in terms of the
rationale adopted as the basis of the Bill. The Parliamentary
Secretary, Cabinet Office has made clear the criteria we use to assess
public bodies across the whole of the government sector to see whether
they should be included in the schedules. That is an initial tranche or
filter. Those that fall outside the criteria are not included in the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11091387000061">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">A fundamental
issue that the Committee must get its head around is that we are not
abolishing any public bodies in the Bill. We are providing the
legislative vehicle by which that process can then take place, which
involves consultation and further parliamentary scrutiny. At that point
it will happen. It is a two-stage process. This is paving legislation,
something that the previous Government were also keen to have, I
believe. I was certainly led to believe that that it was felt there was
a need for a vehicle for looking at public bodies. Therefore it is a
two-stage process. Those bodies that are included in the schedules are
those that meet the criteria for consideration. That consideration then
has to take place before a final decision is
taken.<a class="bkMark" name="11091387000062">&#160;</a>

However, one has to start somewhere, and we would be criticised by hon.
Members if we suddenly announced abolition without any parliamentary
process. This is the opportunity for people to talk about the process
and the legislative vehicle. We will then go through the subsequent
process. In this instance, I do not think we are losing expertise, as I
will go on to say, because of the changes that have already taken
place. Let us be clear: Ministers have taken a view about what they
think might be the right solution, but we must test that through public
consultation and parliamentary scrutiny. That is a perfectly proper
process.<a class="bkMark" name="11091387000064">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">The hon.
Member for City of Durham asked me about the savings. Let me be as
explicit as I can. It is estimated that implementing the
Government’s new approach to the rural policy functions will in
total generate net savings of approximately £17 million over the
comprehensive spending review period of 2010-15. That is not to be
sniffed at. Let us all be sensible: we are trying to find savings as
part of the process, as well as finding better ways to carry out policy
and government functions.<a class="bkMark" name="11091387000065">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">The first
phase of the transition was completed by 31 March 2011, as
planned. By consolidating resources within an expanded rural
communities policy unit within Government, and working with the CRC to
design and influence a more streamlined operating model, DEFRA has
already reduced annual spending on its rural policy function by
approximately 60% from the 2010-11 baseline. Under its new operating
model, the CRC receives £450,000 per annum funding towards its
delivery costs, and is provided with back-office
support—finance, human resources functions and so on—by
DEFRA at an estimated cost of £80,000 per annum. The annual
resource cost of maintaining the CRC as an arm’s-length body is,
therefore, estimated at £530,000 per annum. The cost of
abolishing the streamlined CRC is estimated at approximately
£150,000.<a class="bkMark" name="11091387000066">&#160;</a>

secondly, from whom it takes its own advice and with whom it
communicates. I will go on to that in a moment. Thirdly, having spoken
to Ministers in DEFRA, I am clear that they wish to retain an
independent element within the policy advice that they receive, and I
know they are working to that end.<a class="bkMark" name="11091387000068">&#160;</a>

unit. It is 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 82<a class="bkMark" name="Column82">&#160;</a>
                  </div>already up and running, built on DEFRA’s existing rural policy
function, and includes staff transferred from the CRC. There are
approximately 30 staff in the new unit, which makes it substantial. The
hon. Lady also asked whether it would be in London and, therefore, cut
off. That is not true: offices have already been established in Bristol
and York, nearer the communities they deal with. Remaining at the CRC
are the chairman, nine commissioners and a small team, equivalent to
three and a half full-time staff, providing support for that structure.
That would be abolished if the proposals went
ahead.<a class="bkMark" name="11091387000069">&#160;</a>

               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Having
addressed the staffing, I will now deal with some of the other issues.
It is critical that the new RCPU works. The unit has already been
established and is built on DEFRA’s existing rural policy team.
Staff with other backgrounds and expertise have been brought in,
including, as I have already indicated, those transferred from the
CRC.<a class="bkMark" name="11091387000072">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">One of the
new unit’s key objectives is to develop open and transparent
ways of working. It will collaborate, where appropriate, with
organisations representing and supporting rural residents, enterprises
and communities, which will give those stakeholders an opportunity to
influence the unit’s priorities and
projects.<a class="bkMark" name="11091387000073">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
process will be open. The RCPU work programme will shortly be published
on the DEFRA website, and the unit will use a variety of methods to
provide public updates on its progress and impact. We will have a
transparent process for both policy advice and information collection,
which is how Dr Stuart Burgess worked. I pay tribute to his
work—it would be quite wrong for us not to say what a valuable
role he played—but I am not sure that his valuable work was
always transferred into the policy, legislation and programmes of the
previous Government, which was my constant criticism. Nevertheless,
that was not for want of strong advocacy on his
part.<a class="bkMark" name="11091387000074">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It
is key that DEFRA Ministers are able to champion the cause of rural
areas and to lead policy from inside the Department. Many other
organisations have a part to play in that, too. Such organisations
already advocate strongly and effectively on the behalf of rural
people. DEFRA Ministers will be accountable to Parliament for the way
in which they fulfil their role as rural champions. Inevitably, some
elements of the work of DEFRA and the RCPU will take place behind the
scenes. I make no bones about that because it is to be expected. A lot
of the work will be open, however, as the previous advocacy process was
open. Additionally, there will be the application of the Select
Committee on Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, which has already
indicated that it wishes to scrutinise the work of the RCPU. We welcome
that. It is further evidence of the importance that many people in the
House and elsewhere attach to the interests of those living and working
in rural areas.<a class="bkMark" name="11091387000075">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">The RCPU will
bring together, for the first time, a consolidated picture of the
Government’s broad range of policies and programmes for rural
people, businesses and communities through the publication of a rural
statement, which is an important innovation. As stated on the DEFRA
website, the RCPU will also publish its rural programme work plan,
which will be updated
annually.<a class="bkMark" name="11091387000076">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
will now address the concept that a small group of civil servants will
not be able properly either to understand or represent the concerns and
priorities of rural people. As I have already mentioned, three
offices—Bristol, London and York—have already been
established to maximise the chances of recruiting and retaining staff
with a background and interest in the relationship between national
policy and local delivery. Since its creation in April, the RCPU has
been carrying out a careful assessment of the rural evidence base and
considering how best to gather evidence related to current policy
issues as well as more strategic long-term evidence about the changing
characteristics of rural places, communities and
economies.<a class="bkMark" name="11091387000077">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">When
the hon. Member for City of Durham and her colleagues look at the
website, I would welcome their views on whether the programme will meet
the needs that the unit should meet. The unit will be working closely
with other organisations. It says in my notes that DEFRA’s
officials will be taking a more proactive and public-facing approach
than has previously been the case. I am not sure about the phrase
“proactive and public-facing approach,” but I think it
means they will talk to people and listen. I welcome civil servants
talking to people, listening and providing advice. Among those to whom
they will be talking and listening will be the Rural Coalition, which
is already engaging with a wide range of businesses and other
stakeholders that are interested in the rural economy growth review,
and supporting the development of DEFRA’s new rural and farming
network.<a class="bkMark" name="11091387000078">&#160;</a>

said. There will be an annual statement, which will effectively carry
out the same role. One perfectly legitimate concern that hon. Members
have expressed is about independence. We have to establish independence
to ensure that Ministers in the Department can convincingly argue their
case on the basis of good advice. We have rural-proofing mechanisms,
but they have not always worked terribly well, and I want them to work
better. Of course, I have an interest in that, but for reasons of good
governance we need to make sure that rural-proofing works better,
because too often legislation has appeared to be based on an urban and
suburban model without really understanding what happens in rural
areas. Ministers in DEFRA are still exploring options to ensure a
degree of independent advice.<a class="bkMark" name="11091387000080">&#160;</a>

the future of the CRC, if this Bill becomes law, following consultation
Ministers will be clear about how they will be given independent advice
and how we ensure proper audit of the rural-proofing that the
Department is carrying out on behalf of rural communities. We are
seeing a focusing of rural policy expertise within Government, which I
hope will remove duplication, improve efficiency and enable resources
to be more effectively focused on securing practical outcomes in
priority policy areas. For the time being, the CRC remains in operation
as a more streamlined body, and it will continue to do so until such
time as—subject to parliamentary approval—it is
abolished. Until that time, the commission will retain the ability to
perform, albeit in a different way, the statutory functions required of
it by the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006.<a class="bkMark" name="11091387000081">&#160;</a>

communities that we all want to see. I recognise some of the concerns
that she and her colleagues have expressed. I can only assure her that
those are at the forefront of Ministers’ thinking in developing
the policy and ensuring that we end up with a measure that enables
DEFRA to perform its role more effectively, and which ensures that the
rest of the Government are aware of the impact of policies on rural
areas. On that basis, I hope she feels able to withdraw her

                  </strong> I thank the Minister for that detailed
response. There was much in his answer that was reassuring, but I want
to deal with the question of the Bill being enabling legislation. As my
hon. Friend the Member for Wigan pointed out, the problem with
Ministers arguing that the Bill is simply enabling legislation is that
several bodies mentioned in the Bill seem to have been substantially
dismantled, at least, in advance of the legislation being passed. That
is producing many problems for several organisations and for us in
seeking to scrutinise the Bill
carefully.<a class="bkMark" name="11091387000083">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">Nevertheless,
the Minister made several reasonable points, particularly about the
programme of activities that will be taken up by the RCPU, but we may
need more reassurance on how it will maintain a high level of activity
across Departments. One issue the Minister did not mention was how the
RCPU will work across Departments to produce reports on rural poverty,
for example, with a severely reduced budget. That needs to be explored
further. We are all looking forward to seeing DEFRA civil servants
being proactive—going around the country and holding focus
groups, for example. I am sure we will all want to take part in that,

minutes to explain why the Department reached that view. I totally
understand the hon. Lady’s starting point that we are moving

in which that would be desirable, but I need to explain why. As is
clear to the Committee, the Government intend to reduce the number and
cost of public bodies, so removing the board from schedule 1 would
impact adversely on that intention. The board was established in 1991
to provide advice to the Secretary of State, which he may refer to from
time to time, on matters relating to disability living allowance and
attendance allowance. The Government want to place on record their
thanks to the members of the board for the advice they have provided
over the years, which has genuinely contributed to policy debates in
the Department. However, I ask the Committee to note that the board has
not been asked to provide any advice since November 2008.<a class="bkMark" name="11091387000091">&#160;</a>

experts, including DLA decision-makers and departmental medical

can obtain, when required, expert medical advice in specialist medical
fields using what it calls task and finish groups. For example, the
Department has set up a specific advisory group to work with it on the
creation of the new assessment for the personal independence 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 86<a class="bkMark" name="Column86">&#160;</a>
                  </div>payment, comprising independent experts in health, disability and social
care, including disabled people. Meanwhile, the Department feel that
members of Equality 2025, itself an independent public body, are very
well placed to provide personal insights into the effects of policy
initiatives. The Government see no case for continuing with a board
that has not been asked for advice since November 2008 and has not sat
since December 2010. They feel they can access advice more
cost-efficiently through tailored consultation, rather than by
maintaining a non-departmental public body.<a class="bkMark" name="11091387000092">&#160;</a>

was that it brought people with knowledge of physiotherapy,
occupational therapy, social work and nursing together with medical
practitioners and disabled people to be a strong, independent voice to
Government on the needs of disabled people. Will he reassure us that

                  </strong> I hope I can give the hon. Lady that reassurance.
For example, the Department is designing the assessment for the new
benefit—the personal independence payment—in
collaboration with a group of independent specialists in health, social
care and disability. That group includes two members of the board,
recognising their experience and expertise. It includes individuals
from a range of professions such as occupational therapy, psychiatry,
physiotherapy, social work and general practice, as well as
representatives from Radar and Equality 2025. The Department therefore
feels that it is accessing a wide variety of tailored, relevant
expertise, rather than maintaining a non-departmental public body in
perpetuity. That is the basis on which it wishes to proceed. If I have
given the Committee some reassurance on that point, I ask
the hon. Lady to withdraw her

that the whole landscape of benefits is about to change and there will
be a need for a different arrangements within the Department. In
agreeing to withdraw the amendment, we will want to check that these

               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">All
of the matters we are discussing on the Bill are important, but a few
of them touch on questions of life and death. Touch wood, we have done
well in recent years with safety at sports grounds. We can never be
complacent about the way that large crowds of people, sometimes quite
excited and frequently with small minorities who become over-excited,
conduct themselves. We need to be sure that it is right to abolish the
Football Licensing Authority. In the spirit of the non-partisan way in
which the Committee has worked, I will not pray in aid anyone from the
Opposition Benches, because, as I am sure the Minister is aware, there
were many speeches by Government Members defending the Football
Licensing Authority which, after the recent passage of legislation, is
now called the Sports Grounds Safety Authority. Many comments were made
by the Sports Minister about how important the body is, which I will
refer to as I address the
issues.<a class="bkMark" name="11091387000100">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Let
me briefly recall how the SGSA originally came into existence. There
were a number of dreadful incidents. The Hillsborough one still has a
huge place in the national memory. It is impossible to recall that day,
the tragic images that we saw and the relatives’ reactions
afterwards, without feeling a touch of sadness. As we know, there are
unresolved issues relating to those events, and I was glad to see that
the Government were considering whether they could publish some
records.<a class="bkMark" name="11091387000101">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Afterwards,
the Taylor report emerged. It made a series of recommendations, which
were implemented by the SGSA, with some care. The report
wanted to see the closure of the standing terraces, new
safety measures at exits and entrances, a new advisory
committee on stadium design, and crucially, the
Government’s identity card scheme being dropped on the grounds
of safety, which was a suggestion that the Government reluctantly
carried out. All those measures were to be enacted by an independent
body, outside of central Government. It would be focused on developing
expertise in the management of large crowds, and at venues where large
crowds can sometimes move very quickly.<a class="bkMark" name="11091387000102">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Since then,
there has been no incident of any significance in the UK within a
sports ground, but there have been some elsewhere in the world. We
remember the Heysel stadium disaster, which took place before
Hillsborough, or there was an incident in which 84 people died during a
match between Guatemala and Costa Rica. Hon. Members may also recall
that 43 people died in a match between the Kaizer Chiefs and the
Orlando Pirates, only ten years ago. We have seen other incidents, too,
and frequently, when such an event takes place elsewhere, or when a
Government wish to review sports ground safety, they come to the UK and
ask the FLA—or now, the SGSA—for advice. We are seen as a
world centre of excellence in maintaining sports ground safety, and
that expertise has been developed within the body that we now propose
to
abolish.<a class="bkMark" name="11091387000103">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It
is right to ask why we would want to close down an
organisation that—touch wood—has done so well inside the
UK and is seen as a centre of excellence throughout the world,
particularly given that a series of new venues are coming
into existence in London, because of the
Olympics. We hope that there 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 88<a class="bkMark" name="Column88">&#160;</a>
                  </div>will be huge crowds and that the series of events will be
successful, but it seems odd that we should now seek to
abolish the body that would oversee such
matters.<a class="bkMark" name="11091387000104">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">In response,
I say that if I were employed by the SGSA—given my expertise and
the great pride I would take in my organisation’s work to secure
safety at sports grounds over the past few years—and I then
discovered that the authority’s life would not be extended and
its functions would be placed elsewhere, I might feel unsettled, at
least. More than that, I might decide to seek employment and use my
expertise elsewhere. Many countries in the world, English-speaking or
not, are looking to reproduce the kind of authority we have here. I
accept that the intention is not to see the body disappear before the
Olympics. However, the truth, I am told, is that the staff feel
unsettled and some may decide to move on. There is a settled body of
expertise there and I am worried that some of that may be lost. Will
the Minister address how we ensure that we do not lose that expertise,
particularly in the run-up to the Olympics, but also beyond? There are
events every weekend where stadiums are occupied by large numbers of
people.<a class="bkMark" name="11091387000108">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">As
I just said, the new Sports Grounds Safety Authority Act effectively
extends the functions of what was the FLA and is now the SGSA. During
the Committee stage of that Bill, the Minister said the matter was
urgent because the Olympics were not far away. He added:<a class="bkMark" name="11091387000109">&#160;</a>

across Europe of where that has been done successfully, such as in
Hamburg, where there are safe standing areas. The management of crowds
is evolving; there are more options now. A number of Premier League and

point. I was not aware of that campaign, but I am aware that many
people feel part of the ambience has been lost with all-seater
stadiums. I sometimes feel that when I go to a football or rugby match.
It was felt that standing crowds were dangerous, but perhaps that was
due to the way the stadiums were configured. If it were possible to
reconfigure them, standing might again be permitted. That would be a
matter for debate. I tend to feel that if it were possible, it would be
a good thing to achieve. However, I would want the absolute technical
assurance of an independent authority before I could vote for such a
proposal. I do not want on my conscience—I am sure nobody
does—that we agreed such an action and then an incident took
place. That is how I feel about the authority itself. I am not a
Luddite who simply defends existing structures—my political
philosophy suggests that many changes in our country are absolutely
necessary—and the Opposition are not attempting to defend
institutions without an argument or rational discussion. In a case such
as this, however, I would not want to have on my conscience the
abolition of the authority without a categorical assurance that the
level of technical expertise that had been brought together will be
kept together and exercised independently.<a class="bkMark" name="11091387000113">&#160;</a>

Wigan is a renowned sporting town, although I cannot say that I have
massive admiration for the rugby league club, because they recently
beat a Yorkshire team, and rugby league is my sport. My constituency
contains two rugby league sports grounds: Wakefield Trinity and
Featherstone Rovers. The crowds are, lamentably, not as good as they
ought to be, given that excellence is displayed on those playing
fields. None the less, we want to know that people from our area, and
people who come to our area from, say, Wigan, are well looked after in

off the bat, it is important to say that, as the hon. Gentleman
powerfully said, football safety is extraordinarily emotive. Even so
many years after the event, the word “Hillsborough”, for
those of us alive at the time, conjures up powerful associations and
images, not least for me. My father was Home Secretary at the time, and
I have heard him speak quietly but powerfully on a number of occasions
about the impact that going round the hospitals the day after with the
then Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, had on him. I do not think
anyone on this Committee would quibble with the importance that the
hon. Gentleman attaches to the issue. We all know how important it is,
and I hope that no Opposition Member feels that the Government are in
any way taking a risk with something so serious. To use the hon.
Gentleman’s phrase, we cannot be complacent. I hope that, by
addressing my amendment and by responding to his amendment, I can
assure the Committee on that point and that we can avoid a
Division.<a class="bkMark" name="11091387000121">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Government
amendment 1 is necessary following the successful passage of the Sports
Grounds Safety Authority Act 2011. That private Member’s Bill
was introduced with full Government support by my hon. Friend the
Member for Woking (Jonathan Lord) in June 2010 and received Royal
Assent on 12 July 2011. The Act will, when commenced, reconstitute the
Football Licensing Authority as the Sports Grounds Safety Authority and
expand its advisory role. The key point is that we want other sports to
benefit from the authority’s expertise, to which the hon.
Gentleman paid appropriate tribute. So 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 91<a class="bkMark" name="Column91">&#160;</a>
                  </div>the authority will benefit not only Wigan Athletic, but the rugby league
club down the road. As the hon. Gentleman said, that expertise is
important and we want to see it used to wider benefit. It is about
creating the right environment for the advisory role to be
expanded to benefit other sports, rather than
removing that advisory role. As he alluded to, that will be of
particular importance as we approach the Olympics and Paralympics in
2012.<a class="bkMark" name="11091387000122">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
assure the hon. Gentleman that the FLA is currently engaged with
Government officials on the necessary planning and detail work to
ensure a smooth transition to its expanded advisory role. When both the
Government and the FLA are satisfied that the FLA is ready, we will put
the 2011 Act into force, and the FLA will become the SFSA. We
anticipate that that will take place later this year and, in all
likelihood, before the Public Bodies Bill receives Royal Assent. The
amendment is therefore necessary to change the reference in schedule 1
from the FLA to the SGSA, as it will soon
be.<a class="bkMark" name="11091387000123">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Amendment
40 seeks to remove the FLA from schedule 1. As I hope I have
made clear, the Government are not seeking to abolish the valuable
existing role of the FLA in relation to football ground safety. This
is, as I have said, about trying to create an environment in which that
role can be expanded. The Government are also not taking any risks with
football safety during the process of transition. While the inclusion
of the authority in schedule 1 allows it to be abolished as a separate
body, the Government are fully committed to transferring its expertise
and functions to another body after 2012. The Government’s
recognition of the importance of preserving the roles and
responsibilities of the authority is underlined by our support for the
expansion of its advisory role to other sports through the 2011 Act.
The broad support across sports for the expanded role shows that the
need for the authority’s expert advice is now much wider than
football.<a class="bkMark" name="11091387000124">&#160;</a>

Throughout the Committee’s proceedings, he has dealt with our
issues in a positive and genuine manner. If its role is to be expanded,
will he confirm whether the organisation will have enough capacity? He
has outlined that more sports will be taken on under a new authority.
Will there be enough capacity in the organisation to ensure that sports
grounds are monitored and safe and that football is safe alongside all
the other sports grounds where people gather and enjoy some of our
nation’s greatest games and
events?<a class="bkMark" name="11091387000125">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> I thank the hon. Gentleman for his remarks. That is
exactly how I intend to continue. The human capacity is clearly an
important issue, because the authority’s expertise lies in human
beings. That was an important point of his, because, as the hon. Member
for Wigan pointed out in an earlier debate, change creates uncertainty.
The Government, the authority and the people managing the process have
a strong responsibility to recognise that and to manage the risk
appropriately. On the staff at the FLA, no decisions have yet been made
about the future staffing of the FLA or its successor. There are
currently no plans to make any staff redundant. We are keen—it
is essential—to ensure that the current expertise is retained.
In my further remarks, I will address the balance of my response to the
hon. Gentleman’s important point, because we are trying to
achieve an outcome 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 92<a class="bkMark" name="Column92">&#160;</a>
                  </div>whereby we place the people and the expertise in a different operating
environment that allows them to do more and realise that
potential.<a class="bkMark" name="11091387000126">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It
is a natural progression to integrate the work of the FLA with that of
a body with wider responsibilities, and we want more sports to benefit
from its expertise. The authority has a well earned international
reputation as a leader in its field, and we will not do anything to
threaten that. However, the truth is that its small size means that it
is not currently able, in the Government’s view, to fully
realise its potential. The backing of a larger organisation would allow
the authority to deliver its services for less. It would be able to
explore opportunities for sharing back offices, accommodation and such.
Additionally, the authority could also further improve its commercial
potential if it were part of a larger organisation with greater reach
and commercial expertise in areas such as publishing, training, support
and commercial partnerships. We are taking this course of action
precisely because we want to give the authority greater freedom by
expanding its role and we do not want its current size to become a
constraint to fully realising those potential benefits. We are
therefore committed to finding a future home for the authority that
will enable it to build on its significant successes so far and to
continue to develop in
future.<a class="bkMark" name="11091387000127">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
recognise that there may be concern to know now where the
authority’s functions and expertise will be transferred after
2012—not least among the staff at the FLA. That is entirely
natural, but the Government believe that it would be premature to rush
to a decision without full consideration of the options, so that the
benefits for the authority, any host body and all of sport can be
maximised. The Government are committed to ensuring a smooth and
successful transition and to take no risk whatsoever with the
authority’s core football safety responsibilities. We have made
it clear that we want to consult with interested parties that would be
affected by the proposal, to allow them the opportunity to comment.
That will naturally include the relevant football authorities.
Therefore it would be wrong to speculate about potential host bodies
before we fully consult those with an interest in sports ground safety
and the work of the authority. I hope that I have been able to reassure
the hon. Gentleman with those remarks and that he will feel able to
withdraw the
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11091387000128">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">I was drawing
my comments to a close. I hope that I have reassured the Committee that
the Government do not intend to take any risks at all with football
safety. We recognise the expertise in the current FLA, but we want that
expertise to be available to a wider body for sport. We think that
expertise can develop and flourish in a different setting in a larger
organisation where some 
<div class="columnNumber">

                     </span>
                  </strong> I am not completely convinced by the
Minister’s argument. As I understand it, the amendment changes
the name of the organisation and then in effect abolishes it. It
changes the name, but the fact that the organisation is in the schedule
means that it will be abolished. I think that is the total effect of
the Government’s
actions.<a class="bkMark" name="11091387000132">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Listening
to the Minister, I found some points persuasive. For example, we can
always make the case that it would be good to pool back-office
functions on occasion—personnel, computers, accounting, payroll
and such things. In a small organisation, it is clear that there may be
some benefits to increasing scale by merging functions with another
body. However, he made some other points
too.<a class="bkMark" name="11091387000133">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> A body may be abolished, but the critical thing here
is that the functions will not be abolished but simply transferred to

                     </span>
                  </strong> Okay, so I am with the Minister so far on
sharing back-office functions with a larger organisation. The term I
used in an earlier Committee was “residual functions”.
These are core functions—sports ground safety. I accept entirely
that the Government want to place them in a larger organisation. He
also said that the Government were not yet in a place where they can
indicate what the future location might be and that though he does not
anticipate redundancies, presumably among specialist staff, he cannot
say where they will be. That leads me to reiterate the point I made
earlier. There are already anxieties among the staff. They do not know
where their future home will be—a bit like some Members in the
Committee this morning reflecting on the boundary changes we all face.
Some of us do not know where our future is, but we know we may have
one, although it may not be in this place. That is another story, which
I will not pursue further. We become anxious, and the anxiety we are
all feeling is shared by the staff of the
authority.<a class="bkMark" name="11091387000135">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">If
we were to lose the world-class expertise that those people have built
up it would be extremely unfortunate. Perhaps the Minister can tell us
on another occasion at what pace the Government intend to proceed in
relation to that decision. The Minister then said that he thought there
was an opportunity for commercial income. There may be many managers of
sports grounds who do not have in-house the expertise of those staff.
It may be possible to generate some income. That is a powerful argument
and one that we would not want to resist. But we would add a caveat
that the work of raising commercial income should not displace the core
inspectorial function of the organisation. Again we would look for some
certainty about that.<a class="bkMark" name="11091387000136">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">This is a
very difficult ask for the Minister. If a disaster were to take place I
would not want to feel that I had simply sat on my hands and given the
Minister a clear path to make a decision over which I had had no
influence. On the other hand, I am not ready yet to 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 94<a class="bkMark" name="Column94">&#160;</a>
                  </div>recommend to the Committee that we should proceed to vote. There will be
opportunities to raise this matter again after we have reflected on
what the Minister has said. Clearly an amendment that was accepted by
the Committee would go to the other place too who would also look at
the Minister’s words very carefully. I am sceptical. The
Minister has not yet convinced me, but I want to reflect on what he
said so that we can perhaps come back to it. I beg to ask leave to
withdraw the

               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Again,
this is largely a probing amendment. My hon. Friend the Member for
Hemsworth made a compelling case last week for having charities added
to the list of bodies to be considered under a transfer of functions
under clause 1. We would not necessarily want to oppose functions and
responsibilities going from a public body to a charity. However, the
Government need to give the Committee some reassurance about the
process of transferring functions from the National Consumer Council to
citizens advice bureaux, as that seems to be their
intention.<a class="bkMark" name="11091387000141">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">First,
is the Minister confident that, and can he assure the Committee that,
citizens advice bureaux have enough resources—including staff
and volunteers, where appropriate—to undertake these new
responsibilities effectively? Can he also reassure the Committee that
there is good liaison between the staff in the National Consumer
Council—the staff who are left—and those responsible for
organising the new functions within the citizens advice bureaux? There
appear to be two areas where such liaison is essential. First, the
citizens advice bureaux will be taking on this new role regarding
energy, and they will be the lead representatives for consumers on
energy and postal services. Secondly, they will be the principal
consumer advocates for many other services. Those distinct roles differ
from what the CAB did previously, and Opposition Members want to ensure
good liaison and exchange of information in advance of the transfer of
functions.<a class="bkMark" name="11091387000142">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We also want
reassurance that the CAB will be able to carry out its other existing
functions. Perhaps its most important work is on financial inclusion.
We know that the Government will give additional money to the CAB for
financial inclusion work, but we want to know that that will not be
affected by the transfer of yet more responsibilities and functions to
the CAB.<a class="bkMark" name="11091387000143">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Funding is a
greater concern. We all know from our constituencies that citizens
advice bureaux are being affected very negatively by cuts, largely from
local government, because local government is no longer receiving
enough money from central Government to support all its voluntary
sector organisations as it used to do. Citizens Advice itself is not
anxious about the question of having the expertise and ability to
undertake these functions, but individual bureaux are concerned about
whether they will have the capacity to carry out their functions, given
that their services are being cut across the board.<a class="bkMark" name="11091387000144">&#160;</a>
               </p> 
               <div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 95<a class="bkMark" name="Column95">&#160;</a>
               </div>
               <p class="tabbed">There is yet
another issue on which we want reassurance. In addition to liaison
between staff in the two organisations, is any liaison taking place
with, for example, stakeholder meetings, or all the different
organisations that might be affected by the transfer of functions? Are
the Government talking to them, and are they listening to any concerns
that might exist?<a class="bkMark" name="11091387000145">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Time scale is
another issue. There seems to be a huge question mark over whether the
statutory transfer of powers will happen before or after the powers
have been transferred in practice. As we pointed out this morning,
although the Bill is enabling legislation, with much of the abolition
of particular organisations, a transfer of powers seems to be taking
place in advance of the Bill going through the parliamentary process
and receiving Royal Assent. This issue is important, because crucial
regulatory functions are undertaken by the National Consumer Council in
representing consumers. How will those be addressed? Where will legal
responsibility lie for advice that is given if the transfer of
functions happens in advance of the statutory transfer? The Minister
needs to address that important issue.<a class="bkMark" name="11091387000146">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">My final
question is about reviewing and monitoring, which will be new
responsibilities for the CAB. No one is suggesting for a minute that,
given the right resources, it will not be able to undertake those
additional functions, but the duties will be different. Will the
Department monitor what happens to ensure that the consumer’s
voice is not weakened in any way by the Government’s desire to
abolish the National Consumer Council?<a class="bkMark" name="11091387000147">&#160;</a>

                  <strong> </strong>Consumer Focus has been placed in schedule 1
because the Government believe that its functions will be better
carried out by transferring them to the Citizens Advice service, which
includes Citizens Advice and Citizens Advice Scotland. The previous

rationalising the functions of consumer protection bodies, in order to
eliminate confusion and duplication, strengthen local delivery and
provide a stronger role for front-line consumer services. She will know
that that consultation closes on 27 September. We have to await the end
of the consultation process and will, of course, consider all responses
very carefully indeed. However, we believe that the proposals are a
positive step forward in consumer advocacy, and build on the strengths

the hon. Lady alluded to in her closing remarks, consumers need
protection no less than in the past. Increasingly sophisticated
products and services need an increasingly clued-up consumer to take
maximum advantage, and avoid the pitfalls, of the marketplace. I think
we all understand that. In Government, we need to ensure the delivery
of assistance and advice to individual consumers at the point of need
at a local level. At a national level, we need a body to continue with
quality research, and which is capable of taking on the big policy
issues of the day and fighting for the consumer interest with big
business, regulators and Government.<a class="bkMark" name="11091387000150">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I will come on to that, because that is a
consideration. When transferring functions, it is important that the
resources are there to exercise the functions properly. On the hon.
Lady’s point about increased demand on the CAB, I endorse it
wholly. I think we have all experienced an increase in our work load,
because the conditions out there are very tough for a lot of our
constituents. There are more problems out there and that makes it even
more important that our constituents, the people we represent and
serve, know where to go for the best quality advice and that there is
the resource to support them.<a class="bkMark" name="11091387000153">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">On the
question of the best place on which to concentrate resources and to
guide people to, the CAB has a distinct advantage in terms of brand and
trust, and we should seek to use that for the benefit of our
constituents and ordinary consumers. As everyone knows, it has local
representation through citizens advice bureaux in communities
throughout the country. It offers a presence on the high street for
people to call in to get advice and information. It can cater for those
who need personal contact—people are not necessarily comfortable
with a telephone or an online service. It can assist vulnerable
consumers face to face to identify problems and help with solutions. It
has a huge amount going for it as a network of trusted
support.<a class="bkMark" name="11091387000154">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It
should also be made clear that the CAB has an excellent track record of
advocacy on behalf of consumers at a national and local level. The

awareness.<a class="bkMark" name="11091387000155">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> Will the Minister say a little about the
Department’s appraisal of the coverage that bureaux are able to
offer across the country? Some of us in scattered rural areas are
concerned about the extent of the CAB network—through no failing
of the bureaux themselves. We have seen a contraction of some services
and of our constituents’ ability to access support from the CAB.
There is a worry that the network is perhaps not quite as robust as
some are suggesting.<a class="bkMark" name="11091387000156">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> That is an important consideration for the
Department. It will look carefully at the responses to the
consultation, which has not yet closed, to give itself comfort that the
network is sufficiently robust. That consultation process may throw up
some questions and challenges for Government in reinforcing the
resilience of the network. My constituency, for example, is being asked
to consider many changes to legal aid and various other issues, and the
Government are wrestling with that to try to smooth the transition and
make the process as easy as possible for the network under difficult
circumstances. That is all part of the consideration that the
Department has to make in launching a serious consultation and
considering the responses to it.<a class="bkMark" name="11091387000157">&#160;</a>

not, will it be more or less, and if less how much less? Does he have a
business case? As we have said, the CAB is short of

                  </strong> There is a wider issue about the resources available
to CAB for the functions it currently exercises, and I will address
that. It is the Government’s intention to allocate some
resources to the transferring of new functions. The Department is
obviously keen in that process to do its job on behalf of the taxpayer,
and to explore every opportunity, hopefully, to deliver more with less.
However, it is difficult at this stage to be explicit about the
potential savings from such an approach until the consultation process
has ended and the Government have come to the House with a firm
proposal and a supporting business
case.<a class="bkMark" name="11091387000164">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
have sought guidance on the Welsh issue and it seems to confirm that,
as I said, there are ongoing discussions. I stress that the key
objective is to provide a better service to consumers. We can do that
by bringing together the policy and research expertise in Consumer
Focus, especially in the energy and postal services sectors, with the
long-standing success of Citizens Advice and its bureaux in helping
consumers at the sharp end, on the high street and via their online and
telephone advice 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 98<a class="bkMark" name="Column98">&#160;</a>
                  </div>lines. We can connect the consumer policy and research functions with
the real-time concerns and problems of citizens in their communities.
The Government believe that there are real benefits to be realised by
making that
connection.<a class="bkMark" name="11091387000165">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Member for Walsall South asked about the resources that are
available to Citizens Advice for its existing functions. There are
concerns about that, and I have had a number of meetings with
representatives of that network from across the country who have talked
about the stress they are under, not least as a result of uncertainty
about local authority funding. The Government take that issue extremely
seriously, and a number of advice centres have been beneficiaries of
the £107 million transition fund that the Government have
launched. The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills and the
Ministry of Justice have put in place measures to restore some funding
to the network to help it through this process of change. The
Government take the matter very seriously and would not consider
transferring functions to a network they did not feel was fit for
purpose. In the light of that explanation, I hope the hon. Member for
City of Durham feels able to withdraw her
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11091387000166">&#160;</a>

made a very positive case for Citizens Advice which we do not dispute.
I hope it is obvious that our main concern is whether Citizens Advice
is being given enough resources to be able to undertake its functions
effectively. That becomes even more important when we look at the

to the hon. Member for Ceredigion for mentioning legal aid. We know
that local bureaux are having to consider increasing the amount of
legal advice they give to people, because so many people will not have
access to legal aid in future. I have mentioned financial inclusion. A
huge change to benefits is also taking place, so the number of people
taking advice about welfare benefits is also
increasing—precisely when the number of local authority welfare

for including the regional fisheries advisory committees in schedule 1.
Although there is a wonderful fishing river, the Wear, in my

rather than
theirs.<a class="bkMark" name="11091387000175">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Having
researched the matter, I understand that the committees have an
important role in stakeholder engagement on fishing issues. Their
members are interested in salmon fisheries, trout fisheries, freshwater
fisheries and eel fisheries in all parts of controlled areas. The
committees have an important function for those involved and interested
in
fishing.<a class="bkMark" name="11091387000176">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
stakeholder role seems to be extremely important for addressing
recreation, conservation and navigation issues. I understand that the
Environment Agency has overall responsibility for those areas, but we
need to hear from the Minister, before the committees are
abolished, about how the agency will engage with
stakeholders, if it is to perform that task. That is not totally clear,
so it would be helpful if the Minister could clarify that
point.<a class="bkMark" name="11091387000177">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We
again need to ask questions about consultation. Have the
committees’ members been consulted about the proposed abolition
and do they agree? Was it a written consultation? We are unsure whether
there has been any consultation with the committees. The committees do
not meet terribly often but, nevertheless, they deal with important
subjects when they do meet. What procedures will be in place to ensure
that such issues are
addressed?<a class="bkMark" name="11091387000178">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">These
bodies may not have a high degree of traction with the general public,
but that does not mean that they do not carry out essential functions.
We need to hear from the Minister about how issues will be addressed in
future, and we need to hear about whether the committees have made
useful contributions to debates on fishing stocks, for example, and the
consequent need to change not only national legislation, but European
legislation.<a class="bkMark" name="11091387000179">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Are
the committees helpful locally with the enforcement of fishing
standards? If so, and if the committees help local communities, anglers
and others fully to comply with the water framework directive, how will
such enforcement activity be carried out in the future? It would be
helpful to know whether the Government carried out an impact assessment
either on the work that the committees did when they were functioning
fully, or on the consequences of their abolition. We also
need to know where the Government will get  
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 100<a class="bkMark" name="Column100">&#160;</a>
                  </div>stakeholder advice from, if the committees capable of giving independent
advice to the Government and the Environment Agency will no longer
operate
locally.<a class="bkMark" name="11091387000180">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We
know that the regional committees have been able to deal effectively
with some of the complexities that have arisen for the fishing industry
due to devolution. For example, the regional committees have been able
to look at the River Tweed, which runs through England and Scotland, in
a regional context and to talk to each other about it. If the Minister
explained how the Environment Agency or another body will deal with
devolution issues, that would be extremely helpful.<a class="bkMark" name="11091387000181">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Finally, we
have questions about cost. It would be helpful to know the estimated
costs and savings to the public purse associated with a decision to
abolish the committees. We need to know whether there will be a
straightforward transfer of functions to the Environment Agency. If the
Government go ahead and abolish the committees, will that abolition
also cover the committees that existed prior to the Environment Act

necessarily follow regions—they stray; they have tributaries;
they have river basins. Increasingly, matters concerned with the
management of rivers in the Department and on a wider front tend to be
concerned more with river basin and catchment areas, rather than
artificial political constructs, which do not always meet
needs.<a class="bkMark" name="11091387000187">&#160;</a>

Government believe that a non-statutory approach will allow
more flexible community and civil society engagement on both advice and
delivery, which will better meet current needs and policy objectives.
Such a structure will have the flexibility to evolve as needed without
the constraints of a prescriptive statutory remit at the regional
level. It will better address local priorities while working with
partners and communities to deliver improved local engagement. It will
enable civil society to take the lead where appropriate, as distinct
from the current focus of simply advising the

know the range of people who are involved in these committees. What is
their background? Where do they come from? If we are to change the
structure, how will we ensure that those skills are transferred across
to any new organisation? This is a genuine question because people see
fishing as an extremely important part of our national life. They want

by asking me questions. It would be pointless me standing in Committee

trying to do mine in responding  to him.<a class="bkMark" name="11091387000193">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">Like the hon.
Member for City of Durham, I have no direct involvement with these
committees in my constituency, although I suspect that our rivers tend
to run slightly more slowly—if at all—than those in her
area. As I understand it, the principal engagement is to provide the
angling community with advice about what is happening, although it goes
slightly wider than that because there are conservation issues. There
are also local environmental issues. As the hon. Member for Telford
will be aware, there are competing uses of waterways that are not
entirely compatible. There can be perfectly legitimate competing uses
of the same river, and that is what the committees try to
address.<a class="bkMark" name="11091387000194">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
will come to the successors in a moment because it is important that we
retain the function, if not the structure. The hon. Member for City of
Durham asked whether the existing committees had been consulted. They
have, of course, and that is very much an aspect of the proposals. The
intention is to engage with all stakeholders, and much of that work has
already taken place. The river basin panels will be involved in much of
this, working along with national sector groups and angling trusts.
Indeed, an angling body for England and Wales has been set up to
provide national as well as local advice.<a class="bkMark" name="11091387000195">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">There will not
be a one-size-fits-all approach because different river catchment areas
have different needs and uses. There will be a much more organic
approach in future, building on what is appropriate for the local area
and involving a process of finding out from those people who are
involved. There will be detailed consultation on that. It is hoped that
the new structure will build up, rather than be imposed. It is not
being suggested that a new rubric should be applied that simply
replaces one statutory regional body with a new set of bodies. Instead,
the Department will work closely with those involved to ensure that
concerns are listened to and that structures are found that are
appropriate to each area. So that is what is happening. DEFRA, along
with the Environment Agency, is already working with Committee members,
key stakeholders and civil society at both a regional and local level
to consider how we can best do this. There will obviously be detailed
consultation before the proposals for the abolition of the bodies are
presented and come before the
House.<a class="bkMark" name="11091387000196">&#160;</a>

               </h4>
               <p class="tabbed">There
was a question about savings and what is proposed. I can be more
specific than I have been able to be on previous occasions. I have very
detailed costs that I can give the hon. Lady. Based on 2010-11 costs,
the total savings will be approximately £225,388. The majority
will be £122,947 for the chairs’ salaries. As I told the
hon. Member for Telford, there are seven committees. Each committee has
a chair who is paid approximately £18,000 per annum for five
days’ work per month. Other costs will be the chairs’
national insurance at £10,243, chairs’ and
members’ expenses at £25,410, meetings at £7,423,
post and printing at an estimated £4,912 and Environment Agency
staff at an estimated £54,402. I hope that the Committee feels
much better informed about the precise costs of these bodies. I can see
some hon. Members who are perhaps facing uncertain political futures in
this institution wondering if they missed the boat in offering
themselves for appointment to the bodies about which we know an awful
lot more than we
did.<a class="bkMark" name="11091387000198">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Let
me return to the basic plan, which is to maintain and improve the
functionality of the advice that DEFRA and the Environment Agency have
on the management of rivers so that they have a more integrated
approach, particularly regarding the interests of inshore estuarine and
fluvial fisheries. That is why the measures are included in the
schedule. Of course—I repeat the point that has been made many
times—before there is abolition and replacement of the bodies,
all the details will have to be consulted on and presented to the House
for Members’ scrutiny before final secondary legislation puts
the measure in place. On that basis, I hope that the hon. Member for
City of Durham will feel that she has sufficient information at her
fingertips and will withdraw the

heard what the Minister had to say, but it would be helpful to have a
bit more reassurance from the Government about who in future will
arbitrate where there is a conflict of interest on the use of the
river. That is something I experience in my constituency from time to 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 103<a class="bkMark" name="Column103">&#160;</a>
                  </div>time because rowers are sometimes in conflict with anglers about the use
of a particular stretch of river at specific times. Of course, it is
possible to refer that at least for consideration to the local and
regional panels. If they are no longer in existence, we need to know
exactly who will consider issues of that nature. On civil society
engagement, we also need some additional reassurance about exactly
which stakeholders will be involved, what will be the nature of the
involvement, what expectation the Government will have of them and so
on.<a class="bkMark" name="11091387000201">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">My
final point is about savings. I listened carefully to what the Minister
said, and I can see that there are, of course, savings at this time
from abolishing the regional committees. However, the Minister did not
give us the costs of transferring some of the functions to the
Environment Agency, so we have some questions. If none of the resources
are transferring, is this just an additional set of functions that the
Environment Agency will have to undertake within already reduced
resources? We are a bit perplexed as to how yet more functions can be
added within a reducing budget and whether the agency will be able to
undertake them
effectively.<a class="bkMark" name="11091387000202">&#160;</a>

amendments in this group relate to the abolition of the regional
development agencies and their current position in schedule 1. As the
Committee is aware, the reform of the delivery of economic development
in England was one of the commitments in the coalition agreement, and
the Government have given a public commitment that the eight RDAs will
cease operational activities by March 2012, pending abolition, which is
subject to the passage of the Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11091387000212">&#160;</a>

               </div>
               <p class="tabbed">The Government
amendments will remove the RDAs from schedule 1 and provide for their
abolition on the face of the Bill in a new clause—new clause
1—dealing with RDAs. Moving the abolition of the RDAs to the
face of the Bill would have the effect that it would no longer be
progressed using the order-making power in clause 1. The new clause
dealing with RDAs contains its own limited order-making powers and
procedure.<a class="bkMark" name="11091387000213">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Under
our plans, RDAs will not be abolished when the Bill receives Royal
Assent, but when the relevant provisions are commenced by a separate
order. If there is a requirement to transfer certain RDA activities or
powers to successor bodies, the amendment requires that that be
achieved by affirmative order unless it does not require amendment to
primary legislation. Additionally, the amendment permits the Secretary
of State to make a transfer scheme for RDA property, rights and
liabilities, and where that is not done by order, it must be laid
before Parliament. Government amendments 16 to 18, 20 and 22 make
provision regarding the commencement of the new provisions relating to
RDA abolition and amend the long title of the Bill, and new schedule 1
deals with consequential repeals to references to RDAs in other
Acts.<a class="bkMark" name="11091387000214">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
truth is that the closure programme is now significantly advanced. It
includes substantial work to scale back the expenditure of the RDAs in
line with the spending review settlement. That provided funds for legal
commitments and closure costs only, representing some 18% of the
amounts spent by the RDAs in the four years to March 2011. There are
currently about 1,300 staff left in the RDAs, which has been reduced
from approximately 3,000 at the start of the process. We expect the
majority of RDA activity to have been wound down or transferred under
existing legislative vehicles by the end of February 2012. Some RDA
activities do not require the powers proposed in the Bill to make
transfers to successor bodies. Those are the functions that have been
delegated to the RDAs by the Government, where the transfer is being
effected under existing legislative powers. Examples for the Committee
include the transfer of European Regional Development Fund activities
to the Department for Communities and Local Government and the transfer
of Rural Development Programme for England activities to DEFRA, which
both took place on 1 July; and the transfer of land and property
related assets and liabilities to the Homes and Communities Agency,
which will transfer on 19 September under the Housing and Regeneration
Act
2008.<a class="bkMark" name="11091387000215">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
reality is that if the Government proceeded with the proposed abolition
of the RDAs through use of the power in clause 1, the closure programme
would effectively need to be halted while consultation in line with
clause 10 was conducted, regardless of the clear commitment of the
coalition to abolish these bodies. I am sure that that would delight
the Opposition, but it would frustrate the Government in their
implementation of the coalition commitment. It would not be beneficial
for the economy or the future of regional economic development and
would risk compromising the budgetary savings we need to
make.<a class="bkMark" name="11091387000216">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
reassure the Committee that the Government remain committed to
meaningful consultation in line with clause 10 for orders
that are made under the main powers of the Bill. However, both I and my
colleagues in the Department 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 105<a class="bkMark" name="Column105">&#160;</a>
                  </div>for Business, Innovation and Skills have concluded that it would be
neither sensible nor appropriate to consult on RDA abolition, given our
longstanding commitment to abolish these bodies and the advanced status
of the wind-down process. I expect the Opposition to have a strong view
on that, but that is the practical conclusion that was reached by the
Department that is responsible for this process.<a class="bkMark" name="11091387000217">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Government amendments in this group are crucial to the transition and
closure process for the RDAs, which is already under way, and I hope
that the Committee will see fit to accept them. The passage of this
Bill is important to enable the wider reforms that we have in place to
support local economic
development.<a class="bkMark" name="11091387000218">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Let
me turn to the new clause tabled by the hon. Members for City of Durham
and for Hemsworth. I understand that some Opposition Members support
the retention of the RDAs, but the Government do not believe that the
RDAs represent an effective vehicle for promoting growth across the
country.<a class="bkMark" name="11091387000219">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">There has
been considerable discussion, both here and in another place, about the
RDAs, and I am aware that there is strong support in some areas for
their retention, particularly in the north of England. It must be
noted, however, that support for a regional north-east 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 106<a class="bkMark" name="Column106">&#160;</a>
                  </div>body did not lead to any proposals for a region-wide LEP. That debate
needs to be given space in the Committee, I am sure. No one is denying
that the RDAs did some good work in their time, but we sense that they
did not really belong to the communities in their regions. In my
experience, they felt like very detached agencies, because they were
based on administrative regions rather than real economic geography.
Furthermore, their budgets were unsustainable, and I suspect that they
would have been unsustainable under any Administration. Indeed, the
previous Government found it necessary to reduce RDA budgets several
times, including by more than £300 million in the 2010-11
financial
year.<a class="bkMark" name="11091387000220">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We
believe that the inherited structures are not the most appropriate for
achieving economic growth, and retaining all or any of the RDAs is not,
therefore, a viable option. New clause 3 would require, prior to the
abolition of any RDA, a report to be laid before Parliament setting out
the impact of the removal of RDAs on business development and economic
growth in the region concerned and the preparedness of local economic
partnerships to take over the functions of
RDAs.<a class="bkMark" name="11091387000221">&#160;</a>
