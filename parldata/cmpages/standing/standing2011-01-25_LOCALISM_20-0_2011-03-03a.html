the Minister’s Department, the third biggest cause of statutory
homelessness last year was the loss of an assured shorthold tenancy. It
was the third largest only because it was overshadowed by the end of a
relationship and family or friends no longer being able to house the
person. I cannot quite fathom, therefore, why the Government believe
that a problem that largely stems from the lack of stable long-term

people to that same sector—they are potentially being returned
to a revolving door of homelessness. Tenancies are shorter in the
private rented sector, and families have to move more regularly,
creating greater instability for them. Indeed, the Minister himself
recognised that in 2009, when he put his name to early-day motion 1154,
which was tabled my former right hon. Friend Sally
Keeble.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000030">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I thank the hon. Lady for her intervention. There
is, indeed, a niche in the market for those short lets, but, by and
large, moving families who are vulnerable for a range of
reasons—she will know about that from her constituency
surgery—into short-term lets creates instability. The evidence
is there, and it is not just my evidence, but the Department’s.
Some people choose a short-term let, and that is their choice because
it works with their career. My daughter, for example, is in that
situation, and it works for her and her partner at the moment, but it
probably will not in the future; they have just had their first child,
and they may not want the instability in their lives. I agree that
there is a niche in the market, but I do not think that it is
appropriate to force vulnerable families down that route and not to
give them a
choice.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000032">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Unfortunately,
the hon. Lady has not saved the Minister from being reminded of his
wonderful history with early-day motions. Early-day motion 1154
said:<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000033">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“That
this House recognises that tenants in the private rented sector risk
losing their homes through repossession when landlords default on
mortgages; notes that many tenants are evicted with little or no
notice, sometimes only finding out when the bailiff arrives on their
doorstep; further notes that many of these tenants could be at risk of
homelessness through no fault of their own”.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000379">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>That flags up one of the
issues with the way in which the private rented sector is managed, as
well as the problems faced by those who are put into the sector without
being given a choice and indeed by some of those who do have a
choice.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000034">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There is also
the issue of standards in the private rented sector. Standards have
improved enormously, and a lot of credit goes to a lot of private
landlords, who have put a lot of time and effort into ensuring that the
product they put on the market is of good quality. Again, however, all
the evidence shows that the percentage of properties of non-decent
standard is considerably higher in the private rented sector than it is
in other sectors. The most recent figure was 44%, against 32% in the
social sector—that figure was declining as a result of the
decent homes standards—and 26% among owner-occupiers. We
therefore know that a disproportionately high number of people live in
insanitary conditions in the private rented sector. As we mentioned
when we debated clauses on the allocation of housing, people living in
such houses in the private sector need to be considered for rehousing
and for the allocation of properties, so there is a bit of double
counting here, which poses further problems for local authorities,
which have a duty to house people. Clearly, we do not want local
authorities having to rehouse people from insanitary or 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 777<a class="bkMark" name="Column777">&#160;</a>
                           </div>unsuitable private rented sector accommodation and, simply because of
pressure on numbers, moving them on into properties that are probably
below standard.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000035">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Allowing local
authorities directly to place people into the private rented sector
will necessarily result in a higher proportion of some of
society’s most vulnerable people being placed into properties
that are still of a non-decent standard. There are also genuine
concerns that the local authorities will simply place people out of
borough in ever greater numbers. If a person cannot refuse, then ties
to friends and families may be broken.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000036">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Finally, there
is the issue of affordability. That is something that we come back to
time and again during discussion of this part of the Bill, largely
because of the Government’s decision on housing benefit. Rents
are higher in the private rented sector than in the social rented
sector, and reductions in housing benefit focus primarily on the local
housing allowance. The local housing allowance helps low-income
families to be able to afford their rent. One of our concerns is that
placing families directly into the private rented sector may leave them
vulnerable to further reductions in housing benefit, which in turn
could make it impossible to afford the rent. There was further evidence
yesterday, which was well publicised, of the impact of the housing
benefit proposals not just in central London, but in the whole London
and beyond into the home counties. If the rent is unaffordable and the
individual or the family cannot move, and they fail to pay and are
evicted, they will then be deemed intentionally homeless and may well
not be entitled to any further support from the local
authority.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000037">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The amendment
seeks to maintain the present system, where private sector offers can
be made in certain circumstances, with the consent of the applicant.
With proper advice, provided by some local authorities, people may
well, on understanding the nature of the waiting lists—an issue
that we have also debated at length—opt for the private rented
sector. However, it is wrong to seek to weaken the rights of homeless
applicants in that way. The Minister once put his name to early-day
motions that said as much, and I hope that he will now be willing to
accept the amendment, and, if not, to explain how and when he changed
his mind.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000038">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">On the issue
of accreditation in new clause 14, I think I speak for all of us on
this side of the Committee when I say how disappointed we are at the
Tory-Liberal Democrat Government’s decision not to change their
mind on the discharge of duty into the private rented sector. We tabled
the new clause because there is a strong argument to be made about
accreditation schemes. I accept that the new clause is fairly basic,
but we have done it with the backing of people in the industry. They
were keen to move to some sort of regulatory set-up in the run-up to
the general election, and were close to being in a position, with the
then Labour Government, to introduce something. The industry itself is
saying that it wants to have regulation. It wants to make sure that
landlords are properly licensed and that the quality in the system
drives out the cowboys and raises standards. Would it therefore be
sensible for the Government—I understand their dislike of
regulation; we may not agree with it on this side, but we understand
their position—to allow landlords to work with them to introduce
a proposal that can be included in the Bill? It would not 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 778<a class="bkMark" name="Column778">&#160;</a>
                           </div>necessarily have to be wholly managed by the local authority. Landlords
associations say that they could come up with a good, strong workable
scheme themselves, although that is work in progress.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000039">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The proposed
scheme would not be compulsory. Landlords would be able to register,
which would be a form of quality mark. Renters would then know that a
property would come with certain minimum guarantees. Furthermore, the
new clause is drafted—I thank both Shelter and the Residential
Landlords Association for their support in drafting the new
clause—in order to keep the scheme at a local level. It would
not require a new national scheme—no major Government IT
products, for example, would be necessary. Each local authority would
set up a scheme and adhere to the framework brought forward by the
regulations. Details would remain local, and the scheme would be
tailored to any peculiar local requirements. There may be some special
cases: inner-city London, for example, may be likely to have different
requirements from those of a northern seaside town. Accountability
would also be local, through the council, but with some basic
parameters set in regulation.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000040">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">On its own, we
believe that the accreditation scheme is a worthy addition to housing
legislation for the private rented sector—a sector almost
without regulation and with too many cowboy landlords ruining the
reputation of those who take their responsibilities seriously. Many of
us have children, either at university or leaving home for the first
time, who live in private rented accommodation where we know the
landlord does not care about standards. The amendment would go some way
towards rectifying that
situation.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000041">&#160;</a>

I have said, I appreciate some redrafting might be needed if the

to consider allowing direct payment of housing benefit to the landlords

intend to push ahead with placing unintentionally homeless families
with priority in the private rented sector, it is important that we
should have some safeguards, with the one outlined as a minimum. It is
flexible and progressive, and I hope that the Committee will join
Members on the Labour Benches in voting for an amendment in due

                           <em>]</em> It
already feels late. The amendments I shall speak to refer to the
provisions that enable a local authority to discharge its homelessness
duty by securing placements in the private rented sector. The first

private rented sector, and the others to standards in the

hon. Friend the Member for Bradford East and I broadly welcome the
Government’s intentions on that point, but we share some of the
concerns of Labour Members, particularly about discharge into the
private rented sector without a person’s approval. I hope that
the upshot of today’s debate will be that the Government can
consider whether adequate safeguards have been included in the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000053">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">As
Members will see, amendment 217 would effectively create a mandatory
two-stage tenancy process for discharging the homelessness duty into
the private rented sector. My hon. Friend the Member for Bradford East
and I sought to draw on lessons from recently passed Scottish
regulations governing the discharge of the homelessness duty into the
private rented sector north of the border. We are keen to ask Ministers
to reconsider the proposals to end homeless households’ ability
to choose whether to accept accommodation in the private rented sector.
Whether or not that is reconsidered, we believe that a two-stage
discharge process would improve outcomes for homeless households placed
in such accommodation.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000054">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I am grateful
to the campaign groups Crisis and Citizens Advice for the support that
they have shown for amendment 217, which would effectively provide
tenants with further support and assessment from the local authority as
the discharge process takes place. That support and assessment is
optional, though highly recommended, north of the border, but my
colleague 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 780<a class="bkMark" name="Column780">&#160;</a>
                           </div>and I believe that within the Bill, it would be better as a mandatory
provision. As the hon. Member for Plymouth, Moor View, said, a key aim
of amendments to this part of the Bill is to reduce the chance of
repeat homelessness. If we make additional efforts up front to ensure
the suitability of the accommodation that is offered in the private
rented sector to a homeless household, it will reduce the long-term
likelihood that that accommodation will fail and additional costs
befall the local authority.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000055">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The way that
such measures work in practice in Scotland, and in the amendment, does
not put undue responsibilities or onus on the private rented sector. It
does not create contracts of more than 12 months, so it should remain
appealing to landlords in the sector. By preventing repeat
homelessness, the amendment would make the system work better for
tenants, landlords and local authorities.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000056">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As the hon.
Member for Plymouth, Moor View, said earlier, we know that support is
important for people who need it. Even at a time of budget pressure,
support should be prioritised for the most vulnerable in our
communities. If people do not receive the support that they require at
the outset, tenancies are more likely to fail, with financial and
personal cost to the tenant. However, although local authorities will
have to assess all tenants’ support needs, the level of support
that they give will be determined by each tenant’s needs. The
Scottish authorities’ impact assessment said that there might be
a minor financial impact on local authorities due to a possible
increase in the provision of independent advice and information
services, but it did not foresee any major costs. In the current
climate, that is obviously a critical consideration for the
Government.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000057">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The observant
will probably note that the Bill already contains provisions to ensure
that all applicants discharged into the private rented sector who are
made unintentionally homeless again within two years are automatically
considered to be in priority need. The Government may well suggest that
that support makes a two-stage process unnecessary. However, we believe
that the two-stage process has some advantages over the
Government’s planned safeguards. It is essentially a protective
measure aimed at averting problems at an early stage, rather than
waiting for homelessness to recur.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000058">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We worry that
the two-year safeguard covers only those who are unintentionally made
homeless; the most vulnerable might leave accommodation or fail to keep
up rent payment. There is not only a risk that those in most need of
support in the early stages of tenancy will not receive it, but a risk
that if they become homeless, it will be considered intentional and
they will not be owed the main homelessness duty, whether or not they
are in a priority need group. I urge Ministers to consider whether the
provisions can be strengthened, or whether they can accept any of the
amendments tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Bradford East,
several Labour Members and me.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000059">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Under the
associated amendments—218 and 219—where a local authority
wishes to arrange for an offer of private rented accommodation to be
made to a homeless person or family in order for it to discharge its
duties under the Bill, it should not do so unless the landlord has been
properly accredited. Under amendment 218, the requirement for
accreditation will apply in all cases where the authority wishes to
discharge its homelessness duty by means of a qualifying order under
section 193(7B) of the Housing Act
1996.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000060">&#160;</a>

local authorities that have the powers to adopt some form of

start to raise their
standards?<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000061">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am grateful for the hon. Lady’s
intervention because she makes a salient and pertinent point. The
reality is that if the proposed sweep of changes to housing legislation
go forward, the state will be a major purchaser of supplies from the
private rented sector. When we are considering the best use of
taxpayers’ money, it behoves us to ensure that that money is
spent on accommodation that befits the people who are being put
there.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000062">&#160;</a>

                           </span> That is a very powerful point.
The converse side is that we should not have a situation where, through
housing benefit schemes, the state is propping up the interests of
private landlords who are not providing a good service for the public
money that is being spent. In my borough of Gateshead, I have
experience of private landlords who, while letting their property,
allow the property to run into a measure of dilapidation deliberately,
to try to drive down the value of neighbouring properties. They can
then buy up those properties at a knock-down rate and get more money
through the housing benefit system from quick
lets.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000063">&#160;</a>

                           <strong> </strong>The hon. Gentleman makes an entirely
accurate point, which was highlighted to hon. Members in a recent
Westminster Hall debate, where we learned that several housing
charities have brought to hon. Members’ attention the appalling
standards of some accommodation in the private rented sector. My
contention, and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Bradford East, is
that if the Government are going to become a major purchaser of
services in the sector, we can use that leverage to help to drive up
not just standards for those who are being discharged into that sector
under the homelessness duty, but general standards for everybody within
the private rented
sector.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000064">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Under
amendment 219, the requirement for accreditation would also apply in
the three situations where an authority is under a duty to provide
advice and assistance to an applicant under the Housing Act 1996. Those
three situations are: where the applicant is in priority need, but has
been found to have become homeless intentionally because of, for
example, rent or mortgage arrears; where the applicant is threatened
with homelessness intentionally; or where the applicant is considered
not to be in priority need. I think hon. Members from all parties
recognise that there is a critical shortage of social housing and that
large numbers of households are approaching their local authority for
support. The private rented sector is increasingly and quite properly
being used by local authorities to house vulnerable people, but despite
that—and at considerable cost to the taxpayer—there
remains little assurance of standards in the sector.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000065">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">That is a
particular concern in the context of the recently announced changes to
the local housing allowance, which will make fewer private rented
sector properties affordable to vulnerable households. I
understand that research shows that the housing benefit changes
will immediately reduce the proportion of London

about 75% to 51%. In the long term, that will fall to just over one in

support and encouragement, which I hope will be reflected by Members on
the Government Benches—if not later today, then at a later point
in consideration of the Bill. Some of the debates can be summed up by
comments of the homelessness manager of a London council on the
problems faced by the local authority when trying to put people in the
private rented sector. He was quoted in <em>Inside Housing </em>as
saying:<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000068">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

was referring to

                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“But
we don’t have as much information about the landlords as we

                        </p>
                        <p>He
continued:<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000070">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="hs_brev">“It
will probably be the same type of landlords we use for temporary

replicated.”<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000382">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">By
ensuring that offers of private rented accommodation made under the
homelessness functions only come from accredited landlords who have
proven that they meet minimum standards that can be defined locally,
local authorities will be taking steps to ensure that the most
vulnerable households are not placed with the kind of rogue landlords
with whom we are, sadly, all too familiar. There is a lack of security
and stability, and poor regulation, in the private rented sector, as
well as a lack of choice and support for the most vulnerable tenants.
That raises significant questions about whether the Bill goes far
enough in protecting those people who will be discharged into the
private rented sector under the
provisions.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000071">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
can also look, in passing, at the need to place housing benefit
claimants at the bottom end of the sector. There is almost a double
whammy for those in the wrong category. We risk worse outcomes for the
households in most need, and could incur higher costs for local
authorities in the long run. I have said that my hon. Friend the Member

is vital that local authorities ensure that they take appropriate
precautions to protect vulnerable households, so that they are not
subject to poor standards and bad management that puts them at risk of
repeat homelessness, with potentially significant costs in future, both
to the household and the state. The amendments are about the best use
of taxpayers’ money. I am sure that hon. Members on both sides

seeks to redress those potential pitfalls, and ensure that local
authorities set standards in their private rented sector and make sure
that landlords who obtain accredited status demonstrate that they can
meet those standards. We are talking about simple standards, such as:
providing a fair written tenancy agreement; agreeing to complete
repairs within a reasonable time scale, which is something that the
landlord of my London flat could well fall foul of; protecting
tenants’ deposits with an official scheme; and ensuring that the
property meets the minimum legal fire risk standards, and other
standards that the House has seen fit to set. It is not unreasonable to
expect those standards of professional landlords. As the hon. Member
for Plymouth, Moor View, has said, many local authorities already do
that, and the amendment seeks to widen participation in the best
practice that is demonstrated in parts of the country.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000076">&#160;</a>

that an authority

                           </div>that makes an offer of private rented accommodation must inform the

                        <p class="tabbed">I want to give
the broad context of the proposals in the Bill and to deal with the
specifics of individual new clauses and amendments. Clause 124 amends
section 193 of the Housing Act 1996, which places a duty on
local housing authorities to secure accommodation for applicants who
are eligible for assistance. It does not change that main homelessness
duty, and the same section also sets out the circumstances in which the
duty comes to an end. That is the essence of the clause.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000081">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In most cases,
the homelessness duty is brought to an end with an offer of social
housing in accordance with the authority’s allocation scheme.
That is at the expense of other applicants on the housing waiting list,
many of whom are likely to be in significant housing need. Currently,
housing authorities that are faced with that dilemma can arrange for a
private landlord to offer the applicants an assured shorthold tenancy
in suitable accommodation, but the applicant can turn that down without
giving a reason. They incur no penalty and the duty continues on the
local
authority.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000082">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
practice, only about 7% of homelessness duties on local authorities end
with a move into the private rented sector. That means that people who
are owed the homelessness duty can effectively insist on being offered
a tenancy in social housing, and because social housing is in short
supply, the local authority has to arrange expensive temporary
accommodation until social housing becomes available. That may not be a
significant problem in many areas of the country, but in London, for
example, where—as hon. Members have pointed out—housing
pressure is at its greatest and costs at their highest, the average
wait in temporary accommodation is now three years. In individual cases
that can be much longer. On average, people owed a homelessness duty
are spending three years in temporary accommodation. That is clearly
not a stable situation. It does not allow people to establish roots, or
enjoy security with regard to their children’s education or
other aspects of their future.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000083">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Homelessness
legislation provides a safety net for families with children and
vulnerable people at risk—groups considered to have a priority
need for suitable accommodation. That does not automatically mean that
they need social housing. The clause intends to give local housing
authorities the flexibility to bring the duty to an end with an offer
of suitable accommodation in the private rented sector, without
requiring the applicant’s agreement. That is subject to certain
conditions. First, the tenancy has to be for a minimum fixed period of
12 months. Secondly, the existing safeguards in the
legislation will apply before the duty can be brought to an end in that
way. The authority has to satisfy itself that the accommodation is
suitable for the applicant and the household, and it must be made clear
to the applicant that he or she has the right to ask for a review of
its suitability.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000084">&#160;</a>

their children’s education. He used the word
“security”. Will he please tell us how a household placed

and

months—can possibly establish roots, feel confident about
getting their children into a school in which they have the prospect of
staying for a period, or feel secure in their homes? How is that

temporary accommodation because it denies exactly those
elements?<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000085">&#160;</a>

temporary accommodation in London is currently three years, but it is
not necessarily the same accommodation for all that time. The temporary
accommodation is at the beck and call of the local authority and the
landlord. We seek to improve a situation where there is not sufficient
social housing to allow every homeless family to be given a place the
following week.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000086">&#160;</a>

a point I perhaps should have made at the outset. We are giving social
landlords the option of going down the route that we are setting out. I
am sure that there will be many parts of the country where local
authorities believe that they can best discharge their homelessness
function by continuing to place all or the majority of homeless
families in the social sector, rather than having recourse to the
private rented sector. I put it to the right hon. Member for Greenwich
and Woolwich that three years in temporary accommodation is the
average; many periods in temporary accommodation are longer than that.
It is not an acceptable long-term way to deal with homeless families in
high-pressure areas. It is appropriate for us to find another model
that is available to local
authorities.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000087">&#160;</a>

response to my right hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich and Woolwich,

rightly said that the Minister had given a number of reasons why
temporary accommodation can be unsatisfactory—reasons relating
to security, putting down roots and getting children into school. My
right hon. Friend then asked the Minister to explain his position on
the short tenancies in the private rented sector that could be imposed
on people, without them having a chance to say anything about it. I am

home of their choice immediately available in the place that they

first condition is that the tenancy must be for a minimum fixed term of
12 months. The second is that the existing safeguards must be brought
into play. That means that the authority must be satisfied that the
accommodation is suitable for the applicant and the household, and they
have the right to review that suitability. By law,
“suitability” must include the property’s
affordability, size, condition, accessibility and location. With regard
to affordability, the local authority must by law consider the
applicant’s financial resources and the total cost of the
accommodation in determining whether it is suitable. I hope that that
is some answer to some of the amendments
tabled.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000094">&#160;</a>

factor that must be taken into account by law is location, and it is
relevant for local authorities to take into account whether the family
have reasonable access to employment, schools and any necessary
support. As now, applicants have the right to ask for a review of
suitability, and if they are not satisfied, they have a right of appeal
to the county court on a point of law. The consequences of acceptance
or refusal of the offer must be made clear to the applicant, and the
authority must be satisfied that the applicant can bring to an end any
existing obligations relating to his or her current accommodation.
There will be a further safeguard in non-restricted cases where the
duty has been ended with a private rented sector offer and then the
applicant becomes unintentionally homeless again within two years,
because the duty will then recur. Provision for that is included in

                           </strong> The duty remains with the placing local authority

                        <p class="tabbed">New
clause 13, along with several other amendments, refers to setting up a
statutory housing options advice service. Housing options are an
established part of the homelessness prevention services offered by
local authorities. At present, all local authorities in England have
such a service. Indeed, many of them are very effective. Everyone
understands that London is a hot spot for homelessness and housing
pressure. However, even in the centre of London, Kensington and
Chelsea, as well as Westminster, will continue to run their housing
options service, despite it not being a statutory requirement. Of
course, specific central Government resources are provided through the
preventing homeless grant, which is paid to those hot spot areas.
London authorities are the main
beneficiaries.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000105">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">According
to information from Kensington and Chelsea, its service prevented 501
households from becoming homeless in 2009-10. Westminster prevented 564
households from becoming homeless during the same period. Even in the
hot spots, effective housing options services are continuing to keep
people in their homes and out of homelessness. Experience in my local
authority area of Stockport, which is obviously subject to far fewer
pressures, has shown that the options service works well at
significantly reducing the potential impact of homelessness.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000106">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The hon. Member
for Plymouth, Moor View, is right: that service is very important and
serves a crucial function. Of course, it saves a huge amount of money,
because the prevention of homelessness does exactly that. However,
there does not appear to be any evidence that there is a risk to the
excellent services run across the country. They will continue to be
run, and it seems burdensome to place a statutory duty on local
authorities at a time when we are saying—the title of the Bill
is a give-away here—that localism is a matter for local
determination. The way that local authorities run their options
service, and the way that they deliver, should be shaped to meet local
circumstances, rather than being part of a nationally prescribed
scheme. I am extremely sympathetic to the outcome that she wants, but I
hope that I have demonstrated that what she wants already exists, and
that we do not need a central Government, dead, bureaucratic hand to be
placed on existing, functioning
arrangements.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000107">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
second set of amendments deals with registration schemes and the
quality of the private rented sector. The hon. Member for Plymouth,
Moor View, rightly drew attention to my concerns about that, which I
have expressed in early-day motions and in speeches during my time in
Parliament. That matter clearly needs to be taken very seriously. We
need to recognise that many local authorities—particularly the
larger ones—have registration schemes that are shaped to meet
their circumstances and to deliver the standards that they believe are
relevant in their area. The private rented sector is not, as she says,
largely unregulated. The Housing Act 2004 introduced the housing health
and safety ratings system, which allows local authorities to assess
private properties in relation to a wide range of hazards. It also
gives local authorities power to enforce
compliance.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000108">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Lady rightly said that the proportion of non-decent homes is
higher in the private sector than in the local authority and public
sector, but the figure is not as significantly higher as one might
expect—some 40% of homes are non-decent in the private rented
sector, compared with 32% in the local authority sector. The English
housing survey has shown that a large number of homes in the private
rented sector are judged to be non-decent because they have
particularly steep staircases. That is a function of their age and
design, rather than reflecting their actual standard for occupation.
Again, we should not have an exaggerated view of the
difficulties.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000109">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The hon. Lady
said that 32% of homes in the local authority sector were non-decent. I
remind her that there is no ruling—and the amendment does not
provide one—that a homeless family may not be placed in a
non-decent social home. Indeed, members of the Committee might agree
from casework experiences that local authorities often put homeless
families in hard-to-let accommodation, which is often non-decent
accommodation. It would seem a little perverse to have a rule requiring
a decency standard in the private rented sector that we are not
requiring in the social sector.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000110">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Let me turn to
the amendments tabled by my hon. Friends the Members for St Austell and
Newquay, and for Bradford East. There is a good deal of overlap between
what is proposed in those amendments and in the amendments on which I
have already commented. There is concern about whether the
accommodation 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 789<a class="bkMark" name="Column789">&#160;</a>
                           </div>into which a homeless family is placed will be satisfactory. I draw the
attention of my hon. Friend the Member for St Austell and Newquay to
the requirement for the local authority to ensure that any offer is
suitable. I have outlined to the Committee the factors that a local
authority must take into account by law; if it does not take them into
account, it can be challenged in the
courts.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000111">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There was a
point about accredited landlords and standards. A large number of local
authorities, particularly the larger housing authorities, already have
accredited standards and use them as a vehicle for improving standards
in the private rented sector. However, as my hon. Friend the Member for
St Austell and Newquay said, there is a shortage of accommodation in
all sectors at the moment. We have more households than homes, which
means that resources are scarce. We must not create a system of
regulation in the private sector that is so burdensome that landlords
withdraw from that sector, fail to come forward, or refuse to accept
homeless social tenants nominated by the local
authority.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000112">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am grateful to the Minister for setting out the
Government’s thinking, but there is a danger of us trying to
have our cake and eat it. On one hand, the Minister is saying that many
housing associations and local authorities already implement legally
enshrined standards, and that if those standards are not enforced by
the local authority, people can get redress through the courts. On the
other hand, however, he says that there is a weak case for extending
those standards to the worst parts of the private rented sector by
compelling local authorities to have a code. How does the Minister
square that circle?<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000113">&#160;</a>

committed to a process of localism. Any local housing authority can do
exactly what he has just said should happen statutorily, and a good
number already do. They have that option. They will judge the
circumstances that they face, the health and prosperity of the private
rented sector, the pressures that they face in placing families, and
perhaps the longer-term encouragement of the private rented sector in
the area. It is for a local authority to take those decisions. There is
nothing in the legislation that prevents it from doing everything that
my hon. Friend believes should happen.

That is not what localism is about. Standards nationally should protect
the most vulnerable, and I am worried about the line of argument that

                           </strong> I have already explained the national framework.
When an accommodation offer is made to somebody to whom the
homelessness duty is owed, it has to be suitable.
“Suitable” is not a woolly, vague  
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 790<a class="bkMark" name="Column790">&#160;</a>
                           </div>word: it is defined in law. I have already described the factors that
comprise suitability. It has been tested in the courts often over the
years; it is a well-understood concept. If the tenant is dissatisfied,
they can ask for a review, which is undertaken by the council, and if
they are not satisfied with the outcome, the matter can be taken to the
county
court.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000116">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">That
is the national framework. Within that, any local housing authority
could discharge that suitability test by running an accreditation
system in which any accredited property is deemed suitable. They could
do that if they chose, and some already do. I say to the hon. Member
for Scunthorpe that the right framework is to have a national
overarching suitability test, which is not at all imprecise, and which
local authorities can develop, if they think it appropriate in their
area, to ensure that their scheme suits their circumstances. That is
what localism is about, balanced against standards at a national
level.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000117">&#160;</a>

giving way. I am quite intrigued by his argument. A couple of weeks
ago, we spoke about best practice among local authorities in the
context of the community right to bid, and to challenge to run
services. I questioned the Government on why all the prescription and
legislating on that issue was necessary, given the many examples of
good local authorities already doing what was proposed. This seems to
be the flip-side of that argument. The Minister says that there are
good authorities out there, some of which have something similar to an
accreditation scheme, so we do not need to legislate. Can he explain
that inconsistency for
me?<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000118">&#160;</a>

think that I have made it very clear where the Government believe the
balance lies between a national framework for the allocation of
tenancies, and tailoring that to deal with local circumstances. This is
not a question of good and bad authorities, but of fundamentally
different situations facing them. I speculate, but I imagine that a
large number of shire district housing authorities outside urban areas
will see no need even to think about the application of this particular
flexibility. However, the consultation report clearly showed that some
authorities would very much like the opportunity to take advantage of
this
flexibility.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000120">&#160;</a>

that we need confidence: first, that the public has confidence that
public money is spent wisely and properly on decent accommodation for
the most vulnerable in our society; secondly, that the council has
confidence that tenants are being placed only with good landlords;
thirdly, that the homeless have confidence that if they are being
placed in private sector rented accommodation, it is decent; and,
fourthly, that good landlords have confidence that they are not being
undercut by the bad? If it is being suggested that those objectives are

not the right way to go. If we accepted the principle of there being a
statutory need to do all the additional things he describes, cases
would be still be settled the same way—there would still be
disputes; they would still go to the court. His point might be that he
does not think that that court is the right place for the process to
happen, but introducing another law will not reduce in any way the
intervention of the courts if the decision is taken in an improper way

                           </strong> I am listening carefully to the Minister and he is
being generous in giving way, but it seems to me that a suitability
test applies to everything except the suitability of the property. That
is the point that we are making. We should make sure that there is some
protection around the suitability of a property for the most vulnerable
people in our
society.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000128">&#160;</a>

that one. As I said, suitability depends on a number of things,
including the size of the property, its condition and its

there to assess affordability, size, location, accessibility and
conditions,

However, that right is probably not widely known, and when we are
talking about some of the most vulnerable people in our society,
exercising that right of redress will be difficult, complex, time
consuming and, given that it might involve legal action, possibly
expensive.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000132">&#160;</a>

suitability test that is outlined as protection by the Government does
not cover the speed at which premises are repaired or whether the
conditions of the agreement are fair—what we would accept for
ourselves—such as whether tenants are allowed pets, or visitors
after a certain time. We have an opportunity to include an additional
set of obligations in the Bill to protect the most vulnerable and to
drive up standards—not just for them but across the private
rented sector—at the same time as ensuring that our principal
concern is met: the proper use of public
money.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000135">&#160;</a>

was not clear whether the Minister had finished his remarks on all the
amendments. He did not refer to the possibility of a two-step
discharge, which might address some of these problems. Under that
proposal, an assessment could be made after six months in the private
sector of whether the accommodation remained appropriate for that
person. Perhaps the Minister will explain—orally or in
writing—why the Government do not see merit in that
proposal.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000136">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The Minister’s response has been wholly
unsatisfactory, and at times completely contradictory, as he has tried
to justify the wording of the Bill and the change he proposes. There is
a lot of common ground between the Opposition and the Liberal Democrat
Members on the amendments and our genuine concerns, some of which were
expressed by the Minister.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000137">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
Minister’s assertion that families have a choice does not stand
up, even when he prays in aid issues around temporary accommodation. We
have heard from a number of Labour Members about cases that make a
nonsense of the Minister’s argument. It is not desirable that
people spend three years moving around temporary accommodation.
However, what is proposed leaves people with no choice but to go into
the private rented sector. They might have a landlord who wants to
extend their provision beyond 12 months, but they might not. People
could find themselves in another revolving door, with all the
instability that comes with
that.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000138">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Minister talks about safeguarding, but it is for only up to two years.
After that, the tenants are on their own, and the landlord will have no
duty at all. Given the housing benefit changes that are being brought
forward, a number of authorities will be shipping people outside their
borders, so there could be a difficult impact on the receiving
authorities when that two-year period is up. My hon. Friend the Member
for Scunthorpe put his

                           </div>finger on the button with his assessment that the provisions were being
weakened. The Minister made great play of the quality of
people’s homes and the roofs over their heads, and said that
there was concern about the standard of homes in the social sector.
However, an awful lot of work is going on in the social sector, and
every local authority, through the decent homes programmes, is trying
to bring homes up to a certain standard. My local authority, which is
not a Labour authority, endeavours to ensure—or it certainly did
when it was managing the homes—that homes are improved before
moving people into them. That simply does not happen in the same way in
the private rented sector.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000139">&#160;</a>

Minister seemed to condone allowing the worst landlords in the private

legislation, is entirely wrong.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000140">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Clause 124 is the reason why I wanted to serve
on the Committee, and I oppose it on ideological grounds. My reasons
are not about the private or public sectors, nor are they about
vulnerable families—a lot of the homeless families I see are not
vulnerable; they simply need somewhere to live. My ideology is that of
work. I believe that everybody who can work should work, and that no
social policy should get in the way of that objective. For that reason,
I ask Government Members to consider my comments. I do not believe for
a minute that the Committee will vote against clause 124, but I want to
ask the Government to go away and question some of what I have said and
to see whether they can share any of my views and those of other Labour
Members. I am happy to provide my figures, which have been provided by
the Library.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000174">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I want to show
why the measure will mean that people in my constituency will not work
and better themselves—it will be an aspiration tax. It may be
such a tax for not only the current generation of parents, but their
children who want to better themselves through
university.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000175">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">My
constituency is in south London at the end of the Northern line. It is
not an expensive place in London terms, although I accept that it is
exceptionally expensive compared with the constituencies represented by
some members of the Committee. Some 24% of people on housing benefit in
Mitcham and Morden work. The overwhelming number of people on housing
benefit are not unemployed—they work, care for somebody or are
disabled. If, after approaching Merton council, a family are discharged
to the private sector against their will, there will be enormous
consequences.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000176">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I am trying to
convey these arguments through the people whom I have met, such as Miss
James and Mr Brown. Mr Brown is a postman, and Miss James
works in an after-school club at Haslemere primary school, which her
two kids attend. They have an income of about £26,000 a year,
which is roughly £500 a week. If they are discharged to the
social sector, the median rent for a two-bedroom property will be
£95 a week. On their income, they would not be entitled to
housing benefit, so they would be floated off benefit and could pay
their own rent. However, if that same family on the same income are
discharged to the private sector, their median rent for a two-bedroom
property is £196.15 a week. On the same earnings of £500
a week, they will be in receipt of housing benefit, and they will stay
in receipt of housing benefit even if they earn £200 a week
more, at which stage they will get £17.77 a week in housing
benefit. In addition to receiving housing benefit to the order of
£20, they will also be £83 a week worse off than if they
were in social accommodation.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000177">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The aspiration
tax comes in if they work to raise their income from £600 to
£700, because they will gain only £25 of that additional
£100 a week. Although they will be working extra hours and
encountering the additional difficulties of looking after their young
children, of the £100 extra that they earn, they will keep only
£25. In the social housing sector, however, they would keep
£68. That is the difference for such real families.
The marginal rate of tax for a family earning £100 more a week
is 75% in the private sector and 32% in the social
sector.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000178">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Let me cite
another example involving two adults, such as Mr and Mrs Ossai, and
four children in a three-bedroom house. I am sure that nobody would 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 795<a class="bkMark" name="Column795">&#160;</a>
                           </div>suggest that such a property was palatial or that the family would have
too much space. Mrs Ossai is a district nurse—a great
lady—and her husband had a building company that went down the
tubes, so he works when he can. In social housing, if they were given a
three-bedroom house, the median rent for their property would be
£105 a week. When they reach earnings of £650 a week, or
£34,000 a year, they would not be entitled to housing benefit,
and they would be paying their own rent. In the private sector,
however, for an equivalent property, for which the median rent is
£253, they would be able to earn £1,000 a week and still
be on housing benefit. In fact, under the Government’s
proposals, they would lose their child benefit rather than their
housing benefit. They would not only be a responsibility for the state,
but find their own income drastically reduced, because they would be
£41 a week worse off than a family in a rented unit in social
housing. If their income was to increase from £700 to
£800 a week, they would receive only £10 of that
additional £100. Is that an incentive to go
work?<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000179">&#160;</a>

                           </span> The hon. Lady’s
south London constituency is close to mine, and she makes a valid point
about the marginal rates of taxation experienced by tenants in the
private rented sector in receipt of housing benefit. However, I am not
sure why she is speaking against clause 124, because I put it to her
that nothing in the clause will change the number of families in her
constituency who are allocated social housing in any given year. The
people might change, depending on the particular policies that Merton
council adopts, but it will not change the number of families in her
constituency who get allocated a social housing tenancy as opposed to a
private rental. Her argument is not about the clause; it is about the
need for more social
housing.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000180">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The hon. Gentleman is right that my argument is
about the need for more social housing, but he is wrong to say that the
proposal will change who is being housed. People who are in overcrowded
conditions will obviously get the larger properties, and the less
popular one-bedroom flats will be left, and families and people with
children will not have access to them. The hon. Gentleman is one of the
people whom I hope will consider my argument, because he knows exactly
what I am talking about, because he represents a similar
area.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000181">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
am sorry if Members are becoming bored, but this is a passion of mine,
and I want to ensure that everyone understands exactly what is going to
happen if you force families into the private sector against their
will. If the income of a family in a three-bedroom house in the private
sector increases from £700 to £800 a week, they will be
£10 a week better off, but they will still be receiving
£107.45 in housing benefit. Is that how we want to spend
taxpayers’ money? I suggest that it is not; it is bad for us and
bad for
them.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000182">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
council was trying to persuade Mrs Ossai to take a private sector
property. She is a good woman who wants to do what is best. She does
not want to be homeless and she was about to accept the property. I
pleaded with her not to do that because of what would happen to her
family financially. She accepted a three-bedroom flat on an estate that
is not the nicest place in the world—nobody here would choose to
live there—but 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 796<a class="bkMark" name="Column796">&#160;</a>
                           </div>not the worst. Having that lady, who is a district nurse, and her family
who work, with the kids getting on, is great for the block of flats in
which she lives. She provides an example and a way forward, and, before
we know where we are, she will be caring for the other people in her
block, which she is happy to
do.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000183">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Again, I am absolutely with the hon. Lady on the
need for people in our estates who are in work, which she touched on
earlier. For her argument to have merit as opposed to giving us an
individual powerful example, however, she would have to demonstrate
that the people who are accepted as homeless in Merton are more likely
to be in that in-work income range than people on the housing waiting
list. My experience in Croydon is that, if anything, the converse is
true. If more social housing spots are allocated to people who were on
the housing waiting list, more tenancies will be given to people who
are actually in work and who need the kind of support that she is
discussing. There might be good housing reasons for not doing so, but
that is right in respect of her particular
point.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000184">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am sure that the hon. Gentleman does not mean
this, but I feel that this is about the belief that all homeless
families are young single-parent mums who do not want to work and all
the rest of it. The case is that my borough discharges some 10 homeless
families a month into the private sector. The group that overwhelmingly
enters that sector of their own free will are precisely those young
mums, because they are not going to work. They are not at a stage of
their life at which we could get them to work—they are probably
not at a stage in their life at which an employer would take them
on—but with the help of others, we hope that that will change in
the
future.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000185">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
disagree with even 10 homeless families a month being discharged to the
private rented sector. I want to do my best to get young mums into
work, because that is best for their children. It is a travesty that we
would choose to put a family with children into a home in which the
parents cannot go out to work every day. The only way to teach the
children is through the behaviour of the parents. Unless we get them
into accommodation in which they can afford to live like that, there
will be a huge social problem in the
future.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000186">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
do not mean to tax the Committee, and I am sorry if I am, but I want to
give two more examples. The first is Gerard, who worked for a housing
association. He worked in social care, and he was extraordinarily
successful. He had a good income and did not need any help from anyone,
but he met up with the wrong partner. They had a volatile relationship,
and he started to drink. He lost his home, so he started sleeping
rough. His job collapsed on him—he could not do it—and he
had a breakdown. He had a number of psychotic episodes and he took a
long time to get
better.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000187">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
council eventually gave him a one-bedroom flat around the corner from
where I live. His rent is £80 a week, so he only has to earn
just above the minimum wage to pay his rent without help from housing
benefit. He has gone back to caring for people supported by the
independent living scheme. There is not a lot of pressure and he has
the skills, so he manages to do the job. Had he been placed in the
private sector, and as a vulnerable

                           </div>person he could have been, he would be on as much as £400 a week
and be in receipt of housing benefit. And, again, if he raised his
income from £300 a week to £400 a week, he
would only have been £24 a week better off; whereas somebody in
social housing would be £68 a week better
off.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000188">&#160;</a>

do not want to try the Committee’s patience, but I want to give
one more example, which I find staggering. My hon. Friend the Member
for Lewisham East and I have very large Tamil populations in out
constituencies. In the UK some 80% or 90% of Tamil families, no matter
what their social circumstances, send their children to university.
More Tamil girls than Tamil boys go to university. Education is
incredibly important, and I am seeing increasing numbers of Tamil
families being evicted because of the uplift in rents and other such

                        <p class="tabbed">A
number of Tamil families have come to me, and I want to tell the
Committee about Mr and Mrs Alegaratnam, who recently obtained a tenancy
from Moat housing association. They have a number of children and live
in a three-bedroom house. Their rent is £105 a week and they are
earning just over £300, so they can afford to pay it themselves.
Had they been discharged to the private sector, they would be in a
property with a median rent of some £253 a
week.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000190">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Mr
and Mrs Alegaratnam have two children just about to go to university.
The family have nothing, but the kids are going to Oxford and
Cambridge. That is a magnificent statement about our country, and it is
a magnificent statement about that family. But if their two daughters
go to university in September, the reduction in the family’s
income would be staggering, because they would then be under-occupying
the family home. So not only will they have a shortfall in their rent
because of the introduction of the 30th percentile restriction, but
they will be under-occupying. We could not believe the figures when we
looked at them: when the two girls go, Mr and Mrs Alegaratnam will be
left with £41.66 of that £300 a week. With an income of
£400, after paying their rent they would be left with £65
a week. If someone knew their mum and dad were going to be left with
that amount, would they leave the household? They will not; I would
not, and I am sure most members of the Committee would
not.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000191">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">That
is the real consequence of these measures. How can we have the big
society of the Government’s ideology, if we do not allow people
to access it or the fundamental building blocks of work to better
one’s family? I have tried to work that out. But other than
having a rather mean-spirited ideology—I would not suggest that
Government Members have such an ideology—I do not understand why
someone would want to do that. I have looked at the analysis of and the
evidence for the homelessness policy, and I ask all members of the
Committee to look at the impact assessment because it explains why the
Government are doing it. I am not the best accountant in the world; I
am not any sort of accountant. Members of the Committee may understand
how the figures stack up better than I do.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000192">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Page 66 of the
assessment suggests that over 30 years there will be a saving of
£6.8 billion because temporary accommodation will no longer have
to be paid for. A small amount of that is because councils will no
longer have to process the bureaucracy of temporary accommodation. Page

benefit costs for those 20,000 families will cost the taxpayer. If,
over a 10-year period, each family costs only £10,000 more a
year—£20 a week—within 10 years there will be no
savings. As we know, rents in the private sector for two-bedroom
properties are about £100 more a week than in the social sector.
I appreciate that not every area costs as much as Mitcham and Morden,
but many areas cost more.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000193">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We must look
at the figures and challenge them. I do not believe that we—or
more importantly, the British taxpayer—will save anything. We
will, however, incontrovertibly place 20,000 families a year in a
position where there will be an impediment for them to do everything
that our families did for us, whatever walk of life we came from. My
dad worked on buildings, and I saw him go out to work every day from
Monday to Saturday until he was 70. He believed absolutely in the power
of work to support a family, and as a moral good to keep a person fit
and healthy, both mentally and physically. It is also good for a
citizen to pay taxes and pay for services that they, and members of
their community, may need when vulnerable. Look at the figures, look at
the effects and think seriously about this

                           </strong> I feel privileged to follow that extremely
powerful speech by my hon. Friend the Member for Mitcham and Morden.
She has a long tradition of concern and care for homeless people and
for housing, and she made an incredibly persuasive case. She rightly
highlighted the impact that the changes proposed by the clause, and
other measures in the Bill, will have on ordinary people and on those
who, under current arrangements, might have the prospect of moving into
more secure accommodation after a period of unsettled existence due to
homelessness. It is important to give such people the opportunity to
rebuild confidence in their lives, get back to work, and put their
children in a school in the comfort and knowledge that they will remain
in that area. All those things are being undermined by this
provision.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000195">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We all
recognise the importance of policies that discourage dependence and
encourage people to make the most of their potential. As my hon. Friend
urged the Committee, we should be thinking of that when we consider the
clause. She rightly emphasised that, in general, homeless people are
not different from other people. There are some who have special
problems, but the vast majority of homeless people are those who have
fallen on difficult times. They may have lost their home through a
variety of different circumstances, and they are exposed to all the
horrors of not having a home. Above all, they need help and support to
get back on their feet and to move back into the mainstream and normal
life.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000196">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">That
is what brought me into working in housing in the late 1960s. I was of
the generation that saw “Cathy Come Home” and was
horrified by the revelation in that powerful programme of just how
badly we as a society treated homeless people in the 1960s. It was a
revelation. I was not aware that old workhouses were still being used
as accommodation, or that families were routinely split up and husbands
were not allowed to go into accommodation for homeless
families—only the women and children could go in, and the
husbands were split away. There was no proper safeguard for homeless
families or people. That led me not only to 
<div class="columnNumber">

                           </div>work in the voluntary housing sector, but to campaign in the 1970s for a
law that would give hope and security to homeless people and help the
process that I have just
described.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000197">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">That
process involved helping homeless people through the difficulty and
back into the mainstream of society, rather than allowing them to be
stigmatised, marginalised and punished, as was the case before the
Housing (Homeless Persons) Act 1977. That Act was very important, and I
helped Stephen Ross, the Liberal MP for the Isle of Wight, who bravely
undertook to promote that as a private Member’s Bill in 1976, a
time when he could have easily adopted other causes that might have
been more popular in his constituency. I know from talking to him at
the time that he was determined to do something hugely important for
society, not just take on something that would be popular and help him
to win a marginal seat in the ensuing general election, so I pay huge
tribute to him. He did so with the support of the then Labour
Government, which had a wafer-thin majority, so Liberal support was
important. The two parties worked together, and that legislation was
the product of Labour and Liberals working together to give rights to
homeless people.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000198">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I am sorry to
say that the Conservative party at the time opposed that legislation.
It voted against it and fought it literally clause by clause through
this House. However, it got onto the statute book and made a
difference. It changed attitudes towards the homeless, and it ensured
that provision for homeless people was brought into the mainstream of
housing provision, rather than being something on the margins that
separated them from the rest of society. That continued throughout the
1980s, until in 1996 a Conservative Government sought to weaken the
safeguards for homeless people. In Opposition, we in the Labour party
fought that unsuccessfully, supported by the Liberal party—I
think they were the Liberal Democrats by then—who were
absolutely at one with us in defending the 1977 Act against the Tory
Government’s attempt to weaken it. I welcomed that
support.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000199">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">In
2000-01, when I was Minister for Housing and Planning, I had the
privilege of introducing the Homes Bill, which reinstated the principal
safeguards of the 1977 Act which had been weakened by the 1996
legislation, and also introduced the concept of local authorities
developing homelessness prevention strategies. That Bill did not reach
the statute books immediately—it fell because of the 2001
general election—but it was re-introduced by my successor
immediately after that election, when I had moved to another
responsibility, and made it on to the statute book. That was passed by
a Labour Government with the support of the Liberal Democrats. In fact,
I well remember the right hon. Member for Bath (Mr Foster), who led the
Opposition for the Liberal Democrats in the Committee that discussed
the Homes Bill in the run-up to the 2001 general election. He was
pressing us to go further, rather than saying we should weaken in any
way our commitment to homeless
people.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000200">&#160;</a>

people and help those in difficult circumstances to get

and Newquay has—to a degree—maintained the honourable
tradition of his party in seeking to safeguard the position of homeless
people. I hope when on Report he will continue to do so with a
commitment to voting for his views, rather than simply articulating
them.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000201">&#160;</a>

say to this Committee, and to all Members of this House, that this is a
retrograde step. This is weakening the safeguards for homeless people.
As my hon. Friend the Member for Mitcham and Morden so eloquently said,
it will expose more people to a position where they are subject to a
dependence on benefits; where the work incentives are to very large
degree taken away by punitive rates of taxation because of the
withdrawal of benefits; and where they do not have the security to be
able to rebuild their lives because they live in insecure lettings
where they cannot be certain they can stay from one year to the next
and continue to occupy it as their home, providing they pay the rent
and meet the tenancy obligations. This is a sad, retrograde step, and I
believe that the House will ultimately regret it and will come to
realise that if it passes the clause, and the Bill, it will have made a
serious
mistake.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000202">&#160;</a>

incredibly well-informed and passionate speeches from Labour Members
who have a wealth of experience. My hon. Friend the Member for Mitcham
and Morden made an extraordinarily strong case. I urge the Minister to
look at the figures that she provided and share them with officials and
indeed with colleagues at the Department for Work and Pensions. They
are relevant not only to this debate but to the upcoming debate on
universal benefits. The questions that the hon. Member for Croydon
Central legitimately asked deserve to be considered along with that,
not least because my hon. Friend’s figures reinforce her
case.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000203">&#160;</a>

Friend the Member for Greenwich and Woolwich gave us all yet another
vital history lesson about the importance of the homelessness
legislation, and about the support and drive that came from the Liberal
Democrats. I hope that if the hon. Member for St Austell and Newquay
feels that some of the concerns that he raised are not responded to, he
will come through the Lobby with us, because we will want to take this

and issues that my hon. Friends the Members for Lewisham East and for
Mitcham and Morden raised about the numbers that will be discharged
into the private rented sector—about 20,000 additional
households—is the Minister confident that the capacity of
suitable accommodation exists in the PRS to house them? There is
enormous pressure from both ends of that sector as a result of the
forthcoming changes to the housing benefit system as well as from
people who cannot currently access mortgages. I am sure the industry
will reinforce that point and that the Minister is aware of the
situation. At the same time, the number of people who are owed a main
homelessness duty is starting to rise again after having fallen quite
dramatically during the 10 or so years to early 2010. Can the Minister
put his hand on his heart and tell us that the private rented sector
will also want to prioritise

able to charge higher rents to people including, perhaps, some of those
families who are returning from Germany? They may not need social
housing but may need space in the private rented sector.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000205">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Why did the
Minister not feel that it was necessary to carry out a full health and
well-being impact assessment of the measures relating to homelessness?
It is well recorded that uncertainty about one’s housing status
and constant moving between properties can give rise to health and
mental health problems. We have already debated the condition of the
stock at the cheaper end of the private rented sector, which causes
ongoing health concerns. A number of mental health charities have
expressed concern about that and I would like to know why there appears
to be this omission in the papers with which we have been
provided.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000206">&#160;</a>

government ombudsman is already receiving a large number of complaints
about councils indulging in what are described as gatekeeping
activities, and trying to offload people into housing outside their
boroughs. A recent case highlighted in <em>Inside Housing</em> concerned
Richmond council, which failed to house a woman who was eight months
pregnant. She was told to go to Wandsworth, but she wanted to stay
close to her family for support and because of her expected new
arrival. The local government ombudsman found in her favour. Has the
Minister considered the potential rise in such cases and other legal
actions, and the additional costs that local authorities will face in
legal fees as a result of this? I could not find a reference to that in
the impact assessment, but I may have missed

elaborate on the point I was trying to make to the hon. Member for

and, with some trepidation, I want to respond to the right hon. Member
for Greenwich and Woolwich. I was David Curry’s special adviser
sitting in the corner of the Committee Room during the debates on the

                        <p class="tabbed">Our
fundamental problem is the lack of secure accommodation. My view
probably differs slightly from that of Labour Members in that I believe
that many of the people I see at my surgeries who have either been
accepted as homeless or who are on the housing waiting list do not
necessarily require a tenancy for life. They certainly need more than a
six-month tenancy and in many cases they need more than a two-year
tenancy. They need a significant degree of security. There are not many
people for whom the right solution is to be given a lifelong tenancy,
but I certainly accept that the issue is a lack of security of tenure,
particularly for people with children, who wish to settle in an area
and have their children go to school. That is the fundamental
problem.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000209">&#160;</a>

absolutely with the hon. Lady on the importance of promoting work and
the massive issues that we have, particularly in London, because of the
levels of rent in the private rented sector and the way that housing
benefit is structured and the marginal rates of tax that people face
when we place them in the private rented sector. The point I was trying
to make in my intervention

increase the stock of secure housing. The issue is how we allocate a

                           </strong> Let me develop the argument and then I will
happily give way. At the moment, councils can discharge the duty into
the private rented sector with the permission of the person concerned.
The fact that some people object and others do not does not necessarily
strike me as the most rational way to allocate our secure housing
stock. Nothing in the clause will change the availability of secure
stock in any of our constituencies.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000212">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">A good council
will benefit from the ability to decide between people who are on the
housing waiting list, many of whom are in acute housing need. I am sure
that the right hon. Gentleman and the hon. Member for Mitcham and
Morden would agree that in relation to their constituencies.<em> </em>For
people who have been accepted as statutorily homeless, the authority
should be able to decide where the priority lies in each individual
case as to who is best placed in a secure tenancy and who is best
placed in the private rented sector<em>. </em>I should like to see more
secure tenancies so that more people could be placed in that
environment.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000213">&#160;</a>

on some of these issues. He talks about the need for more homes where
secure tenancies are available. I agree with him 100% on that. Does he
believe that the Bill overall, particularly the provisions in the
planning part, will lead to more of that type of housing being built in
the coming years? Does he believe that the reductions in capital grants
to the Homes and Communities Agency will result in more homes of that
type being built? I completely agree with him. We come back to the
issue of a lack of affordable housing. That is the real

                           </strong> I will be brief as I promised I would be. The
answers to her questions are yes and no. I believe that a lot more is
achieved through incentive than from forcing people to do something
they do not want to do. If the Government get the level of the new
homes bonus right and if they review that as it rolls out, I believe it
will lead to more housing development over time. It is a question of
getting the level of the incentive right. The dangers that Labour
Members have warned about are there. It is a question of balancing
these things correctly. I am an optimist on that point. Clearly the
reduction in HCA funding is not helpful in this context. I do not want
to reopen the issue of the deficit and the need to deal with it and
where responsibility lies, but it would be silly to deny that that is a
concern in that
regard.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000215">&#160;</a>

essence of my reply was provided by my hon. Friend the Member for
Croydon Central. For every person the hon. Lady described who is at a
disadvantage as a result of moving into the private rented sector,
there will be somebody else who does get the social home that they
might have got, who will have the benefit. One household gains, another
household loses. I am not persuaded that it would be better for the
individuals and households she brought eloquently to the Committee to
be in private rented temporary accommodation for three years, not
knowing whether they were there for a week, month, year, two or three
years. It would be better for them to be in a secure assured tenancy as
set out in the
legislation.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000217">&#160;</a>

Member for Mitcham and Morden raised a linked point about whether the
assessment of costs in the impact assessment was right. I want to make
it clear that the impact assessment balances or offsets the cost of
housing benefit in temporary accommodation against the cost of housing
benefit in the private rented sector as a consequence of making these
changes. The housing benefit costs are higher in temporary
accommodation to cover local authority management costs and voids,
because units are usually procured for several years at a
time.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000219">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> While the Minister is right to say that across
the board there is an average period of three years in temporary
accommodation, there are many authorities—such as my own in
Greenwich—that have worked hard to minimise the use of temporary
accommodation. Thanks to that, in our area there are not a large number
of people—in fact very few—in temporary accommodation.
That, again, is the product of authorities doing the right thing. I
hope the Minister will recognise that they should be encouraged to
that, rather than simply tip more people into private lettings, which I
fear will be the consequence of the
clause.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000222">&#160;</a>

in the earlier debate that I would suppose that a large number of

flexible option to be available to them. It could well by that my local

it better for me to write to the Committee with the detailed
information on that point. I certainly do not want, in any way, to
trivialise the strong case that she has made for families to have
accommodation where they can feel secure and build a future for
themselves. The debate is centred around whether the Government
providing an option for the most hard-pressed local housing
authorities, which cannot avoid having substantial numbers of
residents, to whom they owe a homeless duty, stuck in temporary
accommodation, will actually improve the possibilities and options for
those families. Our case is that the proposal provides a safety valve
that can do
that.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000226">&#160;</a>

say to the right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich, who has a
lifetime’s professional experience working in this field and
with whom I tangle with the greatest trepidation, that it is certainly
right that homeless families should be helped back into the mainstream
as soon as possible and that—he and I share this view—if
we had more social housing, that would be easier to achieve. I have
already pointed out to the Committee that we actually have
significantly less rented housing available—420,000 fewer social
homes—than in 1997. Our analysis, therefore, is not hugely
different.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000227">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
want to come back to what is, at least for me, the core point. The hon.
Member for Plymouth, Moor View challenged me on when I changed my
views. My views have not changed, but I believe that we cannot be blind
to the fact that there are thousands of families stuck in temporary
accommodation, because there is no prospect of them getting social
housing for a long time. Providing a gateway for those people to
re-establish their lives is the right way to
go.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000228">&#160;</a>

provision.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000229">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am afraid that the hon. Lady has not quite
understood the point that I was making. It is of course true that only
one family out of two can occupy a newly vacant social home. The
housing authority has to make a reasonable assessment of which of those
two families has the highest level of need. At the moment, that
decision is pre-empted by legislation that says, regardless of their
respective need, the family for whom a homeless duty has been accepted
has to take that accommodation. They may still take that accommodation
in future, but it will be on a level playing field between the two
situations. The two families will be judged on their respective levels
of need. Homelessness is not a trump card for a local authority that
chooses to exercise

			Column number: 805<a class="bkMark" name="Column805">&#160;</a>
                           </div>that particular flexibility. As I have said, it is not a flexibility
that must be universally applied by any local authority. An authority
that decides to exercise it does not have to exercise it in every case.
They can look at the circumstances that the families face, and their
housing allocation policy, which, as we have already dealt with, will
be published and transparent, will be the judge of
that.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000230">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
have dealt with the point about costs from the hon. Member for
Plymouth, Moor View, but, as I have said, I have undertaken to write to
the Committee, because that is clearly a matter of dispute. She also
asked me about capacity. We have mentioned the two families situation,
but where are they at the moment? One of them is in temporary
accommodation, and the other is probably in private rented
accommodation, on the housing waiting list and seeking priority access
to social housing. We do not actually require 20,000 new private rented
sector homes, because some of the homes will be vacated by people going
into social housing that homeless families did not take. There is,
therefore, an element of circulation that the hon. Lady needs to be
aware of, and our assessment is that the capacity exists.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000231">&#160;</a>

and well-being assessment, the Department’s research on people
in temporary accommodation found that waiting for settled accommodation
was what created uncertainty. In fact, people in temporary
accommodation are most prone to the kind of problems that the hon. Lady
illustrated, which will not surprise anybody if they think about it.
Being in a settled long-term tenancy is clearly a far better
option.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000232">&#160;</a>

the Member for Croydon Central made a number of statements that are
highly supportive of the point of view that I have been deploying, but
there were two issues that it would be sensible for me to respond to.
He asked whether two years was too short a time, in respect of which I
draw attention to the response made to the consultation paper by my
right hon. Friend the Minister for Housing and Local Government. He
said that in the vast majority of cases, we expect longer-term
tenancies than two years to be offered. In particular, that would be
the case with vulnerable households or those with children.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000233">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The underlying
point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon Central was that we
need more secure tenancies for families to move in to, which is
absolutely right. We shall come to this issue shortly, I hope, but the
affordable rent model provides a gateway for doing that. It reduces the
necessary public subsidy level for each affordable home from something
like £87,000 a home constructed under the existing
model to closer to £35,000 or £40,000 of public
subsidy for a home under the new model. That has allowed us to say that
we believe it is possible to construct up to 155,000 affordable homes
and homes for rent in the lifetime of this
Parliament.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000234">&#160;</a>

are other incentives, because the new homes bonus is not only a bonus
for homes in general; there is a specific premium for social
and affordable accommodation, for which an additional premium of
£350 will be paid. My back-room boys—and girls, of
course—tell me that Merton council is already using the private
rented sector as a central plank in its homelessness

is under a duty to provide applicants who are owed the duty in section
195(2) of the Housing Act 1996 with a copy of its policy on
offering choice in allocations. As there is no longer a presumption
that homeless acceptances will be allocated social housing, the local
authority no longer needs to provide that information. Clause 125(3)
removes that obligation by removing the

allows the re-application of the main homelessness duty if the private
rented accommodation offer ends within two years, and it makes sure
that the right recurs with each fresh application. The clause as
currently drafted means that the duty would be owed only once in the
lifetime of an applicant, which is clearly not right, rather than once
for each fresh or initial application. The policy intention is that the
duty is owed to those who apply within two years of accepting an offer
of private sector accommodation. Without the amendment we would not be
able to deliver what is clearly the right policy outcome.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000268">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I shall be brief. We have talked about the
discharge of the homelessness duty into the private rented sector, and
the implications of dependence on housing benefit have already been
highlighted. Amendments 252 and 253 are designed to put
safeguards in place to ensure that people housed in the private rented
sector who find that they cannot sustain their tenancy, not through any
fault of their own but because their benefit entitlement is cut, are
not penalised. The amendments have been worded fairly carefully; they
do not simply say, as some voluntary organisations pressed us to say,
that people should never be judged to have become homeless
intentionally through housing benefit changes, because housing benefit
could change as a result of a change in circumstances. They have been
worded fairly carefully to apply only where people are unable to
maintain their tenancy as a result of a change in housing benefit other
than one that results from an increase in their income. It is
absolutely common sense, and it is right to have such a
safeguard.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000272">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There are two
versions, but not because I am being over-diligent. Amendment 252 deals
with the specific circumstances of people placed in the private rented
sector under the discharge of the homelessness duty. That would apply
equally to people who are in private rented accommodation for reasons
other than the homelessness duty, and who are unable to sustain their
tenancy following the cuts in housing
benefit.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000273">&#160;</a>

impact. Hundreds of thousands of people will have their benefit

how the clause will impact on people’s lives. It might help the
Committee if I quickly give the example of Lewisham. Some 9,600 people
rent properties in the private rented sector. The changes, particularly
the calculation of LHA to the 30th percentile, will mean that on
average those residents will lose £17 a week, or £884 a
year, from next October. Those people do not have money left over at
the end of the week at the moment. That change will put them in an
incredibly difficult position in future
years.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000275">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I thank my hon. Friend for her telling
intervention, in which she highlighted the impact on her constituents.
Having researched the situation, I can assure her that the position in
the neighbouring borough of Greenwich is very similar. Several thousand
households will suffer a significant loss of more than £10 a
week as a result of a change to the 30th percentile. There is also the
cumulative benefit cap, which will restrict people to no more than
£25,000 overall. Families living in high-cost areas with a
number of children draw benefits not only from the housing element, but
from others. They could easily reach a position in which they are
affected by the cumulative cap.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000276">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Housing
benefit is being uprated and will change from the retail prices index
base, which is currently the norm, to the consumer prices index. That
will erode the benefit’s value. So there is a series of cuts in
housing benefit, which will have impacts that we do not yet fully
understand. Very much to its shame—I made this point to the
Committee that discussed the previous housing benefit
changes—the Department for Work and Pensions has not done a
cumulative impact assessment of how, one on top of another, those cuts
will affect individual households. Some households will experience a
devastating loss of income; some people will lose their home. It would
be absolutely disgraceful if people who lost their home in such
circumstances were judged to have made themselves homeless
intentionally.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000277">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
hope that the Government will recognise that the amendments would
introduce a common-sense safeguard that is absolutely essential if

increasingly have to find accommodation in the private rented
sector.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000278">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I appreciate the concerns expressed by the right
hon. Gentleman and the hon. Member for Lewisham East, but those
concerns are misplaced. It is already a perfectly clear matter of law
that a person cannot be found to have made themselves intentionally
homeless if the homelessness was caused only by a reduction in their
financial resources. That is not only about losing income, although
that is relevant, but about whether they have lost support such as
housing benefit. According to section 191 of the Housing Act
1996,<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000279">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“A

                        <p>Clearly that would not
include a person who ceased to occupy accommodation as a result of a

the Minister for Housing and Local Government is aware of concerns that
local authorities might choose to find homeless applicants
intentionally homeless as a result of the housing benefit changes. They
would certainly not be acting in accordance with the law if they did
so. The feedback from local authorities is that they are very clear
that the legislation around intentionality is as I have set out, and
they will not be seeking to use it where homelessness is due to a
reduction in the local housing allowance. The Government will carefully
monitor decisions from April onwards, and can issue further guidance to
local authorities on the use of intentionality should that be
necessary.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000281">&#160;</a>

Member for Greenwich and Woolwich. There is no evidence that such a
situation will arise; indeed, the evidence is to the contrary, because
local authorities say that they understand the law and have no
intention of flouting it, which is of course exactly what one would
expect to hear. I went on to say that we will keep an eye on the
matter, and if it turns out that the concerns expressed have any
substance, there is the capacity to change things, but it is certainly
not necessary to load up the Bill with the amendment that we are

that when somebody leaves accommodation there might always be grounds
for dispute about the circumstances, and the law clearly covers how
that should be judged. What I have said, and am happy to repeat, is
that we will monitor decisions, and if necessary we can issue further
guidance. I think I am giving the right hon. Gentleman the back-up that
he wanted: the Minister for Housing and Local Government and
I—and my other ministerial colleagues—will keep an eye on
the matter. We see no cause or reason to accept the amendment or make a

who feels that that is not a satisfactory answer. This is a genuine
concern and there is real worry. The Minister himself conceded that the
Minister for Housing and Local Government is worried about the matter
because he has heard the force of the argument that has been deployed.
As I have said, we know that the cumulative impact of the housing
benefit cuts cannot currently be modelled, even by the Department that
is imposing them. Very few local authorities, let alone the individuals
concerned, will be in a position to assess the impact of a series of
different housing benefit reductions on individual households. In that
very fluid situation, where households could end up having to leave
accommodation because they can no longer afford it, it seems to be only
basic human decency to say that we will try to put safeguards in place
to ensure that local authorities do not misinterpret the
law.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000286">&#160;</a>

am afraid that the Minister’s case is unpersuasive. Where he
feels that local authorities will not do what he wants, he puts highly
prescriptive legislation in front of us and asks us to vote for it.
When we come to safeguards for vulnerable people who might be
prejudiced by a misinterpretation of the law by a local authority, he
is not prepared to do anything. That is wholly unacceptable, and I hope

amendment seeks to address better the needs of people who do not
qualify as unintentionally homeless but who are homeless nevertheless;
it might, sadly, apply to some of the people described by my right hon.
Friend the Member for Greenwich and Woolwich as a result of changes to
housing benefit. At present, only households that are unintentionally
homeless and in priority need are entitled to accommodation. Households
classified automatically as being in priority need are those that
include pregnant women, dependent children, people under 18, care
leavers under 21. Those with other special needs, such as disabilities
or mental health issues, and victims of violence may be entitled to
housing if they can prove that they are more vulnerable and at greater
risk than other homeless
people.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000316">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Most
single homeless people do not meet those tests. However, under the law,
they should still receive advice and support to prevent homelessness,
address the reasons why they have become homeless or find
accommodation. The amendment is supported by Crisis, which helped me to
bring it forward. There is evidence that in practice—this is
where Crisis’s huge experience in the field comes into
play—too often the process does not happen as it ought, and
sadly that inevitably leads to rough sleeping.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000317">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment 234
would create a new duty on local authorities to prevent the
homelessness of all unintentionally homeless people who approach them.
Crucially, it would be applied far more flexibly than the main
homelessness duty. We have discussed the long-term effectiveness, in
terms of outcomes and cash savings, of offering good early advice and
support; the hon. Member for St Austell and Newquay made a
strong case for
it.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000318">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Under
the new duty, local authorities would be required to offer emergency
accommodation to those who need it, and to work with applicants until
their homelessness was resolved. Although social housing might be
appropriate for some, local authorities might discharge that duty by
assisting applicants in accessing supported or other accommodation, or
through mediation, relationship support or other advice and assistance
that leads to accommodation or prevents homelessness. Introducing a new
statutory duty will set a standard minimum of help and assistance to
which people would know they were entitled. The duty would seek to
prevent homelessness before it becomes entrenched in an
individual’s life by creating a more secure framework and a
stronger safety net for people who find themselves homeless but not
entitled to direct support as part of a priority group. The Minister
has so far turned down all pleas for better advice and support for
people in need, and I fear he will do the same now. Nevertheless, we
will listen with interest to his
comments.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000319">&#160;</a>

the problems presented

			Column number: 812<a class="bkMark" name="Column812">&#160;</a>
                           </div>by single homeless people. Indeed, we have established a ministerial
working group on homelessness that brings together Ministers from eight
Government Departments to look beyond housing, because the hon. Lady is
right: the focus is by no means on housing. The problem of homelessness
in those circumstances is quite often much more to do with employment,
training, health, rehabilitation and other issues that generated the
homelessness. The ministerial working group will follow that
through.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000322">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
have also taken the practical measure of overhauling the rough sleeper
count to make sure that we get a more accurate assessment of the number
of people sleeping rough, so that we get a clearer picture of the scale
of the problem in each area of the country. We have provided £10
million of funding to Crisis so that there can be voluntary-sector-led
support for schemes on access to private rented sector accommodation
for single homeless people. I visited a project in west London that
provided effective support for precisely that
group.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000323">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Statutory
help for households not in priority need has been debated ever since
the establishment of the current main homelessness duty in the Housing
Act 1996. Back then, the House accepted that it was
reasonable for priority accommodation to be given to certain homeless
households such as families with children and people who are vulnerable
for some reason. The current duty to secure advice and assistance for
households not in priority need stems from the 2002 amendments to the
1996 Act, brought in by the previous
Government.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000324">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
proposed amendment would put in place a duty to resolve an
applicant’s homelessness by one of several means. The concern is
that an amendment of this nature could create perverse incentives for
applicants to ensure that mediation did not work and not to engage in
robust efforts to find their own accommodation or make use of the
advice, as they would know that the local authority would have to
secure accommodation for them. In other words, there would be a reward
for failing in that process, and the amendment would therefore amount
to a duty on local authorities to secure accommodation for all homeless
households, not just those in priority
need.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000325">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Lady will know that to place a duty on local authorities to
provide accommodation for all homeless households would be costly and
impractical. Local authorities already have a discretionary power to
provide emergency accommodation. That strikes a reasonable balance
between the need to provide particularly vulnerable homeless households
with emergency accommodation, and the costs that that creates. The
Government will continue to work with local authorities to improve the
assistance available to single homeless people and to encourage access
to prevention schemes for all homeless households. I have already
commented on the fact that every local authority in the country has a
housing options service, which is available to single homeless people
who are not accepted as being in priority need, just as it is to other
households. For those reasons, I hope that the hon. Lady will withdraw
the amendment. If she presses it to a Division, I recommend that my
colleagues oppose
it.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000326">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I welcome the fact that there is a cross-cutting

			Column number: 813<a class="bkMark" name="Column813">&#160;</a>
                           </div>from it. I am slightly surprised, however, given the evidence that is
already out there on homelessness prevention outside statutory
provision. In their very good “UK Housing Review
2010/2011”, Steve Wilcox and Hal Pawson clearly set out the
potential benefits of the type of measure that we are discussing; more
than 5% of households that presented were supported through mediation.
The figures are impressive, and the drop in the number of people being
accepted as homeless up to mid-2010 was dramatic. There was not much
change in the number of people under a main duty, but something else
was going on, and that was deemed, by and large, to be good preventive
measures, some of which were entirely
voluntary.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000327">&#160;</a>

to gainsay that after looking at the bare facts and figures. I shall
withdraw the amendment, but I would like the Minister to mull over the
issue a little more, perhaps with the Minister for Housing and Local
Government, because there does not seem to be a huge gulf between us on
the issue. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

                           </strong> This chapter of the Bill is in many ways
extremely contentious, given that it relates to the reform of social
housing, on which there are fundamental differences between the
Conservative and Liberal parties in government, and the Labour party.
However, before we come to the meat of the chapter, which is on
security of tenure, we will consider the tenancy strategy clauses. They
make up a relatively small set of provisions—they take up fewer
than two pages in the Bill—but they have the potential to make a
significant impact to the way in which registered providers of social
housing interact with authorities, tenants and the wider public. They
also include the additional powers that Ministers seeks to award the
Secretary of State, who is accruing such powers at quite a pace as we
move through the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000339">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Although
we disagree with the Government on much of what we have already debated
on housing, and we will disagree on areas that we are yet to cover, we
have no objections in principle to tenancy strategies. I hope that
that, at least, will bring a smile to the Minister’s face.
However—there is always a however—although we do not have
an issue with the concept of the strategies and feel that they have the
potential to be a positive addition to the local housing frameworks, we
have concerns about the Bill’s drafting and the implications of
some of the measures. Our amendments would strengthen as well as
clarify aspects of how strategies will work and interact with the
public, registered providers of social housing and the private rented
sector, and how they fit together with other strategies relating to
homelessness or housing.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000340">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It might seem
at first that amendment 255 proposes a minor change to subsection (2),
but I believe that that change is absolutely necessary for the smooth
running of the tenancy strategy regime. Subsection (2)
states:<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000341">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“The
tenancy strategy must summarise…policies or explain where they
may be
found.”<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000385">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>The
wording does not appear to be too controversial, but we have received
representations from the housing sector and particularly the National
Housing Federation—I am sure that the matter has also been
raised with Ministers. The Bill appears to require the local housing
authority to summarise the policies of registered providers within the
local housing authority area, but the problem that arises is one of
interpretation. In summarising the policies of another provider, the
local housing authority might miss out on nuance or detail, so perhaps
quite complex legal issues could be skirted over or omitted as part of
the summarising process.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000342">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">While it would
be useful to have all policies available in one place, we are worried
that the Bill grants local housing authorities the power to interpret
the policies of registered providers in a way that might misrepresent
those policies.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000343">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">In an urban
area covered by a number of local authorities, such as London or
Manchester, local authority borders can cut through communities and
housing developments owned and run by registered landlords. However, we
could find that Wandsworth, Merton, Lambeth and Southwark—all
boroughs in a small geographical area—interpret one
provider’s policies entirely differently. What potential would
there then be for legal action against any of those authorities for
misrepresenting those policies, or against the registered provider for
failing to meet the policies that people seeking housing had been led
to believe were demanded in a statutorily commanded document—the
tenancy strategy? We could face the prospect of a seemingly positive
and innocuous provision putting the entire policy under threat and
changing it from a positive development to something burdensome and
legally difficult. I will be interested to hear what legal advice the
Minister was given on this point, what representations he received, and
why his colleagues decided to press ahead with the
wording.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000344">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
255 would resolve the problem. It would still require policies to be
signposted to individuals seeking housing, or indeed anyone simply
wishing to know the different policies adhered to by the various
providers, but would remove the ability of local authorities to present
those policies in their own words and thus the possibility of
misleading information or misrepresentation. Subsection (2), as
amended, would
state:<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000345">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“The
tenancy strategy must refer to the policies of registered providers and
explain where details of those policies can be
found.”<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000386">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>That
would preserve the intention of the subsection, which we welcome, but
remove, we hope—the Minister’s parliamentary draftsmen
may well disagree—the point of real concern.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000346">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment 256
deals with another concern about the impact of the clause’s
wording. It would remove subsection (5), which allows for review,
replacement or amendment of a tenancy review as and when the local
authority believes that to be worth while. I appreciate that it might
seem perverse that we would wish to restrict that ability, but I assure
the Committee that we have no desire to tie the hands of local
government. The amendment was tabled as an attempt to ensure stability
and to make sure that tenancy strategies could not be completely
rewritten by a local authority at a frequency that could cause real
issues.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000347">&#160;</a>

                           </div>we could see a different tenancy strategy every year.
From a lender’s perspective, that would be destabilising and a
cause for concern. Any of those factors might affect the revenue stream
or the way in which provision is offered in a particular area. Whether
the change came in four years or one year later, I would not want a
Labour council to be restricted from reversing a tenancy strategy that
it did not like, but continuity and stability in the system are
necessary, because certainty is important for lenders. We must put our
political concerns aside, because developers and social housing
providers will not want to build their homes on shifting
sands.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000350">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
want tenancy strategies to reflect the will of the local population, as
expressed through the ballot box. While we do not wish to remove the
ability to review, amend or replace the strategy regularly, we want to
put in place some form of calm. We felt that a period of four years was
sensible. That would not deter changes from being made in the interim,
but such changes should be to correct errors in strategies, which is
familiar under other aspects of legislation. Our proposal reflects the
normal electoral timetable of four years. We accept that some
authorities are elected by thirds, but we do not want strategies to be
amended year after year in such places, thus creating flux in the
system.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000351">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
257 is similar to an amendment to an earlier clause tabled by my hon.
Friend the Member for Worsley and Eccles South. Subsection (7) requires
that the strategy should be available for purchase and for review in
the authority’s office. The amendment would introduce the
additional requirement that it should be published online for ease of
access and better transparency. I do not think that such a proposal is
especially contentious, but the Minister might feel
otherwise.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000352">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendments
258 and 259 have been tabled to clause 127. Amendment 258
returns, I am afraid, to the point that we have made already—and
that we will undoubtedly continue to make—about the need to
consult in advance of bringing forward new rules, regulations and
legislation. The clause calls for local housing authorities to draft a
strategy and then send a copy to the registered provider of social
housing, allowing them a reasonable period of time for comment. That is
the wrong way round. We would like not only the providers of social
housing but the people who will live in that housing and the wider
community to be involved in preparing the draft strategy. It is better
to be as inclusive and as consultative as possible as early as possible
when drafting tenancy strategies. Amendment 258 would therefore require
local housing authorities, in advance of producing a draft strategy,
to<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000353">&#160;</a>

list is purposefully broad. With the exception of providers of social
housing within the district, those on the list are not otherwise
mentioned in clause 127. I am not sure why Ministers felt that it would
be appropriate to draw up such strategies without involving the public,

<div class="columnNumber">

                           </div>tenants or others in the sector, so I would be interested to hear their
reasons. Their logic might be perfectly plausible, but we would welcome
knowing what it

am also not sure why Ministers do not want local authorities to consult
one another on the policies that they expect to promote as part of
their tenancy strategy. Given the duty to co-operate and everything
else, it would make sense for each local authority to have a view on
neighbouring tenancy strategies. To return to my earlier point about
areas where local authorities are tightly packed together—mostly
in cities— if there is no proper consultation among local
authorities, there is a risk that people will simply abandon one local
authority for another whose policies they believe suit their needs
better. Requiring local authorities to consult each other is imperative
to ensure that the strategies are sympathetic and do not cut across
each
other.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000356">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Clause
126 places a new duty on local housing authorities to publish a tenancy
strategy, which is designed to set out in high-level terms the matters
to which all the different registered providers of social housing in an
area should have regard when framing their tenancy policies. We want
social landlords to have substantial freedom to decide what types of
tenancy to provide to avoid creating unnecessary bureaucratic
structures. On the other hand, we think it is important that local
policies on tenure should be developed collaboratively and
transparently. The tenancy strategy provides the framework and starting
point for that
process.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000358">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
do not think that the strategy needs to be a long or detailed document.
It should set out broad objectives to which the policies of individual
providers of social housing should have regard. For instance, it might
establish objectives involving promoting work incentives, reducing
overcrowding or preventing homelessness. Tenancy strategies will not
contain detailed information about what sorts of tenancy landlords
might choose to grant, or the basis on which tenancies may or may not
be reissued. That will be found in tenancy policies, which the new
tenancy standard will require every registered provider to prepare and
publish.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000359">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In other
words, the strategy will be a high-level, borough-wide document, but
the tenancy policy will be in the ownership of each registered
provider. Social landlords in a single local authority area might have
a range of different tenancy policies. The requirement to have regard
to the tenancy strategy means that those tenancy policies will be
developed within an overarching framework that takes account of local
housing needs and circumstances.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000360">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I hope that my
brief introduction has helped to dissipate the assumptions of Labour
Members about the nature of the strategy that some of the amendments
imply. It is not tenancy policies that will be drawn into a big,
comprehensive document, but the tenancy strategy covering the local
authority area. We want that to happen freely. We are aware that some
registered providers think that the measures might result in a top-down
process at borough level, but that is certainly not how we have framed
the provisions.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000361">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment 255
is not necessary because clause 126 strikes the right balance between
encouraging local authorities and private registered providers to work
together, and recognising that individual landlords are best placed to
make decisions about the use of their own stock. I note that a number
of registered landlords provide specialist accommodation of one sort or
another, and that is often the unique selling point of their business.
By requiring a tenancy strategy to refer to the policies of registered
providers, the amendment appears to be an attempt to achieve a much
closer relationship between the local authority and the private
registered providers than we intend. It is difficult to see what the
amendment would add to subsection (2) in
practice.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000362">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I will certainly reflect on that point, which
might be something for us to examine at a later stage. Our intention is
to draw together the threads of different providers that serve a
population to ensure that we get the best fit possible between the
provision and needs of that locality. At the moment, that process is
left perhaps not to chance, but to individual assessments by different
providers that do not necessarily work to a common framework,
and we aim to provide that overarching framework through the tenancy
strategies. I think that the hon. Lady is suggesting that the council
should, in effect, hold a library of different policies rather than
exercising any kind of editorial role, but we are clear that some
editorial action may be needed. However, we will give further
consideration to the interesting point that she

authorities have a mature view about how their housing should be
provided in their areas. Of course, there can be sharp political or
policy differences, and dramatic changes in a community’s
circumstances might mean that new strategies need to evolve. However,
housing is not like a bus route that can be changed one week and
changed back the next—<em>[</em>

Perhaps I was a bit optimistic by talking about changing a bus route,
as hon. Members are quite rightly suggesting. My analogy may not have
been right, but the principle is.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000365">&#160;</a>

Most local authorities—and certainly housing
authorities—would be responsible and therefore would not want to
chop and change things, or tear them up, every five minutes. However,
some authorities throughout the country involve incredibly acrimonious
relationships, with a huge ideological divide, so views on the
management and delivery of housing can be quite significant, for good
or ill. A British National party-led council might have very strong
views about how and to whom provision should be made. There

Lady raises, but practical problems would arise if we entrenched her
suggestion in primary legislation because it would not provide the
required flexibility. Let me cite one situation that might arise: there
could be a court judgment suggesting that a particular aspect of the
strategy was unlawful or needing amending—perhaps the hon.
Lady’s example of the BNP would apply in such a case. Under the
four-year rule proposed in the amendment, the council would be bound by
primary legislation and therefore unable to comply with the judgment,
so there would be problems on the grounds of practicality. We will need
to reflect on several of the hon. Lady’s points to determine
whether we have the optimum process, but the amendment is not an
attractive proposition.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000367">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> May I reinforce the point about the possible
difficulty for lenders if chopping and changing housing association
tenancy arrangements for a particular area was on the cards? We have
heard that the hon. Member for Croydon Central spent some time as an
adviser to David Curry, so he will recall an embarrassing moment during
the passage of the Bill that became the Housing Act 1996. Mr Curry, the
then Minister, had to withdraw a series of clauses because the lenders
had essentially said that they would take their money away and would
not lend to housing associations if those provisions remained in the
Bill. The position under this Bill is nowhere near as extreme, but the
lesson is important. I hope that the Minister will talk to the hon.
Member for Croydon Central about the risk of the Bill damaging
investment in social housing.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000368">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I certainly accept the underlying point that
there must be a strategy that enables growth in the social and
affordable housing sector, and every local authority will surely have
that at the top of its working agenda for future action. When I talk to
local authorities throughout the country, I find that they are
constantly concerned that they have not been able to invest in social
housing as they would have wished. Obviously, there can sometimes be a
political edge in respect of the way in which authorities feel that
hindered by central Government, but I do not think that local
authorities lack any willingness to have tenancy strategies that
encourage providers in their areas to do exactly that—to
provide.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000369">&#160;</a>

Gentleman makes an interesting point about how we might ensure that
there are safeguards. That goes beyond what is in the Bill, but I will

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment 258
would ensure that local authorities consult, but such a provision is
already in the Bill. The amendment has been tabled to clause 127, which
details a procedure for preparing a strategy. In particular, the clause
sets out an obligation to consult housing associations that have stock
in the area, and it states that there must be “a reasonable
opportunity” to comment before the draft is adopted. One problem
with providing a specific list of people to be consulted is that if
somebody has been left out, it becomes more difficult to include them.
The current wording means that local authorities will consult others
who have an interest—notably, that includes tenants—and
given that there is already a statutory duty requiring tenants to be
consulted on housing management matters, it is clear that they will be
included. There is the option of including a list of persons to
consult, but building that in at this stage seems unnecessarily
complex.<a class="bkMark" name="1103045000371">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment 259
would require local authorities to conduct an assessment of the needs
of those in residential accommodation and to consider that when
preparing their tenancy strategy. That, however, is only one of a
number of important considerations that authorities should have, and we
do not see the need to place the requirement in primary legislation. We
will consider the tenancy standard, which the regulator will be
preparing, when we get to clause 128. However, for the purposes of this
amendment, I should say that we will require landlords’ tenancy
policies to take account of the needs of the most vulnerable, who will
clearly include those in residential accommodation. With those words of
explanation, and perhaps of some comfort, I hope that the hon. Member
for Plymouth, Moor View will not press her amendments to a
