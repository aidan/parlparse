                           </span> On a point of order, Mr
Caton—I apologise to the witnesses, but I will only delay
everyone for one minute. This morning, in our deliberations on the
provisions of the Bill vis-à-vis the Regulation of Investigatory
Powers Act 2000, the interception of communications commissioner came
and told us his views about how the provisions of the Bill will operate
with respect to RIPA and his responsibilities. His responsibilities
deal with
communications.<a class="bkMark" name="11032323000009">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">From
the questions and comments that arose this morning, I think that the
Committee would have liked to ask the relevant surveillance
commissioner about the operation of RIPA. Clearly, we were not able to
do that. Through the usual channels—the Government Whip and the
Opposition Whip—we sought the attendance of the surveillance
commissioners at our deliberations, but it was felt to be
inappropriate. That is their decision, which I can understand up to a
point, but it would be helpful to the Committee if we could ascertain
the views of the chief surveillance commissioner on the
provisions in the Bill—whether they see a problem, whether they
think the provisions are good or whether they would like to see the
Bill amended in any
way.<a class="bkMark" name="11032323000010">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
suggest to the Committee—hopefully the Minister will be able to
say something positive—that we should contact the chief
surveillance commissioner and ask whether he can provide the Committee
with answers to certain questions that would aid our deliberations and
our consideration of the Bill. If the Minister could agree to that, it
would be extremely
helpful.<a class="bkMark" name="11032323000011">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I hear what the hon. Member for Gedling has
just said about information for the Committee. The commissioner was
asked if he could attend and give evidence, but unfortunately
he was not available. I am certainly happy to refer the
commissioner to what was asked in Committee about his views in respect
of the RIPA provisions, and to ask what he might be able to provide to
the Committee in terms of setting out his thoughts and his response. If
that would help the hon. Gentleman, I am happy to take that away and to
update the Committee once we have done that, letting the Committee know
what information we have been able to
secure.<a class="bkMark" name="11032323000012">&#160;</a>

Sankey:</strong>
                           </em> Thanks to the Committee for inviting Liberty
to give evidence today. On the CCTV provisions in the Bill, we have
long been calling for better regulation. As the Committee will be well
aware, we have seen a sharp increase in the number of CCTV cameras that
are up around this country, over the past 10 years in particular. At
the same time, we have not seen an increase in regulation. We are
concerned about not only the number of cameras, but the innovations,
such as facial recognition technology, microphones and loudhailers
being attached to cameras, automatic number plate recognition cameras,
and so on. Regulation has not kept pace. The Data Protection Act 1998
and the Human Rights Act 1998 apply to most CCTV cameras in terms of
the use and processing of images, but the principles in those Acts were
not designed to deal with the sophisticated types of CCTV that we now
see on the streets.<a class="bkMark" name="11032323000021">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
particular, you have mentioned crime and fear of crime, which Liberty
is very alive to. We are concerned that public expectations about the
role that CCTV can play in keeping them safe are somewhat out of step
with the reality. That is not to say that it cannot be extremely useful
in detecting crime and leading to convictions. Of course, there have
been several high-profile cases in which CCTV has been used, so we are
not against it, and I do not think any sensible person would
be.<a class="bkMark" name="11032323000022">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The idea,
however, that CCTV is a silver bullet that prevents crime is frankly
not borne out by the evidence, which was commissioned by the Home
Office under the previous Government to investigate its effectiveness
in deterring crime. At best, it might displace it. The images that are
collected—certainly in the past—are often not of
sufficient quality to lead to successful detections and convictions. We
are concerned that the public have a general idea that CCTV is a silver
bullet, and that it will keep them safe. Everyone should be seriously
concerned if that means that people are walking down deserted alleyways
at night because they see a camera. Making people feel safer when in
fact they are not is surely no public policy goal. We welcome the
Bill’s provisions on additional regulation. It could certainly
go further on enforcement, but I wanted to make that point about fear
of crime, as well.<a class="bkMark" name="11032323000023">&#160;</a>

Metcalfe:</strong>
                           </em> I agree with everything that Isabella has
said. Our organisation has a significant concern about the growth in
private surveillance. It is understood that public bodies are bound by
their obligations under the Human Rights Act, which, as Liberty has
pointed out, is a rather blunt instrument when it comes to specific
questions on the placement of a camera, where it can look, times, and
so on.<a class="bkMark" name="11032323000024">&#160;</a>

                           </em> Police and local authorities. Private
companies are bound to the extent that the Data Protection Act imposes
certain obligations in relation to data processing. But there is
nothing in the data protection framework, for example, that can tell
you whether the Tesco that you might happen to live next door to has
five or 50 cameras on its car park. Surely such matters require better
regulations than the current ones. A very poor patchwork of laws
governs this area.<a class="bkMark" name="11032323000026">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">When we
prepared our written evidence, we could not comment in detail on the
regulation under the clauses because the code had not been published. I
am pleased to see that that has now been done and a very good
consultation paper sets out how the code was drafted and why it was put
in those terms. It seems to hint that regulation of private CCTV will
be something to be done gradually in future. We certainly hope that
that will be taken on. The point is that any private individual may put
a camera, or 60 cameras, on their land, and in principle there is no
legal barrier to doing so. If we are serious about protecting privacy
in this country, we must be more keen to have much better regulation of
how CCTV can be established and used.<a class="bkMark" name="11032323000027">&#160;</a>

those points. Our understanding is that 90% of CCTV cameras are outside
the public sector, and a number of those are in premises where members
of the public go frequently, such as stores and sports grounds. It
seems to us that an opportunity has been missed to apply these to the
private sector, at least in those areas where substantial numbers of

Committee for inviting us to give evidence today. We recognise that it
is very difficult to quantify the effects that CCTV and ANPR might have
on the prevention, detection and investigation of crime. Nevertheless,
we are also conscious that there have been a number of high-profile
cases where it has been of use in such prevention, detection and
investigation of crime. We feel that the current proposals, with the
code of practice, represent a positive start in maintaining some sort
of regulation of the use of those cameras, and we endorse what others
have said in that regard.<a class="bkMark" name="11032323000030">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The debate about CCTV is interesting. I can
understand about the code of practice and so on, but as a constituency
MP nobody has ever complained to me about CCTV, apart from complaining
that there is none. That is just a comment, really. Although people
have complained to me about other areas of the Bill, it is interesting
that the public perception of CCTV and ANPR is that they are not a real
problem, and yet they generate a huge amount of
debate.<a class="bkMark" name="11032323000031">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">For
your information, because I think we were surprised, according to the
evidence we had this morning the Bill covers 29,000 cameras, and the
Association of Chief Police Officers’ latest estimate is that
there are 1.8 million cameras, not 4.2 million. Clearly, for
us as a Committee there will be a large debate about what all of you
have just said about the impact of CCTV and whether the code of
practice should apply outside of just the police and local authorities.
In that regard, the Bill also proposes to have a surveillance camera
commissioner. Why would we not just extend the remit of the Information
Commissioner? The Information Commissioner already has a code of
practice. Why not amend that and put that together rather than create
another bureaucratic body—another quango? Do you not think that
would be a better way of doing it, if we are going to have this code of
practice?<a class="bkMark" name="11032323000032">&#160;</a>

responsibility to the Information Commissioner. One thing that I would
say to the Committee is that currently we believe that the Information
Commissioner is under-resourced and has overly restricted
powers  of enforcement in discharging many of the functions of
that office, so if he is going to be given additional responsibilities,
he would certainly need to have the resources and capabilities to match
it. We would not want to remove from the Bill another commissioner who
would get resources without having those passed on to the Information
Commissioner.<a class="bkMark" name="11032323000034">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
want briefly to address the point that you made earlier, Mr Coaker,
about constituents not being concerned about CCTV. At Liberty we have a
pretty different experience, and it might just be that people are more
likely to contact us about this. Quite recently we had a case, which
was widely reported, of Muslim residents in Birmingham who discovered
that their local authority 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 51<a class="bkMark" name="Column51">&#160;</a>
                           </div>had been responsible for putting up a ring of steel—CCTV
cameras—around their community so that nobody could enter or
leave without being monitored. I think that very clearly makes the
point that without sufficient regulation these cameras can be used
inappropriately, and particularly in a discriminatory way.<a class="bkMark" name="11032323000035">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">That is
something that you often see with incursions into the privacy sphere.
There is this well-worn phrase that we have had a lot over the past few
years at Liberty: “Nothing to hide, nothing to fear.” Our
experience is quite different; it is those minority groups—those
groups that might at any one time be unpopular—that are often on
the sharp end of these privacy intrusions. We saw that community become
very much alienated and disillusioned, with all the consequences that
flow from that. I think that there is concern, but it is not
necessarily as widespread as concerns about other things.<a class="bkMark" name="11032323000036">&#160;</a>

not appreciate the importance of privacy protection until it is not
there, just as most people in this country probably did not worry a
great deal about the security of data transfer between different
Government Departments until 11 million families got a letter from the
Treasury explaining that their personal data had been lost in the mail.
It is about those kinds of concerns. You or a constituent may not care
a great deal or worry about CCTV until a neighbour’s CCTV camera
captures footage that is put on YouTube. Then, they may be very
concerned about what can be done by way of CCTV. It is at that point
that they will look to their MP and say, “What were you doing
about the ability of my neighbour, or a private company, to put up CCTV
cameras in the first place?”<a class="bkMark" name="11032323000037">&#160;</a>

perhaps being married to this rather than creating a new body. Given
what you have just said about CCTV and the fact that the code of
practice is just a code of practice and has no teeth, would you like
real power to be given to whomever is responsible for regulating CCTV,
so that it does not become, “This is good practice,” but
becomes an offence for people to do certain things? What would the
offence be? I always find this really interesting, because everyone
says that we should criminalise it, but you are the lawyers, so what

was a growing problem with data gathering powers. Our legislative codes
have been outstripped by the growth of technology in this

                           </div>1,000 cameras in Britain in 1970. Now, per capita and in
absolute terms, we have the most CCTV cameras on earth. The BBC
recently did a study, which found  that there were more CCTV
cameras in the Shetland islands than there were in the city of San
Francisco. The Shetland islands have 22,000 people and San Francisco
has 3 million people. That says something about the lack of regulation
in this
country.<a class="bkMark" name="11032323000042">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">You
do not necessarily need a criminal offence specifically for invading
privacy—that would probably be too broadly drawn to be
satisfactory—but you could have a code of practice backed by a
series of regulatory offences. For example, a person responsible for a
CCTV camera could be obliged to notify the Information
Commissioner’s Office if they had one on their property. Failure
to do so could be a regulatory offence and could be backed by criminal
sanctions, depending on the seriousness. There are criminal offences
under the Data Protection Act, but they are rather difficult to apply
to a lot of
CCTV.<a class="bkMark" name="11032323000043">&#160;</a>

can go down a variety of routes with a code of practice. It could be a
soft code or we increasingly find a lot of areas of law in which a code
has almost the force of law. You could come up with a lot of different
alternatives. We will respond to the CCTV code of practice in due
course, but we certainly think that there is a very good case for
having some force of law behind it beyond a voluntary sign-up, and
certainly for extending it beyond the public sector.<a class="bkMark" name="11032323000044">&#160;</a>

that can apply. Ultimately, there may be particular invasions of

can be ignored. If there is not some sort of sanction somewhere, you

to be, first, to look at the number of cameras. There is an argument to
be made that the Bill could go further in ensuring that, certainly in
the regulation of public authorities’ use, there is a set limit
to the number of cameras that a public authority can use. If it wants
to go over that limit, it should have to make an argument about why it
is necessary and proportionate to have additional cameras. Of course,
that would be quite difficult in the private sphere, but it could
certainly apply to public cameras.<a class="bkMark" name="11032323000048">&#160;</a>

of regulation, what is currently envisaged in the code is certainly a
movement in the right direction about how images are used, and the
standards that need to be enforced as regards who is looking at and
processing the images. Those are all areas that need proper
regulation—in fact, quite similar to what the Information
Commissioner currently has in his voluntary codes. The key point has
already been made that, if this going to be a positive step forward,
there needs to be a better enforcement mechanism than is currently in
the Bill. As others have said, the code could quite easily be ignored
without any substantial
repercussions.<a class="bkMark" name="11032323000049">&#160;</a>

                           </em> The starting point is that CCTV is a form
of public surveillance. It should be discouraged, because surveillance
is an interference with privacy. There are certain situations when it
is absolutely justified to interfere with privacy—for example,
CCTV in an airport. That is a security zone and it is reasonable to
have security in that situation. But, as a general rule, you have to
show that it is necessary and proportionate. I agree with Isabella that
you need to have a framework constructed around the idea that CCTV
should be scaled back, because it is not possible to do an assessment
of each individual CCTV camera in the United Kingdom, but I am willing
to bet that the reason why the United Kingdom has the most in the world
is not because we made such a judgment in each and every single case. I
think we have that situation because there has been a general idea in
the public mind that CCTV helps fight crime, and it has been exploited
by private security companies that are very keen to sell on new
technologies.<a class="bkMark" name="11032323000050">&#160;</a>

the question is not so much about the number, but about why people feel
that they have to have as many CCTV cameras as they do? I was on a
radio programme once with a professor who basically took the same line
as you. It was a number of years ago, so there were far fewer cameras
then, but the fact of the matter was, and he agreed, that a CCTV camera
was perceived to give security. I know that, as does my colleague. I
have never had anybody complaining to me about the number of cameras,
but I have had plenty of constituents saying, “We want
them.” In relation to what you are saying, why would that be? At
the end of the day, the Bulger

has been compared with other crime detection and prevention measures
has not been properly explored and explained to members of the public.

                        <p class="tabbed">I
agree with some of the points made earlier about the public not fearing
the proliferation of CCTV. It is the unregulated nature of CCTV that
the public seem to be concerned about. Can I ask you to concentrate on
one area you brought up, Dr Metcalfe? You mentioned the issue of Tesco
having cameras around its car park. Do you not agree that, if we start
getting into the area of regulating private cameras in private areas,
we are going into an area where we will inevitably find difficulties,
from the man in the street who wants to point a camera at his car to
ensure that he can identify anyone who has been targeting it to people
holding camcorders and so on? There will be all sorts of difficulties
if we start regulating private individuals using private cameras on
private land. Although I understand why you use Tesco as an
example—I think that we can all get that example—it will
also include a lot of people who are purely going about their innocent
business and want to do the right thing, but they will get ensnared in
that trap that I think you may well set for them.<a class="bkMark" name="11032323000065">&#160;</a>

                           </em> Straight off the bat, fortunately at the
moment you can distinguish between camcorders and a CCTV system, for
the reason that one is self-contained and one is networked. We use CCTV
closed camera circuits, but in this day and age most of what we think
of as surveillance cameras are not closed circuit. They are networked,
linked and they are accessible to a much larger category of people than
we are normally aware of.<a class="bkMark" name="11032323000066">&#160;</a>

if you were going to regulate the private use of all photography it
would be a nightmare, but we are not talking about that. We are talking
about the regulation of the private use of surveillance powers and I
think that, as the current <em>News of the World</em> investigation
shows, there is very good reason to be concerned about private
individuals and private companies using surveillance
technology.<a class="bkMark" name="11032323000067">&#160;</a>

Parliament has already made it a criminal offence for a private
individual to intercept a communication without a warrant. That is an
example of how Parliament has already got into the business of
regulating private communications and private surveillance. What we are
saying is that it makes no sense for Parliament to regulate phone
hacking by private individuals but not to regulate the <em>News of the
World</em> if it wanted to put up a CCTV camera in your backyard to film
footage there. That seems to me a strange set of
affairs.<a class="bkMark" name="11032323000068">&#160;</a>

characterising the argument here, from the perspective of all four of
you, as being one of proportionality? I see all four of you nodding. I
noticed that you focused on the codes of practice and there was a
general desire to see them being enforceable. Is that also right? Is it
not the case that there are many other areas in life where there are
codes of practice and that they work perfectly well without the
possibility of criminal sanction. I should declare an interest myself,
as a member of the Criminal Bar Association. For example, I am thinking
of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. That is a bulwark of
criminal legislation even now, and it has very important codes of
practice—does it not?—that are not enforceable in terms
of criminal sanction. A breach of that Act’s very important
codes of practice might damage a prosecution, but it cannot be
punishable by criminal sanction. So there are examples of codes of
practice that work pretty well without yet another law, are there
not?<a class="bkMark" name="11032323000075">&#160;</a>

are very few enforcement possibilities. Re-enacting that with no

would respectfully take the same view that perhaps we should look and
see how the code works to begin with. If there were then a perceived
need for criminalisation of breaches of the code, that could be
revisited in the future. I would not, however, be suggesting any
particular criminalisation at this stage, or any particular penalty for

Metcalfe:</strong>
                           </em> We very much welcome that. It is something
that we have long expressed concern about. Our concern is shared by
members of the public as well, particularly given the recent example
from Poole borough council, which was found to be surveilling a couple
who may have been sending their child to a school out of zone. That is
an example of the ludicrousness of surveillance powers being used by
public bodies for purely regulatory matters.<a class="bkMark" name="11032323000091">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We think that
judicial authorisation is an extremely important mechanism. Where we
would invite Parliament to go further is to extend it to other areas of
surveillance. We have a patchwork of surveillance authorisation under
the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act. Sometimes you speak to
people about RIPA, and they say that RIPA was a very human
rights-friendly piece of legislation, which was enacted shortly after
the Human Rights Act 1998 and was developed in a very considered way.
We would say that RIPA is a crude patchwork of different forms of
regulation knitted together in one very ugly statute. You end up with a
number of absurdities, whereby, for example, if a policeman wants to
put a bug in your house because he is investigating serious organised
crime, he needs to get the authorisation of a surveillance
commissioner, who is usually a judge. If MI5 wants to put a bug in your
house, because it is considering a threat to national security, it gets
authorisation from the Home Secretary. What is being proposed here is
that if a local authority wants to use surveillance powers—it
cannot do bugging, of course—it would have to go to a
magistrate.<a class="bkMark" name="11032323000092">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We
think that judicial authorisation should apply across the board. It is
no different in principle from a search warrant. If the police want to
search your house, they need a warrant from a judge. If the police, or
any other public body, want to put a surveillance device in your house,
they should also get a warrant from a judge. The good thing about what
is being proposed is that it sets out that important first step. The
problem is that we are not going far enough. We are addressing one
aspect of a problem that has been highlighted when it needs root and
branch
reform.<a class="bkMark" name="11032323000093">&#160;</a>

Metcalfe gave on how patchwork the current regime is as regards
different types of surveillance and different bodies using that
surveillance. We see no reason why there should not be prior judicial
authorisation for all types of targeted surveillance that are available
under the Act. One recent high-profile case of police infiltration of
environmental protest groups has brought people’s attention to
how lax the current self-authorising regime is—indeed, the
current head of the Association of Chief Police Officers has called for
prior judicial authorisation for the use of covert human intelligence
sources by the police. When you have the police asking for prior
judicial authorisation and better regulation of the use of these
powers, it should be incumbent on the Government to look at going
further in the

officers who no doubt gave evidence this morning that it will make a
significant difference to the ability of the police to prosecute
crimes. We know that the previous Government had a great deal of time
to come up with it, but there is no evidence to show that it has at all
inhibited the situation in Scotland and that police and prosecutors
have not been able to prosecute serious crime, including sexual and
violent crime. We think that the Scottish model is the correct model to
adopt. We have some concerns about particular details—the ways
in which the model has changed from the Scottish model—but we
think in general that the Scottish model is the correct approach. We do
not see any evidence from north of the border to suggest that it has
been a problem in their ability to prosecute

they are going to feel concerned is quite personal and unique to each

I will add something else, and you might like to comment when you have
finished on what I have asked already. I am told by the Forensic
Science Service providers that they process people’s DNA in
batches of about 80 samples, with some control samples in there. They
are held in those batches it is not possible to differentiate one from
the others, in the sense that they could destroy one. If there is one
in a batch that has to be held indefinitely because someone has a
sentence for a notifiable crime, the whole batch has to be held;
otherwise, you have to destroy that DNA. Going back to your point that
it is the personal information, those bodies are going to have to hold
on to
those.<a class="bkMark" name="11032323000106">&#160;</a>

for indefinite retention via the back door—the national security
exception and the idea that if someone is arrested or charged with a
serious violent or sexual offence, their DNA may be retained for three
years at first, renewable for two years. My reading of the Bill is that

                           </em> We have always said that the Scottish model,
which allows for an additional three-year retention once someone is
charged, is a proportionate way of dealing with the difficult issue of
the lack of convictions, particularly in rape cases. The bit that I am
less keen on in the Bill is that that can kick in at the point of
arrest, where the threshold is so low, and where you are not talking
about exceptional cases. Being charged and then the case not going
ahead is pretty unusual and exceptional. That is where you should make
the exception, not at the point of arrest. However, I understand that,
particularly with the national security exception, there is no finite
limit on how long DNA can be retained, and we think that that is
problematic, particularly given that it is almost impossible to
challenge retention by a judicial review or any other
means.<a class="bkMark" name="11032323000122">&#160;</a>

the DNA of people who have been arrested or charged with minor offences
should not be cross-checked. From experience, a number of
people—not hordes of them, I know—were arrested for minor
offences and then subsequently, through DNA, it was found out that they
were perhaps involved in a murder, rape or serious offence many years
before. You would effectively exclude

proportionate to take their

not do that unless they have reasonable grounds for believing that
taking the DNA will help them catch a person. If they are looking for a
violent offender who is unidentified and they pick up a person for a
minor violent offence, I think that that is reasonable grounds. If they
pick up a person for passing a bad cheque, I am not quite sure that I
would go that far. As the Bill stands, you would have the power to take
the DNA and run a cross-check in both cases.<a class="bkMark" name="11032323000127">&#160;</a>

the individual concerned, given the seriousness with which, presumably,
Parliament would have to take the application for an extension because

for emergency legislation in general? Yes, absolutely. Parliament has
to be able to legislate in an emergency. Should this particular device
be used? Does it qualify as an emergency, and would it be an
appropriate response to an emergency? I have great difficulty with
that. First of all, I do not know how we identify the kind of emergency
in which the appropriate response is extending the current period of
pre-charge detention from 14 days to 28 days. In the kinds of
emergencies that we have looked at, and if you go back over the history
of emergency legislation—fire, flood, famine, bombs dropping on
London and all the rest; look at the emergency legislation that was put
in place in world war two—it was not about extending the period
of pre-charge detention in terrorism cases. If you had an event that
qualifies as a genuine terrorist emergency, and the police came to you
and said, “We are concerned that there is a nuclear bomb
somewhere in central London,” clearly the response would not be
just to lift the current period of pre-charge detention from 14 to 28
days. I hope that they would rather do more than that.<a class="bkMark" name="11032323000133">&#160;</a>

me strange from a criminal justice perspective that the period was

Prosecution Service and its ability to charge using the threshold test.

                           </em> We are, as you have guessed, Mr
Coaker, pleased to see the limit come down to 14 days. When you compare
it with the length of time a suspect can be held before being charged
for offences that also are complex and involve a lot of investigation,
such as organised crime, 14 days is already more than enough in our
view. As Dr Metcalfe says, based on recent cases where people were held
for extended periods of time, we do not see that more than 14 days will
be
required.<a class="bkMark" name="11032323000137">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We
briefed parliamentarians, during the attempted legislation on 42 days,
about the Civil Contingencies Act 2004, a particularly chilling piece
of legislation, in our view. We took legal advice on that from David
Pannick QC and he agreed that it would be capable of being used, in a
genuine emergency, to extend the pre-charge detention limit to an
extended period of time. The reason why that idea was not favoured by
the then Government was that it would have to be a genuine emergency
and could not be something that could be flicked on and off more
easily.<a class="bkMark" name="11032323000138">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We
believe that there is already legislation on the statute book to deal
with a genuine emergency—a 9/11-style emergency, God forbid. We
do not think that any additional legislation would be required. We
completely agree about the difficulties that you mentioned in
Parliament passing anything like this in a hurry, particularly given
that parliamentarians would not be able to discuss particular cases,
and one suspects that the Government would only try to push something
like this through because of particular cases. We think that that would
be problematic. Of course, there may be reasons for emergency
legislation in all sorts of contexts, but we do not think that this is
one in which emergency legislation should or would be
required.<a class="bkMark" name="11032323000139">&#160;</a>

welcome the reduction from 28 days to 14 days. Many of us in this area
are very conscious of how difficult it is for suspects detained in
police custody for up to 28 days. It is worse than being in prison; it
is solitary confinement. Suspects find it very difficult, so we welcome
that reduction, but we are conscious that there may be occasions on
which, on taking advice from the appropriate authorities, it is thought
necessary to increase that period of detention. We cannot envisage
every possible situation, so we are conscious that it would be
beneficial for the Government, on taking advice, to be able to enact
emergency legislation of this

Met thought that by day seven it might have become clear that they
needed to push it slightly beyond 14 days. Do you have a view, from
your experience, of which of those scenarios is most likely? Clearly,
if it is knowing on day one, it may be that the civil contingencies

cases over the past few years in which the police have gone beyond 14
days, they have not actually needed to. That has been the advice of
lawyers involved in the cases, who have said that, based on police
interviews, they could have charged the individuals or released them
much earlier. Based on that empirical evidence, we frankly do not see
the need to go beyond 14 days, particularly when you bear in mind all
the other innovations that we have had over the past few years, which,
of course, include threshold charging, the proliferation of
lower order terrorism offences and many other innovations to do with
encryption under RIPA and so on. It is probably not the best answer to
your question, but we frankly do not see the reason to go beyond

far enough. I have to recognise that a great deal of good work has been
done. It is a much better provision than section 44 of the Terrorism
Act 2000 was. However, it does not go far enough, and it is likely to
prove to be incompatible. The main reason for that is that the only way
to challenge it as it currently stands is by way of judicial review.
There are insufficient safeguards against an authorisation and, despite
the requirement that it be necessary and proportionate, the only way to
challenge it is ex post facto. The better way forward would be to seek
prior authorisation from a Crown court judge  to have the
notification put in place. It goes back to the point about prior
judicial authorisation being a vitally

by suspending the operation of section 44 wholesale you take away what

criticism of the use of stop-and-search without reasonable suspicion
was not that it could never be justified. If, for example, police
receive a threat to St Paul’s cathedral and they want to
establish a cordon around the City of London and use stop-and-searches,
they might want to search everyone’s bag or everyone’s
vehicle as they enter the City of London. It would be reasonable to use
section 44 for a very limited time—say, a 24-hour
period—drawn right around the City of London to effect

front of us. The point that I am making, however—I wonder what
everybody else thinks—is that Parliament has not had the
opportunity to debate the clauses in the Bill; the remedial order that
was passed and came into force on 18 March puts into effect these
clauses before we have debated them.<a class="bkMark" name="11032323000160">&#160;</a>

                           </em> I take your point, Mr Coaker, about the
importance of parliamentary scrutiny. In fact, we are like a broken
record, arguing so often about how important parliamentary scrutiny is;
that measures that are meant to be in primary legislation should not be
in secondary legislation; and that your role is so vital in ensuring
that measures are proportionate and human rights compliant. That said,
when any Home Secretary decides to use Human Rights Act powers, Liberty
will not take issue with that. We think that the Act achieves a fine
balance between parliamentary sovereignty, which is absolutely crucial
to our style of Government and our history and traditions, and ensuring
that people’s rights are protected when you have a judgment,
which we had in this particular case, from the European Court of Human
Rights saying that the power was unlawful.<a class="bkMark" name="11032323000161">&#160;</a>

which seems to us a proportionate one that will be a substantial help
to employers and many others. We do not particularly see that people
will become more vulnerable or more at risk as a result of this. One of
the things we particularly welcome is the recognition that regulation
can happen in a number of ways; that solicitors generally are very
highly regulated; and that the sorts of things that the original Bill
was seeking to prevent are largely covered by the existing regulation.
We are glad that the rules do not apply to solicitors in respect of
legal advice to children. We are slightly surprised that they do cover
them in respect of other vulnerable people, and there seems to be a
very strange anomaly there, which we think ought to be looked
at.<a class="bkMark" name="11032323000167">&#160;</a>

of children and vulnerable adults. Indeed, under the Human Rights Act
the Government have positive obligations for the first time in domestic
law to protect life and to protect those who are vulnerable. We think
that the Bill strikes a good balance on this issue. We absolutely
welcomed the creation of an independent body to perform the very
sensitive function of ensuring that those who were given employment
with vulnerable adults and children were appropriate. One of our major
concerns previously was that under the enhanced Criminal Records Bureau
disclosure framework we found—this is something that lots of
people contacted our organisation about—that employers were
always erring on the side of caution if even the smallest piece of soft
information was passed their way, regardless of whether the individual
could refute the circumstances, or explain information that on the face
of it might have made them seem inappropriate. So we thought—I
think this was very much the implication of Sir Michael
Bichard’s report into the Soham murders—that having an
independent body would be a very good way of squaring a difficult
circle, so that past criminal convictions could be taken into account
along with sensitive information that was not conviction-related, but
was relevant.<a class="bkMark" name="11032323000168">&#160;</a>

that we were concerned about when the ISA was created was that the
enhanced Criminal Records Bureau check was going to continue alongside
it. We did not really understand the point of that. We were also
concerned that under the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act 2006, many
more people would need vetting who had not previously been vetted.
Arguably, they would be categories that it was not necessary to vet,
whether they were receptionists, cleaners or other categories of
people—that extra controlled activity
category.<a class="bkMark" name="11032323000169">&#160;</a>

Bill is given further scrutiny we can all be absolutely sure that that

provisions, but more concerning for us is that the Bill seems to be

Only people who have worked in regulated activity, or are likely to

kind of careers they have, and they often switch midlife. Does the

Bill is that that is not prevented, but that the onus is now going to
be on the employer to ensure that they are vetting people they decide
to employ. Our experience of that framework is that employers are very
keen not only to vet, but to get enhanced CRB and get as much
information as possible. We do not see the onus being on the employer
as problematic per se. Our concern would be to make sure that people
are properly vetted when they are about to start in relevant
employment.<a class="bkMark" name="11032323000173">&#160;</a>

subject of mandatory disclosure. We seek, however, to ensure that the
information flows on people who are known to have engaged in
inappropriate conduct towards children and vulnerable adults are made
known to prospective employers, so that they can consider whether, in
the light of that, they should employ or engage such people.<a class="bkMark" name="11032323000185">&#160;</a>

                           </em> I think that our concerns are not
about the categories but about the concept of supervision. What will
“supervision” actually mean? I do not know whether the
Government’s intention is to seek to define it, which I think
will be challenging, or to leave it to local interpretation, which
could lead to widespread interpretation. That is the point that we want
to look at with some care when ideas develop, rather than saying,
“Well, we think, for example, that cleaners in old
people’s homes should be included in regulated activity”.
That is not at all an approach that we are seeking to
adopt.<a class="bkMark" name="11032323000188">&#160;</a>

face is that vetting and barring can be vested with too much comfort
and authority. The intention is to underline the responsibility of the
employer or the organiser of volunteers, and that is right. The
approach should be that the right relevant information is provided to
employers, so that they can make those sorts of decisions.<a class="bkMark" name="11032323000190">&#160;</a>

proposals. These are supplementary. You have every continuing
responsibility to engage in proper selection, proper supervision,

given where we are in terms of public communication at the moment,
there is a continuing danger, which I hope we can address in the coming

about volunteers. There is general cross-party consensus that our

on how volunteers are put off and frankly it does not swim in a single

to add a point to your question if I may, Mr Baker, without seeking to
avoid it. When I did a piece of work that looked at the earlier scheme,
the National Confederation of Parent Teacher Associations canvassed the
views of parents. Three out of four parents said that if they
personally could not be responsible for deciding which adults looked
after their children, the adults should be subject to some form of
check, basically to see that they were not unsuitable to work with
children. I have to say that for all my massive support of volunteers,
and I have worked with thousands of them during my years with
Barnardo’s, consideration of relatives and parents should sit
alongside the debate about whether checking is off-putting to
volunteers.<a class="bkMark" name="11032323000194">&#160;</a>

for people who are currently in regulated activity, and we will not in
the future. When that information leads to a bar, they are barred from
posts that they will then be able to work in once the definition
changes, even though that was the post in which they committed the
behaviour that led to them being barred. Our concern is that if we
receive information about someone who is working with children and
vulnerable adults but not in regulated activity, and that behaviour
relates to harm for children and vulnerable adults, if we cannot
identify that the person has previously worked in regulated activity,
we will not be able to bar them. In theory, if they are not working in
regulated activity, it is not an issue, but if they subsequently apply
to work in regulated activity, or happen to be working in regulated
activity that we are not aware of, we could technically, at that point,
consider barring them because they are now applying, but the age of

                           </strong> Could I ask one other question, which relates to
the Education Bill that is currently going through Parliament? That
refers to a list of teachers who are barred through the General
Teaching Council.

                           </div>That information is held by the Department of Education. As I understand
it, that list is available to the general public and to schools. If a
teacher is barred on that list, that information is available in the
public domain, but you are saying that in the particular instance that
we just discussed, the barring information that you hold would not be
available?<a class="bkMark" name="11032323000211">&#160;</a>

with that legislation—the information that would be available to
parents and to other people who want to check would be on whether the
teacher is registered. If the teacher is barred, they would not be
registered. That is how it works at the moment. A parent can check
whether a teacher is registered, and if they are barred, they will not
be registered, but the parent would not be told whether they are
barred. I do not understand how the legislation will work once the
General Teaching Council ceases to
exist.<a class="bkMark" name="11032323000212">&#160;</a>

review that I have prepared, my fundamental underlying belief is that
public protection comes first and foremost, but we can be more
proportionate in how we disclose and give information to employers to
allow them to make the best decisions. In circumstances such as the
example you have just given, there need to be good and safe employment
and recruitment practices, as I envisaged when I wrote my report. If,
for example, a teacher had done something so serious that it led them
to be barred, the police should have been involved. If there was a
conviction, it would obviously be disclosed in an enhanced criminal
record check, if they were engaged in non-regulated activity—as
a volunteer, for example. If there had been no conviction but there was
local intelligence information, a chief officer would, again, make a
decision about whether it was relevant to release that information. If
good and safe employment practices are carried out and proper guidance
is given to employers, they can get the right information to look at
these
issues.<a class="bkMark" name="11032323000215">&#160;</a>

employer of a person who is prospectively working with children and
young people in non-regulated activity has the option to apply for an
enhanced disclosure. The enhanced disclosure will not reveal whether
the person is barred, but it will reveal information about any
criminality—cautions, convictions or police soft
intelligence.<a class="bkMark" name="11032323000217">&#160;</a>

concern that we have—this is one of our three little loophole
points—is that we estimate that one in five cases of people
being barred have not been near the police. The proportion is greater
in relation to vulnerable adults than it is in relation to children.

			Column number: 74<a class="bkMark" name="Column74">&#160;</a>
                           </div>been near the police; therefore, if, for example, a male teacher barred
from working in schools wanted to volunteer as a Sunday school teacher
and the parish priest decided to apply for a CRB disclosure, if the
grounds that led to the barring had not involved
the police, the disclosure would come back, in the jargon, clear.
Although we understand why we are there on that, we feel that it gives
false comfort to the parish priest in that circumstance, because a
reasonable belief would be that there are no known grounds for concern.
That is a small adjustment that we think would improve safeguarding
and, I have to say, would improve public confidence in the scheme,
too.<a class="bkMark" name="11032323000218">&#160;</a>

those matters. I think, however, that if there are serious concerns,
employers need to be educated to refer matters to the police. Quite
frankly, it is not only the ISA that might want to share information. I
sit as a deputy district judge, and I have to see safeguarding
information in respect of children. If the police have information when
those safeguarding checks are carried out, that information goes to the
courts and will come to a judge’s attention. If an employer only
makes a referral to the ISA and does not make any referral to the
police to investigate, that information is lost to the criminal justice
system. If it goes through the police, the police obviously do a
relevance test in deciding whether that information should be released.
So there is a proportionate measure, but it is also fairer, correct and
safer because the whole criminal justice system can share that
information if it is relevant. We are talking here about
proportionality and
safeguarding.<a class="bkMark" name="11032323000219">&#160;</a>

calling it soft intelligence. It is basically
police information. It might be broadly one of two types in this
area—these are the only disclosures that I see. One, it might
amplify on the statement of a caution or conviction that is on the
disclosure. That is one type—it may give the circumstances. The
second type, which is more contentious—Mrs Mason may wish to
comment on this because it is as much her area as ours—is where,
for example, the police may have investigated allegations of an
inappropriate relationship between a care worker and a young person in
the care home. It gets to the point where the police
decide—perhaps because the young person refuses to co-operate
further—that the prospect of a conviction is not there and
therefore they do not proceed to court. Under the police intelligence
system, they may record the fact of that
investigation.<a class="bkMark" name="11032323000227">&#160;</a>

something that has vexed and taxed me for some time—in fact,
since I came into post—because I realise that it  is
collected by the police for their internal use, but it is then
disclosed in a manner that is perhaps not always fair and
proportionate, although there are times when it is absolutely essential
that that information is revealed. For example, there was a real case
where a man who applied for an enhanced check to work as a tennis coach
at a primary school had no convictions, cautions, warnings or
reprimands, so in that sense it was clear, but the local intelligence
held by the police suggested that over a period of five years there
were instances of his assaulting four individual girls aged between
five and nine. The chief officer thought that that was highly relevant
to disclose to the employer, and that information went on to the
enhanced CRB check. It is absolutely right in such circumstances that
that sort of information is given.<a class="bkMark" name="11032323000232">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">On the other
side of the coin, however, information from local intelligence can be
revealed as in the case of a 13-year-old who was arrested on suspicion
of assault, but who was not identified as the offender and the CPS said
that it would not take any further action against her. When she turned
16, however, she applied for a CRB check to work on an external work
placement as a nursery nurse and that information was released, so it
was not a clear check and she was told that she could not do that job.
That is a real-life scenario. That is 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 76<a class="bkMark" name="Column76">&#160;</a>
                           </div>totally disproportionate, because she was not found guilty; there was no
conviction, and on the local intelligence held it was clear that it was
not even her.<a class="bkMark" name="11032323000233">&#160;</a>

can form a vast array of anything from one to 100 in its relevance. In
my discussions with ACPO, it has said that it is
really about who disclosed it and when; the nature of that source; the
relevance of that information; and how many other incidences there are.
It is a decision that needs to be taken by a chief officer under a
quality assurance framework test. It is very complicated, but when it
is done right it gets the right results.<a class="bkMark" name="11032323000234">&#160;</a>

the man was not prosecuted. I think you mentioned assaults on children
aged five to nine. It seems to me astonishing. If he is guilty of such
a thing, I want that person put in prison. Equally, if a person is not
guilty and he has had five allegations, do we just get to a point where
five allegations amount to a conviction? To me, this seems to be the
nub of such measures. Would you agree that it is the heart of what we

bit more about what the ISA actually does? I should declare that I have
visited the ISA on several occasions and have discussed this with some
of your caseworkers. I have also worked in high-security prisons and
read the court reports of many offenders, and I have observed the fact
that in very few of the serious convictions is it the first offence or
the first victims. There is clearly a lot of crime going on, and there
is information that if it had been passed on and dealt with properly
could have prevented crimes. There is an idea that the ISA collects
information, and that it probably errs too far on the side of caution
and bars people when perhaps common sense might dictate that it should
not. Can you explain the process that you go through and the checks
that you perform internally to make sure that that does not happen, and
the appeals that people can lodge with you to ensure that people are
not inappropriately barred?<a class="bkMark" name="11032323000239">&#160;</a>

of tests that we have to check before we take any action. The first one
is whether we have any evidence of relevant conduct. There was a lot of
information in 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 77<a class="bkMark" name="Column77">&#160;</a>
                           </div>the press which suggested that we barred people because they were
lonely, or because of gossip and innuendo, or for various other
reasons. On the contrary, we actually have to have information that a
child has been harmed or put at risk of harm, or a vulnerable adult has
been harmed or put at risk of harm, before we would look at the
information. This is ignoring the auto-bar process, which is a separate
piece of work. If the information that comes to us did not demonstrate
that, we would not take action against the person because we have to
have that harm to a child or vulnerable
adult.<a class="bkMark" name="11032323000241">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Having
established that the information that we have received suggests that
harm took place, and if there is no criminal conviction or caution, or
a finding of fact by a competent body such as the General Medical
Council, we get information to see whether we believe that what we call
“relevant conduct” took place. We weigh up the evidence
very carefully to ensure that we are satisfied that the behaviour took
place. We do not have to reach the same standard of proof as a court,
but we have to be satisfied on the balance of probability that the
behaviour took
place.<a class="bkMark" name="11032323000242">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">If
we are satisfied that the behaviour took place, we look at the
information that we hold to establish why we believe the behaviour took
place, and whether this was a one-off accident that will not be
repeated or the result of premeditated behaviour. We have a risk
assessment process that caseworkers are trained to undertake, which
looks at the behaviour and all the other information that we receive.
Some of that information might be about other convictions that the
person has, or it might just be other details that we have about how
they have behaved in their role—their job. It might be
information that the employer has provided to us about previous
disciplinary hearings. We collect a range of information, and if there
has been police involvement we will get information from the
police.<a class="bkMark" name="11032323000243">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We put
together a picture of the person and make a decision about whether we
believe that person presents a risk of harm to children or vulnerable
adults. If we decide that they do, we write to the person, giving them
a copy of all the information that we hold and saying, “This is
what we hold. These are the reasons why we consider it is appropriate
to bar you,” and we give them the right to make representations
in relation to that information. When we receive the
representations—if the person makes any—we reconsider the
information that we hold to ensure that our findings of fact are still
correct. It might be that the person provides information that
challenges those findings, and that we decide that they were not
accurate because of the new information that impacts on them. We will
also reassess whether the findings of fact are accurate, and whether
any information is provided that suggests that the level of risk
changes.<a class="bkMark" name="11032323000244">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">If,
at the end of all that, we are satisfied that relevant conduct took
place and we believe that there would be a risk of harm in the future
from that person if they were allowed to work with children or
vulnerable adults, we bar them. When a person is barred, they have the
right to appeal against the decision, and they can appeal on a finding
of fact. If we have decided that behaviour took place and there is no
caution or conviction, the person can challenge that on appeal. We can
also be challenged on a point of law, which could be that the decision
that we made was totally irrational—that based on the
information we had it was not appropriate to
bar.<a class="bkMark" name="11032323000245">&#160;</a>

Sir Roger made earlier, that the main concern of the ISA are those
cases in which an individual has been barred for reasons that have not
been disclosed to the police. Why, if you have a collection of
information that is so serious that you feel that a person should be
barred from engaging with children, has that information not been
passed to the police? Mrs Mason commented that soft intelligence
included in CRBs takes in such a range of intelligence. Are you not
permitted to pass on such important information to the
police?<a class="bkMark" name="11032323000246">&#160;</a>

that the majority of cases that involve children have involved the
police. There are some that do not, for example, a school might decide,
on the face of the information that it has, that a person has behaved
inappropriately. It challenges the individual, who says,
“I’m going to resign.” The school is so relieved
that it lets the bursar bundle him out of the back door. There is no
referral to the police, and that is the end of the matter, except that
the school should refer it to us. If we are in possession of
information that a similar thing happened three years ago and we took a
decision at that point not to bar, we start to put those two things
together and say, “What is it about this man’s behaviour
that leads to this
situation?”<a class="bkMark" name="11032323000247">&#160;</a>

Mrs Mason that schools should refer such cases to the police in the
first instance, and that we have a duty to encourage them to do so. My
question is not whether schools should do so; it is this. Once you have
that information and you have made a decision about firing, why are you
not communicating that decision to the police, along with the
information on which you based it?<a class="bkMark" name="11032323000248">&#160;</a>

report it to the police, or, exceptionally, do it ourselves. But we do
sometimes deal with information that is less specific and much softer
than that. It might even be that the police have been consulted
informally and say, “No, you sort it out within the

to gain on that. Without coming away from the point that you make, a

                        <p class="tabbed">We talked
about the alarming type of local intelligence that can be disclosed on
a certificate. It can go from something very serious to very minor, but
a lot of employers are still under the false apprehension that if a
check does not clear, one cannot employ someone. I spoke to a head
teacher who said that he still meets head teachers today who think
that. One of the examples that I gave in my review was of a teacher who
had a penalty notice for disorder—not a conviction—for
excessive standing at a football match. That was revealed in local
intelligence. He was very worried about it and thought he might lose
his job. If he had seen that first, when that certificate was disclosed
to him, he would have had an opportunity to put that right. He would
have had the opportunity to go back and say, “Is it really
relevant that this is disclosed? Does that make me a risk to children
that I got a bit excited at a football match once?” Someone can
then make a decision on that. He should not have to be at risk of, or
fear, losing his job over that. It is about being proportionate and
sensible.<a class="bkMark" name="11032323000258">&#160;</a>

only be on an enhanced certificate. If you were working in the sort of
role that required you to have an enhanced certificate, you
would apply for it and that information would come
out. One of the questions that was in my terms of reference, and which
the Government asked me to look at very carefully, was whether local
intelligence should be on the face of disclosure. I very much felt that
it should, but with a package to make it more proportionate to
individuals, hence my idea of one certificate. If, however, the
Government had said to me, “We hear what you’re saying,
Mrs Mason, but we do not think that this should be on the face of a
disclosure”, then I would have been uncomfortable with how the
two reviews sat, because I would have thought that there would have
been loopholes and gaps for individuals to fall into, and that could
have eroded public protection. However, I believe that the way that the
two sit together as drafted covers public protection but still looks at
proportionality, so I am satisfied with
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11032323000272">&#160;</a>

Of course, the CRB does not itself exercise judgment about what is on
the systems it holds. The information is controlled by the police. It
is the means whereby the information flows from police forces, among
other agencies, to the ISA.<a class="bkMark" name="11032323000283">&#160;</a>

Robertson’s earlier question on the individual knowing what
information is against held on them so that they can challenge it, am I
right in thinking that it is essential in the interests of justice and
fairness for that individual to have the information? It is similar to
evidence of bad character in a criminal trial, where an individual is
given the details beforehand, and sometimes it is not convictions or
cautions that amount to bad character. If people are given the
opportunity to challenge in the interest of justice in the latter case,
they should be given the opportunity to challenge information before it
goes anywhere else in the former case, in the interests of
fairness.<a class="bkMark" name="11032323000284">&#160;</a>

you have about soft information. Is it accurate to say that what is
being termed as soft information—the police do not actually like
that term because they think it is derisory—can be little more
than hearsay, sometimes no more than gossip? Is it not right that
people should have a robust safeguard against malice that may be
directed towards them? What this does is form a balance between the
competing interests, both the individual who may be subject to that
soft information and the general public and the need for

                           </div>the same consistency of decision making. That is why there are the
anomalies like the revelation of a penalty notice of disorder. One of
my recommendations was that that decision making could be centralised
or regionalised. Then you would get a much more consistent approach.
Also, if there were a statutory code of practice, which I again
recommended, that all chief officers follow and there is a procedure
known as the quality assurance framework, then a chief officer has to
jump through many hoops and hurdles and ask themselves the questions,
“Was it malicious? How long ago was it? What happened? What was
the outcome?”, before they decide whether it is relevant to
reveal that. That is why I have also said that when that information is
revealed to an individual and an employer, they should say why, so that
the individual and employer
understand.<a class="bkMark" name="11032323000293">&#160;</a>

organisations I consulted. I have been told that they ask for enhanced
checks when they are not actually eligible for an enhanced check. At
the moment, employers or registered bodies simply tick the box and send
it to the CRB. The CRB, as Sir Roger has just said, is an operational,
functional body. It is not there to check whether that application is
correct, although I understand that it does do some sampling. Because
there are no sanctions for somebody asking for extra information, those
employers who feel that they want to know everything, even if they are
not entitled to it, may well do so. I am not suggesting that someone
who makes a mistake should be fined, but I think repeat offenders
should face sanctions and penalties, because it is inappropriate and
not proportionate.<a class="bkMark" name="11032323000299">&#160;</a>

on that. The scheme has imperfections that are reflective of

number of instances where people have behaved highly inappropriately

the ISA. I have in mind, for example, a person working under

about children that perhaps we can discuss. Certainly, in relation to
innocent people’s records, which is the main issue we have had
concerns about, I think it is a proportionate approach. In our view, it
will very much limit the risk of anyone not being detected and it will
at the same time address the very serious concerns that a lot of
innocent people have. A lot of people phone us up, send us e-mails and
so on, and they are very concerned about the retention of records. In
relation to innocent people, we think that it is basically the correct
approach. In relation to children, we have a concern that warnings and
reprimands are being treated in the same way as a conviction. We have
concerns about that because, essentially, that system was designed to
keep children out of the criminal justice system. In the Bill as it
stands, a child who has two warnings, for example, will have their
records retained for life. We think that that is excessive, so we would
like to see that addressed.<a class="bkMark" name="11032323000321">&#160;</a>

                           </em> I think people often do not realise that
children can be given reprimands and warnings without their consent at
the police station. Often, parents do not realise the serious nature of
what is going on. They think that it is a slightly
more formal clip round the ear from a policeman, and they do not
realise that this results in a record. If they did, perhaps they would
be more careful about seeking legal representation at the police
station. They may find that there is actually a reasonable defence for
what is an apparent evidence of guilt. Children often feel harried
through the process and they end up being reprimanded and never really
understand that they could have justified their actions. Parents and
children are overwhelmed. They may not have advice. As Helen has said,
the whole purpose of the reprimand and final warning system is to keep
children out of the system for as long as possible, so it seems
entirely counter-productive to lock them in
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11032323000322">&#160;</a>

understanding the consequences of their reprimand or caution, am I
right in thinking that at the moment, in the criminal justice system,
when a child is taken to a police station they have an appropriate
adult or parent there at the time? So, there is oversight at the police
station when a caution is accepted. Am I right in that

caution. It is not like an adult caution; it is a reprimand or a final
warning. There does not have to be consent to it. All there has to be
is some evidence that the child was involved in what is alleged, and
some kind of admission. But certainly, in my experience from talking to
criminal solicitors who represent children at police stations,
admission can be interpreted very loosely

embarrassed and they want to get it over with. They feel that the

other things can come into play when a parent is there with a child at

process has accelerated. Some school governors thought that maybe they
could beat the Bill by getting the system installed and were then quite
surprised to find that permission for processing—consent to
processing —would be required, rather than actually

What supervision is there going to be of schools, especially ones with
pre-existing systems, that are going to have to work to bring
themselves up to best practice? What is going to make sure that they
comply, and will the Information Commissioner have sufficient elastic
to take on board that duty? We would prefer to see a sanction in the
Bill. There is certainly a precedent for that. If you take something
like the pupil registration regulations, a head teacher commits an
offence if he or she fails to remove a child from the school roll when
asked to do so by the parents. That carries a fine. I would prefer to
see, for the avoidance of doubt, a sanction in the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11032323000336">&#160;</a>

largely created these systems, seeking to diversify their markets and

concerns that people raised with us were really about the issue of
retention, so there is a two-year retention limit on that power. The
key concern about the existing DNA provisions is how that data might be
misused and the fact that people have a permanent record of
criminality, if you like, even if they are an innocent person. So our
emphasis, given the concerns that have been raised with us, is on the
issue of DNA retention and restricting that period of

                           </strong> It just strikes me as exceedingly odd. The whole
Bill is about trying to protect people’s freedoms more
effectively and there are concerns about the taking and retaining of
DNA. And yet here we have, tucked away in the Bill in this clause, a
new power for a penalty notice, for which someone will have their DNA
taken. That DNA can then be retained for two years, as you say, and the
penalty notice can be given to a young person. Now I am not sure
exactly where it got to, but section 2 of the 2001 Act says that it can
apply to children over the age of 10, which is obviously the age of
criminal responsibility. That is certainly an issue that we will come
back to during the deliberations of the Committee. I think that the
Government are going way too far with respect to this
measure.<a class="bkMark" name="11032323000344">&#160;</a>

is the case, may I just put a scenario to you? It seems to me that
those two clauses are fairly robust. My reading of them is that if a
school were to provide bus passes, for example, to children and it
obtained the consent of just one parent and not both parents, as
required by the clauses, they would fall foul of those clauses. Am I
correct that you are suggesting that you would criminalise the head

that means that in terms of the people on the database, we have not
only 1 million innocent people but probably a high proportion who are
children. It is difficult to be very exact about the figures, but we
hear about large numbers of children arrested for very minor offences,
things like allegedly pulling each other’s hair, allegedly
scratching their name on a park bench, which count as assault and
criminal damage respectively. All those records are currently kept
indefinitely to age
100.<a class="bkMark" name="11032323000356">&#160;</a>

Wallace:</strong>
                           </em> No, we were not happy with those provisions.
We really have two sources of information. First, there are the people
who contact us and raise concerns, and the other groups we spoke to who
felt that it was still very unreasonable, from their personal point of
view, to have those records retained for that length of time if they
had done nothing wrong and not been convicted of any
offence.<a class="bkMark" name="11032323000360">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
second piece of evidence is statistics and information. I want to refer
to something ACPO said this morning when they claimed that 1,000
matches per year would be lost under the Bill. I do not agree with that
figure, but I think it is moving in the right direction. In the
original Home Office evidence for the Crime and Security Bill, they
claimed that 6,200 detections would be lost per year if all innocent
people were removed, and 3,800 would be lost per year under the
six-year proposal—much bigger numbers. I think the reason why
that has gone down is that 1,000 matches is about 500 detections, not
3,800. It has gone down because ACPO must have accepted the criticisms
of the way those calculations were
done.<a class="bkMark" name="11032323000361">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There
were two major criticisms, the first of which I think ACPO accepted,
which is that the Home Office made the assumption that if you were not
convicted and your DNA was taken off the database you would never be
convicted again for any other offence. That is, in effect, what they
assume—completely wrongly, which is why their figures are orders
of magnitude in
error.<a class="bkMark" name="11032323000362">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
second problem with the Home Office evidence is the reason why I still
think that ACPO’s number is too high. You will notice that they
come to around 500 detections a year, but I say in my written evidence
that it would be about 400 detections a year if innocent people were
equally as likely to commit crimes as other people on the database. In
fact, we know that is not the
case.<a class="bkMark" name="11032323000363">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
evidence that ACPO rely on is still the same basic evidence that was
presented in the consultation. The major error, although there a number
of smaller errors as well, is that it looks only at comparing people on
their first arrest. We know that the vast majority of crimes are
committed by repeat offenders with long records, so that will skew the
proportion. It is not a fifth, as ACPO said this morning, of the
detections that you lose, it is a much smaller proportion. I think you
lose perhaps as few as 20 detections a year. The vast majority of those
are volume crimes; fewer than 1% are rapes, fewer than 0.5% are
murders. If you take all the innocent people off the database, you are
talking about losing less than one serious crime a year; no one knows
the exact number. Those are the people, those very rare cases, that
your three years plus two years is designed to capture. In my view,
that is why I take the position that the proposal in the Bill will be
sufficient to capture those serious
crimes.<a class="bkMark" name="11032323000364">&#160;</a>

just heard about criminal record checks. I think that a lot of Members
of Parliament even do not realise this, because it was not a change in
legislation but a change in policy when the legislation changed to
retain DNA collected on arrest indefinitely. There was a policy change
by ACPO to keep all the linked police national computer records. If you
are arrested, you get your DNA and fingerprints taken on arrest, and
you get a record on the police national computer. That record contains,
until you are aged 100, a record of that arrest. Those are records that
can be used in a variety of
ways.<a class="bkMark" name="11032323000366">&#160;</a>

heard Sunita Mason talk about the 13-year-old girl arrested on
suspicion of assault—not convicted; it was not her, but when she
was 16 she still could not get a nursery nurse job. I appreciate that
the Bill tries to make the process of employment vetting more
proportionate; it looks at what is necessary and proportionate in that
context. But in fact those records are used in a number of other
contexts.<a class="bkMark" name="11032323000367">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
records are used if you want to travel to the USA. If you have ever
been arrested, you now have to make an application to ACPO to release
your criminal record, which is a record of arrest, and you are required
to send that to the US embassy and to go through a full visa
application process. Police officers see records of arrest routinely on
the street. People tell us that if they have previously been arrested,
the police say, “Oh, you are known to the police”, but
the officers have not seen the circumstances, they simply see that you
might have been arrested for an assault when you were
13.<a class="bkMark" name="11032323000368">&#160;</a>

are trying to argue in the written evidence that it is not just about
use but also about retention. You need a policy that deletes these
records at some point, if people are innocent. We would like that to
correspond to the deletion of their DNA and fingerprint records, as
that seems to us to be a logical
approach.<a class="bkMark" name="11032323000369">&#160;</a>
