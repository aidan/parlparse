wishes.</div>
<a name="10020477000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">When we broke
for lunch, I was responding to the debate on this group of amendments.
The Minister of State had set out the Government&#146;s position, and
I was making it clear that I accept neither his characterisation of the
official Opposition as not accepting the use of technology and DNA, nor
his suggestion that our proposals, including amendment 26, reflected
that.</div><a name="10020477000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">Now
that we have had our lunch break, is the right hon. Gentleman able to
respond to a point that I raised in relation to the case studies that
he cited in the letter that was handed to the Committee? He did not
seem to disagree with my comment that case study 5 and case study 1
might be one and the same case. That is quite important because
obviously the letter has been put before the Committee. The facts in
case study 5 are quite limited, and I made my assumption based on the
limited facts. I do not know whether the Minister has sought
clarification over the lunch break. Perhaps he can respond on that
point.</div><a name="10020477000047"></a>

further on a number of points that the hon. Gentleman made in the
morning sitting. I was trying to be helpful to the Committee by
completing my remarks in time for a possible Division at 10.25, but as
we instead proceeded, I should be happy to continue the debate
shortly.</div><a name="10020477000048"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020477000525"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> I will happily cover that point now, in an
intervention. Having checked the matter, I can say that case study 1
and case study 5 are the same case. One reason why there is some
difficulty is that we have been seeking to ensure that we get victim
approval when victims&#146; names are put into the public domain.
Every name that I have mentioned in my contributions has had the
victim&#146;s approval of it being put into the public domain. There
was some confusion over those cases. I will clarify the matter if
necessary by letter for the Committee, but we have many more cases that
we have permission to use, and I will do so during the
debate.</div><a name="10020477000050"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020477000526"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I am a little disturbed by what the
Minister has said. Obviously, we have received the letter,
which in effect set out to formalise the Government&#146;s
approach and to show why the Government feel that the Scottish model,
and any adjustments in that direction, are not appropriate. It is
therefore quite 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column253" />Column number: 253</div>worrying if we are being told that there are five
case studies when in fact there are four. I ask the Minister to reflect
on whether a letter of clarification should be written to the Chairmen,
in case the documents are all put down as evidence to the Committee and
then all bound up and looked at afterwards. The question is what other
facts may not be correct if, just having highlighted one
issue&#151;</div><a name="10020477000051"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020477000527"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. I might be able to help. The letter was
sent to Members. It becomes evidence only if it is sent to the
Committee as evidence&#151;if it is stated that it is sent as
evidence. If that helps to clarify the matter and deal with the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s concern, we might be able to move
forward.</div><a name="10020477000052"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020477000528"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I am grateful for that, Mr. Cook.
It was the fact that the letter had been addressed to you and your
co-Chairman that gave me the impression of extended formality. I think
the Minister was indicating that he wished to intervene, but if he does
not, I will leave that point, because I understand what he is saying. I
do not want to delay the Committee and I know that the right hon.
Gentleman will respond as required on the matter. We look forward to
receiving that information in due
course.</div><a name="10020477000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have heard clearly that on the balance of proportionality, there is a
difference of opinion in the Committee. In the light of that, I wish to
test the Committee&#146;s opinion on amendment
26.</div>

Brake</b> (Carshalton and Wallington) (LD): On a point of
order, Mr. Cook. I wish to ensure that the record is clear.
Before we broke for lunch, the Minister of State referred to a case
involving a constituent of mine. He may have led the Committee into
believing that, if adopted, Liberal Democrat party policy would have
made a difference and not allowed the murderer in that case to have
been pursued.</div>
<a name="10020477000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">For the sake
of clarity, I must point out that my party&#146;s policy would have
made no difference, because the assailant in that case was arrested
some months afterwards and his DNA was captured then. That sample was
cross-referenced with the DNA captured at the crime scene. I wish the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020477000543"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> On a point of order, Mr. Cook.
This may be an appropriate point to raise the matter. I understand from
the business statement made earlier today on the Floor of the House
that there will be a motion to approve an instruction relating to the
Crime and Security Bill next Wednesday. I wonder whether you have
received notification of it or had any instruction relating to the
matter. Motions seem regularly to appear at the moment, and any
clarification would be greatly appreciated.</div>
<a name="10020477000074"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020477000544"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I grasp the point. I have not been informed, but
it is not a matter for the Committee. It is a matter for the Chamber
and the business of the
House.</div><a name="10020477000075"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020477000545"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> Further to that point of order, Mr.
Cook. I will write to members of the Committee and to you and Sir
Nicholas about those matters, but I had to wait for an announcement to
be made by the Leader of the House on the Floor of the House before I
could do so.</div>
<a name="10020477000076"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020477000546"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Thank you very much. We are all being very
proper today, thankfully.</div>
<a name="10020477000077"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020477000547"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I beg to move amendment 150, in
clause 14, page 30, line 42, leave
out from beginning to end of line 27 on page
35.</div><a name="10020477000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
come to a slightly narrower point and a further testing amendment on
the differential approach being applied in relation to young people and
adults. During the first debate on clause 14, I acknowledged that the
Government sought to adopt a different regime for children to reflect
not only the Marper judgment but the United Nations convention on the
rights of the child. However, under the proposals on
retention periods for adults and persons under 18, will the DNA of a
young person convicted of an offence, albeit not a qualifying offence
falling within a category designated by the Government as serious, not
be retained for longer than someone who is innocent in the eyes of the
law?</div>
<a name="10020477000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">The retention
period for an adult arrested for any offence will be six years, whereas
the period for a young person convicted of an offence other than a
qualifying offence will be five years. In essence, someone who is
guilty of an offence will be treated more leniently than someone who is
not guilty. Will the Minister explain the thinking behind the relative
positions? We touched on this question during our previous debate,
albeit obliquely, but it is worth probing the Government&#146;s
thinking to explore how they have arrived at those retention
periods.</div>
<a name="10020477000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
of State has discussed dealing with minor as well as more serious
offending, yet the Government have made a distinction on that point in
respect of children which cuts across some of the more general
arguments made in the previous debate and seems inconsistent with their
broad view on retaining DNA 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column255" />Column number: 255</div>records. It would be useful to understand the difference in thinking on
this issue. Why has a distinction been made that appears to treat young
people who have offended more leniently than those who have not
offended at all?</div>
<a name="10020477000081"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020477000548"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> This is an interesting amendment, and the hon.
Gentleman has phrased it so as to allow debate on convictions involving
under-18s. The reason for the differential is that we have taken a view
that young people are often involved in minor crime at a young age, but
we hope that diversionary activity through youth offending teams, youth
custody if necessary, non-court disposals and a range of activities
will help to ensure that when the individual reaches the age of
maturity at 18, they will not progress into the criminal justice system
for a long
period.</div><a name="10020477000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have considered the matter in factual terms. We recognise that for many
teenagers, criminal activity can be and often is a minor and isolated
incident. However, teenage involvement in crime can be a strong
indicator of risk of further criminality in adulthood, so we need to
consider retaining DNA up to the age of 18. Based on a fair assessment
of the difficulties faced by young people, we will call an end to
retention at the age of 18 to give young people a fresh start in
life.</div><a name="10020477000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
the hon. Gentleman will know, we have again downgraded the proposals
from our May 2009 consultation. We have changed our original proposals
for first convictions under 18&#151;that records be removed at 18 or
retained indefinitely&#151;to retention for five years. Individuals
could, for example, be convicted of an offence at the age of criminal
responsibility of 10 or 11, and in such instances, a five-year period
would be sufficient to ensure that they can examine their criminality.
If they commit further crimes, retention will continue. Changes have
been made in the regulations after our May 2009 consultation and I
believe that they are fair and
just.</div><a name="10020477000483"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.15
pm</div><a name="10020477000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman is right to raise the question whether we will have
people who have not been convicted of a crime having their DNA retained
for a longer period&#151;six years&#151;than those who have been
convicted of a crime under the age of 18. Again, it boils down to the
judgments that we have made in the context of European legislation. I
still think that the six-year period is fair, based on the evidence
that we talked about under the previous group of amendments and our
discussions about the clause generally. I also think that the five-year
figure is fair for under-18s. It is a matter of judgment and that is
the judgment that we have come to, which is based on the offending
rates of younger people and on the likelihood of offending for those
who are not convicted but who are initially
charged.</div>
<a name="10020477000085"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020477000549"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> The Minister of State said that he has
undertaken some analysis and research in relation to youth offending
rates. That does not appear to be captured in the hazard rate analysis,
which is more general in plotting the hazard rate curve. That may have
been because of the relevant information that was available to him.
However, is there any published research or anything else that led him
to conclude that the five-year period is appropriate, or was it, as he
says, simply a matter of judgment?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column256" />Column number: 256</div><a name="10020477000086"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020477000550"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> We have a range of information, which we
continuously examine, about youth offending rates between the ages of
10 and 18. There are peak years when offending commences&#151;around
the ages of 14 and 15&#151;which are covered in the maximum retention
period of five years up to the age of 18. At that point, we are trying
to draw a line in the sand to give people a new opportunity not to
offend again in their adult years after an offending period in their
teenage years. The age of criminal responsibility is and will remain
the age of 10. People can be convicted of criminal offences from that
age. The majority of our young offenders are between 13 and 18. That is
why we made the judgment that we did in relation to the five-year
period.</div>
<a name="10020477000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not have
statistics to hand, although I may get some during the debate. However,
I know from my experience of having responsibility for the Youth
Justice Board and for youth justice in two years as a Justice Minister
our focus all along was on diverting people away from the criminal
justice system, changing their behaviour and ensuring that we gave them
a new start in life at 18. We did not succeed in every instance, but
that is the principle and the logic behind the proposals that are
before the Committee.</div>
<a name="10020477000088"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020477000551"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I hear what the right hon. Gentleman says and
I respect the approach of trying to give young people who may have
committed one minor offence an opportunity to reflect on that offence
and not necessarily have it blight the rest of their life by affecting
their employment and life chances. I understand and recognise the
principle that he is seeking to establish. The issue is more
fundamental. It requires that we take a step back from that approach,
use our judgment and examine the time periods for records and DNA
profiles are to be kept. We seem to have ended up in a rather perverse
situation, where a young person who has not been convicted is being
treated less leniently than someone who has been convicted. It is
almost like treating someone who is innocent more harshly than someone
who is guilty. It is important that we recognise that logical
inconsistency.</div>
<a name="10020477000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will
certainly reflect on what the Minister of State has said and I do not
intend to press the amendment to a vote. However, my parting comment is
that, at the very least, the situation seems rather odd. I beg to ask
leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="10020477000090"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<a name="10020477000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am sorry if I sound
slightly cynical about the term &#147;national security&#148;, but
it seems from some of our debates that there is very wide scope to use
other powers and justify it on the basis of national security. The
provision therefore flags up concerns about what we mean by national
security.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column257" />Column number: 257</div><a name="10020477000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">Earlier in our
proceedings, we heard of the concerns that Lord Carlile expressed in
his last report about powers that were ostensibly intended for the

will be used in a way that reflects our interpretation of it&#151;in

<a name="10020477000104"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020477000560"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> Concern has been raised about the reference
to national security. The provisions of new section 64ZK appear to
allow for the indefinite retention of the DNA profile of someone who is
innocent of any crime; indeed, they may not even be a suspect. It
appears from the language in the Bill that the rolling two-year period
can be extended for another two years and then for another two years.
It is therefore a concern that there is no oversight and that
everything is down to the judgment of the relevant chief officer of
police. As I 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column258" />Column number: 258</div>indicated, the wording is not framed in a way that suggests that the
power should be used, for example, to prevent acts of
terrorism.</div>
<a name="10020477000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">My first
question to the Minister is why the power has been drawn so widely and
in such an open-ended way. A chief officer of police seems to have wide
discretion. Is there nothing in the power&#146;s
interpretation&#151;I appreciate that this is pushing the language to
its nth degree&#151;to prevent a chief officer of police from
determining that all DNA under his or her control should be retained to
aid the purposes of national security? The language is framed in such
an open-ended way that it almost allows that sort of determination.
What rights would an individual have in relation to the notification of
such a determination by a chief officer of
police?</div><a name="10020477000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Bill has various requirements to notify someone about the destruction
of their profile or the DNA information or sample that they have
provided, so will the lack of such a notification inform someone that
their DNA is being retained for the extended period? Is there some
other mechanism that will allow someone to know that that is the
case?</div><a name="10020477000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">Linked
to that is the question whether the chief officer of police would be
expected to provide grounds for such a determination. If asked why
someone&#146;s DNA has been retained under new section 64ZK, does the
chief officer of police have the justification or ability to offer an
explanation, or will their response simply be, &#147;In my judgment,
this is required for the purposes of national security.&#148;? As
there is no oversight, what right of challenge would someone have? Is
it anticipated that there will be any right of appeal against such a
determination? Would we then simply return to the current guidance
issued by the Association of Chief Police Officers and say that it is
only in exceptional circumstances that we would remove the DNA
profile?</div><a name="10020477000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
language used does not appear to reflect the Home Secretary&#146;s
statement last November when the proposals on DNA retention were being
outlined. On the retention of DNA in relation to terrorism and national
security, the Home Secretary
said:</div><a name="10020477000457"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Material
taken under any regime (including the Terrorism Act 2000) would be able
to be retained beyond the six-year point where there is a case for
doing so on the basis of a case-by-case review on national security
grounds. This would require a review by a senior police officer every
two years&#151;although data would be deleted if it became clear
between reviews that its retention would no longer be
necessary.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report</i>, 11 November 2009;
Vol. 499, c.
28WS.]</div><a name="10020477000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
last part does not seem to be reflected in the Bill, which outlines a
two-year determination. Moreover, it does not state that the
determination will remain in effect only when there are concerns about
national security and that it would be automatically released when
those concerns were no longer
evident.</div><a name="10020477000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
issue is notification and knowing why a chief officer of police may
have taken such a judgment. In some cases, there may be justifiable
reasons for not notifying, because it could put lives at risk. I
respect that, but it is a question of how that then fits in with how
someone can challenge. We are almost getting into the grounds of a
control order-type regime, where people are not necessarily aware of
what they may be challenged with, there is no evidence and they do not
believe that they have done anything wrong. Moreover, there are
questions about misjudgement and whether the facts 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column259" />Column number: 259</div>that have been presented are correct. It would be
helpful to understand why the concept of deletion between reviews if
the concerns regarding national security are no longer evident is not
reflected in new section 64ZK. That would at least offer clarification
and bring the new section in line with the Home Secretary&#146;s
stated intentions in his initial
announcement.</div><a name="10020477000484"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.30
pm</div><a name="10020477000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
return to the distinction with which I began on the broad application
of &#147;national security&#148;. The phrase can be interpreted
widely. What is &#147;in the national interest&#148;? What does
&#147;national security&#148; mean? It extends beyond what might be
perceived to be prevention of terrorism. I say that not because of idle
speculation, but because on page 37 of the Bill, new section 64ZN on
the use of retained material draws a distinction. It sets out two
categories of reasons to retain DNA: &#147;in the interests of
national security&#148; and &#147;for the purposes of a terrorist
investigation&#148;. That makes me query the intention behind the use
of the words &#147;national security&#148;. If a distinction is
being drawn in a separate clause to suggest that the meaning goes wider
than terrorist-type activity, a court would say that &#147;national
security&#148; is a much broader
category.</div><a name="10020477000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government must clarify whether they have terrorism-related activities
in mind, or whether the provision is broader and, if it is, what sort
of circumstances they are trying to cover. They must provide that
clarification because of the concern and sensitivity about how the
Government, whatever their colour&#151;I am not suggesting that the
current Government would seek to use the provision as I have
outlined&#151;might use it. Parliament must legislate in language
that is not open to abuse by any future Government. Once a statute is
on the statute book, it stays there unless it is changed or repealed.
Clarification of the language is important because of the issues that I
have highlighted, and to ensure that there is no future
misunderstanding about the scope and intent of the
provision.</div><a name="10020477000113"></a>

which have experienced mission creep and been used for purposes that
were never intended when the legislation was drafted and debated. The

<div class="Column"><a name="Column260" />Column number: 260</div><a name="10020477000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that the Minister will give us some more detailed information
about how he expects that judicial review process to work, and the
grounds, based on national security, on which a police officer may
apply for retention. As the hon. Member for Hornchurch said, we are not
expecting the Minister to reveal secrets that could threaten our
national security, but we hope that he will give a further explanation
of the grounds, the justification that might have to be deployed by
police officers, and the appeal process that may be available to
individuals&#151;if, indeed, they are aware that their data are being
retained, not
deleted.</div><a name="10020477000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
this is exactly the sort of issue that will lead to the Minister having
to give me that fiver that he proffered earlier. Having worked in IT
before I was elected to the House, I know that that is exactly the sort
of area where things tend to go wrong. It involves exceptions, and that
is where problems will arise in relation to the fantastic algorithm
that will automatically delete everyone from the database at the
appropriate time. I suspect that it would be simpler for the Minister
to give me that fiver now. I promise to give it back to him if he can
prove to me, in future years, that no one has fallen foul of his
algorithm.</div>
<a name="10020477000120"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020477000562"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> On the day that Sir Thomas Legg has produced his
report, I do not think that it is appropriate for me to give fivers to
anybody, given recent circumstances.</div>
<a name="10020477000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">Both hon.
Gentlemen have raised real issues that need explanation and
examination. Let us be clear about the impact of the amendment. It
would remove all powers for the police to retain, for a period of two
years, DNA profiles under national security considerations. It is fair
that the Committee asks what exactly is meant by the provision. There
is no clear, standard, legislative definition of national security. I
want to place on record what we understand that definition to be,
because that will help those who will interpret the legislation
downstream, should it be passed by both Houses of
Parliament.</div><a name="10020477000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are clear that the legislation will define national security in the
terms that I will put before the Committee today. It will cover
counter-terrorism, counter-espionage and counter-proliferation. Those
functions are currently covered by the security services and will be
well known and well understood by the Committee. Again, a judgment has
to be made. We believe that there are circumstances where the ongoing
nature of terrorist activities, and the ongoing need to monitor them,
requires the potential retention of DNA beyond the six-year period, for
a rolling period of two years. That will be authorised by a senior
officer, and the period will be subject to that end date and to further
renewal if the individual is still of interest to the security
services.</div>
<a name="10020477000123"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020477000563"></a>Tom
Brake:</b> Does the Minister of State expect that police
officers will automatically seek a two-year extension, or does he
expect some variation, with officers requesting a six-month, 12-month
or 18-month extension, as the legislation appears to
allow?</div><a name="10020477000124"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020477000564"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> The six-year period is the six-year period. If the
security services and the police, at chief constable and senior officer
level, have an interest in an individual and wish to apply for
retention, that could be for one year, or any period up to a maximum of
two years, by which time a further application would need to be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column261" />Column number: 261</div>made. That is done for a very simple purpose. Let me
quote Sir Hugh Orde from the second sitting of the evidence
sessions:</div>
<a name="10020477000461"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In my
previous world, in Northern Ireland, some very dangerous people were
entirely innocent in law&#151;as in, they were never
convicted&#151;but I was greatly reassured that I had a better
position in terms of keeping the public safe by knowing I had some
information, which, if crimes were committed by those individuals, I
could use to deliver an effective
investigation.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report, Crime
and Security Public Bill Committee, </i>26 January 2010; c. 40,
Q72.]</div><a name="10020477000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
know from my two years as a Minister in Northern Ireland that there
were many people whose DNA it would have been valuable to have retained
for ongoing investigations, and sometimes for historical, cold case
reviews. There are many cold case reviews ongoing in Northern Ireland,
relating to unsolved crimes from the very difficult troubles of the
&#146;70s and &#146;80s. There have been convictions now. The
Enniskillen bombing was the subject of a court case some years ago. In
the end, that did not lead to a particular conviction, but it had to do
with a review of a cold case from 1998 and DNA was involved in the
discussions.</div>
<a name="10020477000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">The chief
officer might well wish to retain the DNA of someone who was convicted
in Northern Ireland of fuel laundering, post-office robbery or bank
robbery, but who, ultimately, might also be associated with a murder,
such as that horrific event in Enniskillen in 1987. The theory is that
in such cases a chief officer could request continued retention,
because there would be an ongoing interest in coming to conclusions.
The retention is renewable; the material is not held in perpetuity,
because the retention has to be renewed under that authority, but there
are concerns about how that would work in practice.</div>
<a name="10020477000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is no
appeal formally, because often the individual would not know about the
retention. They sometimes would not know that the police were
interested in them for counter-terrorism, security or other reasons. I
saw lots of very difficult things in my two years in Northern Ireland.
I can think of numerous examples where information came through on
individuals who were apparently involved in no crime or in low-level
crime, but we knew through Security Service information that they were
engaged in plotting, planning and trying to execute other offences.
Reflecting on the retention, I can see that it could be seen as a
curtailment of civil liberties, but one that is undertaken for the
greater good of the public at
large.</div><a name="10020477000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before
I take interventions, I would like to cover one further point. We want
judicial oversight, as I said in my evidence. The Home Secretary has
said that he is considering whether there should be provision for an
independent reviewer of the legislation, in relation to the national
security provisions, but that is not in the Bill, and we have made no
final decisions. We are seeking oversight. Lord Carlile is undertaking
oversight of the application of section 44 of the Terrorism Act 2000,
and we are considering a similar process for the retention of DNA. We
have not taken a decision yet, but when we do, we will inform the
Committee.</div><a name="10020477000129"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020477000565"></a>Tom
Brake:</b> The Minister of State may not be able to answer, or
perhaps should not answer, this question, but 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column262" />Column number: 262</div>if someone were to make a speculative approach
because they suspected that their DNA was retained, how would that be
handled?</div><a name="10020477000130"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020477000566"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> That takes us into difficult territories, for the
simple reason that for counter-terrorism activity to work, the people
being scrutinised by the counter-terrorism authorities in relation to
potential or actual criminal acts cannot know about that scrutiny. In
my role as Minister for Policing, Crime and Counter-Terrorism, on
numerous occasions I learn of activities that the individuals whom we
are looking at do not know are being undertaken. I cannot give the hon.
Gentleman an assurance that Mr. or Mrs. X would
know that their DNA was being retained for eight years, rather than
six. If we said, &#147;Actually, Mr. X, your DNA is being
retained,&#148; Mr. X would know that we knew that he was
involved in some aspect of terrorism. I am sorry, but that is one of
those rubs where the interests of the majority are put against the
interests of the few.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020477000567"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I understand the difficulty that the Minister
of State is trying to address and the need, at times, for covert
surveillance and the other important work of the security services. In
the light of what he said to the hon. Member for Carshalton and
Wallington, how does he intend to address a request from someone under
proposed new section
64ZM?</div><a name="10020477000462"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;If
a person makes a request to the...chief officer...to be
notified when anything relating to the person is destroyed under any of
sections 64ZA to 64ZJ, the...chief officer...or a person
authorised by the chief officer or on the chief officer&#146;s behalf
must within three months of the request issue the person with a
certificate recording the
destruction.&#148;</div><a name="10020477000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
may require further consideration in Committee, because if someone,
thinking that their DNA profile would be deleted at the end of the
six-year period, were to make a formal request to the chief officer,
some response would be required. Formal notification might have to be
given at that point, under the
clause.</div><a name="10020477000485"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.45

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020477000568"></a>Tom
Brake:</b> Will the hon. Gentleman give
way?</div><a name="10020477000134"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020477000569"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I am intervening on the Minister.
</div><a name="10020477000135"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020477000570"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> I shall look at those issues. I shall happily give
way to the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington, if he
wishes.</div><a name="10020477000136"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020477000571"></a>Tom
Brake:</b> On that point, I am not sure whether I am
misreading the provisions, but clearly new section 64ZN
excludes new section 64ZK, and therefore people would, I assume, not
expect a
response.</div><a name="10020477000137"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020477000572"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> My colleagues and I have heard hon.
Members&#146; comments, and we shall look at the issue and decide
whether we need to provide clarifications in Committee.</div>
<a name="10020477000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">The key thing
is that even the Marper judgment recognised the seriousness of
terrorism and terrorist offences, and a legitimacy in retaining the
relevant data. The hon. Member for Hornchurch acknowledged that this
morning. Any chief officer who authorises retention after six years
must do so in a responsible way that is compatible
with the European convention on human 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column263" />Column number: 263</div>rights, and in a way that relates to any changes in
the national security situation. I do not expect this to happen, but I
should be extremely concerned if an individual whose profile, because
of national security issues, was retained for another 12 months after
the six years, had their profile kept on for a seventh or eighth year
when they were of no more interest to the security services. There are
checks and balances in the system.</div>
<a name="10020477000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall
reflect on the discussions. However, we sometimes need to consider
retaining DNA after the six-year period if there is continuing interest
in an individual from whom the community needs to be protected, and in
defined national security circumstances. That is shown particularly by
Northern Ireland, but also by violent extremism in other forms, not
least Islamist and animal rights extremism and racially motivated
extremist
activity.</div><a name="10020477000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is an overlap between national security and terrorism, but they are not
synonymous. To use the example of animal rights terrorists, there might
not be national security implications, but one of our major concerns
would be terrorist activity. The wording in new sections 64ZK and 64ZN
is deliberate, to ensure that we recognise those instances. I shall
reflect on what is said in Committee, and if clarification is needed,
we can consider whether to table amendments. I hope that hon. Members
understand the need for the clause. I ask the hon. Member for
Hornchurch to withdraw the amendment.</div>
<a name="10020477000141"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020477000573"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I appreciate what the Minister has said. An
important aspect of any such provision is the clarity of the language
used. The Minister has explained the scope of the Government&#146;s
intended interpretation of national security. My residual concern about
not including that clarification in the Bill is that a court would only
in certain limited circumstances refer to <i class="I">Hansard</i> to interpret
legislation, if the language could be interpreted in a particular
way.</div><a name="10020477000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall reflect on what the Minister said, with regard to whether to
draft a definition or simply rely on his statement this afternoon about
the understanding of the breadth of, and intention behind, the term
&#147;national security&#148;. There are understandable concerns,
in the light of some of the highlighted cases, about the distinction
that has been drawn between terrorism and national security. Again, I
understand and shall reflect on what the Minister said about animal
rights terrorism, which may not be a national security issue, and the
need to make that explicit and draw it out. However, in the interests
of reassuring the public about the use of the power and the two-year
retention, we should reflect on the definitional issues, and I am
grateful to the Minister for undertaking to do that.</div>
<a name="10020477000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">The issues of
oversight are also key. I imagine that such a power would be used in
exceptional circumstances; it would not be the norm. The Minister has
said nothing to the contrary, and I would have been concerned if he
had. However, there is a need for clarity on these issues. I respect
what the Minister has said about the work that is still to come on
oversight and his promise to look at the point that I highlighted in
relation to proposed new clause 64ZM on the relevant distinctions that
are drawn in certain circumstances and the requirement to notify about
destruction<i class="I">.</i></div><a name="10020477000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington was right to highlight that
the relevant section is not covered. If someone knew that their DNA had
been 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column264" />Column number: 264</div>retained and a profile had been made, and the
expectation was that it would be deleted after six years, that person
might seek notification under the provisions. So what might the
response need to be? While I accept the point that he raised about the
drafting, I am not sure that the broader issue is addressed. I raise
that to help our consideration of these provisions, because we all want
to get this right. If there are those who would use malign intent
against innocent civilians in this country, we should consider very
carefully all the powers that are available to protect against that. In
the light of the Minister&#146;s comments, I beg to ask leave to
withdraw the
amendment</div><a name="10020477000145"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

footwear.</i></div><a name="10020477000148"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020477000574"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I beg to move amendment 152, in
clause 14, page 38, leave out lines 4 to
16.</div><a name="10020477000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment relates to new section 64ZN, which provides for the use of
any retained material under section 64 of PACE, such as DNA samples and
fingerprints. The definition in section 64 includes materials that
are</div>
<a name="10020477000463"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;taken in
connection with the investigation of an offence with the consent of the
person from whom they were taken&#148;.</div>
<a name="10020477000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">That covers a broad
swathe of materials&#151;not simply DNA or other materials that are
taken by virtue of an arrest power, but those that may have been
volunteered to assist in an
investigation.</div><a name="10020477000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">Proposed
new section 64ZN allows material to be used for national security
reasons, terrorist investigations, the prevention or detection of
crime, the investigation of an offence or identifying a deceased
person. Subsection (3) allows for the material to be
disclosed to any person. It further provides that the definition of
crime includes criminal offences committed outside the UK, which do not
also have to be criminal offences in the UK. That is obviously quite
broad; it would seem to permit the sharing of DNA profiles&#151;or
the DNA samples themselves, before they are required to be
destroyed&#151;with foreign law enforcement agencies, whether in the
EU or elsewhere, with regard to something that was not a crime in this
country and that might relate to the national security of a foreign
country. That may or may not be
appropriate.</div><a name="10020477000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">Certainly,
there are significant issues around the concept of dual criminality.
Let us look at extradition: normally, the broad principle is that, for
extradition to take place, the actions would have to amount to a
criminal offence in both jurisdictions. That is not reflected in the
drafting here. A request for information could, seemingly, be made by
any country in the world when someone is suspected of being involved in
a crime there, even though those actions are not regarded as criminal
or a breach of the law in this country.</div>
<a name="10020477000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">Why does
there appear to be that imbalance in the drafting? How would the power
be used? The language appears to be broad enough to cover the sort of
scenario that I have mentioned. It will be interesting to hear the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column265" />Column number: 265</div>Minister&#146;s response. He may say, &#147;That
is not our intention. There will be protocols that will need to be
framed within bilateral treaties or other regulations.&#148; At the
very least, it would be beneficial to put that on the record, so that
we can understand more effectively the sharing power in the
context of the use of retained material. In principle, we are talking
about genetic material&#151;the sample provided. The
Government&#146;s desire to destroy samples within six months shows
that they have rightly understood the concerns about misuse and the
need to keep information secure.</div>
<a name="10020477000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">Proposed new
clause 64ZN would appear to allow material to be shared with someone
else. Is that the intention? What circumstances are contemplated? What
protocols would the Government adopt with foreign Governments for the
use of the power? Is it intended that the situation would be captured
by, for example, the existing mutual assistance regime? It may well be
that it is. Is the power much broader than that in its scope and
application?</div>
<a name="10020477000155"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020477000575"></a>Tom
Brake:</b> I can see where the hon. Gentleman is going.
Presumably, he would like some assurances that if the Iranian
authorities, for instance, sought an exchange after a demonstration in
Tehran, because they thought there might be DNA material in the UK, the
Government would not comply.</div>
<a name="10020477000156"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020477000576"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> It is pushing the language to its furthest
degree, but, in isolation, the Bill would appear to allow that type of
sharing. It would be constrained by treaty obligations and other mutual
assurance, but it would be helpful to state that formally in relation
to these provisions, so that everybody is clear about the intentions
and purposes behind the clause on the sharing of such
material.</div>
<a name="10020477000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are again
getting into the issue of data security. Close and careful examination
needs to be given to sharing data with somebody else. We may have
designed systems to keep data safe and secure that are robust and
cannot be hacked into, and that ensure that insiders in an organisation
could not misapply their authority to use the material wholly
inappropriately. Consideration needs to be given to whether those
standards would be applied by the person with whom the information is
being shared.</div>
<a name="10020477000158"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020477000577"></a>Tom
Brake:</b> I assume that the hon. Gentleman would also like
reassurance that if a request came in it could not be of a scale that
would allow another Government to trawl. It would have to be a specific
request for DNA relating to one individual. If it were much wider, what
safeguards would there be to prevent that Government from using that
much wider sample for other
purposes?</div><a name="10020477000486"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2
pm</div><a name="10020477000159"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020477000578"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> It is a question of getting clarification,
and I have fastened on that matter especially because it applies to
information that is being volunteered. We are not necessarily talking
about someone who has been arrested in relation to a crime; the
information is simply being volunteered by someone to assist with an
investigation. The provision seems to spill over into that sort of
material as well. It has a very broad ambit, which goes beyond some of
our earlier debates. Volunteered 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column266" />Column number: 266</div>information can be destroyed and consent can be
withdrawn, but the provisions would be operative until consent was
withdrawn. It is important to understand the intention because we are
talking about sensitive material&#151;someone&#146;s genetic
coding&#151;in the DNA sample provided. There seem to be no
safeguards or oversight in relation to that, and I have tabled a
further amendment that speaks to my concern. It would be helpful to
gain clarification on the intent of the provision, how it will be used
and what safeguards and other measures are in place to address some of
the concerns that might
arise.</div><a name="10020477000160"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020477000579"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> The essential impact of the amendment would be to
prevent the sharing of data with authorities outside the areas covered
by the Bill&#151;England and Wales. Our colleague authorities in
Scotland and Northern Ireland would not be able to access DNA under a
data-sharing arrangement. In the UK context, many investigations in
Scotland have an impact on England and vice versa, and similarly with
Northern
Ireland.</div><a name="10020477000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman has raised some key issues, however, about security and
safety. First and foremost, I am working with my hon. Friend the
Under-Secretary of State on a range of issues that follow from the
Pr1/4m convention, which was signed on 27 May 2005 by a number of
European nation partners, and adopted in June 2008 after the Council
decision that implemented the agreement. That would effectively mean
that it will increasingly be possible to look at cross-border
agreements on tackling serious crime, drugs, trafficking and a whole
range of key issues, in the fight against not just terrorism but
cross-border crime and illegal immigration. Crime is not individual
nation-orientated. We regularly receive searches against a profile or a
crime scene for a DNA sample from foreign law enforcement agencies, and
they are dealt with through Interpol or the United Kingdom National
Central Bureau in the Serious Organised Crime Agency, which falls under
my hon. Friend&#146;s jurisdiction. That body complies with requests
when it deems them necessary, using the partnership criteria to help to
reduce crime. That is a fair and useful assessment of the
issues.</div><a name="10020477000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
situation will certainly occur with countries outside the EU. We have
mutual legal assistance treaties or bilateral agreements with a number
of countries, on sharing information to help reduce crime and make
convictions. Two countries with which we currently have mutual legal
assistance treaties are the United States of America and Canada. Under
the proposed legislation, individuals&#146; data will be shared with
other countries in the United Kingdom, in Europe and elsewhere.
However, like all the provisions, it is meant to ensure that we crack
down on crime, bring criminals to justice, give justice to victims and
co-operate with partner countries in Europe and elsewhere to achieve
those
objectives.</div><a name="10020477000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope the amendment is simply for clarification. If I accepted it, we
would not be able to share information with Scotland, Northern Ireland,
Europe or mutual legal assistance countries outside Europe. That is
important in the fight against crime, so I ask the hon. Gentleman to
withdraw his amendment.</div>

that if the measure is passed, in cases outside Europe or the US and
Canada, the Government would have to come to an agreement with each
individual country about whether the provisions
applied?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column267" />Column number: 267</div><a name="10020477000165"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020477000581"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> Yes. We already have mutual legal assistance or
bilateral agreements with a range of countries on crime-fighting
measures. I gave the examples of the USA and Canada, but there are
others. Such arrangements are negotiated by Governments, signed by
Governments and open to public scrutiny, and they can be asked about in
the House of Commons. Ultimately, they will form the basis for the
sharing of information. Self-evidently, if we do not have an agreement
with a country, we will not share information with
it.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020477000582"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I hear what the Minister says. The amendment
was intended as a probing amendment to tease out some of the detail and
the thought behind the clause and how it would be used.</div>
<a name="10020477000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, I
have two remaining concerns, notwithstanding what the Minister said.
The first involves the dual criminality point and the fact that the
clause as drafted does not require the offence to be recognised as such
in both jurisdictions. The second relates to materials that have been
volunteered. If someone simply volunteers information without being
arrested, that will also be captured by the provisions on sharing
relevant materials.</div>
<a name="10020477000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">I accept that
some sharing might be appropriate and required, under certain
constraints. The Minister discussed the Scottish authorities and some
European partners, and I hope that we will discuss the detail of the
Pr1/4m treaty and its potential implications shortly. How will the
provisions be constrained? What safeguards will provide data
protection, and what checks will the Government undertake before
enabling the power to be used in the way described?</div>
<a name="10020477000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will not
press my amendment to a vote, but those concerns remain, although I
heard what the Minister said. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

Bill.</div>
<a name="10020477000172"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020477000583"></a>The
Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to consider
clause 15 stand part.</div>
<a name="10020477000173"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020477000584"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> We have gone through a significant amount of
detail relating to the clause, so I do not intend to repeat it, as that
would not be in the Committee&#146;s interests. However, I would like
to raise with the Minister a few additional points for
clarification.</div>
<a name="10020477000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">The first
relates to the rights of challenge to retention, which the Minister
alluded to during a previous debate. Currently, individuals who seek to
have the police remove their DNA records must apply to individual chief
constables. Under current ACPO guidance, that will happen only in
exceptional circumstances. Obviously, a uniform approach is not being
applied. Some police forces refuse to remove any records once a case is
closed, while others refuse more than four in five records. The result
is that there is a big difference depending simply on the area of the
country where someone lives.</div>
<a name="10020477000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some freedom
of information requests to police forces have highlighted that stark
difference between forces. Results provided to us show that in south
Yorkshire, which has the highest request success rate, 83 per cent. of
requests are granted, whereas some forces refuse to remove any profiles
at all. It is very much a lottery, in terms of which approach is taken
by a force.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column268" />Column number: 268</div><a name="10020477000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is a matter of concern that where someone lives should affect their
ability to have their DNA information removed from the record, and what
the scope and ambit of that ability would be. The issue was raised by
the Home Secretary in his statement in November 2009, when he
said:</div>
<a name="10020477000464"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Currently,
chief officers may consider the exceptional destruction of DNA and
fingerprints under the exceptional case procedure. We propose to
introduce greater transparency by setting out in statute more clearly
defined criteria where deletion would be appropriate. This should bring
greater clarity to the public and also the
police.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report</i>, 11 November 2009; Vol.
499, c.
27WS.]</div><a name="10020477000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is
not currently reflected in the Bill at all, as far as I can see. The
Government may be giving the issue further consideration and, as the
Minister of State told us this afternoon, a concept of judicial
oversight may be applied in relation to challenges and requests to have
information removed.</div>
<a name="10020477000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, it
seems odd that there is nothing at all in that regard on the face of
the Bill. Even if one were not seeking the clarification of the
judicial oversight that the Minister of State referred to, there are
not the requirements, procedures or relevant steps that the Home
Secretary highlighted in his initial statement. I would like to
understand why that is the case. I would like to know if it is the
Government&#146;s intention to fulfil the ideas behind the Bill as
set out in the Home Secretary&#146;s comments last November. Will
that intention be reflected in the Bill and, if so, when will the
Government introduce amendments or proposals to give it
effect?</div>
<a name="10020477000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">Regarding the
whole approach on records and DNA material, we also have the issue of
the quality of the information that is retained. The Government said
very clearly&#151;they highlighted their case and made it
strongly&#151;that the issue is about bringing criminals to justice.
I share that intent and the principle behind it. Obviously, however,
there have been errors in the past and I would be grateful if the
Minister of State could confirm that in August 2007, there were more
than 500,000 records with wrongly recorded or incorrectly spelled names
and that in May 2007, 26,200 DNA records were not loaded, with the
result that there were 183 undetected crimes. Can he confirm that that
information is
correct?</div><a name="10020477000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
appreciate that remedial action has been taken by the National Policing
Improvement Agency to address accuracy, but it will clearly continue to
be an issue. Can the Minister of State tell us the measures that he
intends to put in place to maintain the quality and accuracy of
information in records on the national DNA database, to ensure that
errors are avoided and crimes can be properly detected as a consequence
of accurately recorded
information?</div><a name="10020477000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">Taking
a broader perspective, there is a difference between our party and the
Government. Obviously, we have put on record our differing views and we
will see how the issue develops. At the very least, I look forward to
the Minister&#146;s response to the two specific points he may be
able to help me with, even if he is not able to help on the broader
approach and on our differences and disagreement on relevant aspects
and retention
periods.</div><a name="10020477000487"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.15

McIsaac</b> (Cleethorpes) (Lab): I am pleased that the
Opposition amendments have not been accepted. I fear that had they been
accepted, fewer criminals 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column269" />Column number: 269</div>would be brought to justice. There is a flipside to
the argument. We have been focusing on people being apprehended for
crimes, but DNA and a robust DNA database can also clear people of
crimes. It gives an additional tool for the police and authorities to
eliminate people from their inquiries. I do not think that one
Opposition Member touched on that aspect of having a DNA
database.</div><a name="10020477000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Hornchurch has concentrated a lot on Scotland. As I
pointed out during an intervention, the Scottish legal system is
completely different from the English one in that there are three
possible verdicts. Being found not guilty in Scotland is different from
being found not guilty in England, because cases in Scotland can be
deemed not proven. I would hazard a guess that if that verdict was
available to juries in the English system, many cases in which people
are currently found not guilty would in fact be not
proven.</div><a name="10020477000184"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10020477000586"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Simon Burns</b> (West Chelmsford) (Con): The hon. Lady said
that there is a considerable difference between being found not guilty
in Scotland and being found not guilty in England. I do not understand
that. I assume that if one is found not guilty in Scotland, it is
identical to being found not guilty in England. However, if a jury has
a problem making its mind up, it can decide that the case is not
proven, which is totally different from being found not
guilty.</div><a name="10020477000185"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020477000587"></a>Shona
McIsaac:</b> I think I understand where the hon. Gentleman is
coming from. However, a couple of years ago, I spent a large part of
the summer recess on jury service and the cases I had to decide upon
were serious sexual offences. There were two separate and serious
cases&#151;both harrowing&#151;in which the accused were found not
guilty, but as I know the Scottish legal system, I hazard a
guess&#151;</div><a name="10020477000186"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020477000588"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. With utmost respect to all members of the
Committee and to the hon. Lady in particular, I do not want the debate
to go down the path of a comparative debate on the Scottish and English
systems. Unless the Minister tells me differently, the Bill relates
specifically to England and Wales, so I would prefer to avoid the
comparisons that are
surfacing.</div><a name="10020477000187"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020477000589"></a>Shona
McIsaac:</b> I totally accept that, Mr. Cook.
However, in mitigation, I was prompted to mention Scotland because the
Opposition seem to rely on the Scottish system so much to justify their
amendments. A robust DNA database is about justice for the victims of
serious crimes. Having been a member of a jury hearing the gruesome
details of such crimes, I am pleased that we have a DNA database and
that the DNA of those found not guilty of those crimes is still in the
system.</div><a name="10020477000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">All
the evidence relating to those arrested at a young age for sexual
offences suggests that by their nature sexual offences tend to escalate
over subsequent years. Patterns of sexual offending occur. That is why
we must keep DNA records for the length of time the Government are
suggesting. With all respect to the Liberal Democrats, I would be
horrified to think, in the light of the evidence I heard in court, that
no DNA record was kept of the crimes those people had
committed.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column270" />Column number: 270</div><a name="10020477000189"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020477000590"></a>Tom
Brake:</b> I shall not go over ground already extensively
covered. We have had an in-depth discussion about some of the
fundamental principles around DNA retention. Clearly, there are
fundamental differences of opinion about how best to address the issue.
We could possibly trade insults about whose crime policy is the most
effective at tackling crime. In my view, spending money on identity
cards is not as effective as spending money on police officers, but
that is the decision the Government have taken.</div>
<a name="10020477000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">I asked in
the Home Affairs Committee whether there were any studies of the
cost-effectiveness of the national DNA database as a tool to prevent
and detect crime. In a letter, the Under-Secretary of State for the
Home Department
answered,</div><a name="10020477000465"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Having
looked into this issue, we are not aware of any independent
cost/benefit analysis ever being commissioned on the effectiveness of
the
NDNAD.&#148;</div><a name="10020477000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
we want to trade insults about whose crime policy is the most
effective, I will pray in aid what that Minister said about the
national DNA database.</div>
<a name="10020477000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope the
Minister of State will respond to the point made by the hon. Member for
Hornchurch about the postcode lottery for people who want their DNA
deleted for exceptional reasons. We are strong supporters of police
operational independence in each force area when it comes to how, where
and in what numbers they deploy officers and what their local
priorities are. It is, however, difficult to see why police forces
require different approaches to deleting DNA from the database in
exceptional circumstances. I hope we can get some response from the
Minister on that point. It is clearly of great concern to people up and
down the country, when they see different percentages of people being
successful, or not, at having their DNA removed from the database when
exceptional circumstances
apply.</div><a name="10020477000193"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020477000591"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> We have had a long debate about clause
14 but I maintain the arguments I put before: clause 14 as constituted
is a useful tool in the protection of British citizens against crime;
is proportionate, in line with European judgments; and is an effective
way of bringing individuals to justice. By deleting clause 14, we will
delete the option to retain DNA of convicted and innocent people for a
period of six years. I hope that the hon. Member for Carshalton and
Wallington will not be voting to do that. He has raised some important
points and this remains an important issue for me.</div>
<a name="10020477000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman raised criticisms of the clause and its possible operation in
practice. Abdul Azad was arrested for violent disorder in a Birmingham
home in February 2005 and although he was released without charge, a
DNA sample was taken from him. Some time after that, a stranger rape
occurred in Stafford, 25 miles away. Whatever the human rights
considerations, thanks to DNA evidence taken when he had not been
charged, he was found guilty of that stranger rape and is now serving
six years in prison for sexual assault. If I were the victim of
Mr. Azad, I would sing hallelujah for the DNA database at
the top of my voice. I say to the hon. Gentleman that that is one of
many cases that I could cite, as could my hon. Friend the
Under-Secretary of State. We could fill the next 45 minutes giving
examples of individuals who are in prison because the DNA database has
been operational&#151;but we will not do so, Mr.
Cook.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column271" />Column number: 271</div><a name="10020477000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have had a very good debate. I hope that during the course of the
debate the Committee has sensed that I feel passionately, as does my
hon. Friend the Member for Cleethorpes, that we are in the business of
bringing justice to victims of crime. We are in the business of putting
bad people away for crimes that they have committed. If the DNA
database helps us do that, proportionately and in line with European
judgments, then we should do so.</div>
<a name="10020477000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is not
just guilty people that we are putting away as a result of the DNA
database. As my hon. Friend mentioned, there are occasions when
innocent people are not put in prison because of the database. I cannot
name the individuals involved, because we have not yet had permission
to do so, but in 2007 a British male&#151;call him male A&#151;was
arrested for criminal damage and released without charge. His DNA was
taken and loaded on to the database. Some time later an allegation of
rape was made against another male&#151;male B&#151;who was
arrested, charged and remanded in custody based on that allegation of
rape. Samples from the crime scene were sent to the national database
for matching. The samples from male B, who was alleged by the
individual to have committed the rape, was found not to match. The
crime scene samples matched with male A and he was subsequently
convicted; male B was released. It is not just about ensuring that the
guilty go to prison. Sometimes, as my hon. Friend pointed out, it is
about ensuring that the innocent do
not.</div><a name="10020477000197"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10020477000592"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Douglas Hogg</b> (Sleaford and North Hykeham) (Con): I rise to
reinforce the Minister&#146;s point. There have been one or two cases
in the Court of Appeal where convictions were quashed many years after
the date of conviction because the DNA evidence established that the
person convicted many years before was in fact not
guilty.</div>
<a name="10020477000198"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020477000593"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> There are a number of points to make on that, but
I go back to what Sir Hugh Orde said in his evidence to the Committee.
He said that the DNA database puts an individual in a place and at a
time, and they have to do some explaining. The jury will look at that
information, look at the explanation and determine whether they were in
that place for purposes of criminal intent. The debate on clause 14 is
about the proportionality of the Government proposal and its compliance
with human rights law. I believe that what we have proposed complies
with human rights law, is proportional, and that the alternatives that
we have debated and rejected so far would not be appropriate.</div>
<a name="10020477000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
still important points to discuss. We need to ensure that we have the
consistency that the hon. Member for Hornchurch mentioned. We are
working with ACPO to develop guidance in light of the new policy and,
in particular, to improve consistency in the operation of the procedure
to delete profiles ahead of the normal retention period, in certain
circumstances. We will bring forward that guidance with ACPO shortly,
subject to the completion of the Bill&#146;s passage through both
Houses of
Parliament.</div><a name="10020477000200"></a>

Brokenshire:</b> The Minister of State says that he is
developing guidance on the removal of DNA profiles from the system.
However, the Home Secretary said that it would in essence be put into
statute. Why has there been a change of approach on

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020477000595"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> It may well be that the guidance ultimately has
statutory backing. Often, guidance is given to chief police officers
that is of such importance that it has statutory backing that they are
minded to support, rather than voluntary guidance and operation
guidance. We are currently working on that and we will bring forward
proposals
shortly.</div><a name="10020477000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Hornchurch mentioned a number of figures in relation to
his concerns, but neither I nor my officials recognise those figures.
We work continuously with the National Police Improvement Agency to
ensure that police forces and forensic science provide accurate data
for the database. I will not be complacent. We need to ensure that the
database is as near perfect as possible as a major crime-fighting tool,
and we will continue to work on
that.</div><a name="10020477000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are safeguards built into the proposed legislation. In new section 64ZI
of PACE subsections (5)(a) to (d) list the criteria that chief
constables must apply to ensure as much standardisation as possible
across the country. Samples must be destroyed immediately if it appears
to the chief officer that the arrest or the taking of fingerprints was
unlawful, the arrest was based on mistaken identity, or circumstances
relating to the arrest mean that it is appropriate to destroy the
material. There are a number of such references in the Bill. We want to
ensure that there is guidance in due course and that we help to support
that consistency, which is important if we are to avoid a postcode DNA
lottery.</div><a name="10020477000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
Mr. Deputy Speaker&#151;I have said Mr. Deputy
Speaker again. I apologise Mr. Cook, it has been a long
week, all of which I have spent in Committee or on the Floor of the

should compare our crime policies. DNA is an important tool. That
should be coupled with the fact that every member of the Committee has
more police officers and more resources in policing in their
constituencies than ever before. We have presided over record falls in
crime&#151;8 per cent.&#151;and record numbers of police. I will
keep to the clause under debate, Mr. Cook, because I respect
your chairmanship and your integrity in these matters, but I am
responding to the debate. All of that is of no use if we allow people
to get away with crimes because we do not have an effective database
that is proportionate on the lines of the Europe decision. That is what

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020477000626"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> The amendments relate to the introduction of
regimes for the destruction of fingerprints and DNA material.
Amendments 39 to 44 cover materials subject to the Terrorism Act 2000
and correct drafting errors in the Bill&#151;sadly, it does
occasionally happen. New clauses 19 to 21 relate to the same subject:
the applicability of the proposed regimes for the retention,
destruction and use of relevant physical data and DNA material in
Scotland under the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995,
the Terrorism Act 2000 and the Counter-Terrorism Act 2008. The new
clauses deal with the extension of the scheme to samples taken in
Scotland, which it was not possible to achieve before we introduced the
Bill.</div><a name="10020477000261"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020477000627"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> The Minister has explained that the
amendments extend the ambit to Scotland. It would be helpful to have
confirmation on the record that the Government discussed the provisions
with the Scottish Government. What was the nature of those
arrangements?</div><a name="10020477000262"></a>

is a testing amendment to gain clarity. The clause deals with the
destruction of material taken before the commencement of the Bill and
provides that various DNA profiles and other records will be destroyed.
I imagine that that is in part to reflect the broader intent behind
certain other provisions relating to items being destroyed within six
months. I wish to test the Minister on the provision in clause 19 to
ensure that it is clearly understood that the order-making power that
he seeks is intended to give effect to equivalent provisions. In other
words, I hope that it is not intended to extend or provide a different
regime than that expressed by the Bill in relation to samples that may
be taken after it comes into force. If that were the case, the negative
procedure would not be appropriate, so the amendment seeks that
confirmation and clarity. The clause introduces some standardisation
between the period before and after the Bill comes into
force.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020477000675"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> I hope I can provide the clarity that the hon.
Gentleman seeks. If we accepted the amendment, we would have to use the
affirmative procedure. I assure him on the points that he has made. The
Bill suggests the negative procedure, which will give more flexibility
than an affirmative one, which is a stringent form of parliamentary
scrutiny that would be unnecessary in the
circumstances.</div><a name="10020477000339"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020477000676"></a>Mr.
Burns:</b> Can the Minister define flexibility and the need
for it? In opposition, the Labour Members usually very keen on the
affirmative rather than negative procedure, and, since we have been in
opposition, we have been extremely keen on the affirmative procedure.
However, I have never heard a Minister of any party talk about
flexibility.</div><a name="10020477000340"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020477000677"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> In the Bill, we have indicated that the negative
procedure is to be used. The amendment would allow for the affirmative
procedure, but we believe that the negative procedure is better.
However, on matters unrelated to the issue under discussion, the
negative and/or the affirmative procedure can be used in a range of
circumstances. As a Minister, I have proposed use of both procedures.
We wish to look at the matters in a flexible way and the Bill states
that the negative procedure should be used.</div>
<a name="10020477000341"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will put on
record the intention to use the power to apply the same regime to
existing DNA profiles as to those taken after the Bill becomes law. It
is a clear matter. There is parliamentary scrutiny&#151;that is the
key point. If either the hon. Member for Hornchurch or the hon. Member
for West Chelmsford is not happy with a negative resolution on a
particular matter then, as I recall from my 18 years in the House, they
can move that it become an affirmative resolution. That can be done.
That is what I mean by flexibility. It can be done under parliamentary
process.</div><a name="10020477000342"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020477000681"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> We now come on to the oversight of the
national DNA database by its strategy board. The clause
states:</div><a name="10020477000467"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;(1)
The Secretary of State must make arrangements for a National DNA
Database Strategy Board to oversee the operation of the National DNA
database.</div>

the governance rules of the National DNA Database Strategy Board,
and</div>
<a name="10020477000470"></a><div class="hs_brev">(b) the
reporting requirements of the
Board.&#148;</div><a name="10020477000352"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments seek to push that a little further.</div>
<a name="10020477000353"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
merely states that there will be oversight of the operation, but it is
a question of being specific and gaining clarity about what that means.
It should mean that the board will report on the effectiveness of the
operation of the national DNA database and that it will make
recommendations to the Secretary of State or to Parliament on that.
That would seem to be a fairly key aspect of the work. It seems
appropriate to specify that clearly in the Bill, rather than the
Secretary of State having the flexibility to publish governance rules
without necessarily saying what they are intended to relate to. The
process would appear to be internally driven, and to relate to the
governance of the board, rather than it being about expounding,
explaining and putting in statute the rights of the national DNA
database strategy board itself.</div>
<a name="10020477000354"></a><div class="hs_Para">If it is not
intended to specify in the Bill that the board will make
recommendations on the operation of the national DNA database and its
effectiveness what is the purpose of the board? There is also no
indication as to the board&#146;s membership, its breadth, whether
there will be certain qualifications or whether it is intended to have
representation from particular organisations. Again, it would be
helpful to have those intentions set out, even if it is in some form of
code or guidance that sits alongside the Bill. I hope that the Minister
can tell us more about
that.</div><a name="10020477000355"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is also the issue of the relationship between the board and the
National Policing Improvement Agency, which effectively manages the
day-to-day operation of the national DNA database. I presume that the
NPIA makes reports and recommendations. What is its interrelationship
with the strategy board intended to be? Do the Government intend that
there should be some sort of framework or protocol between the NPIA and
the national DNA database strategy board, regarding operational
effectiveness and relative roles and responsibility relating to the
analysis, examination and provision of data and information? That has
been a sensitive issue, as we have seen from the nature of the debates
in Committee
today.</div><a name="10020477000356"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
should be some mechanism to facilitate consideration and debate within
Parliament on the effectiveness and the operation of the national DNA
database. If reports are produced by the board, they 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column281" />Column number: 281</div>should not be simply sent to the Secretary of State. There should be a
role for Parliament and feedback provided, so that we are clear about
the board&#146;s proposals, recommendations and insights. We could
reflect on those in Parliament and decide whether changes needed to be
made and whether any other steps might be
required.</div><a name="10020477000357"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020477000682"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> My hon. Friend makes an interesting point. May I
make a suggestion? One could contemplate the board always having to
send its reports to the Select Committee on Home Affairs, or perhaps
the Justice Committee. That would enable that Committee to reflect on
whether it wanted to scrutinise more carefully. That is a suggestion
that the Minister might care to
consider.</div><a name="10020477000358"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020477000683"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> My right hon. and learned Friend makes a
helpful point. As he will probably be aware, the Home Affairs Committee
is currently undertaking an inquiry into the retention of DNA data. It
would certainly facilitate that sort of discussion and scrutiny if the
recommendations or reports of the board were forwarded in that way. It
is a question of providing something practical, ensuring that
Parliament is kept in the loop, and ensuring that appropriate scrutiny
is applied to any recommendations that come from the
board.</div><a name="10020477000359"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given
the debate that we had on a preceding amendment about the Government
sharing data with the Scottish authority and other bodies or agencies,
we should be clear that the oversight should apply equally to how that
power is used, for the reasons and concerns that I set out in the
preceding debate. The Minister may argue that the oversight of the
national DNA database will be broad enough to cover that sort of
arrangement. However, if there is sharing, the practical implications
and effects need to be kept under close review, because of the
sensitive nature of the information and the need to keep that data
secure and protected from misuse.</div>
<a name="10020477000360"></a><div class="hs_Para">The sharing
of data more widely on an international basis leads to mention of the
Pr1/4m treaty, which the Minister referred to in the preceding
debate. That treaty provides for the sharing of data on the national
DNA database with EU partners. The Minister mentioned that the treaty
had come into effect and that there is, therefore, a sharing of
fingerprint, DNA and vehicle registration data by law enforcement
authorities across the EU. The treaty permits data to be transmitted
and searched through a member state&#146;s national
database.</div><a name="10020477000361"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
its report on the Pr1/4m treaty before it came into effect, the
House of Lords European Union Committee
noted:</div><a name="10020477000471"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
threshold for holding DNA profiles on the United Kingdom DNA database
is far lower than in any other Member State, and the proportion of the
population on the database correspondingly far
higher.&#148;</div><a name="10020477000362"></a><div class="hs_Para">According
to evidence presented to that Committee, the UK DNA database is half as
large again as all the other member states&#146; databases put
together; that was how the House of Lords Committee described it. That
suggests how significant the size of the UK national DNA database is,
compared to those of other EU nation states that are developing
databases. The House of Lords Committee raised some concerns about that
and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column282" />Column number: 282</div>the possible implications for sharing information. That is why I tabled
my probing amendment about overseeing data
sharing.</div><a name="10020477000490"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3
pm</div>
<a name="10020477000363"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the
Minister has said, a wide range of different approaches are taken in
other EU countries, but a significant number retain DNA only for very
restricted periods, and in a much more restricted way than happens
here. In the rest of the EU, DNA data are generally obtained and kept
only in serious crimes. In the UK, those data can be retained for all
recordable offences, which can be relatively minor compared to the
offences that we are talking about in other EU countries. That is
likely to lead to the United Kingdom engaging more widely in giving DNA
data to our EU partners, rather than the data going in the other
direction&#151;simply because of the size of our database. That point
was made by the House of Lords European Union Committee. It
stated:</div><a name="10020477000472"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Officials
of a country which holds DNA data only for serious crimes will
inevitably start with the presumption that DNA data are held in the
United Kingdom for the same purpose, and perhaps put at risk those
whose DNA is held because they have committed only a minor crime, or
perhaps no crime at
all.&#148;</div><a name="10020477000364"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
would be interesting to know whether the Minister accepts the point
that the Committee made. It seemed to highlight the possibly one-sided
nature of the arrangement between an EU country with DNA records only
of those who have committed serious crimes, and the UK, with the DNA
data of those who may have committed relatively minor offences. There
is a potential imbalance, with implications arising from the different
thresholds applied across the EU, and from the size of the
database.</div><a name="10020477000365"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
led the House of Lords Committee to make the following
recommendation:</div><a name="10020477000473"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
threshold for holding DNA profiles on the United Kingdom DNA database
is far lower than in any other Member State, and the proportion of the
population on the database correspondingly far higher. The Government
should as a matter of urgency examine the implications of DNA exchanges
for those on the United Kingdom
database.&#148;</div><a name="10020477000366"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
would be interesting to hear whether the Government have examined that
issue, as the Lords Committee argued it should. Again, the issue is the
potential implications of the sharing of data for costs and for law
enforcement.</div>
<a name="10020477000367"></a><div class="hs_Para">I recognise
that there may be justifications for sharing the data, but the issue is
the surrounding constraints and whether there will be a resource
implication for this country, simply because of the rolling out of the
Pr1/4m treaty. Will the Minister say how the introduction of the
Pr1/4m treaty is progressing for the UK, and set out the practical
implications to date? Will he confirm that all EU member states will
have automatic access to Britain&#146;s DNA database? I looked at the
reply given to the European Union Committee by the then Minister, the
right hon. Member for Enfield, North (Joan
Ryan):</div><a name="10020477000474"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
UK (as with other Member States) will decide which profiles on the
national database should be exposed to search requests from other
member states. There need be no assumption that all profiles would be
searched routinely under Pr1/4m...The results of any search
request will be reported to the other member state on a &#145;hit no
hit&#146; basis. Confirmation of the profile match may be provided,
but no details which would provide the name or other personal details
of the individual would be provided.&#148;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column283" />Column number: 283</div><a name="10020477000368"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would like confirmation of whether that statement on the application of
the Pr1/4m treaty remains the case today. What has been the
experience to date in respect of requests for the sharing of
information on the national DNA database, as a consequence of any
implementation on a hit-or-no-hit basis? What is the thought process on
that? I hope that the Minister will respond specifically on the
intended use and operation of the
treaty.</div><a name="10020477000369"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
reply from the right hon. Member for Enfield, North, to the European
Union Committee seemed to state that the operation of the Pr1/4m
treaty and those data sharing requirements would have cost implications
for the
UK:</div><a name="10020477000475"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Government believes that we have a suitable estimate of the start up
costs of &#163;31 million. This includes running costs for the first
year, which we have considered to be around &#163;2.5 million. We
must however clarify that this is an estimate, and taking into account
the changing nature of technology and the negotiation of the
implementing agreement this is subject to
change.&#148;</div><a name="10020477000370"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
would help if the Minister could provide some further indication of
what the costs might be, and whether there has been any change in
relation to that statement. What has the approach been, and what will
it be, in relation to data sharing with our EU partners in the context
of the Pr1/4m treaty, and has the way in which data sharing will
work been
examined?</div><a name="10020477000371"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020477000684"></a>Tom
Brake:</b> Members will be pleased to hear that I shall be
brief. I simply wish to support amendment 29, which would amend clause
20 to read: &#147;The Secretary of State must make arrangements for a
National DNA Database Strategy Board to oversee the operation of the
National DNA Database to report on its effectiveness and to make
recommendations on the use of the DNA profiles.&#148; I particularly
commend the amendment to the Minister because it makes it very clear
that one of the strategy board outputs will be to document the
effectiveness, and presumably the cost-benefit, of the national
database. That would presumably enable the Minister, the next time the
question is posed once the strategy board is up and running, to
demonstrate that the DNA database is a cost-effective way of tackling
crime.</div><a name="10020477000372"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020477000685"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department
(Mr. Alan Campbell):</b> In discussions that the
hon. Gentleman has had with victims or their families in cases that
have been cleared up with the use of DNA, have they said that while
they welcome the fact that the case was solved, they wonder whether it
was good value for
money?</div><a name="10020477000373"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020477000686"></a>Tom
Brake:</b> I thank the Minister for that intervention. As I
said earlier, we could have an exchange across the Committee about the
effectiveness or otherwise of different measures, but Mr.
Cook would not allow
that.</div><a name="10020477000374"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clearly,
the Minister is right that DNA is effective in certain cases, but other
measures are effective as well. I have previously argued that giving
police officers more training on dealing with rape cases may equally be
a cost-effective way of tackling crime&#151;potentially more
cost-effective than providing more police officers or introducing
preventive measures. We can have that debate, but it is clearly beyond
the remit of what we are discussing today. I am happy for it to go on
the record that I acknowledge that DNA clearly is of great assistance
in many cases. However, that does not do away with the necessity for
something like the strategy board to consider exactly how effective the
DNA database is.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column284" />Column number: 284</div><a name="10020477000375"></a><div class="hs_Para">Members know
of many examples. The hon. Member for Hammersmith and Fulham
(Mr. Hands) gave evidence to the Home Affairs Committee
about the fact that many of his elderly relatives had their DNA taken
in relation to a murder in which they were clearly very unlikely to
have been involved in any shape or form. It is perfectly legitimate to
ask questions about whether, in such cases, we should send police
officers to another part of the country to collect DNA from people who
are clearly not implicated in a murder&#151;elderly, female, senior
citizens.</div>
<a name="10020477000376"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
the Under-Secretary will acknowledge that we should be able to discuss
these matters without throwing allegations across the Committee about
people being soft on crime, which is what has been said covertly, if
not overtly.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020477000687"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> I shall confine myself exactly to the language and
contents of clause 20; I am sure that you will be pleased by that,
Mr. Cook. There are only three points that I want to raise.
The documents contemplated by the clause fall into two classes, which I
shall deal with separately: the governance rules and the reporting
requirements. I suspect that &#147;reporting requirements&#148;
mean reports.</div>
<a name="10020477000378"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would like
the Under-Secretary to tell me what &#147;governance rules&#148;
means. Governance could mean at least two things, maybe more. It could
be concerned exclusively with the housekeeping arrangements of the
board, and no more than that, by which I mean pay and rations, staffing
and the like, or it could mean policy. My hon. Friend the Member for
Hornchurch alluded to the areas where policy issues could arise; for
example, there is the issue of data exchange, such as that between EU
countries and ourselves. Clearly, the functions of the board will be
confined to the lawful functions provided for by the Bill, if enacted,
but it may be that the board could implement policy at its
discretion&#151;policy that the Act will not regulate. We are
entitled to know whether the phrase &#147;governance rules&#148; in
fact extends to the making of policy, or whether it just refers to
internal regulations&#151;pay and rations and the like.</div>
<a name="10020477000379"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us
assume, for the moment, that the rules extend to policy. They may do,
for example on the exchange of information. The Minister of State is
nodding. That is good of him&#151;I had better develop this bit of my
argument now. He has confirmed that the rules extend to policy. That is
important, because if they were simply about pay and rations, one might
not be too concerned, although one might want to talk about the cost.
Once they move on to policy, however, one becomes concerned.</div>
<a name="10020477000380"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020477000688"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> The terms of reference of the board include
developing policy, but I am sure that the right hon. and learned
Gentleman will recall that, ultimately, Ministers are responsible for
policy and can discuss those issues with the
board.</div>
<a name="10020477000381"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020477000689"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> I do not doubt that for a moment, but the
Minister&#146;s intervention reinforces my point. We are talking
about the ability of the board, working with the Minister, to determine
a line of policy, which, although within the statutory framework, is
not prescribed by it. If that is true&#151;it manifestly is, as the
Minister has told us so&#151;we need a proper system for publishing
the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column285" />Column number: 285</div>governance rules in advance and enabling a lot of
people, including all the institutions of Parliament, to
comment.</div><a name="10020477000382"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
measures does the Minister have in mind for consultation and
publication of draft governance rules, so that interested parties and
&#147;stakeholders&#148; can express a view? I hate the word but it
will do for these purposes. There is nothing to stop him, if he is
still a Minister in a few weeks&#146; time&#151;I do not want to
make any unpleasant observations about that&#151;from publishing them
in draft. If they are significant and of a major kind, they could even
be debated in draft. They could certainly be sent to the Home Affairs
Committee in draft, and there are a lot of other
&#147;stakeholders&#148; to whom the draft rules could and should
be sent. My point is that I hope that the Minister has given serious
thought to how he will consult before the rules are submitted in their
final
form.</div><a name="10020477000491"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.15
pm</div><a name="10020477000383"></a><div class="hs_Para">Similar
considerations apply to the reporting requirements. Apart from anything
else, I suspect that they mean that the Secretary of State will
determine how, to whom and how frequently the board will report. If the
Minister of State nods, it always helps at this stage. I am not going
to say that he is a nodding donkey&#151;that would be extremely
unkind. I ask rhetorically: let us assume that reporting requirements
mean the ability of the Secretary of State to create a regime whereby
the board has to report. If that is right, it is important, because we
are entitled to ask to whom and how often the reports will be made, and
how Parliament will have an opportunity to address
them.</div><a name="10020477000384"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those
are all matters of substance, and the Minister of State should give the
Committee the benefit of his preliminary intentions. We would like an
input, Parliament would like an input and many others would like an
input on precisely these questions. They are not my questions&#151;I
am not saying that they are of huge importance, but the ultimate
working of the database and of the board is significant, especially
given the fact that, as the Minister of State knows, the public are
deeply concerned about the retention of DNA
material.</div><a name="10020477000385"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020477000690"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> I was interested to hear the comments of members
of the Committee. First, I wish to put it on the record that, having
been a Minister for 12 and a half years, I do not expect these to be
the last eight weeks of my ministerial career. We will debate that
shortly. My position is obviously in the gift of the Prime Minister,
but I expect that he will be able to appoint Ministers before and after
the general
election.</div><a name="10020477000386"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
would be helpful if I outlined the board&#146;s current objectives
and responsibilities. The board has a remit to work towards the most
effective and efficient use of the DNA database, and to consider the
impact and implications of future technological advances. Moreover, it
crucially has a remit to build public confidence in the use of the
database. The DNA database strategy board was formed in 2007 and one of
the key issues is how we develop
confidence.</div><a name="10020477000387"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
board currently has a number of responsibilities that can be broadly
defined as developing the policy procedures and strategy of the
national DNA database, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column286" />Column number: 286</div>the police elimination database and any separate
DNA-related databases created for the purposes of identifying a
deceased person or a body part. The development of policy procedures
and strategy is devolved to the board, but Ministers will have an
interest in it by introducing policy, as we are doing
today.</div><a name="10020477000388"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
board also has oversight of the scientific operation of the
Metropolitan police counter-terrorism database. It also considers
applications for the release of data from the DNA database for academic
research, which is important. The board has oversight of contracts,
data security and exchange protocols, and it defines and reviews the
level of security required for the storage of and access to DNA
samples. It also&#151;this is another crucial point&#151;produces
annual reports, statements and bulletins in relation to the DNA
database. That is a fairly tight remit, and there will be
interpretation of it. The crucial points are that the board will
publish an annual report, it will have oversight on statements and
policy, and there will be ministerial accountability. Gary Pugh, who
gave evidence to the Committee, is the board&#146;s current
chair.</div><a name="10020477000389"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020477000691"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> I heard the phrase &#147;ministerial
accountability&#148;, and I welcome it, but accountability to
Parliament can operate only if Parliament is kept informed. Therefore,
I would like to know, in the context of ministerial accountability,
what Parliament will be told and in what circumstances reports will be
submitted.</div><a name="10020477000390"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020477000692"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> That goes to the nub of the
amendments&#151;there is an amendment that would require a report to
Parliament. There is currently an annual report, and that is the
procedure that we wish to
continue.</div><a name="10020477000391"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020477000693"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> Is it to
Parliament?</div><a name="10020477000392"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020477000694"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> The report is available in the Library, but it is
not a report to Parliament in the strictest sense of the wording, or a
formal paper laid before the House. However, an annual report is
available for scrutiny, and I would be interested to know whether
members of the Committee looked at it before this
debate.</div><a name="10020477000393"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
29 would require the board to report on the effectiveness of
the database and to make recommendations on the use of DNA profiles.
That is already part of the board&#146;s responsibilities, as I have
outlined, so the amendment is
unnecessary.</div><a name="10020477000394"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
30 and 32 would require that the board&#146;s governance rules and
reporting requirements are laid before Parliament rather than published
by the Secretary of State. I am content to look at the issue on the
basis of the debate we just held. It is a reasonable assumption that we
would have an annual report, and I am not averse to looking at a report
to Parliament. Ultimately, we can reflect on the matter if need be,
but, at present, the important point is that we have an annual report
that is available to whoever happens to be interested in scrutinising
it.</div><a name="10020477000395"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
31 would require details of the board&#146;s membership to be
included in the process. That information is already available for
public scrutiny, and it is important to continue to provide it. There
is widespread public interest, and there is certainly a need to ensure
that the people who are on the board and undertaking that governance
role are identifiable and open to
scrutiny.</div><a name="10020477000396"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have no problem in reflecting further on the amendment. How about that?
Parliamentary process in action.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column287" />Column number: 287</div><a name="10020477000397"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020477000695"></a>Mr.
Burns:</b>
Unusually.</div><a name="10020477000398"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020477000696"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> I had the privilege of serving in this House in
opposition for five years, and, on the 11 or 12 Bill Committees
that I served on, not once did I ever have one of my proposed
amendments
accepted.</div><a name="10020477000399"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am happy to look at how we improve scrutiny. I want the public to have
confidence in the board and in the scrutiny of the DNA database. We
currently publish an annual report, and we could do one for Parliament.
I do not want to accept the amendment now because, as ever, we need to
reflect on it, but I am not averse to the idea&#151;it does not seem
to be an area of great difficulty. If the hon. Member for Hornchurch
will withdraw the amendment, I will reflect on it and possibly
introduce an amendment in due
course.</div><a name="10020477000400"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
amendment 33 would require the strategy board to
monitor</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#147;the sharing of information
held on the...database with other agencies and
organisations&#148;.</div><a name="10020477000401"></a><div class="hs_Para">Access
to such data is already set out in legislation and strictly monitored
by the national DNA database delivery unit, so there are already strict
controls over the circumstances. I do not think that it would be
appropriate to accept the amendment, and I hope that the hon. Gentleman
will withdraw
it.</div><a name="10020477000402"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman mentioned the Pr1/4m convention, and the Committee
had a discussion earlier about its impact. As hon. Members will know
from that discussion, the Government, through the Justice and Home
Affairs Council, agreed in June 2008 to adopt the Pr1/4m
convention decision, which was initially made on 27 May 2005 by
Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and
Spain to help cross-border co-operation on serious crime issues,
including terrorism and illegal migration. The Pr1/4m convention
will come into force in the UK in respect of DNA, fingerprints and
vehicle registration by August
2011.</div><a name="10020477000403"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
date there has been no exchange of information under the convention,
although information is exchanged routinely, as I mentioned earlier,
with serious crime agencies when requests are made, including for
biometric evidence. That applies when the crime is sufficiently serious
that a European arrest warrant could be issued under the Pr1/4m
convention&#151;my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary deals with such
matters regularly&#151;and when there is a request for such
information under the terms that I mentioned
earlier.</div><a name="10020477000404"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington mentioned the Select
Committee evidence of the hon. Member for Hammersmith and Fulham
following a tragic murder in his family, when DNA evidence was
collected from members of his family. The hon. Member for Hammersmith
and Fulham voluntarily provided his DNA, and because it was a voluntary
sample it was not finally loaded on the DNA database. His DNA profile
was not and never has been loaded on to that database. Because of the
voluntary nature of that sample, that potential involvement has been
proved not to be a
concern.</div><a name="10020477000405"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020477000697"></a>Tom
Brake:</b> I thank the Minister for what he said, but that is
not my point. The evidence given by the hon. Member for Hammersmith and
Fulham was about some of his elderly relatives, to whom officers were 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column288" />Column number: 288</div>dispatched many miles to take DNA samples, although as he stated in his
evidence it was clear to him at least that they were unlikely to have
been involved in the murder of his close relative, although the police
may have needed to investigate the matter
further.</div><a name="10020477000406"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020477000698"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> I respect the judgment of the hon. Member for
Hammersmith and Fulham, but he is not a serving police officer
investigating a serious offence. If an officer deems that such a thing
might help to rule people in or out of an investigation, that is a
reasonable judgment, given that the DNA was given voluntarily and has
not been loaded on to the
database.</div><a name="10020477000407"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10020477000699"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Robert Flello</b> (Stoke-on-Trent, South) (Lab): I was going
to make the point that my hon. Friend the Minister just made. DNA
samples are often needed to rule people out. If a large amount of DNA
was collected, it would be important to discount some of that
information to get down to the important parts of the
investigation.</div><a name="10020477000408"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020477000700"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> Indeed, to put aside for a moment the hon. Member
for Hammersmith and Fulham, on numerous occasions the police say to a
community, &#147;Please will individuals give a voluntary DNA
sample?&#148; Individuals do come forward if the police say, for
example, that the suspect in a geographical area was a male
between 20 and 25. Their DNA is not loaded on to a database
afterwards&#151;they are ruled out once investigations are
complete&#151;but it is a valuable tool and helps the police focus on
a smaller group who could be involved in a
case.</div><a name="10020477000409"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020477000701"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> I reinforce what the Minister said. Within my
professional knowledge, that happens. When scenes of crimes officers
are working on a site, they need to be able to exclude as well as to
identify. That extends not just to DNA, but to fingerprints and often
other material, too. It is about ruling out as well as
including.</div><a name="10020477000410"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020477000702"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> On a voluntary basis, that is a useful community
contribution to crime fighting, which helps ultimately and has
helped&#151;I cannot mention particular cases now, but I am aware of
them&#151;bring people to court who were subsequently convicted and
are now serving sentences. Not only are those crimes solved, but we
should never forget that individuals who exhibit dangerous behaviour
have been prevented from committing future
crimes.</div><a name="10020477000411"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020477000703"></a>Tom
Brake:</b> I want to make it clear&#151;I need it to go on
the record&#151;that Ministers and other right hon. and hon. Members
are seeking to portray me as someone who is in principle opposed to the
use of DNA, which clearly I am not. There are numerous circumstances in
which that is appropriate. I am pleased that in the case of Sally Anne
Bowman, which the Minister has quoted, involving the daughter of a
constituent of mine, many thousands of men came forward voluntarily to
give their DNA so as to be excluded from the police inquiries. I fully
support
that.</div><a name="10020477000412"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020477000704"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> I have never said anything to the contrary. If you
recall, Mr. Cook, I praised the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
position as being principled, consistent and absolutely sound in its
logic.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column289" />Column number: 289</div><a name="10020477000413"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020477000705"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b>
But?</div><a name="10020477000414"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020477000706"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> I just happen to disagree completely with the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s position. There is nothing wrong with the logic of
saying that nobody who is not convicted should be on the DNA database.
It is a perfectly logical position to hold; I just do not think that it
is the correct position and I have tried to expose that in our debate
today.</div>
<a name="10020477000415"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
the hon. Member for Hornchurch will consider withdrawing the amendment
on the basis that I have given him an assurance that we will look at

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020477000707"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I am gratified by the Minister of
State&#146;s response&#151;during a debate where there has been,
shall we say, some differences of approach&#151;and to hear that he
is prepared to consider and examine a number of the amendments to
ensure robust oversight. I should have recorded formally an
acknowledgement of the work undertaken by the existing board and the
reports it has provided. The reports have been informative, helpful and
benefited the debate.</div>
<a name="10020477000417"></a><div class="hs_Para">If we seek to
place the national DNA database strategy board on a more formal
footing, it is worth reflecting on being more specific about making
provisions for reporting to Parliament. I am gratified that the
Minister of State has acknowledged that he is prepared, because of the
sensitive nature of the issues, to ensure that there is appropriate
oversight and that we have that level of scrutiny and accountability.
Parliament will be then aided in holding Ministers to account. That
sense of responsibility was alluded to in a number of the comments in
the debate. I am gratified by the positive response from the Minister
of State on the suggested amendments. I look forward to his reflection
on them and hope that the Government make changes as a
consequence.</div>
<a name="10020477000418"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also note
the Minister of State&#146;s comments on the moves towards
the adoption of the Pr1/4m treaty: the examination of data
sharing, and perhaps the interrelationship between the oversight board
and the work of the DNA database strategy unit. While the
strategy unit monitors that, the effectiveness and appropriate use of
the national DNA database needs to examined and reflected on closely. I
do not think that the Minister gave any updated indication on the
likely cost of implementing the Pr1/4m treaty, in contrast with
the indication given by the previous Under-Secretary, my right hon.
Friend the Member for Enfield, North (Joan Ryan). It would be helpful
to receive that at some point.</div>
<a name="10020477000419"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister&#146;s comments have been helpful, and in the light of his
offer calmly to reflect on the changes we have suggested and, I hope,
come forward with some proposals, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020477000709"></a>Mr.
Flello:</b> I want to record my thanks to the National Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children for its support and
assistance.</div>
<a name="10020477000426"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of my
great concerns about domestic violence is the impact on children. On
Thursday 28 January, we heard evidence about that. For example, Deborah
McIlveen said:</div>
<a name="10020477000476"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
violence impacts on the children. That does not necessarily mean that a
child who has experienced or witnessed it will become either a
perpetrator or a victim. However, it does affect their behaviour in all
sorts of ways, particularly with regard to their
education.&#148;</div><a name="10020477000427"></a><div class="hs_Para">During
the same evidence session, Jane Keeper noted that those children, if
they eventually get to organisations such as the one she
represents&#151;Refuge, the national domestic violence
charity&#151;say,</div><a name="10020477000477"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Why
did no one do anything? The police were called. Why did nobody help
us?&#148; <i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report, Crime and
Security Public Bill Committee, </i>28 January 2010; c.87,
Q183.]</div><a name="10020477000428"></a><div class="hs_Para">Children
learn from those experiences that such things do not matter and are not
important. But they do matter and they are incredibly important. The
impact on children of domestic violence is quite terrifying not only
for the child concerned, but for society.</div>
<a name="10020477000429"></a><div class="hs_Para">Such violence
may affect children in many ways. The problem is not just what they
hear. Children upstairs may hear the sounds of violent behaviour
downstairs when they are supposed to be sleeping and being refreshed
for school next day. They may frequently see their mother being injured
and suffering horrendous injuries. There may be damage to the home:
doors and furniture may be broken, and their toys may be destroyed as
part of inflicting domestic violence on the spouse or partner. There
could be reckless behaviour&#151;the perpetrator may drive recklessly
with the family in the car to terrify the victim and their children.
All those examples of how children suffer the impact of domestic
violence are, sadly, far too frequent, and because of its nature, they
may see it so often that it becomes almost normalised behaviour. That
is why it may be such a tragedy for them in the longer
term.</div><a name="10020477000430"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
purpose of new clause 28 is to put in the Bill a clear statement that
domestic violence may include threats against children, and that
violence against the victim has effects on
children. I hope that the Minister 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column291" />Column number: 291</div>will consider the proposal carefully, because it is
crucial to send a message to those children that they are not forgotten
victims of the horrific crime that happens in their home, but that they
are seen as victims. I hope the Minister will address the
matter.</div>
<a name="10020477000431"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
conscious that we are perhaps 20 minutes from the end of this
afternoon&#146;s sitting. I do not want to detain the
Committee too long, but I want to stress how crucial the issue is. We
have the opportunity to send a clear message to children who are
growing up with domestic violence around them, and to subsequent
generations who may be affected, that the House takes the matter
extremely seriously and is prepared to take
action.</div><a name="10020477000432"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020477000710"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> It is a pleasure to follow the hon. Member
for Stoke-on-Trent, South, who spoke about the new clause so
effectively. The NSPCC highlighted the matter, and I will come to its
comments
later.</div><a name="10020477000433"></a><div class="hs_Para">Witnessing
domestic violence may have a serious impact on a young person growing
up in such an environment and, sadly, that impact may be lifelong in
certain circumstances&#151;in due course, we will debate the impact
of gang-related violence. There is some analysis showing that the
predilection of a young person to behave violently may have been in
some way conditioned, influenced or affected by the home environment in
which they grew up. If they are exposed to or see abuse and violence,
they may think that is an appropriate or acceptable way to behave. It
creates conflict: they see someone who is violent but at the same time
they may still love them. They do not understand what happens when they
hit someone in the school environment. Domestic violence creates
confusion, isolation and possible recruitment down a rather dark path
of crime. There is lack of opportunity and lack of social justice for
many young children growing up in such environments.</div>
<a name="10020477000434"></a><div class="hs_Para">The issue is
important and speaks to a number of factors relating to social problems
and causes of crime among young children. We must do what we can as a
society to ensure that children grow up in a good, strong family
environment without fear of violence or abuse, because of the
long-lasting implications of exposure to those sorts of family
circumstances.</div><a name="10020477000435"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to address some broader issues in relation to the domestic
violence protection notice regime. There is a significant problem:
around 14 per cent. of all violent offences involve domestic violence.
That probably significantly understates the problem, because there are
reporting issues. The cycle of violence continues and may get worse and
worse. The desire to take further action on that serious problem is
reflected in the provisions in clause 21 and subsequent
clauses.</div><a name="10020477000436"></a><div class="hs_Para">Questions
have been raised about the use of the powers, but before I go on to
them I shall deal with the background to go orders. In other European
countries they have been used as an inexpensive short-term measure to
remove the perpetrator of domestic violence from the home, allowing the
victim to remain in it and buying the victim some breathing space to
decide what steps should be taken. A recommendation from the Home
Affairs Committee encouraged the Government to examine such provisions
to buy breathing space for victims to consider their options.</div>
<a name="10020477000437"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is worth
reflecting on some of the points that have been raised about the use of
domestic violence protection orders elsewhere. They have been
successfully introduced 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column292" />Column number: 292</div>in several European countries; Austria is often held up as the best
example. An evaluation of the use of similar orders in Austria found
that they were generally supported by victims and were effective if
linked to support and help. That is an important point to make in
relation to the provisions in the Bill. They should not be seen in
isolation. They need to be part of a wider approach and strategy, as
the Home Affairs Committee pointed out in its report. Paragraph 340
states:</div><a name="10020477000478"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Development
of &#145;GO&#146; orders in the UK should be linked with Sanctuary
schemes, which we discuss in paragraphs 221 to 227 of this report, to
provide further protection to victims who remain in their own
home.&#148;</div><a name="10020477000438"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is just one example, but it fits within a broader approach to
highlighting the significance of domestic violence.</div>
<a name="10020477000439"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those are
positive reasons for the provisions. We broadly support the concept of
the orders, provided that they are part of wider measures and are not
seen in isolation. We heard some quite compelling evidence. I was
struck by the comments of Brian
Moore:</div><a name="10020477000479"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;There
are 200,000 arrests per year, but only about 60,000
prosecutions&#151;there is a gap of about 140,000 cases where there
is insufficient evidence available to bring a prosecution. In those
circumstances, the perpetrator is released from the police station and
goes back to the very address where he was arrested perhaps 24 hours
earlier. That is an extremely dangerous time and that is the gap we are
trying to close. When the police have done all they can to bring a
prosecution after arrest and it is simply not possible to do so, there
remains a gap where there is a high level of
risk.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report, Crime and
Security Public Bill Committee, </i>28 January 2010; c.75-6,
Q161.]</div><a name="10020477000493"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.45
pm</div><a name="10020477000440"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
comment neatly summarises the reasons why these provisions have been
brought forward. I will raise with the Minister some other related
aspects; for example, overlap with existing measures and their
interrelationship in the operation of the provisions. That will come up
in relation to other amendments as we proceed with our consideration of
these
clauses.</div><a name="10020477000441"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before
leaving clause 21 and the related provisions, I note that a domestic
violence protection notice is issued by a police officer under stated
conditions for authorisation. We will discuss that in further detail
under some of the notification requirements in clause 22. The officer
must have reasonable grounds that there has been violence towards the
individual and that the notice is necessary to protect someone from
violence or the threat of it from the person described as
&#147;P&#148;.</div>
<a name="10020477000442"></a><div class="hs_Para">We need to
ensure that the power is used properly and appropriately. Concerns have
been raised about what judgments might be formulated. There is a need
for appropriate training in the use of the power, to ensure against
false allegations being made. An officer on the ground who has received
an allegation has to consider what may be appropriate when considering
whether to issue a domestic violence protection notice.</div>
<a name="10020477000443"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would be
helpful to hear from the Minister of State the Government&#146;s
intentions on rolling out the procedure. Although the authorisation
comes from an officer at superintendent level, which is quite high in
this context, the likelihood is that the facts will be presented to a
constable who will have to make recommendations to the
superintendent. What measures, mechanisms and discussions have
taken place, either with the Superintendents&#146; Association or
ACPO, regarding 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column293" />Column number: 293</div>implementation of the power, to ensure that it is used as intended? As I
understand it&#151;we will come to this later&#151;the intention is
that the power should initially be used only on a pilot basis. That is
right and we will be able to debate it further.</div>
<a name="10020477000444"></a><div class="hs_Para">This new
concept and the provisions in clause 21 need to be tested in a local
area before their wider application across the country is considered.
The impact on the person subject to an order could be quite draconian.
Subsection (8) says that if the relevant person &#147;P&#148; lives
in the same premises as the person protected by the notice,
&#147;P&#148; is prohibited from entering the premises. That has
significant implications for that individual. Careful consideration
will need to be given to the utilisation of such
powers.</div><a name="10020477000445"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given
the obvious questions about homelessness and any housing requirements
that local authorities may need to fulfil in that context, local
authorities and crime and disorder reduction partnerships may need to
be bound more cohesively into the arrangements to ensure that the
powers are being used appropriately. However, we will drill down into
the detail in subsequent
clauses.</div><a name="10020477000446"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
point was powerfully made in evidence when Steve Connor said:</div>
<a name="10020477000480"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Approximately
18 per cent. of the 6,000 calls per month that we deal with are from
male victims of domestic violence. That is a huge problem. Research
shows that it is usually much harder for a man to contact the police or
a support agency, because as well as having the usual violence,
intimidation and emotional fear factors, you have the additional hurdle
of feeling embarrassed that you are a man and you are being
abused.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report, Crime and
Security Public Bill Committee, </i>28 January 2010; c. 91,
Q186.]</div><a name="10020477000447"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
would be helpful to hear from the Minister how the Government see the
power being used in such circumstances. What training or guidance is
being considered for police officers to take account of the sort of
issues highlighted in Committee, especially given the number of
complaints received by the National Centre for Domestic Violence, the
organisation represented by Steve Connor? Such issues are not discussed
enough, and it was useful that Steve Connor highlighted the
fact.</div>
<a name="10020477000448"></a><div class="hs_Para">I return to
new clause 28. As I say, domestic violence has obviously been
highlighted by the NSPCC, which stressed the definition of domestic
violence used by the Home Office:</div>
<a name="10020477000481"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147; Any
incident of threatened behaviour, violence or abuse (psychological,
physical, sexual, financial or emotional) between adults who are or
have been intimate partners or family members, regardless of gender or
sexuality.&#148;</div><a name="10020477000449"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
NSPCC noted the differences in what happens under the Home Office, and
in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, but it recognised the overlap
between abuse of the non-abusive parent and abuse of
children.</div>
<a name="10020477000450"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government are committed to reviewing the definition in 2010, and that
is partly dealt with in the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column294" />Column number: 294</div>Bill. We heard from the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, South that the
NSPCC is calling on the Government to include in their definition
children and the impact of abuse. A significant point is being made,
for reasons to which I alluded at the start of my speech. It needs to
be considered carefully to ensure that the problem of abuse in the
family home and the implications for children are properly reflected
upon. I look forward with interest to the Minister&#146;s response to
the new clause, and more generally to the points that I highlighted in
the context of clause 21, so that we may better consider whether it
should stand part of the Bill.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020477000711"></a>Tom
Brake:</b> I shall pick up where the hon. Member for
Hornchurch finished. I congratulate the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent,
South on his new clause. He set out with some clarity how the
definition should be expanded. He said that domestic violence affects
children and that any definition should take that fact on board. I do
not know whether the hon. Gentleman has had discussions with the
Minister about whether his new clause will be accepted. The Minister
may indicate that he is supportive of the proposals&#151;although he
may not take Back-Bench or Opposition amendments on board twice in one
sitting. I shall wait with interest to hear the Minister&#146;s
response to new clause 28.</div>
<a name="10020477000452"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
the Minister will respond to a couple of other points. At our third
sitting, Brian Moore said that if Parliament thought it appropriate for
DVPNs to be issued to under-18s&#151;a slightly different aspect of
children&#151;ACPO would not stand in the way. Did the Minister of
State receive representations from ACPO that DVPNs might be applicable
or available to use with children? That is not something I advocate,
bearing in mind what I shall say about gang injunctions. I would be
interested to know, however, whether any debate or discussion took
place and what the outcome
was.</div><a name="10020477000453"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
point raised during our third evidence sitting was whether any estimate
had been made of how many DVPNs might be issued and, therefore, what
sort of pressure that might place on magistrates courts or other parts
of the system. I accept that it is difficult for the Minister of State
to answer that question, but some analysis of the potential number of
requests may have already been done. If that is the case, I hope that
the Minister will put it on the record so that we have some feel for
the number of DVPNs the Government expect to be
issued.</div><a name="10020477000454"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Ordered,
