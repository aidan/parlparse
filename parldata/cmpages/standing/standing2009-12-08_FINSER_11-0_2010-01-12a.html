regulatory objectives of the
Authority.&#146;.</div><a name="10011242000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
welcome you back to the Chair, Mr. Benton, in what is a
slightly warmer room than we are used

amendment is small but important.</div>
<a name="10011242000021"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10011242000329"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Mark Hoban</b> (Fareham) (Con): The amendment may be small but
important, but is the hon. Gentleman not disappointed, as I am, that it
is only because of the presence of him and my hon. Friends that the
Committee is quorate this
morning?</div><a name="10011242000022"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011242000330"></a>Mr.
Breed:</b> I was not going to mention that, but I agree that
it is a tad disappointing. No doubt the Minister will rustle up a few
more of his colleagues in the next few minutes. Otherwise I might sit
down and ask for a vote. That would be a more difficult
thing.</div><a name="10011242000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
is a probing amendment. I want the Minister to explain why we have
omitted a particular aspect in the clause. To subsection
(3)&#151;</div><a name="10011242000252"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
rules must secure that any remuneration policy that an authorised
person is required by the rules to have is consistent
with&#148;&#151;</div><a name="10011242000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
seek to add the words:</div>
<a name="10011242000253"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
regulatory objectives of the
Authority&#148;.</div><a name="10011242000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is one of the key aspects. If we have learned anything from the recent
past about the way in which remuneration or compensation packages have
operated, it is that they have in many respects driven business both
corporately and individually to extremes, causing some of the problems
that we have seen. In its monitoring and supervisory role in the past,
the FSA might have had a passing glance at the compensation packages or
the recommendations of remuneration committees in the individual
institutions that it was looking at. It obviously did not get too
involved in them, and yet it was a strong driver for the way in which
those institutions operated.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column340" />Column number: 340</div><a name="10011242000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">Monitoring the
performance of banks and other lending institutions must include the
fact that the FSA will need to ensure that the remuneration packages,
particularly bonuses and such, align with the model that the bank or
the institution is undertaking. That is an important role for the FSA.
It should have an impact on compensation packages. It should be able to
make regulatory rules in respect of the operation of banks and others,
which include remuneration and compensation packages. In many respects,
the additional measure ought to be the first one, not the third one.
The rules of remuneration committees, the impact of their decisions and
the way in which bonus contractual arrangements are made are extremely
important. The FSA should not only be able to comment but be able to
ensure that such packages are commensurate with the appropriate
business model that it is monitoring. That it should have at least a
role to play when the remuneration rules are set up is a pretty
reasonable addition to the subsection.</div>
<a name="10011242000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I said to
the Minister, it is a probing amendment. I am sure there are other ways
to do this, but I want to be certain that the way in which the FSA is
involved in how banks and others construct performance-related and
profit bonuses is appropriate. We have seen much inappropriate use of
the bonus systems. I have just come from the Treasury Committee, which
is meeting at this very moment; that is perhaps why slightly fewer hon.
Members are in Committee. It has been receiving evidence from
Mr. Stephen Hester, and already much of this
morning&#146;s discussion has related to bonus payments, the packages
that were put together at ABN and the contractual package that was
offered to Mr. Hester when he took his current
job.</div><a name="10011242000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
for the likely bonus pot and the distribution of bonuses this year, it
has been demonstrated clearly that they will be significant,
particularly in respect of the performance of individual banks during
last year&#146;s trading. The addition to the clause would be an
important way in which the FSA could not only monitor, but ensure that
future compensation packages are allied to a sustainable business model
that will not lead us into the problems that we have experienced in the
past.</div>
<a name="10011242000029"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011242000331"></a>The
Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Ian Pearson):</b> For the
record, the Government Benches were reinforced by 10.33 am, after only
three minutes of our debate, despite the fact that several colleagues
are performing sterling work on the Treasury
Committee.</div><a name="10011242000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
wish to explain to the Committee why the amendment tabled by the hon.
Member for South-East Cornwall is neither necessary nor particularly
helpful. As he will be aware, clause 11 places a duty on the Financial
Services Authority to make rules setting out the standards to which
remuneration policies should adhere, in pursuit of the clear and
specific objectives that remuneration policies in banks should not
incentivise excessive risk taking, and that regulatory action should be
appropriate to ensure that that does not happen. That stems from an
established international consensus among the G20 and the Financial
Stability Board that remuneration policies in the financial services
sector should be subject to control to ensure the avoidance of
excessive risk, and we agree strongly with that
position.</div><a name="10011242000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
11 therefore makes express statutory provision for the implementation
of the consensus by placing a duty on the FSA to make the appropriate
rules. We 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column341" />Column number: 341</div>need to be clear that the rules will be focused on the vital objective
of ensuring that remuneration does not encourage excessive risk taking
by key employees of banks. The amendment proposes something different
from that, and would add to subjection (3) of proposed new section 139A
the additional requirement that the rules that the FSA makes must
ensure that remuneration policies are consistent with all the statutory
objectives of the
authority.</div><a name="10011242000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
must say to the hon. Gentleman that requiring the FSA to insist that
authorised persons have remuneration policies consistent with a large
number of objectives would be difficult from a practical perspective,
both for the firms and for the regulator. The rules would need to be
extremely detailed and wide-ranging to achieve that. The amendment is
therefore likely to detract from the focus of ensuring that
remuneration does not incentivise excessive risk taking. It would
certainly have the effect of moving the United Kingdom policy on
remuneration in a different
direction.</div><a name="10011242000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
balance must be struck between regulation by public authorities and
self-regulation imposed through the normal operation of market
discipline. That is very much a live issue at the moment. To say that
remuneration policies must be consistent with all the objectives of the
authority, including consumer protection, market confidence, tackling
financial crime and so on, is not really necessary. The FSA already
pursues those objectives through the full suite of available regulatory
and enforcement powers. It is not clear that adding an express duty for
it to do so through its regulation of remuneration policies would add
anything.</div><a name="10011242000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">Requiring
the FSA to subject a limited category of authorised persons to the
FSA&#146;s objectives in a small part of their activities would do
little to assist consumers or ensure that the FSA&#146;s other
objectives were fulfilled. As I have said, the FSA has a full suite of
other powers available to it in other areas, and there is a real risk
that, if the amendment were accepted, it would detract from the purpose
of the provisions and from what we are proposing, which is deliberately
focused on avoiding excessive risk taking. I therefore urge the hon.
Gentleman to withdraw his
amendment.</div><a name="10011242000035"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011242000332"></a>Mr.
Breed:</b> The truth of the matter is that banks and financial
institutions are different if they are too important to fail, because
taxpayers are standing behind them. We know that failure, or the
potential to fail, has perhaps been driven as much by remuneration
policies as anything
else.</div><a name="10011242000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
understand it when the Minister says that the measure would have to be
detailed, and in general terms we do not want to interfere in the
remuneration policies of private companies or get too fixated by the
current situation, when there is large taxpayer ownership of a couple
of large institutions. Hopefully, this legislation will endure beyond
that situation, so we can talk about a more normal situation.
Nevertheless, the FSA requires the explicit authority and power to
intervene in a remuneration
policy.</div><a name="10011242000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will
the clause, as it stands without the amendment, allow the FSA to veto
or not authorise an institution&#146;s proposed remuneration package
or bonus payment system if it feels that the package is not in the
institution&#146;s best interests, or because of the systemic risk
that would 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column342" />Column number: 342</div>arise if the institution failed as a result of that remuneration
package? If the Minister is able to satisfy me that that is the case,
and that we do not need to concern ourselves with the issue, I am
perfectly happy for the clause to remain as it is. As far as I am
concerned, the key aspect is that the FSA should have the ability, if
required, to say to a large bank, &#147;We do not believe that your
bonus payment system should be used, given your performance, the
business model and the potential systemic risk that would arise if you
entered into a difficulty. We therefore say that you cannot use
it.&#148;</div><a name="10011242000038"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011242000333"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I am happy to confirm that the focus in clause 11
on avoiding excessive risk taking does exactly what the hon. Gentleman
suggests. The FSA also has other powers in other areas to ensure that
its other objectives are fulfilled. That is why we do not believe that
the powers should be widened in the way that he
suggests.</div><a name="10011242000039"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011242000334"></a>Mr.
Breed:</b> I think that the Minister is being entirely frank.
Our concern was about whether the FSA has that ability. It has had a
number of powers for many years that it has failed to use. Perhaps in
this particular case, it will focus clearly on its ability to use the
clause to ensure that it acts swiftly in future if it becomes
concerned, as a result of its supervisory activities, that a
remuneration package or bonus payment system may drive an institution
in the wrong direction. On that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw
the
amendment.</div><a name="10011242000040"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,
by leave, withdrawn.</i></div>
<a name="10011242000041"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011242000335"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I beg to move amendment 54, in
clause 11, page 9, line 11, after
&#145;void&#146;, insert</div>
<div class="hs_AmendmentLevel0">&#145;where that agreement was signed after 19
November
2009.&#146;.</div><a name="10011242000042"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011242000336"></a>The
Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to discuss
Government amendment
56.</div><a name="10011242000043"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011242000337"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> Thank you, Mr. Benton. It is a pleasure
to serve under your chairmanship this morning. I am pleased to see that
although I have blazed a trail with my amendment to proposed new
subsection 9, the Minister has ridden in behind and has come up with
something else, which may well be the amendment that changes the Bill.
I would perhaps take some credit for poking in the right direction, but
his amendment gives rise to questions about what it means in
practice.</div><a name="10011242000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to start with some brief remarks on the clause. One of the big
debates that has emerged from the financial crisis is about
remuneration. There are two strands in that debate. The hon. Member for
South-East Cornwall just alluded to one of them, which arose from the
questioning of Stephen Hester by the Treasury Committee on quantum and
the amount of money involved. It plays into the question of why banks
can make such large bonus payments, given that the taxpayer bailed them
out. That has rightly triggered fierce debate about that aspect of
remuneration.</div><a name="10011242000300"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.45
am</div><a name="10011242000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">Also&#151;I
shall spend a bit more time discussing this&#151;attention has
focused on what the right remuneration structures are for banks. Clause
11 provides the FSA 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column343" />Column number: 343</div>with a framework for introducing rules to that effect. In his report on
the FSA&#146;s role in the financial crisis, Lord Turner said
that</div><a name="10011242000254"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;within
firms, little attention was paid to the implications of incentive
structures for risk taking, as against the implications for firm
competitiveness in the labour market and for firm profitability. In
retrospect this lack of focus, by both firms and regulators, was a
mistake. There is a strong prima facie case that inappropriate
incentive structures played a role in encouraging behaviour which
contributed to the financial
crisis.&#148;</div><a name="10011242000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
September, Lord Turner said
that</div><a name="10011242000255"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
honest truth is that bad remuneration policies, though relevant, were
far less important in the unravelling of the crisis than hopelessly
inadequate capital requirements against risky trading
strategies&#148;.</div><a name="10011242000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
point is that although there is much debate about bonuses, correlating
bonus structures to risk and shareholders&#146; interests is not
sufficient in itself to prevent or mitigate the recurrence of a
financial crisis. It is a helpful factor, but it is not the silver
bullet that people are looking
for.</div><a name="10011242000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
11 amends the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 to create new
rules about remuneration policy at any and all FSA-regulated firms, not
just banks, although that is clearly the principal focus at the moment.
Proposed new section 139A(1)
says:</div><a name="10011242000256"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Authority must exercise its power to make general rules so as to make
rules requiring each authorised person (or each authorised person of a
specified description) to have, and act in accordance with, a
remuneration
policy.&#148;</div><a name="10011242000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">Section
139A(3) goes on to say
that</div><a name="10011242000257"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;any
remuneration policy that an authorised person is required by the rules
to
have&#148;</div><a name="10011242000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">must
be</div><a name="10011242000258"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;consistent
with&#151;</div><a name="10011242000259"></a><div class="hs_brev">(a)
the effective management of
risks&#148;,</div><a name="10011242000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">which
is not defined,
and</div><a name="10011242000260"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;(b)
the Implementation
Standards.&#148;</div><a name="10011242000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
implementation standards are in a paper published by the Financial
Stability Board in September 2009 setting out how an earlier policy
statement, produced by the Financial Stability Forum in April last
year, could be implemented.</div>
<a name="10011242000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the
Minister clarify one point? The FSA&#146;s code of remuneration
policy was published the previous month, in August last year. It is not
clear from the Bill whether &#147;general rules&#148; refers to the
FSA&#146;s August 2009 statement, which predates the implementation
standards, or whether, as I think is the intention, more detailed rules
will be produced by the FSA to flesh out what was in the code. It is
clear from the FSA code produced in August and the implementation
standards that the latter, although relatively permissive, are much
more specific&#151;for example, on the proportion of a bonus to be
deferred&#151;than the FSA&#146;s code, which is more general. Will
he explain the interaction between those two
documents?</div><a name="10011242000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
looking at the FSB&#146;s work programme, a further report on
compensation practices will be published in March 2010. It will look at
how the implementation standards were implemented across different
jurisdictions. I assume that if the March 2010 document argues for a
further tightening of the rules, it can be reflected in the
FSA&#146;s policies and rules by virtue of subsection (4) of new
section 139A, which
says:</div><a name="10011242000261"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;When
making rules about remuneration policies, the Authority must have
regard to any other international standards about the remuneration of
individuals working in the financial sector&#148;.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column344" />Column number: 344</div><a name="10011242000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is clear that work is
ongoing. There is not a final international position on this. Further
guidance may be issued on the back of the report planned for March.
Although the clause is anchored off the back of the FSB&#146;s
September 2009 document, I assume that any later documents will also be
covered by
this.</div><a name="10011242000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
changing picture gives rise to my and the Minister&#146;s amendment
to subsection (9), which gives the FSA the power to make rules that
may</div>
<a name="10011242000262"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;prohibit
persons...from being remunerated in a specified
way&#148;.</div>
<a name="10011242000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">It may provide
that</div><a name="10011242000263"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;any
provision of an agreement that contravenes such a prohibition is
void&#148;.</div>
<a name="10011242000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">When the Minister and I
debated the Banking Act 2009, we spoke briefly about the potential
power in that Act to tear up directors&#146; contracts. The Minister
was very clear that the power was not there for that purpose, and
directors&#146; contracts would continue in place. It was not clear
from the way in which subsection (9) was drafted whether agreement,
which pre-dated the publication of the Bill, could be made void, and
what protection there was for pre-existing contracts of employment
between financial institutions and their employees. Amendment 54
therefore seeks to clarify any contracts entered into prior to 19
November. Hon. Members might wonder why I chose 19 November. That was
the date that the Bill was printed. People will know that if their
contracts were entered into prior to 19 November, they would not be
capable of being made void. However, if the contracts made after 19
November were in breach of international standards, they could be made
void. People were given notice at that point about the principles with
which the remuneration policy should comply. That is the purpose of my
amendment.</div>
<a name="10011242000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">Government
amendment 56, which applies when the rules are made, is perhaps more
generous than mine. It is not clear to me whether the code that the FSA
incorporates as part of its rules in August is the same as the rules
for this purpose, or whether there is a further set of detailed rules
that people would be expected to comply with. Does the code have the
same standing as a later set of rules? I am not clear what rules the
Minister refers to. Is it the code that was published in August or will
more detailed rules be published at a later date, with which people
will be expected to comply? Are the contracts that pre-dated those
rules still valid? I would like the Minister to clarify
that.</div><a name="10011242000060"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011242000338"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> First, in response to the more general points
made by the hon. Member for Fareham about the clause, the moving
picture of regulation and the further development of international
standards, I must say that the current FSA code is a world-leading
example of how a supervisor should tackle remuneration that
incentivises excessive risk taking. Under the Bill, we are
strengthening the FSA&#146;s hands as a regulator to take action
against remuneration policies that encourage excessive risk taking and
ensuring greater accountability of the FSA to the Government in that
area. The hon. Gentleman is right about further international
developments. He referred to the work of the Financial Stability Board;
it is a matter on which discussions are still taking place. As a
result, the FSA will be changing its code to ensure consistency with
the G20 agreement. The plan is that it will review its code in 2010 to
take account of experience gained in implementing it, and in the light
of international developments, which is something that the hon.
Gentleman will want to support.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column345" />Column number: 345</div><a name="10011242000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">With regard to
amendment 54 and Government amendment 56, I recognise that there has
been some confusion over the impact and powers given to the FSA under
the clause, but I assure the Committee that it was never the
Government&#146;s intention that the power should be used by the FSA
to invalidate provisions in existing contracts, nor does the clause
include a provision giving the FSA retrospective powers. As the
Committee is aware, the Joint Committee on Human Rights recently
recommended that the lack of retrospective effect should be made clear
in the Bill, and the hon. Gentleman has made a noble attempt to do that
with the
amendment.</div><a name="10011242000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
the specific wording of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s amendment refers to
the date on which the Bill was introduced to Parliament and does not
fully address the concerns that have been raised. Any rules that the
FSA makes and publishes will, of course, be known after that date so
amendment 54 would allow some retroactivity by referring to the date
when the Bill was introduced into Parliament rather than the date on
which the FSA made its
rules.</div><a name="10011242000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
contrast, Government amendment 56 provides that any rules the FSA makes
about remuneration may not render void a provision that was already in
an agreement when that rule was made. The hon. Gentleman raised a
broader issue and one that we think is appropriate. He asked whether
the code was equivalent to rules for the purpose of voiding any
contracts. The answer is no. The rules themselves must provide that
continuation of a rule will make a clause void. The code does not, and
there will be new
rules.</div><a name="10011242000064"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011242000339"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> The code is now part of the FSA rulebook, so I am
not sure why it is not regarded as rules for the purpose of the
clause.</div><a name="10011242000065"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011242000340"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I accept that the hon. Gentleman is right. I am
right, too, given my advice, but if I can provide further clarification
during this morning&#146;s debate, I shall certainly do so. The key
point is that the Government amendment is broader and more appropriate
than amendment 54, and I shall clarify the detail with him
shortly.</div><a name="10011242000066"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011242000341"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I am not quite sure what it is we are broader or
more conciliatory to the banking sector about, but there is a problem
because we need clarity for contractual purposes. There is also tension
because the code, which was introduced in August, is less specific than
the implementation standards. For example, the standards define some
proportions of remuneration that should be deferred, whereas the code
is much more permissive. Greater clarity on that matter would be
welcome. If the formulation of the Bill is not sufficiently clear, once
the Government amendment is made&#151;assuming that the Committee
passes it&#151;will the Government return to the matter on Report?
That would ensure that what people are meant to be complying with is
crystal clear. People are making formal commitments; for example, the
banks have signed up to the Pittsburgh declaration. Many commitments
have been made, and we must ensure that we respect contractual
obligations. Therefore there needs to be some clarity as to what it is
that people are meant to be complying with and what the rules
are.</div>

is a pleasure to appear before you again, Mr. Benton. Part
of the Bill addresses the world recession and its effects in the UK,
and the regulatory regime in the UK faced with a world crisis. My
starting point in tabling the amendment is that there will be another
crisis in world banking, which will be reflected in the UK. I am not
foolish enough to predict when that crisis will be, but as someone
whose partial background is as a historian, it is clear from looking at
the past and the nature of capitalism, driven by greed and innovation,
and its cyclical nature, whether one takes Kondratiev long waves or
shorter ones, the high likelihood is that at some point in western
capitalism within the next 30 years there will be some kind of banking
crisis.</div>
<a name="10011242000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill goes
some way towards addressing such issues for the future, including the
recovery and resolution plans in clause 12, and the amendment relates
to resolution plans. Paragraph 106 of the explanatory notes,
states:</div><a name="10011242000264"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
recovery plan aims to reduce the likelihood of failure of a firm by
setting out what the authorised person would do in, or prior to it

resolution plan, in contradistinction to a recovery plan, is to do with
failure. Paragraph 111 of the explanatory notes, states that it
is</div><a name="10011242000266"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;action
to be taken in the event of failure of all or any part of the business
occurring, and action to be taken by a firm where failure is

implementation, focusing on the largest, most complex and systemically
significant firms in the first instance.&#148;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column347" />Column number: 347</div><a name="10011242000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">Proposed new

is about the break-up of big banks. As drafted, the Bill says that if
the authority does not like a resolution plan&#151;a plan that is to
do with failure or its likelihood&#151;it can ask for it to be
revised. Well, whoopee-doo. We could have a big bank failing and the
FSA saying, &#147;You had better revise your failure plan,&#148; or
the &#147;resolution plan&#148;, as it is called in the Bill. That
is not adequate. The size of our financial institutions in the United
Kingdom is the elephant in the room&#151;to use a hackneyed
phrase&#151;in the Bill. They are too big. They need to be broken up.
To use the description of the Governor of the Bank of England when he
spoke in the Lords in December, banks and financial institutions are
&#147;too important to
fail&#148;.</div><a name="10011242000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have a lot of time for the Governor of the Bank of England because he
is, as my hon. Friend the Minister will know, a fellow
Wulfrunian&#151;a Wolverhampton native. For some strange reason, he
does not support Wolverhampton Wanderers football club; he supports
Aston Villa. Apart from that, Mervyn King is not a bad
Wulfrunian&#151;not a bad bloke. He raised the issue of financial
institutions in our country that are too important to
fail.</div><a name="10011242000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
amendment is permissive. It would
say:</div><a name="10011242000270"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
steps that the Authority may take include...requiring the
authorised person to be broken
up&#148;&#151;</div><a name="10011242000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">&#147;the
authority may take&#148; is permissive. The amendment does not seek
to break up big financial institutions in the United Kingdom&#151;at
the moment. If a Government had such a power&#151;let alone used
it&#151;there is a risk that certain financial institutions would
decide to leave the United Kingdom, because of such draconian powers.
That is a concern. There is also the issue of breaking up large
financial institutions&#151;banks&#151;into retail and investment,
or, as the Americans call them, utility and casino banks. That has been
canvassed by the hon. Member for Twickenham, who is a member of the
Committee but has not yet joined us. Breaking up banks in such a way is
simplistic. Hon. members will know my concerns about UK banking in
contradistinction to Canadian banks, which are the most stable in the
world. They were voted the most stable by the World Economic Forum.
They are some of the biggest banks in the world and they do retail and
investment, so that is not necessarily the way to break up big
financial institutions. Although it would be worth looking at, that
alone will not solve
it.</div><a name="10011273000001"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10011242000345"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Andrew Love</b> (Edmonton) (Lab/Co-op): I am following my hon.
Friend&#146;s argument closely. A concern raised by his amendment is
that it places the breaking up of organisations in the Bill. Yet, as I
understand it, the stated intent of the Bill is to set a framework and
leave it to the living wills to decide policy. What arguments does he
deploy to support putting it in the Bill, when the suggestion is that
it be left to the discussions between the FSA and the financial
organisation
itself?</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column348" />Column number: 348</div><a name="10011242000084"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011242000346"></a>Rob
Marris:</b> My amendment is permissive. It does not say that
big financial institutions should or must be broken up. It says that
the Financial Services Authority may, if there is not an adequate
resolution plan, order that a financial institution be broken up. It is
merely permissive in that sense. If it were to lead to an exodus of
financial institutions from the United Kingdom, I am not sure that
would be a bad thing. It would be a bad thing for people who work for
them, of course. However, we are faced with the fact that, in our
country at the moment, we have spent a huge amount of taxpayers&#146;
money&#151;some of which we might get back, some of which we might
not&#151;bailing out failed large financial institutions. We cannot
afford to keep doing that. This year, the Government&#146;s borrowing
is about &#163;175 billion; it will be of a similar order next year.
That is the result of two things: one is the bailing out of financial
institutions and the second is that the world recession and the
recession in our economy, the effects of which the Government have done
very well to lessen, have been hugely costly. The antics of morally
corrupt people such as Sir Fred Goodwin or Adam Applegarth of Northern
Rock have destabilised our whole system here and similarly across the
Atlantic in the United States of America, and the cupboard is
bare.</div><a name="10011242000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
a big financial institution in the United Kingdom were to go bust in
the relatively near future, the taxpayer could not afford to bail it
out. To me, it is not a choice between, &#147;Ah well, do we take on
a bit more debt in the future to bail out a big financial institution
if it goes bust?&#148; or &#147;Do we break it up in the
future?&#148;, but a matter of, &#147;We can&#146;t afford to
bail out big time somebody in the future, so let&#146;s take some
preventive steps now, at least by giving the FSA the power to do
it.&#148; I am not saying that it must do so, but just that we should
take some preventive steps now to consider breaking up the large
financial institutions, as the amendment suggests, because we cannot
afford the
alternative.</div><a name="10011242000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
politicians who are considering the Financial Services Bill and members
of society, we need to debate whether the size of the financial
institutions relative to the size of our economy is, in fact, too big.
I am sure that some hon. Members will agree that at some time in the
unspecified future we will again have a financial crisis in the United
Kingdom. That is what happens with big financial institutions because
capitalism driven by greed and innovation can
produce negative as well as beneficial results. If we are to have such
a crisis in the future, let us take preventive measures now. Let us
talk about it
now.</div><a name="10011242000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
example, as many of my colleagues on the Government Benches will know,
for trade union activists the time to discuss a redundancy policy of
the company for which they are working is not when the company is
proposing to take redundancies, but when it is not proposing to take
redundancies, because that is when a calm debate can take place. At the
moment, the signs are that the Government&#146;s heroic actions have
stabilised the financial system both in the United Kingdom and more
broadly throughout the world, and that things are starting to calm
down. So now is the time when we should debate the size of financial
institutions in our country and whether there should be a cap on their
size, such as on their capitalisation as a percentage of gross domestic
product or some such formula. I am not fixed about what. The issue is
one on which economists are 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column349" />Column number: 349</div>fairly evenly divided, but there is a big school of thought in the
western world among economists that the &#147;too important to
fail&#148; issue is being ignored by
politicians.</div><a name="10011242000011"></a><h4 class="hs_76fChair">[<span class="SmallCaps">Mr.
Roger Gale </span><i class="I">in the
Chair</i>]</h4><a name="10011242000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
certainly pick up in the United Kingdom that, as politicians, we are
failing in the debate. We are not having it. It takes a Back-Bench
amendment to enable such a debate, and I should be interested to hear
what my hon. Friend the Minister&#151;also from the west
midlands&#151;says about whether the FSA should have permissive
powers. Do the Government propose to have a public or political debate
about whether the size of financial institutions in the United Kingdom
needs to be cut and, if not, why do they not consider that we should
have that debate? If the Minister&#151;as I anticipate he
might&#151;says that the amendment is not right, does he think that a
different change to the Bill would be appropriate to implement such a
power so that its use can be discussed now while matters are calming
down? We cannot avoid such a debate; we either have it now or whoever
of us is left standing, as it were, when the next crisis hits and we
cannot afford to bail out big institutions, will have to discuss the
matter then. I would rather have the debate
now.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011242000347"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I welcome you to the chairmanship of the Committee,
Mr.
Gale.</div><a name="10011242000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West raised some interesting
points in his amendment. I was going to touch on something similar in
the stand part debate, and if I may, I would like to make some broader
comments about clause
12.</div><a name="10011242000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
debate is an important one to have. The hon. Gentleman has done us a
service by raising the issues, including the one about banks that are
too big to fail, and whether there should be a division between
different elements of banking activity&#151;the shorthand is: do we
need a British Glass-Steagall? In our white paper on reforming
financial regulation we said that there was a strong case for dividing
up those activities for a range of reasons. However, we feel that the
best way to do so is not by unilateral action, but by international
consensus.</div>
<a name="10011242000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">Meanwhile,
there are measures that we can take to improve regulation to try to
tackle some of the issues that have emerged from the size and
complexity of such institutions. There are ways in which we are able to
impose a higher capital requirement for larger banks, which provides a
bigger buffer if they suffer losses and changes the economics of a
large bank. If we ensure that there is a closer correlation between the
capital requirements and the level of risk that people undertake, we
may see a separation of utility-type functions from higher-risk
activity.</div><a name="10011242000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">Technically,
I think the hon. Gentleman&#146;s amendment may be deficient, which
is a rare statement for me to make&#151;that is a phrase that the
hon. Gentleman uses quite often to talk about me. I am not sure that
his amendment delivers what he seeks, as the case may be that a group
can have a number of authorised persons, and he would not deliver his
outcome of a break-up of banks&#151;they would just have more
authorised persons within a group. However, I do not wish to be
pedantic.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column350" />Column number: 350</div><a name="10011242000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman&#146;s amendment illustrates one of the challenges that we
saw with Lehman Brothers, which is that a single institution can be
very complex, and very difficult to wind up. One will then force a
position either to rescue that institution or let it fail. We saw the
consequences of allowing Lehman to fail. It triggered a fresh wave of
uncertainty in the market and led to a further set of actions to
stabilise the banking system. Also, the administration of Lehman
Brothers&#146; operation in the UK will, I suspect, be one of the
most expensive administration processes, because of the complexity of
the records, the fact that trading on Lehman&#146;s own account was
on the same ledger as Lehman&#146;s trading for its clients, and
because there were no rules or plan in place to wind up the business in
an orderly fashion. I know that the Financial Services Secretary has
announced some progress on
that.</div><a name="10011242000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are complex issues that we need to think about; we are talking about
complicated operations. The hon. Gentleman suggests that we might break
up &#147;authorised person&#148; into several persons. There are
many different ways in which banks can structure their operations. Some
could be heavily subsidiarised, with different activities in different
subsidiaries. Others could have all their operations within one
subsidiary. What would happen if there was proprietary trading,
commercial lending and retail deposits in one institution? There are
arrangements in place to protect retail deposits, but it may be
difficult to segregate those activities and save them separately from
the rest of the banking activity. That is why it is important that we
look at the plans set out in clause
12.</div><a name="10011242000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Governor of the Bank of England said in October
that</div><a name="10011242000271"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;both
the structure and regulation of banking in the UK need reform. Banks
increased both the size and leverage of their balance sheets to levels
that threatened stability of the system as a whole. They remain
extraordinarily dependent on the public sector for support. That was
necessary in the immediate crisis, but is not
sustainable&#148;</div><a name="10011242000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">in
the long term. There are many different regulatory responses that we
can take, and one of them is to have living wills&#151;the resolution
and recovery plans that clause 12
allows.</div><a name="10011242000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">Andrew
Bailey, the chief cashier at the Bank of England, talked about the
range of responses that there could be to complex institutions, and he
identified three elements: regulation, structure and resolution. The
recovery and resolution plans fall within the resolution strand of his
thought. There is widespread international agreement. We talked about
living wills and the need for them in our white paper in July 2009.
There is work going on internationally on how they might work in
practice. The FSA has summarised some of the issues in an appendix to
its discussion paper on the Turner
review.</div><a name="10011242000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me give some detail on what the plans could entail. The recovery plan
should include: detailed plans of the businesses and subsidiaries that
could be sold to third parties in any contingencies; the extent to
which the business could be de-risked in a relatively short space of
time; and the ability to withstand the failure of the largest
counterparties. How do they safeguard themselves against contagion? One
of the untold stories about Lehman Brothers is that its collapse did
not lead to the widespread contagion and the lock-down in markets that
people might have expected. Recovery is about a business sorting itself
out and moving to a more stable position.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column351" />Column number: 351</div><a name="10011242000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">The resolution
plans tie into the special resolution regime set up at the time of the
Banking Act 2009, and they mesh into the responsibilities that the Bank
of England and others have as a consequence of that regime. That
relates to issues such as liquidation, transferring deposits,
introducing a bridge bank, placing banks into temporary public
ownership and deposit protection. However, the plans are at an early
stage, and there are issues that I want to raise with the
Minister.</div><a name="10011242000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
discussion paper published last year refers to a pilot project that
began at the end of 2009, in which a small number of banks will produce
draft resolution plans. Can the Minister confirm that the pilot is
under way? Can he tell the Committee which banks are taking part?
Pilots are important because they determine the type of information
that we need in the plans. We do not know what sort of information will
be required. The Bill is drafted broadly to ensure that the FSA has the
power to collect the sort of information required. Until we know the
outcome of the pilot, it is difficult to know precisely what will be
required, what the cost of the plans will be and how much information
will be needed. Also, what will the institutions have to do as a
consequence of the plans?</div>
<a name="10011242000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">That goes
back to a slightly different approach to that taken in the amendment
tabled by the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West. Some
institutions have raised the question of whether the plans will force
them to subsidiarise if they are operating as a single entity. Although
the hon. Gentleman&#146;s permissive amendment would make that option
specific, there are questions. An institution might ask, &#147;Will
one of the outcomes of my discussion with the FSA about my plan be a
requirement for me to separate out the activities of different
subsidiaries and to undo some of the group structures that are in
place?&#148; That is a valid question.</div>
<a name="10011242000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">One issue
that flows from the pilot&#151;this is not addressed in the impact
assessment, because we are at an early stage&#151;is the cost of the
plans. How voluminous will they be? What will be the level of detail?
How expensive will it be not only to draw them up initially but to keep
them up to date? There is a potentially significant cost that we need
to bear in mind. That affects the competitiveness of banks based in the
UK, compared to others in the global market. That is why it is
important to think about the international
context.</div><a name="10011242000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">Work
is being done internationally to develop the plans, but will the UK
lead the way in their implementation? Have we specifically thought
through the costs and benefits of that? It is worth pointing out that
principle 8 in the Financial Stability Forum&#146;s work on
cross-border co-operation and crisis management says:</div>
<a name="10011242000272"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;authorities
will strongly encourage firms to maintain contingency plans and
procedures for use in a wind down situation...and regularly review them
to ensure that they remain accurate and
adequate&#148;.</div><a name="10011242000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
first words in that quotation are &#147;authorities will strongly
encourage&#148;, but the UK is mandating the preparation of such
plans through the clause. There is concern that the UK is moving faster
than other jurisdictions and about whether that is appropriate. The
British Bankers Association has said:</div>
<a name="10011242000273"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It is
a matter for concern that the FSA is being placed under a statutory
duty to make rules for the production of recovery and resolution plans
without there first being agreement on the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column352" />Column number: 352</div>fundamental objectives behind the initiative. These statutory provisions
would front run international agreement on the need for, and contents
of,
RRPs.&#148;</div><a name="10011242000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
its response to the Committee&#146;s debate, the CBI, which supports
living wills in principle, has said:</div>
<a name="10011242000274"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;this clause
must be consistent with any international agreement otherwise this
clause should be removed from the face of the Bill before it receives
Royal Assent. Additionally the CBI does not believe that legislation is
required for the FSA to implement these new requirements at the
appropriate
time.&#148;</div><a name="10011242000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">Can
the Minister give some assurances about the pace of development of such
things internationally and about how we are ensuring that the FSA
remains in step with international agreements?</div>
<a name="10011242000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have
talked about the coverage of the plans in  the context of
banks, and the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West, spoke about
them in the context of bank break-ups. However, clause 12 is not
limited to banks, or even deposit takers. The clause gives the FSA
the</div><a name="10011242000275"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;power
to make general rules so as to make rules requiring each authorised
person (or each authorised person of a specified description) to
prepare, and keep up-to-date, a recovery
plan.&#148;</div><a name="10011242000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although
we have been talking about plans in the context of banks, the
provisions could apply to insurers, asset managers, hedge funds,
independent financial advisers and the insurance brokers on the high
streets in our constituencies. Everyone could be required to have a
recovery and resolution plan; there is no barrier in the Bill
restricting them purely to banks. I am sure that that is a conscious
decision, but we need to understand whether this is the first stage in
a process that will require all institutions to have recovery and
resolution plans, or whether the intention is simply to restrict them
to banks and licensed deposit takers. Clearly, institutions other than
banks, such as building societies and credit unions, hold
customers&#146; money, and the special resolution regime also applies
to them. It would be helpful to have some clarity on that.</div>
<a name="10011242000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">The key
issues are uncertainty about what the plans will include, the fact that
the FSA appears to be in the lead&#151;that is not necessarily a bad
thing, but we need to understand the balance of the risks&#151;and
what sectors will need to have resolution and recovery
plans.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011242000348"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. Before we proceed, it will not have
escaped the notice of the Committee that we have just embarked on a
clause stand part debate. The rule is that we can have only one, so we
are now entertaining the amendment that has been moved and a clause
stand part debate. There will be no separate clause stand part debate
on the clause.</div>
<a name="10011242000251"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent">There
is another point that I would like to make. Before I came to Committee
from an Adjournment debate in which I had participated, I received a
call from the office of the Chairman of Ways and Means, indicating that
there has been a request for a meeting of the Programming Sub-Committee
to be held at 1.30 pm. I have agreed to chair it, if it is
held. I say to the Committee&#151;and the usual channels, who are
present&#151;that if we are going to hold that meeting, it might make
sense to do so at 1 o&#146;clock, immediately after this sitting,
rather than at 1.30 pm, but I will endeavour to assist, whichever is
more convenient to those
involved.</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column353" />Column number: 353</div><a name="10011242000112"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011242000349"></a>Mr.
Breed:</b> I will include my remarks on clause stand part in
the discussion of the amendment. I understand the reasons why it has
been tabled. It has helped us to raise the issue, which has to be
tackled at some time or another, as the hon. Member for Wolverhampton,
South-West said. However, I do not think that that should be done, for
a variety of reasons, either in this Committee or in the timing,
because international co-operation is vital. Nevertheless, it is quite
right that the big question is whether we can afford to have very large
banks attached to medium-sized countries, with all the associated
risks&#151;of course, we know what has happened in Iceland and
elsewhere&#151;and the issue needs to be tackled. I do not think that
the difficulties will come down the line to us as quickly as the hon.
Gentleman suggested. Nevertheless, that big issue has to be
tackled.</div><a name="10011242000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have been rather lukewarm to recovery and resolution plans in clause
12. I am not certain how they will operate, what their effect will be
on competition, what the overall costs will be and what value they will
have. Often, unexpected and unforeseen&#151;almost impossible to
anticipate&#151;events can cause a
catastrophe.</div><a name="10011242000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">All
the pre-planning in the world and all the recovery and resolution plans
that may be put in place may simply not be able to anticipate exactly
what will befall this sector or, indeed, any other sector. We all know
that risk plans are almost part of the daily life of practically
everything now&#151;in education, science and the police force, for
example, we have to make risk assessments, but too often, the
assessment as perceived does not cover the precise problem that
sometimes arises.</div>
<a name="10011242000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think that
the whole object is the same. We are going to look through general
rules at some stage, and that is the interesting part. I look at this
in terms of macro and micro. In a macro sense, when we talk about
Glass-Steagall, splitting up investment banks and narrowing banking,
such macro-type decisions must, by necessity, include a considerable
amount of international co- operation. Questions such as how to
split up large groups and how to compartmentalise parts of
international businesses in those large groups are difficult to answer.
Indeed, they will be subject to different regimes, different legal
systems and interpretations and different capital requirements. That
will be a difficult aspect.</div>
<a name="10011242000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
simplicity that has been referred to and sometimes accepted by my hon.
Friend the Member for Twickenham does not take into account the fact
that, when Glass-Steagall was set up, the banking system was wholly
different from what it is today. The sheer complexities,
internationalisation, interconnectivity and scale are of a
significantly different proportion. Therefore, some sort of beefed-up
Glass-Steagall is not appropriate&#151;we have to look at it
completely differently. However, I understand the context of trying to
reduce businesses to a size where they can be properly regulated and
where they would not cause a systemic risk, which is likely if they are
too important to fail.</div>
<a name="10011242000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is also
is the micro part, on which we should concentrate more when talking
about recovery and resolution plans. Even in the domestic sense, if we
ignore the international parts of large banking groups, there is a
major complexity in the interconnectivity of subsidiaries and
subsidiaries of subsidiaries. We know that from our evidence session in
the Treasury Committee not that long ago, when we invited the chief
auditor of a large firm of accountants to explain the domestic
arrangements of the various companies within the HSBC 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column354" />Column number: 354</div>group. He was completely unable to do so. That a chief auditor cannot
explain the interconnectivity, where the notes to accounts now occupy
some 60 pages, as opposed to the accounts themselves occupying about
six pages, demonstrates that the real complexity is such that perhaps
that in itself needs to be tackled to reduce the whole subsidiary
complexity.</div>
<a name="10011242000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">Such a system
is often used to minimise tax, not to avoid or evade it, and to create
a suite of companies capable of assisting the banks and their clients
to implement ever-increasingly complex transactions between a variety
of the subsidiaries. That ultimately means a significant reduction to
the
taxman.</div><a name="10011242000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">Identifying
such structures and creating simpler ones could be part of the
resolution and recovery plans, so that even understanding the way in
which the huge groups have been put together would be more helpful in
identifying early the problems that will arise. Such action might even
help to refuse certain acquisitions or mergers in the terms in which
they are envisaged. Companies are sometimes brought into a group in
ways that do not assist the understanding of the relationship between
each part of the group. In the micro sense&#151;the domestic
sense&#151;some work can be done, which will be helpful, but in the
macro sense, it is a more difficult
area.</div><a name="10011242000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
other aspect that I am worried about is keeping things up to date. We
know that keeping things up to date is a constant problem. Yesterday, I
was part of the tax law rewrite Bill, a 10-year project to rewrite
something that made very little difference to the amount of revenue
that we received. Goodness knows how much 10 years of rewriting and
updating things costs, but let us imagine the costs of rewriting and
updating resolution and recovery plans to respond to the Finance Bill
each year and the way in which the legal framework of other countries
had undertaken mergers, acquisitions or even sales of businesses. That
could be a never-ending process, like the tax law rewrite Bill and
become an extraordinary cost to individuals. I just wonder whether we
will receive value for the money that will be
expended.</div><a name="10011242000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
respect of competition and innovation, we do not want to create a
homogeneous system, whereby we just have shades of a certain business
in different financial groups and there is little to choose between
products and how they operate. They are so constricted in the way in
which they have to respond to recovery and resolution plans that it
does not give them the element of innovation or competition that we
want. I have some general concerns such as that, but the clause is
right overall. The rules that will result after discussions with the
Treasury and the Bank of England will be a key part, and perhaps at
that stage and when the international scene is a little clearer, the
more macro aspects of the matter could be considered. However, although
I cannot support the amendment, it has enabled a valuable contribution
to be made to the
debate.</div><a name="10011242000122"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10011242000350"></a><b class="B">John
Howell</b> (Henley) (Con): I, too, thank the hon. Member for
Wolverhampton, South-West for tabling the amendment, which exposes one
of the great weaknesses of the clause and, indeed, the Bill. The
Minister has said on a number of occasions that the Bill will set up
various frameworks, but the difficulty is that those frameworks must be
so wide because all the retrofitting, whether against international
agreements or against the detailed regulations about how the living
wills will work, must be done later.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column355" />Column number: 355</div><a name="10011242000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">The problem
with such frameworks is that anything can be put into them, and there
is no clarity about what is going into them at the moment. I understand
fully why the hon. Gentleman wishes to bring more clarity to the Bill.
In that general aim, he has a large amount of support. However, some
practical issues relating to the break-up of corporate structures have
been mentioned. Clearly, that was in the Minister&#146;s mind during
the evidence session.</div>
<a name="10011242000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
said that the living wills would be a last resort, but he went on to
describe them, colourfully, as a manual for surgery. Surgery involves
cutting bits out, rather than patching things up. Medicine is patching
things up and making the patient better; surgery is the fun bit,
involving taking things out and throwing them away. Unfortunately, he
did not speculate how the living wills might be used. That is a great
shame. Although we do not need speculation, we need more substantial
detail of how they might be used, what they might look like and how
they will be judged.</div>
<a name="10011242000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">The question
of how they will be judged touches on the amendment as well. Subsection
(5) of proposed new section 139B says that the plans must be
&#147;satisfactory&#148;, but we never understand what
&#147;satisfactory&#148; is or how it will be judged. We know whose
opinion will be taken into account in judging whether a plan is
satisfactory, but there are no rules or benchmarks. There is nothing
that one would expect of a corporate entity in terms of measuring what
is
done.</div><a name="10011242000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">Despite
everything that has happened, it is slightly naive to believe that
companies do not undertake their own risk modelling. Indeed, the FSA
already requires some contingency planning. We need to understand the
difference between what companies already do and the FSA already
requires and what the Bill will deliver. To use another phrase that has
come out throughout debates on the Bill, I am trying to tease out what
additionality the Bill will bring. In relation to the break-up of banks
and other financial institutions, that may well be the best solution,
but emphasising that with an amendment to the Bill skews it the wrong
way.</div>
<a name="10011242000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">We also need
to recognise that corporate structures are not static. Companies are
always evolving their structures for different commercial reasons. A
lot of emphasis has been put on the structure of that, for a number of
reasons. I saw one thing mentioned once in a fleeting reference that
was never picked up again but is incredibly important. In any corporate
structuring or restructuring in the financial services sector,
reputational risk is an overriding consideration. We talk openly about
financial risk, but nobody has mentioned reputational risk and the idea
of protecting it.</div>
<a name="10011242000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">Any
suggestion of insider trading is an easy way to trash one&#146;s
reputation. In the recent case of the Australian Securities and
Investments Commission <i class="I">v. </i>Citigroup, we saw how the idea of
insider trading is being taken to an extreme. Citigroup acted for one
company in a takeover battle for another company. There were Chinese
walls between the two teams on the takeover and the proprietary trading
team at Citigroup, which wanted to trade in the shares of the company
being acquired. The issue that raged at that time was whether a general
aside between two members of the same firm was sufficient to indicate
that the bank&#146;s subsequent sale of the shares on its own behalf
was evidence of insider trading.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column356" />Column number: 356</div><a name="10011242000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not want
to blow the issue out of proportion, but it is important; it is one of
the issues that is taken into account in putting together or changing a
corporate structure and one of the complex issues mentioned by my hon.
Friend the Member for Fareham that need to be taken into
account.</div><a name="10011242000304"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.45
am</div><a name="10011242000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
logistics need to be explored in further detail. The Institute of
Chartered Accountants has made much of the logistical problem of
gathering information and undertaking analysis and of whether the plans
will be updated periodically or whether they will be rolling plans,
which is what I suspect many of them will turn out to be, because
situations change frequently in the light of new acquisitions and the
addition of new businesses.</div>
<a name="10011242000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for South-East Cornwall, who speaks for the Liberal Democrats,
said that we must ensure that we do not reduce the financial services
sector to the lowest common denominator. We do not want uniform
business models, which increase risk because there is only one model
operating in the market. That forces out innovation, and that is not in
the interests of the consumer, the taxpayer or the economy as a
whole.</div>
<a name="10011242000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">Through
living wills, we are trying to model stressed situations. I put that in
the plural because people will need to model not just a single stressed
situation, but a variety of stressed situations. Those situations may
have very different outcomes; some may require the break-up of the bank
or parts of it, while others may not. We need to be careful about how
we approach the issue so that we achieve proportionality and identity
problems and what we are doing to solve them. That would be made
clearer if there was far more in the clause about what we
are trying to achieve and how we will go about it.</div>
<a name="10011242000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">The cost of
the proposals is relevant and has been mentioned several times. There
is no costing in the impact assessment and, therefore, no comparison of
the cost here and in other countries. I am quite surprised by that
because banks are already required to provide contingency plans and
they already do a lot of their own modelling. It would not have been
beyond the wit of the Treasury to have come up with a range of costs,
because it loves ranges. The impact assessment for the next clause, on
short selling, includes a range of benefits that starts at &#163;106
million and goes up to &#163;1,066 million. The Treasury loves
ranges, so it could surely have come up with a range to give some
indication of the costs in this case. That is yet another example of
how providing only a framework, and a loose framework at that, leads to
people asking more questions, rather than moving us towards a regime
that leads to a resolution.</div>
<a name="10011242000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Wolverhampton, South-West is right that the future will hold
more banking crises. I cannot remember the exact figure, but the
International Monetary Fund produced an assessment early in the last
decade pointing out that there were well over 50 banking
crises&#151;I think that the figure was nearer 70&#151;in the last
30 years of the last century. Those crises all followed a similar
pattern to the recent crisis, and we need to ask more
generally&#151;not just in this Committee&#151;why that was not
spotted and why the lessons were not learned from previous crises. If
living wills help in the future that will be great, but there is such
imprecision in the clause that I am not sure that it adds much to our
understanding of how they will work in
practice.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011242000351"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> Before I reply to the debate on clause 12 and the
amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton,
South-West, I would like to expand briefly on my earlier comments about
the difference between the FSA&#146;s current code and the general
rules that the Bill requires it to make in respect of remuneration. As
I said to the hon. Member for Fareham, the current FSA code is part of
the FSA rulebook. However, it is not the case that any breach of an FSA
rule on remuneration will automatically make a contract void. Breach of
a rule will have that effect only if the rule itself provides for that.
The present code does not do that, and will need to be supplemented by
new rules to be made by the FSA under the authority provided in the
Bill, setting out specific prohibitions and expressly stating that
contravention of the provisions will make a contract void. I hope that
that clarifies any confusion that might have
arisen.</div>
<a name="10011242000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">At the outset
of his contribution, my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton,
South-West said that the &#147;too big to fail&#148; issue was
being ignored by politicians. I do not believe that to be true as there
has been substantial discussion in the UK and internationally. However,
there could perhaps be more debate, and my hon. Friend has certainly
provided us with the opportunity to do that this morning.</div>
<a name="10011242000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall make
a few broader comments on clause 12, before responding specifically to
the amendment. I shall also pick up on some of the comments made by the
hon. Member for South-East Cornwall. I agree that Glass-Steagall-type
provisions that date back to the 1930s are not likely to be relevant,
even if they are beefed up, as he suggested, for today&#146;s
circumstances. There is no easy or simple distinction between what is
sometimes called utility banking and investment banking, and sometimes
pejoratively referred to as casino banking. Experience of the past two
or more years has shown that firms that stay close to their knitting
would not be regarded as performing a utility function, and could get
into trouble just as investment banks got into trouble. It is well
known that the Government do not believe that the case has been made
for a Glass-Steagall split between retail and investment banking
activities.</div>
<a name="10011242000138"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011242000352"></a>Mr.
Breed:</b> I entirely agree with the Minister. With
separation, we need to understand that the banks that were not in the
casino sometimes had access to it. Northern Rock was clearly a mortgage
bank, but it funded itself by having access to the casino-type aspects,
which was the real problem. It is not only large banks that clearly do
both&#151;the funding of banking generally has fundamentally changed
and includes this aspect of funding, which is difficult to
reverse.</div>
<a name="10011242000139"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011242000353"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes a valid point. The issue
of being &#147;too big to fail&#148; is of central importance, and
I argue strongly that one of the ways in which the Government are
responding is through clause 12 and the proposals on
recovery and resolution plans, which are sometimes referred to as
living wills.</div>
<a name="10011242000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
sets out the consultation arrangements between the UK authorities in
relation to recovery and resolution plans, provides the FSA with
additional enforcement powers relating to the collection of information
and requires the FSA to have regard to international developments in
making rules for recovery and resolution plans. The point about having
regard to international 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column358" />Column number: 358</div>developments explicitly recognises some of the concerns raised by the
CBI and others. I will say more about that in a
moment.</div><a name="10011242000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
made it clear in our White Paper, &#147;Reforming Financial
Markets&#148;, that our strategy for dealing with the systemic risk
posed by the potential failure of individual financial firms includes a
number of strands such as improved market discipline, enhanced
prudential regulation and supervision and strengthened market
infrastructure. Another key element, which is relevant, is the focus on
stronger recovery and resolution arrangements to reduce the likelihood
and impact of banks&#146; failure. Of course, the Banking Act 2009
has already extended significantly the resolution tools available to
the authorities, principally in relation to banks and building
societies, and firms&#146; preparation and maintenance of RRPs is
intended to build on that more
generally.</div><a name="10011242000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
see recovery and resolution plans as a key tool for institutions and
authorities to mitigate the systemic risk posed by firms and promote
long-term financial stability. As a key new part of the supervisory
toolkit, RRPs will create regulatory incentives for firms to avoid
being systemically risky, because the quality of a firm&#146;s
recovery and resolution plan should have a direct bearing on
supervisors&#146; overall assessment of the prudential risk posed by
the firm. In short, if a firm&#146;s recovery plan or resolution plan
is not good enough, there will be regulatory consequences. The
Government and the FSA are clear that recovery and resolution plans and
tougher prudential requirements are key elements of a comprehensive
policy to deal with the risk to financial stability posed by
firms.</div><a name="10011242000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">Perhaps
even more fundamentally, we see RRPs as an important means of reducing
the moral hazard arising where firms are perceived as too big to fail
and benefit from an implied safety net of public support. We want
firms, no matter how big or complex they are, to face up to the
potential reality of their failure. Recovery plans will require them to
have realistic plans in place for coping with stressed circumstances,
and resolution plans will enable the authorities to prepare for the use
of their resolution toolkit if recovery is not
possible.</div><a name="10011242000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of
course, the FSA already has discretion to make general rules on such
matters, which will be further underpinned by its new financial
stability objective in clause 5. However, clause 12 places an express
duty on the FSA to make rules relating to recovery and resolution
plans, exemplifying our strong commitment to taking forward the
measures.</div><a name="10011242000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">By
setting out in legislation that such rules must cover the firms subject
to part 1 of the Banking Act 2009&#151;banks and building
societies&#151;we are prioritising the types of firm that have needed
most taxpayer support in the past and whose failure has impacted on
depositors and on financial stability most severely. The fact that the
duty covers all banks and building societies recognises, as
demonstrated by events here in the UK during the crisis, that smaller
firms can also have a significant impact on national financial
stability and that their resolution can present its own
difficulties.</div><a name="10011242000146"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011242000354"></a>John
Howell:</b> The Minister will be aware of the Building
Societies Association&#146;s argument that many building societies
are small. The BSA questions the proportionality of the measure for
such firms. Does he agree that it would be much better to discuss the
matter with a cost-benefit analysis covering
them?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column359" />Column number: 359</div><a name="10011242000147"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011242000355"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I will say something about that in a moment, but
I wanted to address the wider issue of
scope.</div><a name="10011242000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
anticipate that the scope of recovery and resolution plans will be
expanded to other types of firm. The Government intend to make an order
setting out the timetable after consulting with the Financial Services
Authority. By taking that approach, we are enabling the FSA to comply
with the duty to make rules in a risk-based and proportionate manner. I
will say something more on that in a
moment.</div><a name="10011242000305"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12
noon</div><a name="10011242000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Bill&#146;s provisions do not prescribe the content of recovery and
resolution plans. That will be set out in rules, which the FSA will
draft based on the evidence gathered from its ongoing pilot project and
taking into account the ongoing international work. In response to the
point raised by the hon. Member for Fareham, I do not think that it
would be appropriate to disclose who is taking part in the pilot
project. However, I can say to him that there is a sample of banks, and
we expect the outcomes of the pilot work to be known by the third
quarter of
2010.</div><a name="10011242000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
pilot will contribute to addressing some of the wider policy
considerations on the cost of recovery and resolution plans&#151;that
point was raised by the hon. Member for Henley&#151;and their
potential impact on firms&#146; business models and profitability,
and deal with questions on restructuring. Before making the rules, the
FSA will be obliged to consult and publish a full cost-benefit analysis
in the normal way. I hope that that reassures the hon.
Gentleman.</div><a name="10011242000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
this context, I stress that while we are clear that there will be some
cost to firms from the preparation and maintenance of such plans, there
can be no doubt that, following the events of the last 18 months,
firms, particularly those that are systemically significant, must bear
a fair share of the cost of increased financial stability, which will
include the cost of preparing recovery and resolution
plans.</div><a name="10011242000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
also want to say a little more about the international dimension. We
all understand that our financial services industry operates in a
global and inter-connected environment. That is why the Bill explicitly
states that in making its rules on recovery and resolution plans the
FSA must have regard to international developments in that area. There
is a growing international consensus that such plans&#151;be they
called recovery and resolution plans, living wills, wind-down plans or
even funeral plans, as I have heard in some cases&#151;are a vital
tool in dealing with the systemic risk posed by firms, not least large,
complex, cross-border firms. The G20&#146;s communiqu(c) on 7
November explicitly called
for</div><a name="10011242000276"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
rapid development of internationally consistent, firm-specific recovery
and resolution plans and tools by
end-2010&#148;.</div><a name="10011242000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
work that we are doing in the UK, through the legislation that we are
discussing today, needs to be seen in that
context.</div><a name="10011242000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">Through
the pilot programme and our close work in international forums such as
the Financial Stability Board, we are taking a leading international
role. We want to ensure that the financial services sector in the UK is
stable and can fulfil its role of supporting the real economy, which is
why we have been leading that ambitious pilot programme that will
support and inform our own 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column360" />Column number: 360</div>domestic legislation and European and international work streams in that
area. I take the point that has been made by the CBI and others that it
needs to be seen in an international context. I believe that the Bill
makes explicit reference to allow that to happen, and it is certainly
our policy intention that that should be the
case.</div><a name="10011242000155"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011242000356"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> If by the time we get to the end of 2010 there is
no international consensus about living wills and detailed guidance
drawn up at a global level, does the Minister believe that the benefits
of living wills are such&#151;in terms of the stability that it
brings to the UK&#151;that it would be worth proceeding with a
variant of those in the absence of an international
consensus?</div><a name="10011242000156"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011242000357"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I do not believe that there will be an absence of
an international consensus. Indeed, at a higher level, agreement has
already been reached on the usefulness of such tools. What needs to go
on now are more detailed discussions about the content of recovery and
resolution plans. That is the task for the next few months. Our pilot
work is really feeding into the international discussions that will
take place on the matter. As was said in the communiqu(c), we need
some internationally consistent approaches to the implementation of the
plans in the future, but I do not anticipate problems in getting a
significant level of international agreement that such things are
necessary for financial stability and should be
introduced.</div>
<a name="10011242000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">With regard
to the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton,
South-West, I certainly understand his intention behind it. I do not
support the idea of breaking up by a certain deadline. The amendment is
not necessary and I shall set out briefly the reasons why. We are not
legislating for additional powers for the FSA to force firms to
restructure their operations as a result of their recovery and
resolution plans. My hon. Friend will be aware that the FSA already has
plans, as part of its toolkit of disciplinary measures, to require firm
restructuring. The Bill obliges the FSA to take appropriate action if
it considers that a recovery or resolution plan fails to make
satisfactory provision. The FSA can apply the whole range of its
current set of tools, including disciplinary measures, when it
considers that a recovery or a resolution plan is inadequate. It can
use those tools to achieve significant changes in an authorised firm,
which could include structural
changes.</div><a name="10011242000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
tools at the FSA&#146;s disposal include offsetting measures, such as
discretionary capital add-ons or so-called own initiative variation of
permission powers, which ultimately can include the withdrawal of part
IV permissions. The FSA therefore already has powers that may achieve
structural changes. My hon. Friend will also be aware of the
international debate on whether additional new powers would be
necessary and desirable, and what would be the appropriate body to
exercise them. Its pilot work will again be helpful in that regard, as
will the progress that is taking place on the international template
that has been developed by the Financial Stability Board. We should not
be proceeding ahead of clear evidence and international agreement with
regard to additional new powers, which could have significant
implications for the competitiveness of the UK. It is important that we
continue to lead and participate in  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column361" />Column number: 361</div>the international debate about what additional powers might be required
for the future. The amendment is not necessary or desirable at this
stage, and I hope that I have convinced my hon. Friend of
that.</div><a name="10011242000160"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011242000358"></a>Rob
Marris:</b> This has been an interesting debate. We have heard
some thoughtful speeches and the discussion has been of a higher level
than took place earlier on some of the minutiae. Two main themes have
come through, one of which was the international dimension of the size
of major banks and so on. The other was the complexity of the
structures of many such institutions, with different models not a
shared model. Indeed, as the hon. Member for South-East Cornwall said,
most people cannot understand the structure of some
banks.</div><a name="10011242000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
certainly agree that there is a strong international dimension. I take
my hat off to the Government for making, through clause 12, the
resolution and recovery plans part of the armoury of defence for us in
the United Kingdom, and for introducing and discussing them at an
international level. I am glad that more international debate is going
on than I had realised and, from what my hon. Friend the Minister said,
more domestic debate. If banks go down again, they could bring us all
down with them because we cannot afford to bail them out, and the
evidence is that what I regard as a pretty important issue is not
getting through a whole lot to the average
politician.</div><a name="10011242000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the recovery and resolution plan, the Minister says that in a sense we
do not want to get ahead of ourselves on international discussions. I
say to my hon. Friend the Minister, &#147;What if those international
discussions lead to a position where internationally they are saying
that there should be such powers to break up very large financial
institutions?&#148; I suspect that the United States might come to
that conclusion. They have already started to do that in some ways in
terms of breakdown. My amendment is only permissive.</div>
<a name="10011242000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">I get a sense
from some of this debate that the recovery and resolution plans in
clause 12, which I seek to amend, have an echo of sitting on the
Titanic debating how many lifeboats we have, whether the staff are
trained in putting people into lifeboats and how good the lookouts are,
rather than the fact that the Titanic is a bit too big and should not
be putting to sea at all. Despite the assurances about the level of
domestic and international debates, I am concerned that we could get
into a situation, which has happened before, and it happens to people
in their personal lives and in the body politic, that when the pain
goes away we do not go to the doctor&#151;particularly true of men,
of course&#151;and when things calm down, we collectively take our
eye off the ball, both domestically and internationally. I therefore I
urge the Treasury to keep its eye on the ball, even with things
quietening
down.</div><a name="10011242000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am heartened by the fact that the Minister intimated that the
FSA&#146;s existing powers could lead to a requirement by the FSA for
a financial institution to undertake structural changes, and I take
such changes to include in certain extreme circumstances the breaking
up of that institution. On that basis, and with that reassurance from
the Minister, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="10011242000165"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the
Bill.</div>
<a name="10011242000168"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011242000359"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I do not want to say a huge amount about the
clause. There was some discussion at the evidence sessions about
whether the clause was needed, because similar paths had been taken by
the FSA during the financial crisis to tackle some of the issues
relating to short selling of certain banks&#146; shares. It was
argued that the FSA took action under its market abuse powers and that
that was not appropriate. Indeed, the British Bankers Association
said:</div>
<a name="10011242000277"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Our
members consider that it is inappropriate that the FSA&#146;s current
rules on the emergency restriction of short selling sit within the
market abuse rules of the FSA handbook. Rather, it would be better for
them to be moved to the disclosure rules. The placement of generalised
rules on short selling into the market abuse rules wrongly associates
all forms of short selling with
abuse.&#148;</div><a name="10011242000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
CBI echoes that. It
says:</div><a name="10011242000278"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
previous temporary measures adopted by the FSA in respect of short
selling were taken under the market abuse regime partly because the FSA
believed it had no other power to
act.&#148;</div><a name="10011242000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
welcome the fact that it is now put on a formal basis, although it
still sits within the part of the Financial Services and Markets Act
2000 that relates to market abuse. It has not gone all the way in
tackling the concern that the BBA
has.</div><a name="10011242000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister has defended short selling on a number of occasions on the
Floor of the House&#151;once in response to a question by my hon.
Friend the Member for Macclesfield (Sir Nicholas Winterton). The
Minister is a very clear opponent of that form of trading in markets.
Of course, it can give rise to a number of issues. The impact
assessment characterises the problems with short selling. It can lead
to three aspects of market failure: market abuse, disorderly markets
potentially leading to a depositor run, and transparency deficiencies.
It was around the issue of disorderly markets that such changes were
largely introduced.</div>
<a name="10011242000306"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.15
pm</div><a name="10011242000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
do not, therefore, have an issue with the introduction of part 8A, but
I do want to raise a question about the wording of proposed new section
131B(1). My assumption is that the Government are seeking to prevent
the short selling of certain financial instruments, such as the shares
of Barclays bank, HSBC or the Royal Bank of Scotland. However, it is
not entirely clear from subsection (1) whether that is the
full limit of their ambitions, because it states:</div>
<a name="10011242000279"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Authority may make rules prohibiting in specified cases persons from
engaging in short
selling&#148;.</div><a name="10011242000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am not sure whether that means that the Government would like to stop
an institution short selling. They might tell a particular hedge fund
or investment manager to stop short selling, rather than saying that
they want to stop the short selling of a particular financial
instrument. Will the Minister clarify that, because it would seem odd
for the rules to focus on stopping one institution from engaging in
short selling rather than applying across the market? If that is the
Government&#146;s intention, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column363" />Column number: 363</div>they could use powers elsewhere in the Bill instead. I would be grateful
for some clarity on that aspect of the rules from the
Minister.</div>
<a name="10011242000174"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011242000360"></a>John
Howell:</b> I have three issues on the clause. The first is
the definition, the second is the clarity of the proposals and the
third is the relationship with the international regime.</div>
<a name="10011242000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">There has not
been a legal definition of short selling to date, so the Bill sets a
precedent. The Committee will recall the evidence session at which
Simon Gleeson of Clifford Chance said that the Bill provides</div>
<a name="10011242000280"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a basis for
banning selling. The definition of short selling, as set out in the
legislation, is any transaction in which someone might benefit if the
value subsequently goes
down.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report, Financial
Services Public Bill Committee, </i>10 December 2009; c.
105.]</div><a name="10011242000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">It was
commented that the proposals were more akin to banning selling than
short selling. That witness session revealed a wish for a more
thoughtful definition. There was an acknowledgement that it was
difficult to define short selling. The lawyers offered us the
opportunity to have a paper providing more evidence regarding what a
definition might look like. I am not sure whether anything has yet
emerged, but it would be useful to pursue it, because there is concern
that, by common consent, the definition in the Bill still needs to be
fleshed out. My question, therefore, is how the definition will be
taken forward, given the concern about it among such distinguished
lawyers.</div><a name="10011242000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the clarity of the proposals, the clause proposes two
things&#151;emergency powers to stop short selling, which is largely
separate from abuse, although linked to it, and a disclosure regime. To
look first at the stopping part of the proposals, my hon. Friend the
Member for Fareham made a valid point, which was also made by the
British Bankers Association, when he asked what the purpose of the
proposals is. Is it to allow the FSA to suspend trading and stop
activity in a certain instrument or is it to stop certain firms from
undertaking such activity?</div>
<a name="10011242000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">The FSA
accepts that regulatory intervention is justified where there are
identified market failures and it is expected to deliver net benefits
to the market, and I see no disagreement about that. However, that
means that we need&#151;the CBI has called for this&#151;to know
more about the circumstances in which the provisions will be used and
how they will be used, given that the Bill is aimed principally not at
abuse, but at disorderly markets and transparency deficiencies. It is
relevant to link that to the assessment in the discussion paper that
the FSA produced on the issue almost a year ago. That paper looked at
six options, of which the stopping of the selling only when there was
an urgent need was the one that eventually came through into the Bill.
However, the circumstances need to be better defined because they were
not well defined in the document. Will the Minister comment on the
balance that we need between recognising the benefits of short
selling&#151;an increased number of sellers, improved liquidity,
increasing trade volumes and reducing the transaction costs and overall
improvements in efficiency&#151;and the specific problems that occur
in disorderly markets where there is an excess of volatility that can
lead to contagion.</div>
<a name="10011242000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">The FSA
document also pointed out that emergency measures themselves may lead
to additional volatility just because they have had to be taken and
brought into 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column364" />Column number: 364</div>use. Therefore, something about the circumstances that justify the
imposition of this measure would
help.</div><a name="10011242000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me repeat again that the FSA accepts that regulatory intervention is
justified when there are identified market failures and when it is
expected to deliver net benefits to the market. Paragraph 3.17
states:</div><a name="10011242000281"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It
is not clear whether a lack of transparency about the level of
short-selling and the identity of short sellers gave rise to a material
market failure. Further there is the question whether the benefits of
any mandatory disclosure requirements exceed the
cost.&#148;</div><a name="10011242000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
what evidence is there that disclosure will be useful in normal market
situations and will improve stability in volatile times? The FSA
document is principally considering market abuse, but we need to extend
beyond that. A process needs to take place in relation to the costs
involved. I did not mean to be entirely glowing about the range of
benefits that is put in here. A process seems to be under way of
bringing the number down. I was struck by the way in which the impact
assessment does not take into account opportunity costs because they
were unable to be quantified. They may be unable to be quantified, but
they are certainly not equal to zero, so a process needs to take place
in relation to
that.</div><a name="10011242000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
issue that I wanted to raise was the relationship with the
international regime. The Treasury has already admitted that the UK
currently has a wider definition of market views that many of its
European counterparts. Paragraph 5.2 of the FSA documents
states:</div><a name="10011242000282"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
know that market participants have encountered problems and significant
costs in having to comply with the variety of different regimes
introduced in the relevant jurisdictions.&#148;</div>
<a name="10011242000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">There have also been
calls for the regime to be applied as widely as possible
internationally. In February, the International Organization of
Securities Commission and the Committee of European Securities
Regulators had working parties on short selling with the aim of trying
to produce a draft law by the end of 2009. It will be good to have an
update on that. The issue is not consistent across the European Union.
David Ereira in his evidence session said that no assurances could be
given that what is being proposed in this clause will dovetail into the
EU, and that the UK was jumping the gun. He
said:</div><a name="10011242000283"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It
will probably work out all right, because the wording is sufficiently
wide that in all probability we will be able to come up with
appropriate regulations that fit within whatever comes out of the
international processes. It just seems to me more appropriate to wait
and see what comes out of those international
processes&#148;.<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report, Financial
Services Public Bill Committee, </i>12 January 2010; c. 110,
Q48.]</div><a name="10011242000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">If we
look at how prominent members of the European Union have dealt with the
issue over the past few months, we get a varied pattern. Austria saw it
as abuse and linked it to market manipulation and insider trading.
Belgium linked it to good order, integrity and transparency and
introduced rules that are restrictions on the vending of shares. The
Czech Republic took no action. Denmark&#146;s ban applies to short
selling in financial companies. Finland went for more supervision.
France aimed at short selling of financial sector securities and
Germany principally banned naked short selling of specific financial
institutions. That is a hugely disparate approach, and one can
completely understand where the lawyers who spoke in the
evidence-taking sessions were coming from when trying to get to grips
with the difficulties that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column365" />Column number: 365</div>companies face with this, and the need for consistency. I hope that the
Minister will provide some clarification on those
issues.</div><a name="10011242000185"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011242000361"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> Indeed I will. Let me set out the purpose and
thinking behind the clause before addressing the comments made by the
hon. Members for Henley and for Fareham. In clause 13, we are trying to
give the FSA the power to control all forms of short selling that might
threaten financial stability in the future. As has been demonstrated,
the FSA already has the power to control short selling, but under its
existing powers it can do that only when it considers that short
selling amounts to market abuse. Certain short selling
activities&#151;which legally cannot and should not be characterised
as market abuse&#151;might nevertheless give rise to disorderly
markets and create risks to financial stability. That is why new part
8A gives the FSA the power to control short selling, so as to protect
the stability of the financial system and maintain confidence in
it.</div>
<a name="10011242000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">Responses to
our public consultation showed overwhelming support for allowing the
FSA to place clear and independent restrictions on short selling, and
to require the disclosure of short selling. Under certain
circumstances, the FSA would be able to ban short selling in certain
financial instruments, such as shares in a particular bank. In response
to the hon. Member for Fareham, let me take the opportunity to clarify
that the powers would not enable the FSA to ban an individual firm from
short selling a stock when another firm was able to continue doing
so.</div>
<a name="10011242000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">The FSA
expects to use the power to prohibit short selling infrequently. As is
known, it last used this power in a time of extreme market turbulence
when there was high and prolonged price volatility and downward
pressure on the price of financial stocks. By giving clear, separate,
independent powers in legislation other than that relating solely to
market abuse, we give clarity to firms about the scope of the
FSA&#146;s powers, and why it has those powers&#151;again, I
emphasise that it is to protect the stability of the financial system
and to maintain confidence in that system.</div>
<a name="10011242000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">The FSA will
have the power to fine or censure persons who breach short selling
rules. That extends to all people who engage in short selling,
including those who are not authorised persons under FSMA. Allied to
that, the FSA will be able to require the production of information and
documents from a person&#151;or persons connected to a
person&#151;suspect of having contravened those rules. These are
straightforward enforcement powers, and it is not unusual for such
powers to extend to unauthorised persons in that way, as is the case
with the market abuse
regime.</div>
<a name="10011242000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman made the point that we are putting short selling powers in
the market abuse rules section. I have said this already: we are
introducing a new part 8A. Although it will follow part 8 of FSMA,
which contains provisions on market abuse, it is entirely separate from
it. The new powers given in part 8A will not be dependent on provisions
in part 8; part 8A is located after it, but it is entirely separate.
Without being too controversial, let me draw an analogy with the
measure that allowed us to take action against Iceland. That featured
in a Bill with a long title that included the word
&#147;terrorism&#148;, even though the actions we took were about
protecting consumers. I shall not speak any further on that
matter.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column366" />Column number: 366</div><a name="10011242000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Henley said that there was no proper definition of short
selling, and went on to give a number of international examples of
where other countries have taken action on short selling. We pretty
much know what we mean when we talk about short selling, but the FSA
will obviously consult on the definition that is to be included in its
rules.</div>

the point that the hon. Member for Henley made about disclosure, there
is a global regulatory consensus that requiring disclosure on short
positions is a good thing and will help reduce the potential for
abusive behaviour and disorderly markets, so it is important to
implement it. He also asked about the relationship to EU rules. The
powers given to the FSA in the Bill will enable it to implement any new
EU rules on the
matter.</div><a name="10011242000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is not possible to specify in detail what future circumstances might
require the introduction of an emergency ban. It is essential not to
fetter the FSA&#146;s discretion to take action in conditions that
might require swift intervention. However, when using the proposed
emergency powers, the FSA would need to be satisfied that its rules
were necessary to maintain confidence in or protect the stability of
the UK financial system. For example, if short selling threatened to
destabilise an institution or institutions whose failure could have
systemic effects, or if short selling were otherwise leading to a
widespread loss of market confidence, it would be appropriate for the
FSA to
act.</div><a name="10011242000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011242000362"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I beg to move amendment 58, in
schedule 9, page 192, leave out line 10 and
insert</div> <div class="hs_AmendmentLevel0">&#145;Select Committee for
Children, Schools and Families of the House of
Commons.&#146;.</div><a name="10011242000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
this is the first clause of many dealing with collective proceedings,
with your agreement, Mr. Gale, I will preface my remarks
with some general comments about collective proceedings to save the
need for a separate stand part debate. The amendment flows explicitly
from the argument that I will make about the
clause.</div><a name="10011242000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
genesis of this clause and subsequent clauses on collective proceedings
lies in a report produced by the Civil Justice Council, a body that
advises the Lord Chancellor. The report, entitled &#147;Improving
Access to Justice through Collective Actions&#148;, was published in
December 2008. It was the product of a long process of discussion and
consultation within the legal community. If you are minded to read it,
Mr. Gale, you will see that the report runs to about 550
pages, so it is not an inconsequential document. It sets out some of
the benefits of collective proceedings. They are worth rehearsing as a
backdrop to this
debate.</div><a name="10011242000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
report
states:</div><a name="10011242000284"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Existing
collective actions are effective in part, but could be improved
considerably to promote better enforcement of citizens&#146; rights,
whilst protecting defendants from nonmeritorious
litigation...Effective collective actions promote competition and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column367" />Column number: 367</div>market efficiency, consistent with the Government&#146;s economic
principles and objectives, benefiting individual citizens, businesses
and society as a whole...Collective claims can benefit defendants
in resolving disputes more economically and efficiently, with greater
conclusive certainty than can arise through unitary claims...The
Court is the most appropriate body to ensure that any new collective
procedure is fairly balanced as between claimants and defendants, the
latter of which should be properly protected from unmeritorious,
vexatious or spurious claims as well as from so-called blackmail
claims.&#148;</div><a name="10011242000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
report&#146;s findings conclude with the
recommendation:</div><a name="10011242000285"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;There
should be no presumption as to whether collective claims should be
brought on an opt-in or opt-out
basis.&#148;</div><a name="10011242000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will refer explicitly to that issue during debate on clause 19, which
gives the basis for opt-in or opt-out proceedings, a subject of some
controversy among various bodies.</div>
<a name="10011242000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Civil
Justice Council&#146;s report set out the basis for that. However, I
want to raise one issue. The Ministry of Justice, in responding to the
report, said that it did not see any merit in a general application of
collective proceedings but that proceedings should go ahead on a
sector-by-sector basis. So why is the financial services sector an
appropriate one for the introduction of what is a relatively novel
procedure in UK law, notwithstanding the existence of group litigation
orders?</div><a name="10011242000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to deal with three general questions. First, as I have said, why
is collective action needed in the financial services sector? Secondly,
is there an alternative to legal action? Thirdly, if we believe that
collective proceedings are the right course of action, are there
appropriate procedural safeguards to balance the interests of
defendants and
claimants?</div><a name="10011242000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">Why
is collective action needed? The explanatory note to clause 18, which
is phenomenally brief given the nature of the clause&#146;s subject
matter,
says:</div><a name="10011242000286"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;This
clause provides that the court can authorise collective proceedings to
be brought on behalf of a group of financial services claims that share
the same, similar or related issues of fact or
law.&#148;</div><a name="10011242000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
can think relatively easily of issues in the financial sector that fall
into that category, such as mortgage endowment mis-selling and the sale
of payment protection insurance. One could also argue that Equitable
Life is another example of the type of case that might warrant a
collective proceedings order.</div>
<a name="10011242000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">Such cases
have a common thread; they are not isolated examples. The Civil Justice
Council talked about the benefit of bringing these claims collectively,
ensuring a more conclusive outcome than where a unitary claim is
brought. So we could aggregate these cases, rather than deal with them
on case by case. That would give greater consistency and it would
result in a speedier response.</div>
<a name="10011242000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">A timely
example is the bank charges case that was recently heard in the Supreme
Court. In parallel with that case, although there was a stay in hearing
individual cases, a large number of people were bringing cases through
county courts or small claims courts against banks, because of unfair
bank charges. The reason why the test case ended up in the Supreme
Court was that it was easier to deal with those issues on a collective
basis rather than on a case-by-case basis, although there would have
been a read-across between the Supreme Court case and resolving the
historic claims if the matters had gone in the OFT&#146;s
favour.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column368" />Column number: 368</div><a name="10011242000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clearly there
are cases with a common thread which one could see falling within a
collective proceedings order, but I suppose that my question is not so
much about whether any cases will benefit from this process, as about
what it says about the strength of our regulatory system if we feel
that legal action is the right step to take. For me, that is the most
difficult issue to address, because we are talking about introducing
collective proceedings orders in a heavily regulated sector. The FSA
rulebook governs the activities of the people who will be defendants in
these cases. We already have an alternative disputes resolution
procedure in place&#151;the Financial Ombudsman Service. Although the
remit of the FOS is to cover individual cases, it has almost filled a
vacuum in the current regulatory structure, in that it has also dealt
with a series of claims in particular areas. So it was the FOS that
dealt with the fallout from mortgage endowment mis-selling, for
example; it has dealt with all the cases that have arisen because of
that mis-selling.</div>
<a name="10011242000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">It strikes me
that we are looking at a relatively novel legal process, when there
should be a mechanism in the regulatory structure that consumers can
rely on, without having to have recourse to the law. In the evidence
session, Peter Vicary-Smith
said:</div><a name="10011242000287"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It
is certainly the case that the regulator is not doing its job, as we
can see from the evidence on payment protection insurance and the
persistent mis-selling and lack of action. It created a situation where
the Financial Ombudsman Service was overwhelmed by claims, of which
some 89 per cent., I think, have been upheld. It is undoubtedly the
case that there are
problems.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report, Financial
Services Public Bill Committee, </i>8 December 2009; c. 50,
Q140.]</div><a name="10011242000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">What we
do not see is the reform to the FSA that allow consumers to say that a
proper regulatory mechanism is in place. In debating clause 26, I think
that we will talk about the consumer redress route that the Bill also
introduces, but the Government need to make a much clearer argument
about why this particular route has been chosen, given that a
regulatory structure is in place to protect the interest of customers
of financial services.</div>
<a name="10011242000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">Is there not
a reform in the structure of regulation or the powers of the FSA that
would render the proposals unnecessary? The Ministry of
Justice&#146;s response to the Civil Justice Council report
states:</div><a name="10011242000288"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Rights
of action should be introduced only where there is evidence of need and
following an assessment of economic and other impacts and consideration
of alternative approaches. In particular, regulatory options should be
considered before introducing court based
options&#148;.</div><a name="10011242000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not think that the Government have made that case&#151;it is not
apparent from last year&#146;s White Paper or the explanatory notes.
I hope that the Minister will take the opportunity to explain why this
route is preferred and why other regulatory options are not
available.</div><a name="10011242000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
CBI said in its briefing to the Committee that it believed
that</div><a name="10011242000289"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;priority
should be to ensure that current regulation does its job, and then
greater emphasis placed on other, more effective forms of redress such
as alternative dispute
resolution.&#148;</div><a name="10011242000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
use the Minister&#146;s favourite Titanic metaphor, perhaps we should
focus more on prevention than on cure, and think about what we should
do to avoid sailing into the iceberg in the first place, rather than on
what is going to happen on deck when the ship hits the iceberg. Some
consideration should be given to what the regulators are failing to do
at the moment that makes the provisions
necessary.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011242000363"></a>Rob
Marris:</b> It was I who used the Titanic metaphor. To carry
on with that, part of clause 18, without the amendments, is in a sense
an attempt to stop or try to dissuade the ship from leaving port in the
first place. If a financial institution knows that there could be a
collective action, it may be dissuaded from engaging on a course of
action that is somewhat
risky.</div>
<a name="10011242000216"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011242000364"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I am sorry for wrongly attributing the metaphors;
we have been awash with metaphors this morning, so we should perhaps
move away from talking metaphorically about the issue.</div>
<a name="10011242000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman makes an important point. If this were an unregulated sector,
his argument would be powerful, because there would clearly be a
deterrent. However, there are already a number of measures in place
that should provide protection for consumers&#151;there is an FSA
rulebook and rules on the conduct of business&#151;and we should not
need the clause to act as a deterrent. I am seeing it very much as a
clause that facilitates an outcome when something has gone wrong, but
the expectation should be that the FSA is dealing with situations as
they arise. Some might argue the problem is that the FSA rules are
predominantly about the conduct of business rather than the products.
From what we have here, it seems that products have given rise to a
problem, given that the FSA is looking at product regulation in
particular. It has looked at it most recently in the context of
mortgages.</div>
<a name="10011242000308"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.45
pm</div><a name="10011242000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
regulator should be aware that there is a problem. Such problems do not
suddenly emerge out of nowhere. Payment protection insurance was a
problem that built up over time, so there should have been a regulatory
response as it was building up rather than a resort to law. Concerns
have been expressed about the matter and the analogy drawn by several
commentators is that it is equivalent to US class actions. The British
Bankers Association responded by
saying:</div><a name="10011242000290"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
are very concerned that proposals on class actions risk introducing a
US-style litigation culture to the UK. The US system is
&#147;opt-out&#148; and has led to incentives for baseless claims,
increased costs (ultimately born by consumers) and a situation where
the only real winners are lawyers. The BBA urges that any proposals
based on an &#147;opt out&#148; approach should be dropped and
instead that the focus of the bill is on creating a more effective
system of consumer redress via the FSA and subject to court
approval.&#148;</div><a name="10011242000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
shall talk about that structure later, but its remarks echo the
concerns of the Civil Justice Council, which said that</div>
<a name="10011242000291"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Court is the most appropriate body to ensure that any new collective
procedure is fairly balanced as between claimants and defendants, the
latter of which should be properly protected from unmeritorious,
vexatious or spurious claims as well as from so called blackmail
claims&#148;.</div><a name="10011242000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is not only partially an industry point; it is reflected by the
considerations that underpinned the report of the Civil Justice
Council.</div><a name="10011242000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I said, there has been a significant debate about the measures.
Consumer groups, such as Which?, Citizens Advice, Consumer Focus and
Help the Aged have written a joint opinion on the provisions. They
stated:</div><a name="10011242000292"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
believe that the provisions in the Bill are an entirely proportionate
response to tackle the types of mis-selling issues that have arisen in
the financial services industry. By giving the court the power to
decide whether a collective action would be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column370" />Column number: 370</div>opt-in or opt-out as required by the circumstances of the case, they
strike the balance between ensuring an opt-out process where necessary
but providing judicial supervision to prevent vexatious and
unmeritorious
cases.</div><a name="10011242000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">Consumer
groups recognise the merits of collective action, but also some of the
risks of that, which is why I want to move on to the need for
safeguards. A great deal of the work of the Civil Justice Council was
about some of the safeguards that are
needed.</div><a name="10011242000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to conclude on the second theme. We also need to deal with the
problem with the regulatory system. The regulatory system should deal
with such issues and, given that the financial services sector is so
heavily regulated, we should not have to depend on individuals
enforcing their rights to achieve the right outcome for
consumers.</div><a name="10011242000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">Are
there necessary safeguards? The safeguards are the measures set out in
the Bill, in secondary legislation and under the rules of the court.
The explanatory notes to the clause
state:</div><a name="10011242000293"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Regulations
or rules of the court may require the court, when considering whether
to authorise the bringing of collective proceedings, to consider
matters set out in the regulations or
rules.&#148;</div><a name="10011242000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our
job in Committee is to debate such issues thoroughly. We should all be
able to agree that we do not want a situation in which the only real
winners are lawyers. We are not aiming for that. We must therefore make
sure that there are adequate safeguards in respect of the judicial
option on opt-out
proceedings.</div><a name="10011242000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
point that we have reached in our thinking is that we must make sure
that adequate safeguards are in place in the Bill if we are to go
ahead. In its submission to the Committee, the Prudential
wrote:</div>
<a name="10011242000294"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
agree with the Government that collective proceedings should be used
rarely and only for the most significant cases. However, we do not
believe that the Bill, as drafted, provides sufficient checks and
balances to ensure the system is not
abused.&#148;</div><a name="10011242000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
a similar point, much of the detail will be filled in by secondary
legislation, which has yet to be published in draft, and court rulings.
We expected to have more of the detail by now, as the European Justice
Forum, which does not speak for the financial sector, intimated in its
response. It says:</div>
<a name="10011242000295"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;EJF
is particularly concerned that the Bill would introduce opt-out class
actions in the financial sector and that&#151;contrary to government
policy stated in July 2009, no framework of rules and safeguards has
been produced prior to proposing such a
remedy.&#148;</div><a name="10011242000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
plan to produce a framework document was set out in the Ministry of
Justice response to the original paper by the Civil Justice Council.
What stage has that document
reached?</div><a name="10011242000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
comments on amendments to later clauses will be about ensuring that
sufficient safeguards are in place. The amendments that I have tabled
are an attempt to ensure that the safeguards in the Civil Justice
Council paper are reflected in the Bill not only so that we have a
framework for collective proceedings but so that rights and safeguards
are in place before the process comes into force.</div>
<a name="10011242000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection
(5)
states:</div><a name="10011242000296"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
person may be authorised under subsection (1) to bring proceedings even
if the person would not otherwise be regarded as having any interest,
or any sufficient interest, in the
proceedings.&#148;</div><a name="10011242000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is quite a broad provision. In effect, anyone bringing a claim does not
need to have bought a payment protection insurance policy or to have
been mis-sold an endowment 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column371" />Column number: 371</div>policy. Such a person could act as a representative of claimants. In a
recent case in which a group litigation order was used, the Consumers
Association&#151;now Which?&#151;acted as a representative. It was
not a financial services case; it involved a price-fixing cartel for
football shirts. In that case, it was not an individual customer who
bought a football shirt, but Which? that acted as a
representative.</div>
<a name="10011242000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">One can see
why Which?, as a consumer group, would have an interest in acting on
behalf of consumers, but other groups could equally act as a
representative, given the breadth of subsection (5). We are well aware
of the activities of claims management companies. Some clearly act in
the interests of potential claimants, but one gets the sense from time
to time that others are looking for a cause to fight and see a clear
commercial benefit to doing so in terms of the fees that they might
generate.</div>
<a name="10011242000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">So there
needs to be some control over who can  bring such cases.
Subsection (5) is broadly drafted, and amendment 58 would introduce an
additional check so that the representative</div>
<a name="10011242000297"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;is authorised
to act as a representative on an ad hoc basis under the civil Procedure
rules, or...is authorised to act as a representative and on such
terms as specified by order of the Lord Chancellor, in accordance with
criteria to be published by the Lord Chancellor for the purposes of
this
section.&#148;</div><a name="10011242000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
would introduce some coherence and structure and make clear who can
bring such claims and act as a representative. It would require the
Lord Chancellor to consult the Lord Chief Justice or a judicial office
holder nominated by the Lord Chief Justice when authorising an
individual to act on an ad hoc basis or issuing criteria or guidelines
for who might act as a representative.</div>
<a name="10011242000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">The safeguard
is set out in the Civil Justice Council&#146;s report and is, from
recollection, an extract from the draft Bill that the council prepared.
The amendment is the first in a series that would introduce the
safeguards set out in the report and ensure that a proper framework was
in place for such actions to be
brought.</div><a name="10011242000237"></a>

wishing to be patronising that the hon. Gentleman has taken a pragmatic

considerable extent, opt-in and opt-out, which is in clause 19. The
substance of clause 20 is fairly light, so I will now group the stand

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011242000366"></a>Rob
Marris:</b> I am surprised by the amendment, as it appears to
take power away from the courts, which are independent, and give it to
a politician&#151;the Lord Chancellor&#151;who may or may not be
elected, although the current Lord Chancellor is. That would be a
retrograde step. Pursuant to the other provisions in this
grouping&#151;not only clauses 19 and 20 but clauses 21, 22 and
onwards&#151;I think that the amendment is misconceived in focusing
power in the hands of a politician rather than leaving it with the
courts, as clause 18 would
do.</div><a name="10011242000241"></a>

think that I will begin with clause 18, as you suggest, Mr.
Gale, and amendment 58. Clause 18 is a new development in the law of
the country, and it is entirely right that the hon. Member for Fareham
should raise probing questions about the Government&#146;s
intentions. I am happy to put a number of matters on the record in the
time available this morning and, I suspect, this afternoon.</div>
<a name="10011242000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">We believe
that there is a clear need for collective proceedings for financial
services claims. The hon. Member for Fareham referred to the Civil
Justice Council report on improving consumers&#146; access to
justice. It recommended that generic collective proceedings be
introduced in the UK. In our response, we said that they should be
considered and, where appropriate, introduced in specific sectors where
there is a case for doing so. As I have said, we believe that there is
a strong case for doing so in relation to financial services.</div>
<a name="10011242000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">We do not
believe that there is an effective means at the moment for representing
consumers as a group in mass financial services cases. There is some
provision for collective litigation, but it is so limited that it is
rarely
used.</div><a name="10011242000247"></a>

Sub-Committee will not now meet and that this Committee will sit
between 8 pm and 10 pm this evening. I can take the Chair, so
Mr. Benton will be with you this afternoon and I will be
with you this evening. I give an undertaking to see when I leave the
room whether there is any way to generate a little heat in this
igloo.</div><a name="10011242000309"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1
