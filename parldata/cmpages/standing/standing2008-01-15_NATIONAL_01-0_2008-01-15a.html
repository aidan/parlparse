questioning at a reasonable time before One o&#146;clock&#151;I
understand that that is the expectation&#151;it will move on to the
more familiar proceedings of clause-by-clause scrutiny of the Bill,
after a short suspension to rearrange the room. I hope that that is

principle, is something that the Treasury would, naturally, want to
have an interest in. For the serious purposes of the Bill, it is part
of the overall reform that the Pensions Bill made to pensions
provision, and a lot of the measures were announced in the Budget. We
discussed this on Second Reading, and the broad purpose of the Bill is
simply to ensure that, by making the changes that we are proposing, the
anomaly that we have recognised for the higher
earners&#151;those contributing to the national insurance
contributions fund&#151;do not get a disproportionate benefit later,
as a result of their pension

						</i> We were aware that this was possible as a
likely consequence of the reforms in the discussions leading up to the
Budget. Both HMRC and the Treasury were aware of this possible
consequence. However, further work needed to be done in order to be
clear how best to correct the anomaly in a way that would be fair to
everybody, which was the Government&#146;s intention. It did not
become clear until further work had been done between the Department
for Work and Pensions, HMRC and the Treasury on exactly how to do that.
It was apparent to us that it was better to do it separately in a Bill
of this nature, rather than to take the reform forward as an amendment
to the Pensions Bill.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
Mark Field</b> (Cities of London and Westminster) (Con): I
support simplification and can understand one of the ideas behind the
Bill. What thought was given by the Treasury to try to make the matter
revenue-neutral: in other words, by reducing the upper earnings limit
to such a degree that this whole aspect was revenue-neutral? Was any
consideration given to reducing the upper earnings limit, rather than
to increasing the limit at which national insurance is paid, to get to
that point? I can understand the idea that the Treasury would wish to
simplify the entire system&#151;that makes a certain amount of
sense&#151;but clearly, the way in which the current Treasury has
decided to go about this will hit middle-income earners who are about
to, or are already, paying income tax at the upper earnings limit. Why
was this not made revenue-neutral in such a way that the interests of
those people were
protected?</div>

						</i>The overall reforms that were
announced in Budget 2007 represented a reduction in the taxation on
employment and were funded by revenue raised elsewhere in the tax
system. In broad terms, there was a tax cut related to those elements
around the removal of the 10p rate of income tax&#151;the cut to the
basic rate&#151;and the alignment of the upper earnings limit with
the point at which you start paying income
tax.</div>

them no better or worse off. The overall package, which increases the

cut in the basic rate, should leave them no better or no worse off

						</i> If I can explain, the position of some higher
rate taxpayers, depending on their national insurance position and
whether they have contracted out, is that they made a small gain from
the Budget 2007 reforms. In that sense, the changes here are not
disadvantaging relative to the position before Budget 2007, but they
take back some of that gain. That is why this Bill can raise revenue
without making anyone worse off than they were before Budget 2007. I
hope that that is

that, after the first step of that alignment, which is effective from
April 2008 until April 2009, when the second full step of alignment

						</i> The national insurance Bill will allow those
changes. From April 2009, we can fully align the upper earnings limit
and the point at which people start paying the higher rate of tax.
However, as part of the step in that direction, the initial stages were
taken to start the alignment process from April 2008, but the words
&#147;legislative constraints&#148; meant that it could not be done
all in one go. Therefore, it is a two-stage process. The second stage
is dependent on the legislation in the national insurance
Bill.</div>

						</i> If I could just add to that, Mr.
Marris, if you look at the impact assessment, which is available to
Committee members, four options were considered when we were
considering what to do to respond to the circumstances as we believed
they would develop. One of those options was to do nothing; one was to
do the change effective from April 2009, but two other effective dates
were considered as well. On balance, we believed that it was better to
go for the earliest possible effective date on which we could change
it. Bear in mind that we are all the time seeking to simplify the tax
and benefit system in the UK, and that was also an important
consideration.</div>

Once the Bill is enacted, assuming that it is passed in the form that

set by regulation, subject to affirmative resolution. At the moment,
the maximum of the upper earnings limit that could be set prior to the

number of objectives, the first of which was to seek to simplify the
personal tax system in the UK. We listen to, and are conscious of, the
criticisms of the complexity of the system for personal and business
taxation, which is why that was one of the policy objectives of the
changes. The second and very important objective was to test the
current personal tax structure in order to see whether it best served
our objective of reducing child poverty by bringing more children out
of relative and absolute poverty. I think that I am right in saying
that the changes that we are making, and have made, as a result of the
2007 Budget, and some of the changes today, mean that we will take a
further 200,000 children out of relative poverty. That was an important
consideration. There was a degree of redistribution in the way that we
did it to ensure that we gave as much help as we could to families with
children, which will help towards that
objective.</div>

conduct an academic exercise to see what the whole range of different
options are in detail. You would give a relatively clear steer on what
you wanted to achieve and then ask for proposals that met those
objectives. I am not sure whether the specific option mentioned was
considered, but Ministers will have given a very clear steer at the
time as to what they wanted to achieve, and tax rises and other things
would have been part of that
discussion.</div>

						</b> We are talking about, I think, 5.3 million losers
under the overall arrangements. The question is whether you feel that
the then Minister could have said, &#147;Wait a second. I can
identify two big groups of losers.&#148; That is those who benefit
almost or completely from the lower, 10p rate but do not earn enough to
benefit from the reduction from 22p to 20p in the basic rate, who are
relatively low earners, and the people who benefit from the admittedly
somewhat anomalous position of their marginal rate going
down&#151;the &#163;39,000 to &#163;40,000 income earners. Those
are the two big groups that took a big hit from the
Budget.</div>

						</b> Do you want me to have another stab at that? As
the Minister said, these measures are all considered as part of a
package. The changes to national insurance funded the proposals, as did
the abolition of the 10p rate. Interestingly, as the Minister has
admitted, that meant that there was a redistribution from some people
on relatively low earnings, who benefited from the 10p rate but did not
earn enough to benefit from the cut in the basic rate to higher
earners&#151;something that struck many people as a curious political
feature of the budget.</div>

					<a name="08011633000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would like to give an example
of how the process would have worked, as that seems to be of most
interest. When the discussions were taking place, issues would have
been flagged up with regard to who the potential losers from different
packages would be. As a result of that, a package would have been
brought forward that was engineered to address those people. For
example, as a result of this package and because of the changes to the
threshold that we have made, around 580,000 fewer pensioners will be
paying income tax than would otherwise have been the case.</div>
					<a name="08011633000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">Where there were going to be
losers as a result of the change, we were careful to ensure that those
losers were not in the categories that other Government priorities
clearly wanted to help. When these issues are discussed and the options
looked at, any decisions that are made have to be balanced, and
sometimes there will be some losers. However, as we have said, we
sought to make those who lost out do so in a very small part. They are
losers but not with a capital &#147;L&#148;, and overall, looking
back at the changes that we have made to tax and benefits since 1997,
there are no losers. Even those that we have mentioned are still well
over &#163;900 a year better off as a result of the full reforms that
we have made since we were elected in 1997.</div>

been cleverly designed to limit the number of losers&#148;. He went
on, &#147;To reform the system in a useful way within tight financial
constraints and with only modest...losses should be a cause for
congratulation rather than criticism.&#148; The intentions behind

second question is brief, and it is about the Minister&#146;s
comments on incentivisation to work. The key people who were losers
from the Budget were, generally, single people with no children. In

younger people. How does that stack up with our levels of youth
unemployment? Although we all understand the desire to ensure that
families with children are supported and that child poverty is tackled,
that longer-term aim of ensuring that young people are in work in the

						</i> There are a number of observations to be made
here. First, employment has risen strongly in recent years for almost
all age ranges. When we look at work incentives, there is a concern
that parents, in particular, face some of the toughest work incentive
problems because of the way that the benefit system has grown and
changed over time. Often, they faced the biggest unemployment trap, and
found it difficult to make work pay, particularly with child care
costs.</div>
					<a name="08011633000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore, many
of the reforms have been aimed at further strengthening work incentives
for families with children. That was why the working tax credit
threshold was increased. It will also benefit those without children
who receive the working tax credit. In that sense, work incentives for
many low-paid people, particularly parents, were actually improved as
part of that series of
reforms.</div>

						</b>
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011633000415"></a>Justine
Greening:
						</b> But, it strikes me that perhaps the easiest time
to get those who are unemployed into work is before they have
additional barriers to work. Taking care of children as single-parent
families is clearly identified as a barrier to work. Obviously,
employed people who then have children will often get support from
their employers. So, it seems that perhaps the danger of the Budget was
that it undermined the best time to encourage people to go into
employment, which is before they have
children.</div>

						</i> The reforms are taking place in an economy
in which employment itself has grown very strongly. Notwithstanding the
debate that is taking 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column13" />Column number: 13</div>place about those not in education or employment, employment among young
people has grown strongly. I know that in my constituency, as many of
us will who have constituencies where youth unemployment was a serious
scourge, it is now virtually non-existent. Therefore, it is within that
context that we quite rightly started to look at how we could use the
tax and national insurance contribution system to give more assistance
to those households to which we were seeking to offer the most help and
make the biggest difference, particularly in helping them into
work.</div>
					<a name="08011633000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">The areas of
greatest focus now are those people who continue to have difficulty
getting in to work&#151;those who have children. A whole range of
policy measures were put in place to help families in those
circumstances. All those have to be funded, and clearly those are
issues that Government need to consider, when taking forward a reform
of this nature. Equally, we are doing it in the context of an economy
that is continuing to perform well in providing employment
opportunities. In that context, you can start to consider making the
kinds of decisions that were made in Budget 2007. Had we been in the
context of a labour market of 15 or 20 years ago, such decisions would
have been much more difficult for the individuals

						</b> My final point is that the changes were made
around 1992 and included the legislative safeguard that the figure
would not be more than seven and a half times higher than the bottom
one. A concern that some people may have is that that safeguard is
being removed and is not being replaced with a higher level of eight,
rather than seven and a half or eight and a half. As I understand it,
there is no specified higher level, and it will not require primary
legislation in future to change that. Some people will say that they
understand that you want to align the two and to simplify the matter,
but if you are doing that and all it requires instead is to break the
7.5 multiplier and to make it 7.52 or whatever it will be&#151;it
will be a fraction over 7.53&#151;you are opening the doors to go up
and up as high as the Government may wish at the time. It seems strange
that, for 0.03, this legislative change is required. Some people may
fear that Ministers in the future may exploit or even abuse it, when it
would require only a tiny tweak to stay within the current
limit.</div>

meet at the lower end&#151;at the point at which you start to pay
contributions. There is none whatever, so it seems illogical to
continue with the upper limit purely because it exists. There are sound
policy reasons, as I have advanced, for that particular alignment
spread, including not only the three main policy objectives of the 2007
Budget, but the correction of the pension anomaly that resulted from
pension reform, so that we achieve the overall objective of pension

						</b> Before we return to the issue of national insurance
contributions and the constitutional way in which they are changed, you
said, Minister, that there was not really a restriction on the lower
end. But if there is a ratio, it restricts both ways, and you cannot
cut the rate at which people start paying if you have a ratio that
holds you steady at the top. I have not expressed that very clearly,
but it applies both ways, and the point of the ratio is that it stops a
big distance between the primary threshold&#151;it used to be the
lower earnings limit&#151;and the upper earnings limit. Is my

works, as you say, by limiting the gap between the two. However, there
is the existing commitment, dating back to the 1999 Budget, of the
alignment, instead of the primary threshold at the point&#151;with
the personal allowance&#151;at which you start paying any income tax
at all. So that is the constraint on the bottom. Given that that is

						</i> National insurance contribution levels are
actually set annually as part of a re-rating exercise, following a
report by the Government Actuary&#146;s Department. The Government
Actuary examines the balances of the national insurance fund and makes
recommendations about what future increases in national insurance
contributions may be necessary. The system operates as a pay-as-you-go
system, and on the basis of the Government
Actuary&#146;s report, the Treasury and HMRC make recommendations to
Ministers about future increases in national insurance contribution
levels. Until fairly recently, most of those increases have been
predicated on the basis of increases in prices, or when balances in the
national insurance fund have at any time appeared to be inadequate to
meet the commitments of the fund, Ministers have recommended slightly
larger

basically something that goes towards funding public

there were not a large surplus in the national insurance fund, the
Government would need either to raise taxation or borrow the money on
the open market. It is not always possible to predict accurately what
the calls on the fund will be. It is usually possible to predict what
the major call will be, from state pensions, but the fund is used also
to pay other contributory benefits such as contributory
jobseeker&#146;s allowance and incapacity benefit. It is not always
possible to quantify that. The Government and the Government

give employers good notice of changes, particularly with national
insurance, because of the nature of the system. Because it is
non-cumulative, it is not possible to make changes during the year in
the same way that you can with income tax. There are different
constraints on the system. As I said, the decision to make full
alignment only in April 2009 was to give us good time for a Bill,
knowing that parliamentary timetables can be very busy and compressed.
Therefore, it is possible that this could be done later, but the
earlier we can do it, the more certainty we can give employers about

threshold for income tax. That will necessitate some procedural

with income tax and national insurance contributions. The Finance Bill
does the changes for income tax for that year&#151;the year that we
are in. Therefore, this summer&#146;s Finance Bill will deal with
everything from 2008-09. At the same time, we need to do the national
insurance contributions. For argument&#146;s sake, we could not do it
at the same time because we are actually a year ahead. Therefore, the

						</i> Yes, that is correct. One of the reasons why
that is the case is because national insurance is collected over a pay
period, which means either weekly or monthly. Income tax, on the other
hand, is balanced over the year. It is possible to make changes to the
income tax parameters during the course of the year and the system will
balance out over the year as a whole. Whereas with national insurance,
everything needs to be tied down before the start of the tax
year.</div>

						</i> There are two totally separate structures
for considering the rates of income tax and national insurance. For
ease of reference, Erskine May describes national insurance
contributions on page 782. He stated, &#147;To the extent that they
are payable into the National Insurance Fund, contributions paid by
earners, employers and others under the provisions of social security
legislation are not regarded as charges upon the people or as subject
to the rules of financial procedure&#148;. We would have to implement
primary legislation to be able to consider national insurance in the
Finance Bill. It would certainly not be possible to achieve that by
2009-10, and I am not even persuaded that it would be
desirable.</div>

the points that we started with. We have a very different system for
national insurance contributions. If we go back to the mid 1970s, the

was restricted by things such as the ratio between what was the lower
earnings limit, now the primary threshold, and the upper earnings

we get continuing alignment for the years 2010-11 onwards? That cannot

fundamental reforms to the system. There were a number of consequential
issues. We knew that we had to deal with the entire knock-on effects to
lots of different systems. We were looking, for example, at the way it
affected charities. These were all things that we knew about at the
time and we had to have a process, once the Budget had got out of the
way, of reflecting on those further, having had informal conversations
with key stakeholders. We knew that there were a number of issues that
we were looking at. We set out quite a clear narrative in the Red Book

that we could fulfil our objective of not making higher rate taxpayers

years. In the

package was announced in the Budget 2007, it was never intended to give
the state second pension benefit and the extra benefits to higher

2012, when the other measures will be introduced. For a reason that we
have not got to the bottom of, you decided that that was not
appropriate, although it would have pushed out alignment to 2035. That
seems to have been the primary objective; the Government decided to
stick to 2030, which, albeit, will raise more tax from people over the
next few years.</div>

						</i> But as I understand it, if we had adopted
options 3 or 4, either of which would have delayed the flat-lining,
there would have been an unintended benefit to the high earners, as a
result of the state second pension. Our intention was to correct that
and to bring in flat-lining as early as
possible.</div>

						</i> Delaying bringing in the upper accruals point
until 2009, which this Bill seeks to do, might have disrupted the
contracted-out rebates for pension providers. We explained to Ministers
the consequences of each of the four options, and it seemed that the
one that employers and pension providers would find easiest to cope
with was the one that Ministers brought before
Parliament. Waiting until 2012 before introducing an upper accruals
point would have caused even greater complexities and far more
difficulty for pension providers than they have faced, and they would
have had to deal with the consequences. We have been able to minimise
the disruption to them.</div>

						</b> Did you consider the potential impact on the
industry in the event that the pension regime does not come in in 2012?
This Bill will pass before the end of the tax year. At this point, it
is the only piece of legislation that relates to the package of
measures introduced in other legislation such as the Pensions Act 2007.
However, this Bill is the only one that will bite before 2012, and it
remains uncertain whether the earnings link will be restored. You are
therefore encouraging the industry to go down a particular course that
may or may not link with other measures in subsequent years.</div>

						</i> These decisions were taken when the Pensions
Bill was before Parliament. That Bill included a
strong commitment from Ministers and the Government that the earnings
link would be restored in 2012, or at any rate by the end of the next
Parliament. We also gave a firm indication, in the form of the
legislation that Department for Work and Pensions Ministers introduced
and Parliament passed, that an upper accruals point would be introduced
from 2012.</div>
					<a name="08011633000298"></a><div class="hs_Para">The changes
introduced by the Chancellor in the Budget resulted in the decision
that you have been debating and questioning the Minister about today.
If Ministers had not taken the decision to bring forward the upper
accruals point to 2009 and if they had delayed it to 2012, there would
have been a very severe degree of disruption for pension
providers&#151;they would not have certainty about contracted-out
rebates, because they would not have known what would happen.</div>
					<a name="08011633000299"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would have resulted in
additional difficulties. Pensions are a difficult subject, and it is
already difficult enough to explain what is happening. More
fundamentally, following the Pensions Commission report, Ministers
outlined a vision for pension reform that included as an integral part
the changes to the state second pension, which will be brought back
into line when the Bill receives Royal
Assent.</div>

what you say, but I fail to understand why the industry would be thrown
in confusion and would not know what would happen in 2012 if we

the upper accruals limit in 2012 clear.</div>

						</i> We have obviously engaged in a lot of analysis
of the options in consultation with the DWP. As a result of the work
done in collaboration with our colleagues in the DWP and the Treasury,
we concluded that the change would mean that the schemes are not
required to increase their funding or benefits to meet 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column33" />Column number: 33</div>the tests that pension schemes must pass to be contracted out of the
state second pension. The proposal that Ministers brought forward will

additional entitlement to state second pension. There is then the
additional contracted-out rebate that individuals would have been
entitled to under the Budget reforms that we decided to take back. Two
items are included in those lines: the rebates are the bigger item in
the short term; the accruals&#151;the additional accrued
