<P>
<B>Mr Richard Spring </B>(West Suffolk): I beg to move amendment No. 23, in page 9, line 13, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(5) The New Opportunities Fund shall solely and only make grants to, or make or enter into arrangements with causes where it can be demonstrated that they would not otherwise be funded out of taxation or other local or national government revenues.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take new clause 1--Restrictions on distribution--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`In section 25 of the 1993 Act (appliation of money by distributing bodies) after subsection (4) there shall be inserted--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``(5) A body shall distribute any money paid to it under section 24 solely and only to causes where it can be demonstrated that they would not otherwise be funded out of taxation or other national or local government revenues.''.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> We oppose the Government's proposed New Opportunities Fund because it violates the additionality principle. Lottery proceeds should fund only those initiatives that are additional to core Government spending programmes, which should be funded by taxation. That principle is at the very heart of our objection to the Bill. Conservative Members therefore want the matter to be given a proper airing.
<P>
The White Paper ``The People's Lottery'' maintains that the Government are committed to the additionality principle. In it, the Prime Minister stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``We don't believe it would be right to use Lottery money to pay for things which are the Government's responsibilities''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Given the proposals that underpin the New Opportunities Fund, it is hard to believe that the additionality principle will be observed. The Government's credibility is in this respect open to question.
<P>
On 6 April, Peter Riddell wrote an article in The Times about the lottery's future, entitled ``A winner whatever the odds''. The article's subtitle claimed that the Treasury's aim was
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``to milk the lottery cash cow for its own ends.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Riddell specifically noted:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The new fund also violates the basic principle. . .That alone appears to rule out the new uses. More precisely, there is the concept of additionality, that lottery money should not be used to replace existing spending.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is the core of the problem. Political commentators and members of the distribution bodies are worried by what is a clear breach of the additionality principle.
<P>
The Conservative manifesto for the 1992 general election stated our intention to restore our heritage and to promote projects that would become a source of national pride. That is precisely what happened.
<P>
On Second Reading, my right hon. Friend the Member for Huntingdon (Mr. Major) said that those areas on which the lottery concentrates--and the umbrella which the former Department of National Heritage had provided--constituted a recognition that certain areas of national life would remain under-resourced, regardless of which Government were in office. Arts, sport and heritage are inevitably pushed to the back of the Treasury spending queue, because other areas are seen to be more important in political terms.
<P>
When the national lottery was devised, a clear divide was made between core Government responsibilities that should be paid for by the taxpayer, and those that the lottery should pay for according to the principle of additionality.
<P>
The Bill proposes schemes that will be under the aegis of the New Opportunities Fund. Those schemes include information technology training for teachers and librarians, and the provision of healthy living centres. However, such schemes should be paid for by general taxation, because they relate to education, health and the extension of after-hours school activities.
<P>
The Bill threatens the principle of additionality that was encapsulated in the original legislation and which lies at the very heart of the national lottery. What might happen in future years if the Government establish this precedent? It could prove to be the thin end of the wedge. Increasing amounts of money may be diverted into health and education--far more than is implied in the current proposals and in the draft regulations that we received last night.
<P>
The Bill gives additional powers of direction to the Secretary of State. Once again, that is a departure from the founding principles of the national lottery. The Secretary of State would have the power to divert money into pet projects and fill breaches in core Government spending in order to move further towards what the Government would regard as a politically desirable agenda.
<P>
I alluded earlier to the Green Paper on national childcare strategy which is soon to be published. As I understand it, out-of-school activities are to be a key element in that strategy. If that is so, it underlines my point that the relationship between core expenditure--driven by the Treasury and carried out by the Department for Education and Employment--is being linked unacceptably to the national lottery.
<P>
I turn now to this country's system of teacher training for information technology. We should be proud of one or two aspects of that. An extraordinary expansion of information technology provision has occurred in our primary schools. More computer and information technology equipment is available in the United Kingdom's primary schools than in those of any other European Union country. That is wholly desirable, because computer literacy is crucial if we are to have a successfully functioning economy. There is a rising generation of young people who are comfortable with information technology, and teachers should be trained to deal with that. As the father of relatively young children, I know that there is generation gap between my ability to grapple with the new technology and their ability--they are entirely comfortable with it. The Government should take responsibility for reacting to these developments.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Prior </B>(North Norfolk): I am sure that my hon. Friend is aware that the Government already spend between &#163;15 million and &#163;20 million of normal taxation revenue on teaching teachers how to use information technology.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> That is exactly the point. My hon. Friend is entirely correct to point out that that precedent has already been established.
<P>
The huge expansion in information technology can proceed only if teachers are adequately trained to deal with it. The issue at stake is where the money for that is to come from. The central problem revolves around the principle of additionality. The information technology explosion will be part and parcel of our lives over coming generations. The Government should take money from general taxation rather than from the arts, sport and heritage. Those areas will always be under-resourced, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Huntingdon has said, and the Department of National Heritage and the national lottery were both established for their benefit. That is the heart of Conservative Members' disagreement with the Government.
<P>
The Government say that the money is targeted at existing teachers. We do not accept that. My hon. Friend the Member for North Norfolk (Mr. Prior) said that &#163;296.8 million of the grant for education support and training has been used to train teachers. Five per cent. of that sum is being spent on training in information technology. A precedent has been set, and there is now substitution and additional expenditure. The Government's attempt to make a distinction blatantly flouts the question of additionality.
<P>
<B>Mr. Prior:</B> My hon. Friend made the point earlier that the Government say that sport and physical education in schools are the same for funding purposes. IT teaching is a core skill for modern teachers. Sport or PE might be considered as peripheral, but IT is a crucial part of the core subjects in the curriculum.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> Indeed, it was disingenuous of the Government to take the name of my right hon. Friend the Member for Huntingdon in vain. When I discussed the matter with the former Prime Minister, he said that the standard of sport in school should be upgraded. That is where sporting excellence begins. We might have even more hope of winning the odd medal if the Minister for Sport signs a contract for the UK Sports Institute.
<P>
The former Prime Minister envisaged using the money going to the millennium fund only after that fund had been closed. He accepted that the lottery had to evolve and that there would be movement from capital to revenue spending. On Second Reading he said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``I want us to win the World cup, the five nations trophy, the test matches, the Davis cup.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He talked about his love of sport and added that he
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``would, for example, post millennium, have devoted the sums that are going to the millennium fund to the provision of sports coaching and arts teaching, across--as far as the money would stretch--our mainstream education system.''--[Official Report, 7 April 1998; Vol. 310, c. 154.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The timing and the quality of such funding is different from what the Government proposes, and so my hon. Friend the Member for North Norfolk makes a valid point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tom Levitt </B>(High Peak): I have in my hand a piece of paper. When some of my constituents pay for their purchases at the supermarket they are given a similar piece of paper. Such tokens can be collected and the proceeds used to give computers and training to schools. Tesco's scheme to provide computers for schools is very effective and last year provided &#163;35,000 worth of computers for schools in my constituency.
<P>
How is the Tesco's scheme different from the arrangements for funding for schools, for IT and for IT training for teachers that would be provided through the good causes? If there is no difference, is not Tesco in breach of the additionality rule, as defined by the hon. Member for West Suffolk (Mr. Spring)?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Spring:</B> Do I detect the ossified voice of old Labour? I thoroughly approve of Tesco's community spirit and I have a Tesco club card. As we are keen to support the private sector, I hope that we shall continue to support Tesco's initiative.
<P>
Such private initiatives do not involve taking sums of money from the existing good causes that find difficulty in attracting funds. The hon. Member for High Peak (Mr. Levitt) would not deny that it is difficult for the arts, heritage and sports ordinarily to find the sums that they would like. The Bill will flout the principle of additionality, but I am comforted by the hon. Gentleman's remarks on Tesco. If he has a shareholding in Tesco, I hope that it will continue to thrive.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Minister for Sport (Mr. Tony Banks):</B> I am holding a donor card. Has the hon. Gentleman got one?
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> I hate to think what the Minister has in mind. He has not revealed what he wished to donate in the case of his--I hope that this will not happen for a long time--untimely demise. However, I am sure that the Minister for Transport in London and the hon. Member for Brent, East (Mr. Livingstone) will be comforted by the Minister's forethought.
<P>
I return to the training of librarians and what the Secretary of State has described as the people's network. [Hon. Members: ``Hear, hear.''] I notice that the People's Union did well in the election in Germany at the weekend, so I am reluctant to use the word ``people'' in such a loose fashion. The word is always used by thoroughly nasty, authoritarian regimes of the left and of the right.
<P>
<B>Mr. Banks:</B> Winston Churchill used the phrase, ``Trust the people.''
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> Yes, but the Conservative party never attempted to rebrand itself as the ``People's Conservative party.'' The Conservative party has been the most dominant political force in any democracy in the western world. Therefore, it has not needed to perform such a cheap and trivial act.
<P>
<B>Mr. Damian Green (Ashford):</B> Before my hon. Friend comes to his remarks on libraries, will he consider the incoherence of the Government's proposals for sport and their attempt to pray in aid my right hon. Friend the Member for Huntingdon, the former Prime Minister? It is clear that measures to help sport in schools can easily be channelled through the Sports Council, which is already a grant-giving body. To compare that process with what will happen in schools under the New Opportunities fund is wrong.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> I thank my hon. Friend for making that point. He must have had the same conversation with my right hon. Friend the former Prime Minister as I did. That is precisely the point that my right hon. Friend made.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ivor Caplin </B>(Hove): Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> Oh, goodness!
<P>
<B>Mr. Caplin:</B> The hon. Gentleman does not have to give way if he does not want to. However, will he deal with the point made by the hon. Member for North Norfolk about whether sport is peripheral to schools?
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> What is the hon. Gentleman's specific question?
<P>
<B>Mr. Caplin:</B> I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman did not understand me, but I was brief in an attempt to help the Committee. Does the Conservative party now view sport as a peripheral activity in schools? That is what the hon. Member for North Norfolk suggested.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> Sport was made a beneficiary of the national lottery because we wanted to place emphasis on the role of sport in schools. That contrasts with the wholesale sell-off of playing fields by Labour authorities. That sell-off meant that many schools were unable to provide sport. The lottery is one way of channelling money into sport and securing greater interest in it.
<P>
The Minister for Sport announced the creation of a UK Sports Institute, but he appears to know little about it. If he ever gets round to setting it up, I hope that it will improve the quality of sport in this country. We would all feel greatly comforted by that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Banks:</B> The hon. Gentleman incites me to intervene on two matters. First, I am not responsible for dealing with the contracts for the UK Sports Institute. Those contracts will be signed as soon as everyone agrees that they are satisfactory and I am assured by Sir Rodney Walker that that is imminent.
<P>
Secondly, with regard to the sale of school playing fields: the hon. Gentleman must recall that legislation implemented by the previous Conservative Government required local authorities to dispose of recreation fields, depending on the number of pupils at the school. I should have expected the hon. Gentleman to applaud the fact that this Government have stopped that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> Although a great announcement was made in November, the UK Sports Institute was clearly set up by the Conservative Government. I am glad to hear that the contracts are about to be signed, but disappointed that five months have elapsed, given the hype surrounding that announcement before Christmas. However, if the Minister claims that it is not his fault, then we must feel sorry for him.
<P>
<B>Mr. Prior:</B> I want to clarify my earlier intervention. I said that teaching IT to teachers is a core activity that should be funded from general taxation and not by the lottery.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring I am grateful for that clarification and absolutely agree with my hon. Friend.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Jim Murphy </B>(Eastwood): Will my hon. Friend give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> There is plenty of space on these Benches if the hon. Gentleman wants to joint us.
<P>
<B>Mr. Murphy:</B> The hon. Member for West Suffolk has criticised the New Opportunities Fund, but agrees with the hon. Member for North Norfolk that funding for IT training should come from general taxation. Which elements of public expenditure would be cut to achieve that? We must not have an endless wish list for public funding. The hon. Gentleman should be honest with the Committee. Where would the money come from if not from the New Opportunities Fund?
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> In a sense, that is an academic question. Despite all the talk of controlled totals, the Government have access to more than &#163;1.5 billion, thanks to last year's underspend and the EU rebate. The Chancellor of the Exchequer could use that money in any way that he chose.
<P>
Teacher training and education in general are matters for the Department for Education and Employment. I hope that the Department is more successful in its negotiations with the Chancellor than the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, whose ability to extract money from the Chancellor is virtually non-existent.
<P>
<B>Mr. Murphy:</B> I press the point because it is important. Labour Members are keen on the New Opportunities Fund, which will give opportunities to people who do not benefit at present. The hon. Member for West Suffolk has been critical of it, both implicitly and directly, and talks about general taxation. Will he give an undertaking that, in the unlikely and unfortunate event of his party succeeding at a future general election, he would support the removal of the New Opportunities fund as a source of funding? Would he call on any future Conservative Secretary of State to get involved? The Committee would be grateful for a categoric commitment on that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> I am happy to assure the hon. Gentleman that, when and if the Bill is enacted, the Conservative party will examine the question of additionality very carefully to determine how it works in practice. Many commentators and distribution bodies share my fear that additionality will undermine the public's confidence in the national lottery. Sadly, we will have to deal with that situation when the glorious moment arrives, in less than four years' time, when we sail back into No. 10 Downing Street.
<P>
Having been diverted by a great number of interventions, libraries are required by statute to provide a comprehensive service. That is what the Secretary of State said. However, that apparently does not extend to training serving librarians in the use of information technology. Such a distinction is absurd, and is not justified. The Secretary of State has admitted that money from his budget is spent on training, but he says, in excuse, that it is a relatively small amount of money. He accepts that that happens in principle, but justifies it on the grounds that the sum is not substantial. If that is not the thin end of the wedge, I do not know what is.
<P>
On 18 December 1997, on Second Reading in the House of Lords, it was said that the scope of initiatives would be extended to provide training for serving teachers and librarians. The expansion is to pay for digitisation of educational materials in schools and libraries, which means that things have been taken along a further step. Originally, it was only a question of training, but things have moved on. I am afraid that more such developments will happen in future if we do not call a halt now, because now we are including materials. We are talking about not only training, but materials--whether that be information technology equipment or pens, pencils and paper. We do not know, because nothing is defined--so much for the question of additionality. I hope that the Minister will be able to respond to my points. The precedents have been set, with sums committed not only by his Department but by the Department for Education and Employment and by the Chancellor, for projects that overlap with the Bill's proposals.
<P>
We have already mentioned the national child care strategy. We look forward to the much-delayed Green Paper rearing its head and helping us to understand the Government's thoughts. Children's play and homework clubs fall outside the scope of core spending programmes. I believe that the Chancellor had some words on that subject. My right hon. Friend the Member for Horsham (Mr. Maude) discussed this area on Second Reading. He said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the Secretary of State tried to wriggle out of that when he wrote to me last year. He said:<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `The Lottery-funded training will not support the basics of operating the technology, but will focus on helping teachers to use the technology in the classroom'.''--[Official Report, 7 April 1998; Vol. 310, c. 176.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Again, the distinction is difficult to make, which is what the confusion is all about.
<P>
We have dealt with the issue of training for librarians. In relation to the national child care strategy, the Government have maintained that the proposed children's play and homework clubs fall outside the scope of the core spending programmes. However, in his pre-budget statement, the Chancellor indicated that the cost of setting up new schemes would be shared by the Treasury and the New Opportunities Fund.
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Funds will be available to set up as many as 30,000 new out-of-school clubs, which will provide places for almost 1 million children. The total cost over five years is &#163;300 million, which is now budgeted for in our plans and respresents the biggest ever investment in child care. The cost will be shared between the Exchequer and the new opportunities fund . . . A national child care strategy is no longer the ambition of workless parents; it is now the policy of this country's Government.''--[Official Report, 25 November 1997; Vol. 301, c. 777.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This is a political policy, which is being funded out of the national lottery. The Chancellor has admitted it, and I hope that the Minister will be able to define the distinction, because it escapes everyone else.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Despite the Secretary of State's claim that out-of-school activities are not part of core statutory school provision, which it is the Government's responsibility to fund, it is clear that the Government already provide money for school care initiatives through the Department for Education and Employment. The Government provide money through the training and enterprise councils, which are spread throughout the country, to fund their out of school child care initiative. The scheme announced by the Chancellor will simply be an extension of that financed by lottery money.
<P>
Government spending programmes are already in place, either through the TECs or through Government Departments, which are either being added to or being replaced by lottery funding. If that is not a breach of the principle of additionality, there is no basis to define additionality as anything that could possibly be recognisable.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>The Minister for Arts (Mr. Mark Fisher):</B> Will the hon. Gentleman ponder a second before he digs himself right into a hole with his use of the terms ``add to'' and ``additionality''?
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> I will define additionality just as the Prime Minister was happy to do in ``The People's Lottery'' White Paper. He wrote:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``We don't believe it would be right to use Lottery money to pay for things which are the Government's responsibilities.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
But as the Chancellor and the Secretary of State have admitted, that is already happening as part of Government policy. The whole point of additionality, as defined here, is not to replace but to provide funds for areas that would not normally be provided for, or that would be under-resourced by central Government expenditure. That has been made clear time and time again.
<P>
Many of the services that are likely to be provided by healthy living centres are already provided in GP fundholder practices. There has been enormous expansion in the provision of those services. It is greatly to be regretted that GP fundholding is being subjected to a fresh wave of bureaucratic activity by the health service, which will deprive GP fundholders of the opportunity to provide just those services that their patients want. I fully accept that part and parcel of the functioning of the health service is to upgrade health consciousness, to encourage people to lead healthy lives and to prevent illnesses.
<P>
<B>Laura Moffatt </B>(Crawley): How many healthy living centres were set up directly by the Secretary of State for Health under the Conservative Government?
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> The whole point about GP fundholding--[Hon. Members: ``Answer the question.''] Those are the services provided. Does the hon. Lady go to a GP fundholding practice? Would she care to answer that question? She would not. I ask only because if she did attend such a practice, she would know about the whole range of facilities that are on offer, such as physiotherapy, X-ray, chiropody and guidance on health and the prevention of illness. That is precisely what the expansion of primary health care was all about, and it is enormously welcome to the people served. That is why, despite all the pressures, GP fundholding has been a considerable success. Under exactly that arrangement, but within the health service, all those facilities could have been and were provided out of general taxation on a per capita basis.
<P>
I entirely agree that preventive medicine is important. In the White Paper ``The Health of the Nation'', specific targets were set for dealing with diseases such as cancer, heart attacks and strokes, and advice was given on how to prevent them by cutting down on certain foods, on cigarettes, and so on. As I understand it from examples in the White Paper and from further comments made by the Secretary of State, the services that healthy living centres will provide are being provided adequately, and will have been expanded perfectly satisfactorily, by GP fundholder practices.
<P>
As I said, the emphasis in the past few years--quite legitimately; this is not a party political issue--has been to try to focus on primary health care, to encourage people to think about their health and to prevent them from getting ill unnecessarily as a result of their lifestyle or activities. That has been an enormous success. The White Paper makes it clear that healthy living centres are to be part of the Government's health care provision. It states directly:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``healthy living centres will play an important role in the Government's public health strategy''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Time and again, as we review the areas which thus far have had funds committed to them from the proposed New Opportunities Fund, we find that there is a clash. The additionality principle is being flouted. I fully accept that many people may want an expansion of information technology provision and training, the extension of primary health care, training for librarians and provision for out-of-school activities, but it is absolutely wrong that the arts, sport, heritage and other good causes--the caring charities--should suffer as a consequence. Those are core responsibilities of Government; that is one of the main flaws at the heart of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I feel that we should note en passant that we have experienced an historic event in Committee this afternoon. Not one year into this Parliament, we have had the first nervous question from a Labour Member about what the Conservative Government will do. I congratulate the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Murphy) on his perceptiveness, and on being the first person to reveal that mood.
<P>
<B>Mr. Levitt:</B> My hon. Friend also believes that Scotland will win the world cup.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> One out of two is not bad. If the hon. Member for Eastwood believes that, he clearly gets some things right and some things wrong.
<P>
Our debate is revealing the full range of problems raised by the Government's proposals. One of those, with which my hon. Friend the Member for West Suffolk has dealt, is the negation--or, at least, the whittling away--of the arm's-length principle, which we want to retain. We do not do so in any partisan spirit. After all, the principle was introduced to British public life by Lord Keynes, a Liberal, when he helped to set up the Arts Council for a Labour Government after the second world war. It has been one of the better principles of British public life; it has survived many changes of Government and has been seen to serve the arts community--and the various other interest groups who have received lottery moneys during the past few years--well.
<P>
Lord Gowrie made the point well during debates on the issue in another place, when he talked about the whittling away of that principle by the New Opportunities Fund. That is important in the long run for the future integrity not only of the lottery, but of all Government grant-in-aid to what, in ``lottery speak'', are called good causes--to those areas of life that are seen as desirable, but which do not find state support essential. The Government should not place the arm's length principle in danger, but that is precisely what they are doing in clause 6.
<P>
The New Opportunities Fund, as Lord McIntosh made clear, stands in an entirely different relationship with the Secretary of State from that of any other distribution body. It has much less freedom to act on its own initiative and decide what it wants to do about individual applications. The Government do not tell the Arts Council how much it can spend on opera or ballet, or how much it should give to literature or the cinema. However, the New Opportunities Fund will be told by the Government how much it can spend on its various activities. That, by itself, is a serious breach of the arm's-length principle.
<P>
<B>Mr. Prior:</B> I am sure that my hon. Friend is aware that not only will the Government lay down how much is to be spent on each activity, but, within each activity, they will set out how much is to be spent on each part--and also in which part of the country. For example, of the &#163;400 million that the Government say can be spent on out-of-school-hours activities, they say that &#163;180 million should go to educational activities, &#163;200 million should go to child care, and &#163;20 million should go to individual projects. That money will then be subdivided, to be spent in various parts of the country.
<P>
Mr. Green
<P>
: My hon. Friend anticipates a point that I was about to make. The idea that the Government lay down in detail which areas of activity the fund should finance is a clear breach of the arm's-length principle. However, as my hon. Friend made clear, the Government wish to go much further. They want to abolish the arm's-length principle; there will not even be a hand's-length principle. The Government will be in it all the way; every decision will be made at the instigation of the Secretary of State, and will be under the control of the Secretary of State. That will corrupt the whole process.
<P>
I shall be charitable and assume that every Secretary of State will exercise that power without a thought for political advantage, or for gaining personal or party benefit. Even so, like Caesar's wife, they must not only be above reproach but be seen to be above reproach. No Secretary of State, given those powers, can be seen to be above reproach. The very fact that the powers to intervene are so detailed means that the process will fall under suspicion.
<P>
As we made clear in previous debates, the setting up of the New Opportunities Fund will increase the ratio of losers to winners. The Minister has been in power long enough to know, if he did not know before, that losers make more noise than winners. The Government are knowingly creating more losers. [Interruption.] If the hon. Member for Slough (Fiona Mactaggart) wishes to intervene, or if other Labour Members can bring themselves to speak in support of the clause, which they have so far failed to do, I invite them to raise themselves from their sedentary positions and speak publicly.
<P>
Creating a new and larger class of losers will ensure that resentment will build up. That will cause a degree of opprobrium to fall on the Government. I do not care about that, but I do care that opprobrium may fall on the whole lottery process, which has done much good during the past four years. It would be unfortunate if Ministers went down that route, which they hope will gain them political advantage, because it would bring the lottery into disrepute.
<P>
The fact that that is not a particularly partisan point was illustrated in the debate in another place, when several Liberal Democrat peers made remarks along the same lines. Some said that they were deeply disturbed by the clause, parts of which we want to amend, especially by the provisions which state:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the New Opportunities Fund shall comply with any directions given to them by the Secretary of State . . . An initiative may be so framed that it applies--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) throughout the whole of the United Kingdom; or
<P>
(b) in one or more areas of the United Kingdom''.
<P>
</UL></FONT>The phrase that I enjoy most states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the Secretary of State shall consult such persons as appear to him to be appropriate.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That gives the Secretary of State a free hand to do whatever he likes in any circumstances.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Lord Redesdale said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Almost anything that enters the Secretary of State's mind on any particular day of the week may be inserted into the new opportunities fund and the wording of this clause gives no indication of where limitation should be put on the Secretary of State over his actions.--[Official Report, House of Lords, 22 January 1998; Vol. 584, CWH 68.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I agree with that point. Not only is it damaging; it is genuinely dangerous for the long-term health of the lottery that the Secretary of State should be arrogating to himself such detailed control. That is not only illustrated in the Bill; it appears in a document that we received this morning, which outlines the policy directions to the New Opportunities Fund. Under the heading, ``healthy living centres'', it states that the fund should establish or develop health living centres
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``accessible to around 20 per cent. of the population of the UK.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I revert to my point about there being more losers than winners. Clearly, the Government have accepted that that much-trumpeted policy will have no effect on 80 per cent. of the population of the United Kingdom. I dare say that will cause major disappointment in the constituencies of many Labour Members, whose constituents, having read about the New Opportunities Fund and thinking that healthy living centres will be provided for them, will find that they do not qualify. I wish Labour Members joy when they explain to their constituents why the wonderful new ``people's lottery'' will not provide anything for them. I expect that they will find it difficult to do so.
<P>
That will not be a problem for me, however, because one area in my constituency rates consistently as one of the most deprived areas in Kent. I suppose that that area will be eligible to receive some of the money that will go towards healthy living centres. I do not say that in a partisan spirit, but it is illustrative of many things that are wrong with the Bill. The fund has been oversold. It will not provide a national network of healthy living centres. The network will be accessible only to 20 per cent. of the population, so it will disappoint people. Moreover, the Secretary of State will be given too much power to decide who will form the 20 per cent.

<P>

<B>Mr. Prior:</B> Let us take healthy living standards as an example. If the health authority is considering how far to fund primary health care, how much should it decide to fund healthy living centres, which are already provided by many fundholding practices? To what extent should a health authority rely on the lottery? Does my hon. Friend agree that health authorities will be put in a difficult position?
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I suspect that many health authorities will say, ``Oh, good. We have stretched budgets. We are desperate to keep our hospital beds occupied. We are worried about ward closures and community hospital closures.'' In my constituency, one community hospital is under great threat. The authorities will say, ``If we do not have to provide anything out of our own funds for health living centres, we will not. We can dump all this on the lottery and need not care about it. If someone complains that we are not up with our neighbouring health authority because we are not providing healthy living centres, we can point at the Secretary of State, the lottery and the New Opportunities Fund and say, ``Don't blame us. It's not our problem, it's theirs. We are just about the ill--not healthy living.''
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> My hon. Friend is right to point out that the fund will apply to only 20 per cent. of the population and that it is targeted at those allegedly in the most deprived areas. However, is he aware that, in October, the Government changed the funding formula for the payment per capita to two health authorities? When asked to explain the change from an entirely measurable and quantitative basis to something that was much more subjective, they were unable to do so. If they were unable to define the funding formula clearly, what on earth will they do when they have to make a subjective judgment?
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> My hon. Friend makes an extremely good point. It will be a dog's breakfast, with different rules in different areas of the country. There will be different guidance, with people unsure why they are--or are not--getting a healthy living centre. Neither health authorities nor GP fundholders will know whether to provide one. Bids will be made, some of which will be turned down, as lottery bids are, and the net effect will be to demoralise many of those who already work in the health service to promote healthy living. Overall, there will be huge disappointment--[Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am sorry to interrupt the hon. Gentleman, but there is too much noise in the background, which is unfair on the hon. Member speaking and the rest of the Committee. Without specifying individuals, I ask hon. Members to keep the noise down.
<P>
<B>M. Green:</B> I am grateful, Mr. Benton.
<P>
Another serious point needs to be addressed at this stage. Apart from the damage that will be caused by the abrogation of the arm's length principle, and the greater powers being given to the Secretary of State, existing good causes will be damaged. I know from conversations with several of the existing grant-giving bodies that they are genuinely confused about the effect on them of the New Opportunities Fund, and I hope that Ministers can give them some reassurance.
<P>
The Minister said that the existing good causes could act under their existing planning totals. They can see how well Camelot has done up to now, and they wonder what will happen if Camelot does even better than is projected and raises more than &#163;10 billion and, of course, what will happen if it does worse and for some reason the lottery starts doing badly. That is not a completely unrealistic proposition. At the time of the GTech scandal, there was a genuine fear that people would be turned off from the lottery. Which of us knows that something similar will not happen in the future? We all devoutly hope that it will not, but something might happen that will reduce lottery proceeds considerably and bring the figures back below the original planning totals.
<P>
I know that the fear of many of the good causes that have been benefiting for the past four years is that the New Opportunities Fund will be the only one that is ring-fenced and that will be in a privileged position if there are problems. The good causes would welcome reassurance from the Minister. If there is more money to go around, everyone expects it to be divided by six. If there is less money than was originally thought, the misery should be shared out and the New Opportunities Fund should not receive any particular privileged treatment. It is not just a question of the existing good causes wishing to get their fair share of the cake in the abstract, because their existing commitments might last several years. They have already made promises, typically for two or three years in advance, and they need to know that they can meet their commitments to the bodies to which they are giving grants. For example, two thirds of the grants in the charity sphere are for revenue projects, as Ministers will know, and they would not want to be seen to be letting down the recipients.
<P>
What will happen to the Millennium Commission's share after September 2001, when the current contract ends? The good causes must know what will happen after that date to be able to plan sensibly now. The Secretary of State has said that he hopes that the grant-giving bodies can start to plan five years ahead. Obviously, they cannot do so if they are unsure what will happen after September 2001. The introduction of the new good cause and its apparent privileged position in Government planning has compounded the problem of their inability to know what will happen to them after that date. That has resulted in unnecessary uncertainty.
<P>
The Committee will agree that the dividing line on additionality has, at best, become fuzzier. We all agree that the line has never been exactly clear but, under the Bill, it will become less so, especially in the charity sector. Many charities feel unfairly treated, given the spheres of activity into which the New Opportunities Fund is moving. They think that they are being implicitly or explicitly criticised for not doing enough in those spheres. However, charities and the Sports Council have, for example, done much to ensure that children can take part in useful after-school activities, some of which the New Opportunities fund will want to encourage. Indeed, in some areas, charities have tried to work with the health service to promote the sort of activities that healthy living centres will promote.
<P>
The Government think that there are no enormous cracks down which various good causes have fallen. However, uncertainty has arisen, given the timing of the Bill, as to whether the New Opportunities Fund can deliver in three years. The experience so far is that everyone involved in the administration of the lottery becomes better at it the longer they do it.
<P>
By setting up the New Opportunities Fund and ring-fencing its funds, but only for three years because of the length of the licence, there is a danger that uncertainty will arise in the third year, exactly when money is ready to be spent after the bids have come in. The existing good causes are worried that, if any problem arises then, the Government will be more kind to their own new toy--that they will take money from other good causes to ensure that the New Opportunities Fund fulfils all its commitments.
<P>
Those are the genuine fears of those who have been involved in the lottery from the start. They are worried that, whatever the Government's good intentions might be, the net effect of the New Opportunities Fund will be to damage the good work that they are doing. Frankly, they fear the Government's proposal because they think that this is the thin end of the wedge. They fear that the Government have noticed that a large, desirable pot of money exists and that the Bill is about grabbing it; they fear that more grabs will be made in future, which will do long-term harm to the great work done by many grant-giving bodies.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Fiona Mactaggart </B>(Slough): I shall briefly deal with additionality as someone who has been involved in raising money for and in giving money to good causes. It is not only in regard to the Bill that there is difficulty in deciding what additionality means; it is a problem faced by many grant-giving organisations throughout the country that want to fund innovative, additional initiatives that are outside a body's core business. The amendment is, frankly, silly in the way it attempts to tackle that.
<P>
The hon. Member for North Norfolk made the ludicrous comment that some parts of the national curriculum are more important than others. As a former teacher and teacher trainer, I remind him that schools have a legal responsibility to teach all the national curriculum, whether PE or technology.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> The hon. Lady is being a little too dogmatic. The Secretary of State for Education and Employment recently placed substantial emphasis on numeracy and literacy at primary school level. As she will know from her constituency, that is having a major impact on the way in which the teaching of young people is carried out. So, different emphases are placed on different subjects.
<P>
<B>Fiona Mactaggart:</B> It is true that the Secretary of State has required that the programmes of study for the three core subjects remain in place whereas those for the foundation subjects do not have to be implemented, but technology and sport are foundation subjects. That differentiation has existed since the creation of the national curriculum, so although it has been re-emphasised, it does not create any new differences between foundation subjects.
<P>
<B>Mr. Prior:</B> One of the problems with the Government's proposals is that the funding of core, mainstream activities will be subject to the lottery, which is bound to cause inequalities between different schools, primary health care groups and so on. That is unsatisfactory.
<P>
<B>Fiona Mactaggart:</B> I am afraid that the hon. Gentleman has not understood the difference between core and mainstream. The lottery will not fund a body's core business--its basic business. We are not proposing that, for example, technology training or initial teacher training should be supported in that way. We are talking about innovative, additional projects that will enhance Britain's leading edge in technology in schools.
<P>
I said earlier that additionality is a problem that affects people who give money in many different areas. All the major trusts have to decide how to use their grants innovatively without substituting for public funding. Do people say, ``We will not give anything unless applicants have a certificate proving that the project is not going to be nationally funded''? No, they look at a number of features that test additionality, particularly innovation; we are clearly talking about very innovative projects. Historically, innovative voluntary activity has subsequently been municipalised or nationalised. The classic example is the meals-on-wheels service, which was started voluntarily by the Women's Royal Voluntary Service, but is now a fundmental, core business of local government and local authorities. The legislation suggests how we can use the New Opportunities Fund to innovate--to push forward the boundaries of what might become core business.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Spring:</B> I think that the hon. Lady is confusing two separate, distinct issues. No one is denying that such projects may be desirable--they may be very desirable because, as she said, there is an information explosion and information technology has become very important. However, we already know that under the grants for the education support and training programme, which is just under &#163;300 million, 5 per cent. is already spent on IT training. We also know that the TECs are involved in that. Does the hon. Lady believe that the taxpayer should stop funding such projects and that taxes should be replaced by money from the national lottery? Is that what she is saying?
<P>
<B>Fiona Mactaggart:</B> Absolutely not. I am saying that we recognise that the existing programmes will not enable us to be at the leading edge. I have been in too many primary classrooms where the teachers depend on the geeky boy to teach the other children how to work the computer. Frankly, that will not do; it is dangerous. We can ensure that every primary teacher leaving a training institution can make the computer work, but we are not in a position to ensure that they can use the power of information technology in the most innovative ways possible in the curriculum.
<P>
The point about the programme is that it begins with the digitalisation of learning materials, for example, and includes projects such as the wide programme to enable teachers to make the leap forward from the usually rather pedestrian teaching to using the opportunities provided by new technology to create a new way of learning. Additionality is about going beyond the basic core--the ordinary stuff--to innovate in a dynamic and dramatic way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> The Government accept that these are core responsibilities or they would not be spending taxpayers' money on them. Once again, the hon. Lady is unable to draw a distinction between what is desirable and what is essential. She is saying that what is desirable should be undertaken at the expense of the arts, sport, the built heritage and caring charities. That is her criterion. It is not a valid distinction and I believe that, on reflection, she will agree that it is wrong that what is, after all, an important part of the education process should be at the expense of the arts, sport and so forth.
<P>
<B>Fiona Mactaggart:</B> First, it is not at the expense of those things. We rehearsed the argument at length earlier. What is clear is that the existing good causes have the resources initially envisaged when the lottery was introduced. What is proposed is an additional measure that has clearly been endorsed; the Opposition made much of the degree to which it was discussed during the election campaign when it was focused on, changed and developed. It was extremely popular with the voters. They knew what they were voting for and they did it in troops. Many of my hon. Friends are surprised to be here. They were elected because of the enthusiasm of voters in their constituencies for this and other policies.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> I fully accept that the hon. Lady's party achieved a considerable electoral success a year ago, but the Labour party's two foundation pledges were on education and the national health service, as the hon. Lady said. What has happened, as she well knows, is that waiting lists have lengthened. In the largest town in my constituency, ambulance cover has been withdrawn. Waiting lists in the county have doubled in the past six months and in education, values are declining. Yes, the voters voted for the Labour party, but they are not getting what they wanted, hence the robbery of the lottery to bridge the gap.
<P>
<B>Fiona Mactaggart:</B> That is not true. I share some of the hon. Gentleman's concern that we have not been able to reduce the speed with which waiting lists, which we inherited, have increased. That is very disappointing, but there is no suggestion that any resources from the New Opportunities Fund should be given to deal with waiting lists. That is what the pledge was about. Healthy living centres are an innovation in preventing ill health.
<P>
The amendment is particularly ludicrous because it suggests that it should be specified that some projects will not be funded by the public sector. The hon. Member for West Suffolk referred to that matter when he mentioned the child care strategy that will be funded jointly by the New Opportunities Fund and the Treasury.
<P>
The Opposition fail to recognise that we do business in partnership with other sections of the community. There are many examples of existing good causes, supported by the lottery, that work in partnership with statutory and commercial bodies, for example, the single regeneration budget partnerships in my constituency. The Nai Roshni partnership involves big companies such as Mars, little companies, the local authority, Government funding through SRB, charities and voluntary organisations, making Slough a better place for young unemployed people.
<P>
The measure acknowledges that the Government cannot do it all, but that they can provide leadership and initiative. There can be a dynamic partnership between public, private and lottery money.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> Before the hon. Lady finishes her speech, I want to respond to her description of the amendment as ludicrous, and perhaps prevent embarrassment. Our amendments are almost identical to those tabled by Labour Members during the passage of the National Lottery etc. Act 1993, which enshrined the principle of additionality. The hon. Lady describes amendments that were tabled by the Labour party in 1993 to protect that principle as ludicrous. What on earth has changed?
<P>
<B>Fiona Mactaggart:</B> It seems that we have learned--[Interruption.] What has happened to the Conservative party? The hon. Gentleman must have believed that Labour party amendments were wrong during the passage of the 1993 Bill. Therefore, let us leave the matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Prior:</B> Does the hon. Lady agree that, although it is difficult to define additionality, its greatest safeguard is the independence of the distributor of the fund, and operation at arm's length from Government? Does she agree that the wording of the Bill implies that that is not the case?
<P>
<B>Fiona Mactaggart:</B> Absolutely not. The distributor plays a key role and the hon. Gentleman was right to highlight it. Distribution of money from the New Opportunities Fund will not be made by the Secretary of State, as some Opposition Members implied. It will be distributed by an independent fund board. Therefore, the money will not constitute Government spending, or a substitute for it. It is an opportunity to fulfil our promise to provide a people's lottery. I do not feel cynical about that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Christopher Fraser </B>(Mid-Dorset and North Poole): Several aspects of clause 6 should be examined in more detail, especially in the light of comments on amendment No. 23.
<P>
The additionality principle has overturned at a stroke the important principle of the lottery. The distributing bodies that were specified in the 1993 Act were truly independent of Government, but clause 6, which is at the heart of the Bill, gives direct control of the fund to the Secretary of State by specifying initiatives. The 1993 Act states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``A body shall comply with any directions given to it by the Secretary of State as to the matters to be taken into account in determining the persons to whom, the purposes for which and the conditions subject to which the body distributes any money''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That relationship has worked well. To direct someone to take something into account is different from being ordered to do something.
<P>
If we compare the framework and conditions specified for the old distributors with those in proposed new section 43--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am sorry, but the hon. Gentleman is talking about a group of amendments that we discussed this morning. We are now discussing the amendments relating to additionality. I would ask the hon. Member to keep to that subject.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Fraser:</B> I thank you, Mr. Benton, for your guidance.
<P>
Government spending programmes evolve over time and, even using the most creative accounting, the Government cannot transfer the cost of such evolution to the lottery. Spending on health, education and the environment will be specified by the Secretary of State, who becomes, in effect, a distributing body. How can that be other than Treasury led? What has happened to the hands-off principle that safeguarded the independence of the original good causes? Will the Minister address those matters?
<P>
Is the brief for the New Opportunities Fund as open ended as it appears? Is there any limit to what it can finance? Can the Secretary of State, on a whim or a fancy, put to it anything that he considers worthwhile, for political motives? Will such decisions be limited in any way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> The setting of a precedent is at the heart of this matter. If the Secretary of State takes the powers referred to in the clause, he may set out three additional areas of spending under the New Opportunities Fund. Where will it end? The difficulty is that once the principle of additionality has been broken, as it so clearly is by the provisions, the floodgates will open for potential abuse. That is our concern for the future.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fraser:</B> I wholeheartedly agree with my hon. Friend. All sorts of other things might come into play at a later stage. Our amendments tackle those issues.
<P>
The clause announces spending on the environment. Environment is a generic term, all-inclusive in many respects. What do the Government mean by the word ``environment''? Do they mean the social environment, the natural environment or some other environment that evolves with society?

On resuming--
<P>
<B>Mr. Fraser:</B> I shall just remove my jacket and remind myself where I left off. I shall do my best to keep my comments to the matter of additionality, as described earlier, and how it relates to the amendment.
<P>
The principles of arm's length and of additionality go together, in my book. If the Secretary of State did not have the relevant power, he would not be able to breach the additionality principle. In effect, anything that the Secretary of State spends is Government spending. We want to limit the power of the Secretary of State through the amendment and new clause--to place limits on what he can or cannot do. If he is directing spending, the Secretary of State is spending Government money.
<P>
Amendment No. 23 would allow the New Opportunities Fund to make grants only where it was clearly demonstrated that any programmes thus supported would not otherwise be funded from taxation. That is important. If limits are not set on the powers of the Secretary of State, there is surely nothing to prevent him from trying to supplement public spending from lottery funds. The Committee must be mindful of the fact that the Labour party in opposition tabled a similar amendment to ours in 1993. I should like to think that the Minister for Arts would support such an amendment again today. I do not see how the Bill can be reconciled with the Secretary of State's assurance, given on Second Reading, about the additionality principle.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Spring:</B> The point, as I am sure the Minister would acknowledge, is that we have been careful about not breaching additionality. There was no need to table those amendments to the original Bill because the risk was never borne out in practice, which is a great tribute to those who have operated the national lottery.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fraser:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend and agree with him entirely. I suspect that the Government will suggest that they have the support of the consultation process for their plans. This has been touched on earlier but I should like to touch on it again. As my hon. Friend the Member for West Suffolk has pointed out, that exercise was entirely phoney: there were just 92 responses. The Minister rather pooh-poohed that fact when I raised it earlier but it is worth remembering. There were 92 responses from individuals and 496 from organisations with, dare I say it, a vested interest and which in effect stand to gain from lottery grants if the rules are changed. Such consultation gives no confidence for the future.
<P>
On no fewer than five occasions in his Second Reading speech Lord McIntosh mentioned that more than 90 per cent of respondents approved of the Government's proposals, but that is absurd. Of the 588 responses received, 496 came from local authorities, schools, and campaign and professional groups which all stand to gain from the Government's proposals.
<P>
The clause allows the Government to support a rolling programme of their own specific initiatives as determined by the Secretary of State. Future consultations, if correctly worded, will produce entirely the same result as the first, with resounding support from those who stand to gain. Like my hon. Friends, I would not suggest that the extra money for health and education would be unpopular with the country at large. Of course it will not. As was mentioned earlier, by my hon. Friend the Member for West Suffolk, beneficiaries will certainly support it. That is obvious but the danger is that these mainstream areas will rise higher and higher in the priorities of the Secretary of State,
<P>
It is becoming rather hackneyed, but it is worth repeating that this is the thin end of the wedge. That sums up what the Government are setting out to achieve with the Bill. As it stands, the Bill provides further evidence, if it were needed, that the Government are centralising control over all aspects of British life. We are told that new Labour is a party of decentralisation, of government being created at all levels in all parts of the country. We hear that, yet the clause cuts right across that principle which the Government espoused at the election and which they have talked about since.
<P>
Where are we? Either we are a country of decentralisation, or money is given directly to the Secretary of State in this instance or to any other Secretary of State. That is contrary to what the Government should be doing: they are saying one thing and doing another. This Bill and the additionality principle prove that the Government are riding roughshod not just over Parliament but over the people of the country. The setting up of the New Opportunities Fund means that power is being taken from the distributing bodies and vested in central Government.
<P>
The Government are seeking as much power over the spending of the lottery money as they exercise over normal tax finance spending. Having obtained that power, how easy it will be to extend it. That is why the principle of additionality is most important; otherwise, the process will be abused by the Government in ways that will not please any one.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> My hon. Friend makes an important point. Although we have had assurances from the Minister about his good faith and that of the Secretary of State, which we naturally accept, the provision opens the potential for abuse--for Governments to raid the lottery for entirely party political purposes. It is bad enough to fill the gaps in public expenditure which the inadequacy of Government funding has revealed, but what will happen in future? We, as guardians of Parliament and of the people's rights and responsibilities, must take special care of the precedent set for future generations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fraser:</B> I agree entirely with my hon. Friend; an unhealthy precedent is being set in the Bill. As I said, having obtained that power, how easy it will be to extend it. I shall not speculate this afternoon as to how that may happen; Government members of the Committee will realise that they may say now that they will not extend it, but who knows what will happen in future as policy evolves? That also gives the lie to the Government's claim that the lottery is the people's lottery.
<P>
The lottery is an important aspect of life in this country. As we have said, people want funding to be at arm's length from Government, because they want money to be ring-fenced, so that it is clear where the money is going. The additional sixth cause proposed in the clause drives a wedge between what people think their lottery money is being spent on and what it will actually be spent on. Public-sector organisations stand to benefit. The clause centralises power and stifles local initiative--something that the hon. Member for Forest of Dean (Mrs. Organ) and I discussed the other day. I made the point then that we want local initiatives in which people present their case for lottery funds. If the Government and the Secretary of State are to decide where money is to be spent, that will stifle what the lottery was set up to achieve. That would be a great pity.
<P>
I shall briefly touch on a couple of points that have already been raised about specific aspects of the clause. As I said earlier, spending programmes continually evolve, but we must not give the Government the right to transfer revenue, by creative accounting, from the national lottery to part of their spending programme. If the changes to be introduced are new social aspects of spending programmes, such as the training of teachers and librarians in information technology, the Government are not doing their job properly. The issue of core funding, which has been discussed at some length this afternoon, must be addressed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> My hon. Friend makes a critical point. The whole future success of this country will depend on our ability to grapple with information technology and appropriately to educate our young people to use it. That is a prerequisite to our educational and economic success. Without doubt that is a core Government responsibility; central Government taxation-based money should be spent on it. I am sure that my hon. Friend agrees with that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fraser:</B> I agree entirely with my hon. Friend. In another Committee on which I am fortunate to sit--as do two other members of this Committee, one Conservative and one Liberal Democrat--whether information technology shoud be part of Government core spending is being considered as we speak. Many presentations have been made by organisations, commercial and otherwise, who understand that core spending on technology is part of education, and not divorced from it. It is not something that one can merely add; it is a key part of education and will remain so as we go through the technological revolution.

I have asked several times what the healthy living centres are. So far, I have not been given a true answer, except that the funds that the Government propose to put into the centres are the same funds presently used by GP fundholders to the advantage of the communities in which they serve. By extension, one must ask whether the clause represents another way of reducing the taxpayers' expenditure on GP fundholders, and the good done by fundholding practices will in future be paid for and supplemented by lottery money.
<P>
<B>Mr. Prior:</B> Is my hon. Friend aware that the White Paper states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``healthy living centres will play an important role in the Government's public health strategy''?<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Indeed, healthy living centres will be a key part of primary care.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fraser:</B> Again, my hon. Friend illustrates the point. Healthy living centres are a key part of the process and they should therefore not be funded with lottery money as proposed.
<P>
Many questions need to be considered, and the Government should be mindful of various aspects of the clause and of our amendments, given that they supported the idea when in opposition. The Minister should answer some of the points, which have been raised many times by the Opposition--so much so that we are over-saying them.--[Laughter.] When we get some sensible answers to our questions, and if the Government approve the amendment, we can move on to something else, but until then we must keep pressing the point home.
<P>
<B>Mr. Levitt:</B> I was inspired to speak because the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole (Mr. Fraser) managed to get so many things so wrong in such a short time. It is precisely because lottery funding has not been distributed as equitably as it might have been that it is time to review how it works.
<P>
One reason for the inequitable distribution of funds across the country has been the inability of some areas to find matched funding. Some areas have suffered because others have got in first and gained experience of how to compile lottery bids and so on. It is absolutely necessary to have a framework and to provide reference points, to ensure that the distribution is democratic and fair throughout the country and throughout the different strata of society.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes a fair point. There has been a difference in the response to requests for lottery funding from various parts of the country. No one would dispute that. Indeed, if it is possible to speed up the process and make it easier to apply, no one will object. That has nothing to do with the breaching of the principle of additionality and the robbery of money from the lottery to pay for what is essentially a core Government responsibility. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will move on to additionality, but on that first point, there is no essential disagreement between us.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Levitt:</B> I was arguing about the arm's-length principle mentioned by the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole. I shall certainly return to the question of additionality and core funding, and I have already explained why a framework should be in position. I am not saying that just because the Secretary of State is with us; I had already found the quotation from his Second Reading speech about shifting the focus to ensure that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``lottery money addresses the real needs of communities'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and that projects should make a real difference. My right hon. Friend also said that the Bill acknowledges
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the need to focus on children and young people'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and that it would ``contribute to sustainable development'' and to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``reducing economic and social deprivation.''--[Official Report, 7 April 1998; Vol. 310, c. 170-171.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I agree that that is a political framework, but it is one that is absolutely consistent with the aims and practice of the lottery over the past four years, especially in the charities sector of its operation.
<P>
Additionality has been covered in various ways. Opposition Members have failed to appreciate that all the existing good causes, including the arts, sport and heritage, for example, are all part of a strategy. The arts policy includes lottery as well as Government funding, as do the policies on sport and heritage. We cannot say that there are no-go areas for lottery funding and taxation. We are talking about additional projects, which may be similar and complement what already takes place, but which do not replace or substitute what is provided for by taxation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> The hon. Gentleman is making an important point. He knows the way of the world in terms of politics, and that the arts, charities, the built heritage and sport will never be at the head of any receiving queue. There will always be other priorities. Economic circumstances change and there may be pressures for spending on health, education and so on. The reason why the former Department of National Heritage was established in the first place was to give protection, encouragement and financial support to areas that had been and always would be under-resourced. The distribution bodies will be adversely affected because money will be taken from them and will go to areas that should be, and have traditionally been, the responsibility of central Government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Levitt:</B> We covered the question of the amount of funding this morning, and my hon. Friend the Minister for Arts stressed forcefully that the &#163;1.8 billion that was expected by each of the good causes was what they would get. We voted on the issue and we remember the result. On Second Reading the Secretary of State said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The principle is clear. Lottery money must not replace Exchequer spending--it must add new value. We stand firm by that principle.''--[Official Report, 7 April 1998; Vol. 310, c. 166.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Fraser:</B> Can the hon. Gentleman give me some guidance? We are talking about additionality, but does he agree that given that we live in an age of technological change and movement, the application of technology in schools should be a core spending commitment for the Government, rather than coming from lottery funds?
<P>
<B>Mr. Levitt:</B> I certainly agree that the initial training of teachers, which includes information technology, is a responsibility that should be undertaken by central Government through taxation. When new technology is brought into existing schools--some of it is funded by Tesco, as we have already mentioned, and some of it is funded by the lottery--there is often a huge backlog of teachers who require training. They need to be brought up to speed because such technology training was not available when they qualified. That involves training that is expensive in comparison with teacher training budgets, grants for education support and so on, which must be completed in a relatively short time and is in addition to what has gone before. It might be trail blazing for the future, but it is quite legitimate to pay for that additional training from this one-off source.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> The hon. Gentleman gives the game away when he talks about trail blazing for the future. That is exactly the point that Conservative Members object to. He says that a door is opening, but a precedent will be created for national lottery spending to supplant core Government responsibility for spending.
<P>
Teachers have always undertaken retraining programmes to update their skills--for example, to keep up with the changes in the teaching of mathematics. Does the hon. Gentleman suggest that national lottery money should be used every time a teacher needs specialist retraining? That appears to be what he is saying. It is absurd.
<P>
<B>Mr. Levitt:</B> No, of course I am not saying that. We have a backlog of retraining programmes for teachers. Access to the internet and new technologies have created a new situation, and we need new teaching methods to cope with the associated changes to the curriculum. Teachers might never have considered skills in such subjects to be part of their job.
<P>
As the hon. Member for West Suffolk has pointed out, we already have in-service and pre-service teacher training funded through taxation, and in future the new teaching skills will be included in those programmes. That is the current account way. We are discussing a one-off way of bringing teachers up to speed to complement the existing training programmes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Prior:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman accept that information technology will continue to change for the foreseeable future? Does he therefore accept that support from the lottery will also have to go on for ever?
<P>
<B>Mr. Levitt:</B> No, not necessarily.
<P>
A quantum leap is about to take place in the way in which technology and education interface. It is the only one of its kind that will occur so quickly during my lifetime. I speak as someone who taught for 19 years, and who used information technology. I have written programmes for computer use in schools, and continue to make a small income from them.
<P>
As the subject of educaton has been raised, I want to say that I will not take lessons on the additionality principle from representatives of the previous Government. They put groups such as parent-teacher organisations and friends of schools into terrible quandaries over additionality. Such groups get together to raise money for their children and specifically declare that they will abide by the additionality principle. They do not provide books, desks or teachers for schools, but they provide the extras which help to make a better and rounder education for their children.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fraser:</B> On many occasions, in another part of this building, a Select Committee has discussed the issue of an information-rich and an information-poor society. In that Committee, the Government have stated that they want everyone to be part of an information-rich society and that schools should offer everyone the same opportunities. By default, therefore, the teaching of technology must become part of core Government spending. Does the hon. Member for High Peak agree?
<P>
<B>Mr. Levitt:</B> I also want us to be an arts and culture-rich society. That is why I believe that the way forward lies in a partnership between lottery and taxation funding.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman returned to an earlier subject of our debate. He has obviously guessed what I intended to say about parents' organisations and wants to divert me. Groups of parents in many schools said that they would stick to the additionality principle and that they would not provide the essentials for schools. That was the responsibility of the local authority. Parents should only provide the extras. However, they have had to wrestle with their consciences over the additionality principle. They see schools losing teachers, unable to replace furniture and so on because of the previous Government's spending policies on education. That is certainly the case in Derbyshire, where I come from. It is entirely due to the wrong priorities of the previous Government.
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Additionality can be a difficult concept to maintain, particularly when there is a starvation of the mainstream tax-funded resource. It forces people to think very hard. Some of them stuck by their principles and some of them did not. Some of them would have regretted the decision, whichever way it had gone.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nigel Waterson (Eastbourne):</B> Perhaps I could put aside the complexity and difficulty about which the hon. Gentleman has spoken. Can he assure me with a straight face that when the benefits are incorporated into education or the NHS, we shall not have Labour Ministers smiling into the camera and trying to take the credit for such projects, as if they had been funded out of taxation? That is the acid test, if we strip away all the verbage about additionality.
<P>
<B>Mr. Levitt:</B> Of course we shall take the credit for these innovations, because we are setting up the New Opportunities Fund to provide the very services that we are discussing. The hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole mentioned fundholding general practitioners, and the healthy living centres that some of them have set up. Indeed, some of them have set up units that are close to our concept of healthy living centres. Unfortunately, there was no consistency or rule about those units.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> That is absurd. The healthy living centres will be available to 20 per cent. of the population, in accordance with criteria of social deprivation. If the hon. Gentleman is talking about inconsistency of services provided under the broad umberella of the NHS, by definition--as stated in the draft regulations being issued by the Minister--it is clear that the inconsistency will continue. I do not understand the objection.
<P>
<B>Mr. Levitt:</B> There is no inconsistency in targeting resources where they are most needed. We are discussing healthy living centres that come through lottery funding only. There are already organisations that call themselves healthy living centres and there is no reason why commissioning groups of GPs, under the new health service arrangements, should not set up healthy living centres that do not rely on lottery funding. Again, it is matter of partnership.
<P>
In summary, the issues raised by Opposition Members are spurious. They do not accept the reality of the way in which lottery funding has been distributed until now. They do not accept the partnership that must exist between lottery funding and taxation in all the operations in which lottery funding gets involved. Finally--this point may relate to this morning's debate--there is no reason why sports organisations, voluntary sector organisations or even arts organisations should not set up schemes and apply for money under the New Opportunities Fund in order to provide services that meet its criteria. Far from reducing the funding, it may give those organisations greater opportunities to broaden their horizons and activities.

<P>

<B>Mr. Prior:</B> I suppose that the high spot of the afternoon, apart from listening to the eloquence of my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole, was when the Minister of Sport produced his donor card, but it was put away in rather a hurry--[Interruption.]
<P>
I shall continue Mr. Benton. Having listened carefully to the debate about additionality, it seems to me that the only guarantee of additionality and the only guaranteed way of stopping the Government from using the money for their own benefit will be if the distributing body is truly independent.
<P>
When I discussed this issue on Third Reading it was pointed out to me, perhaps by a Labour Member that in new section 43B, which subsection (2) would add to the 1993 Act, the use of the word ``may'' was extremely important. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The New Opportunities Fund--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) may make grants''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``(b) may make or enter into arrangement''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This was purported to give a degree of discretion. However, new section 43C, which follows, makes it clear that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``in exercising their functions under section 43B the new Opportunities Fund shall comply with any directions given to them by the Secretary of State.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The use of the word ``shall'' removes any doubt at all as to who is in control. There is no doubt that the Secretary of State, not the distribution body, will be in control of directing the funds.
<P>
<B>Mr. Levitt:</B> It was me who intervened on the hon. Gentleman's speech on Second Reading. I said then that clause 12(5)(d) stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``after consultation with the Secretary of State'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
the award-giving body shall
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``make such modifications to the draft as it considers necessary or expedient'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
not as the Secretary of State considers necessary or expedient.
<P>
<B>Mr. Prior:</B> I am not a lawyer, but it seems beyond doubt--
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> Perhaps I can help my hon. Friend. The point is dealt with effectively under the proposed new section 43C(1) in clause 6. It sums up the matter and states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``In exercising their functions under section 43B the New Opportunities Fund shall comply with any directions given to them by the Secretary of State.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The establishment of the New Opportunites Fund is, by definition, in respect of initiatives specified by the Secretary of State under the proposed new section, which gives the Secretary of State order-making powers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Prior:</B> I thank my hon. Friend for making that point absolutely clear. I thought that I had already done so but, judging from the intervention by the hon. Member for High Peak, I clearly had not. 
<P>
	The proposed new section 43C(5) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Before revoking an order under section 43B the Secretary of State shall consult the New Opportunities Fund.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Even when it comes to revoking orders, all the Secretary of State has to do is to consult the New Oportunities Fund. Even when referring to the preparation of a statement of accounts, the clause states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The statement shall comply with any directions that may be given by the Secretary of State.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There is absolutely no doubt about who will be in control of the distribution of the funds.
<P>
The position would not have been so bad if the Secretary of State could, under the proposed new section 43C, use his judgment to give more discretion to the distribution body. However, yesterday we received directions to the New Opportunities Fund under the proposed section 43C(1). It is a preliminary draft and I do not imagine that there will be more discretion in subsequent drafts. There is a hugely descriptive list of what the distribution body can and cannot do. No one can pretend that it has genuine independence. It will do what it is told to do by the Secretary of State. What it can do is set out in black and white in the document. Under the heading of ``Healthy Living Centres'', the distributing body shall commit
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``funds to projects that between them should establish or develop healthy living centres accessible to around 20 per cent. of the population of the UK.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We discussed earlier the practical problems that that will cause to health authorities. Some fund-holding practices will have extensive healthy living centres, while others will not. There is a danger that more money will be channelled into reducing waiting lists and away from primary health care, on the grounds that it may receive lottery funding.
<P>
Under the heading ``Out of School Hours Activities'', the draft states
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Fund shall commit funds to out of school hours education projects which taken together should provide regular activities involving at least half of all secondary schools, a quarter of all primary schools and half of all special schools''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
So, again, some schools will benefit and others will not. That is thoroughly unsatisfactory. The Secretary of State is in full control and the distributing body will follow a highly prescriptive set of rules and regulations. That leads me to additionality.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> Not to the amendment, by any chance?
<P>
<B>Mr. Prior:</B> If the hon. Gentleman cannot understand that those matters are closely related, he is sadly missing the point. The difficulty of establishing whether spending is additional has come across loud and clear in the debate. Clearly, all members of the Committee accept that that is a grey area and, therefore, we must exercise common sense. Common sense tells me that healthy living centres and out-of-school education are fundamental parts of the Government's core policy commitments.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for West Suffolk has already made clear the Chancellor's view of the national child care strategy, but it is worth repeating that the Chancellor said that the cost of the strategy would be shared between the Exchequer and the New Opportunities Fund. He said that that was
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the policy of this country's Government.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Chancellor believes that the national child care strategy is at the heart of the Government's policy and he will share its cost between money properly raised through taxation and money from the lottery. There is a muddying of the waters in that core part of the Government's policy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> My hon. Friend will know that the Government already provide money for out-of-school child care initiatives, funded through the Department for Education and Employment. That is precisely the point. That is not additionality; it is taking money from the national lottery and putting it into areas that are being funded by central Government and the taxpayer. That is the point of principle.
<P>
<B>Mr. Prior:</B> I completely agree with my hon. Friend. Of course, exactly the same point applies to healthy living centres. The White Paper states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``healthy living centres will play an important role in the Government's public health strategy''--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and indeed they do. There is a muddying of the water right at the heart of the Government's central policies on the national health service and education--the two key areas on which they fought the election.
<P>
Given that the distributors are not independent, the best test is one of common sense. The vast majority of Labour and Opposition Members accepted that the previous Government had got the balance just about right. Of the various lottery projects--whether a cricket pavilion, a rugby pitch or an improvement to a theatre--on which I have worked in my constituency, common sense tells one that they are outside the normal course of Government spending, whereas a healthy living centre and information-technology training for teachers are clearly part of central Government policy.
<P>
The Government have made a profound mistake. In the long run, the Bill can only erode the public's confidence in the national lottery. People will say that such activities should be funded properly from taxation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> My hon. Friend is right about public confidence because it is the essential prerequisite of the continued success of the national lottery and all the benefits that flow from it. My hon. Friend will know that, if the lottery continues to develop until 2001 and beyond, the opportunity to extract more and more money from it will grow, unless we achieve the protection of guaranteed percentages for the existing good causes that we seek. Coupled with those two matters, the matter of real concern is the public's long-term confidence in the national lottery. The amendment is intended to highlight that issue.
<P>
<H5>6.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Prior:</B> I thank my hon. Friend for that constructive intervention. Another aspect of the matter that has emerged this afternoon is the fact that the public really want many of the things that the New Opportunities Fund will support. It is incumbent on Governments to raise the taxes to pay for those highly desirable activities. The Government have chickened out of doing so. If they believe that IT training, healthy living centres and out-of-school clubs are important, they should raise taxes to pay for them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fraser:</B> My hon. Friend makes some relevant points about the core spending aspect of the Bill. Does he agree that if extra money is spent on health and education matters, and the others that are being discussed, the good causes that have come to rely on the lottery directly will lose?
<P>
<B>Mr. Prior:</B> Indeed, and that is why we had to try to institutionalise a higher percentage for the existing good causes. We no longer feel that we can trust the Government to respect those. We have heard much mention of the thin end of the wedge, but the wedge has been made so wide in the Bill--to cover environment, education and health--that there will be no control over what money can be spent on.
<P>
	Having listened to the debate, I judge that there are two key determinants of additionality; first, the common sense test, which asks whether a Government in their normal round or local government in its normal course of business would spend money on a particular item; and secondly, the question of whether the distributing body is genuinely independent of Government, or open to being leaned on. the Bill fails both those tests, and that is why we consider the draft directions to be only the thin end of the wedge. Indeed, in many important respects the draft rules infringe additionality.

<P>

<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> I shall resist the temptation to respond to the interesting aspects of the debate that relate to clause stand part and confine my remarks to amendment No. 23 and new clause 1. I think that hon. Members will agree that it has been an enjoyable debate, if a familiar one, since we covered the same ground, with respect to additionality, that we did this morning. That may become a quotidian element of our debate. I do not object to that. Additionality is an extremely important aspect of the lottery. The hon. Member for West Suffolk quoted the Prime Minister and described it as both desirable and sensible and, referring to the article by Mr. Peter Riddell, called it the best guard against the Treasury. I should expect hon. Members on both sides of the Committee to agree about that.
<P>
As the hon. Member for West Suffolk demonstrated, additionality is hard to define. He mentioned that fact this morning, and his own struggle, during his long and interesting contribution, made the point; it is tough to define. The wording in amendment No. 23 is a reasonable attempt. The Government certainly recognise it because it is very like the attempt that the Labour party made in 1993. It is nice to see the recycling of old familiar friends among the amendments. If only we had copyright, we should be doing very well.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> Although additionality is difficult to define--the Prime Minister had a good crack at it in the White Paper, and we accept his definition--the principle was raised during Committee proceedings of the 1993 Act, and amendments were tabled about it. Does the Minister agree that there was no reason for anxiety during the time that we were in government and controlling the national lottery? Will he confirm that the principle of additionality was not breached, and that the lottery was run honourably under the previous arrangements?
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> I am sure that the hon. Gentleman concurs that the Government will not breach the principle of additionality any more than the previous Government did.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fraser:</B> Does the Minister agree that the arm's-length principle and additionality go together? If the Secretary of State did not have the power vested in him, he would not be able to breach the additionality principle.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> I do not entirely agree with that. It is interesting that specific wording is rearing its head again. We tried to achieve something similar to the Opposition in 1993. The wording does not quite work, but it is a good try. We have learned from our attempt in 1993, but the Opposition go backwards while we move forwards to the future.
<P>
Many members of the Committee have tried to define additionality. My hon. Friend the Member for High Peak defined it as a mechanism that kick-started new initiatives or topped up others. It includes an element of that, but remains difficult to define. That was shown by the example of my hon. Friend the Minister's donor card.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> What part of his anatomy will the Minister for Sport donate to posterity? He was too shy to reveal that to us earlier.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> I intend to use my hon. Friend's donor card to demonstrate the difficulty of definition. It states that he will donate his kidneys, corneas, heart, lungs, liver and pancreas, indeed any part of his body for the treatment of others. But is my hon. Friend defined by parts of his body? Does the sum total of parts define my hon. Friend?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The subject is of great interest to everyone but it is not entirely relevant to our discussion. We have heard enough about donor cards. I appreciate knowing about club membership and so on, but we have heard enough.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> Thank you, Mr. Benton. I was trying to explain that an attempt to define my hon. Friend the Minister for Sport by listing parts of his body did not capture that indefinable something, including his humour, about my hon. Friend. We have experienced the same difficulty in trying to define additionality.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> Because the brain was left out.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> It is a large and imaginative brain. It is also innovative, and would probably qualify for lottery funding.
<P>
The Opposition have sought to define additionality in amendment No. 23 by the words,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``not otherwise . . . funded out of taxation or other local or national government revenues.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is not a bad definition, but does it work? Its weakness is revealed when it is applied to lottery schemes of the past few years. As the hon. Member for West Suffolk said, they did not breach additionality. The arts are funded by national Government and local government, but they would be excluded from lottery funding under amendment No. 23. They are funded by taxation and would therefore not be eligible under the definition that amendment No. 23 seeks to impose on the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman not accept that distributing bodies such as the Arts Council handle this with considerable care and delicacy to make distinctions which are as clear as possible, given the difficulties of justifying the additional sums of money that come from the lottery? They attempt as far as possible to act in accordance with the spirit of the National Lottery etc. Act.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> I entirely agree, but if the definition that the hon. Gentleman seeks to include in the Bill were in force, the Royal Festival hall, which was funded by the state, would not be eligible for lottery funding. Buildings funded by English Heritage, or sports funded by local authorities, would be ruled out. If we made the mistake of accepting the amendment, we would render ineligible for lottery funding almost all ares of the arts, heritage and sport. I am sure that that is not the hon. Gentleman's intention.
<P>
It is a misguided amendment which, on reflection, I am sure that the Member for West Suffolk will want to withdraw. Like some of his hon. Friends, he made great play, of child care, and he quoted the Chancellor's remarks. As my hon. Friend the Member for Slough pointed out in an excellent contribution, child care is a mixed economy. Some aspects of it are funded by national or local taxation and revenues and others are funded by the voluntary and private sectors. There will be new areas which, quite rightly, will be eligible without breaching additionality for lottery funding.
<P>
The crucial point is the hon. Gentleman's own remarks. He stumbled upon the best definition of additionality, which is not in his amendment, when he distinguished between replacing and adding on. If lottery expenditure replaces Government money, it will breach additionality. If it only adds on to activities, as some aspects of the arts, heritage and sports are doing, it will not breach additionality. It would be foolish to put any definition of additionality into the Bill. That is why the last Government rejected our amendments in 1993 and why we will ask the Committee to reject these amendments now.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> This has certainly been a wide-ranging and interesting debate. I am grateful to all the hon. Members who have contributed to it. May I just read out the amendment to the Minister again, because his comments bore little relation to it? Amendment No. 23 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The New Opportunities Fund shall solely and only make grants to, or make or enter into arrangements with causes where it can be demonstrated that they would not otherwise be funded out of taxation or other local or national government revenues''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Subsection (5) of new clause 1 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``A body shall distribute any money paid to it under section 24 solely and only to causes where it can be demonstrated that they would not otherwise be funded out of taxation or other national or local government revenues.''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The whole point about this is that the caravan has moved on. The Minister was gracious enough to accept that there was no flagrant abuse of the enshrined principles of additionality under the last Government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> Nor will there by under this Government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> That is the exact point. We have tabled the amendment because we are wholly dissatisfied with the underlying principles of the Bill when it comes to questions of additionality. We are seeking to protect the very principle upon which the lottery has been such a success and upon which public confidence has grown. There is a qualitative difference.
<P>
Were it not for all the other aspects of the Bill which we find so reprehensible, we could argue the toss about a definition of additionality and how it should be carried out in practice. That is at the very heart of why we have tabled the amendment. I am sure that the Minister understands why--and so, I hope, do his hon. Friends: it is crucial to sustain public confidence in the lottery in future.

As my hon. Friend the Member for North Norfolk said, Members of Parliament should apply a commonsense test and ask whether the Government would spend money on that particular cause or objective, and whether a distributing body would have the independence to do so. That is crucial. On any commonsense test, that particular project fails.
<P>
	The hon. Member for High Peak made an interesting point about the retraining of teachers. He is correct to say that training under the proposed scheme would be for existing teachers; IT training is made available to teachers in training colleges. But that does not deal with the crucial matter of whether retraining in different disciplines in schools takes place already. It does. Therefore there is no qualitative distinction on that score; the distinction lies in the fact that we are talking about money from national lottery funds and a removal from Government responsibility.
<P>
	In conclusion, on the subject of additionality, I believe that the objectives of establishing healthy living centres and of IT training for existing teachers and librarians are core Government responsibilities. Neither the Minister nor Labour Members have addressed those points effectively, and I shall therefore press the amendment to a Division.
