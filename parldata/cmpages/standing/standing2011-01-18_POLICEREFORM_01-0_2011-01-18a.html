of announcements. First, would all Members and members of the public
ensure that their mobile phones and pagers are switched off or turned
to silent mode? For the benefit of Members, as a general rule my
co-Chair and I do not intend to call starred amendments that have not
been tabled with adequate notice. The required notice period in Public
Bill Committees is three working days. Therefore, amendments should be
tabled by the rise of the House on Monday for consideration on the
following Thursday, and by the rise of the House on Thursday for
consideration on the following
Tuesday.<a class="bkMark" name="11011865000009">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
appreciate that not everyone is familiar with the process of taking
oral evidence in Public Bill Committees, so it may be helpful if I
briefly explain how we will proceed. First, the Committee will be asked
to consider the programme motion on the amendment paper, for which
debate is limited to 30 minutes. We will proceed to motions to report
written evidence and to permit the Committee to deliberate in private
in advance of the oral evidence sessions, which I hope will be taken
formally. Assuming that the second of those motions is agreed, the
Committee will move into private
session.<a class="bkMark" name="11011865000010">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Once
the Committee has deliberated, the witnesses and members of the public
will be invited back in and our oral evidence session will begin. If
the Committee agrees to the programme motion, it will hear oral
evidence this
morning.<a class="bkMark" name="11011865000011">&#160;</a>

for the programme motion? Obviously, there will be a lot of debate, and
we will see whether there is enough time but, at the outset, we have
agreed the list of witnesses and the timings. Although we have strong
debates, people know that that does not, generally speaking, spill over
into unnecessary messing around. I wanted to put that on the record. We
also have no problem with the amendment, which is perfectly
reasonable.<a class="bkMark" name="11011865000014">&#160;</a>

is nice to see you here. Obviously, the introduction of police and
crime commissioners will be a radical change to the existing structure
of policing and police accountability in this country. Clearly, the aim
of us all is to reduce crime, prevent crime and reduce reoffending.
Fighting crime and reducing reoffending are obviously everyone’s
top priorities. What would be of interest to the Committee and, I am
sure, the general public is how that particular change will enable the
police more adequately to improve their ability to prevent crime and
reduce reoffending. Will the witnesses tell us what improvement they
think the reform will bring to the agenda of tackling crime and
reducing reoffending? Do they have any reservations about that? Will
each of the witnesses
comment?<a class="bkMark" name="11011865000030">&#160;</a>

Hugh Orde:</strong>
                           </em> I am happy to start. My
first point, Vernon, is that the service is wedded to the notion of an
independent accountability framework, which holds us to account for
what we do. A balance is struck between that independent oversight and
the operational independence of chiefs to do their best to reduce
crime, working with local communities to understand fully what they
want us to do, but balancing that with national
concerns.<a class="bkMark" name="11011865000031">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Will
the measure make a step change? It is a different form of local
accountability; I am not sure whether it will be better or
worse—we must see how it works. For the first time, however, a
police and crime commissioner, not just an individual, will hold the
police to account.<a class="bkMark" name="11011865000032">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">One positive
step in the provision is that, hopefully, we will have one person
trying to drive the whole criminal justice business at the local end.
There may be benefits in terms of ensuring that victims’ cases
are pushed through if that person focuses not only on what the police
are doing but on what the whole criminal justice system is
doing.<a class="bkMark" name="11011865000033">&#160;</a>

McKeever:</strong>
                           </em> It is difficult to predict whether the
measure will have a positive or negative effect on the underlying
requirements for what police officers do until the model is in place
and we see it working. Clearly, as Sir Hugh has said, it will focus
attention 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 5<a class="bkMark" name="Column5">&#160;</a>
                           </div>much more than has been the case in the past, which
is no criticism of the police authorities. A clear line of direction,
however, might be helpful and we hope that that pans out when the
provision comes to fruition. There is potential for positive
outcomes.<a class="bkMark" name="11011865000034">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
will have to wait and see how it will affect the officers on the
street, whom I represent. That is tangential to what they do and to
much of the business that is carried out in every day matters in police
stations across the country, so it is difficult to tell. There is a
long way between what a police commissioner does and what a police
constable is doing on the streets. There are also an awful lot of
layers of supervision and management between them and the commissioner,
which must be taken into account, too. We must consider the whole
picture. We have seen how police authorities are working—some
are very good, and work well with their chief officer. It is hard to
predict, however, until we see the provisions up and running in
practice.<a class="bkMark" name="11011865000035">&#160;</a>

Garnham:</strong>
                           </em> I was going to come in on both
points—Mr Coaker’s, too. On the first question about
whether the Association of Police Authorities thinks that the new
system will help to drive down crime, the APA does not welcome the new
system, and opposes it. If, however, we follow the principles that
police authorities have been successful in implementing, we have played
a big part in driving down crime since we came into existence. Crime
has gone down under a Government system of accountability through
police authorities.<a class="bkMark" name="11011865000041">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We think that
there should be a transition period. Something as major and radical as
the measure—it has even been called revolutionary—needs
to be tested and handled carefully, so that we do not go to the cliff
edge, lose the experience of all those in police authorities who have
delivered lower crime, and then move straight into an untried system.
We would prefer, therefore, that a transition period be
introduced.<a class="bkMark" name="11011865000042">&#160;</a>

                           <strong> </strong>I am very grateful to be here today
taking part in this debate on behalf of victims. It is very important
that we are here and represented. I am grateful to Members for giving
me the time to be here. It is clear, Mr Coaker, that something needs to
change. I was a senior civil servant from 1999 right through to last
year and spent a lot of that time working on crime, policing and
specifically policy in relation to antisocial behaviour. In 2008 I was
asked to do a fairly independent review from the Cabinet Office that
was a first and very fundamental look at the public’s views on
crime, policing and the criminal justice system.<a class="bkMark" name="11011865000043">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">What we know
from that, and what is therefore important and relevant to your
question, is that the public are very clear about their priorities.
They want to know that criminals—I use that word
specifically—face consequences for crimes they commit. They want
to know that the police and others, such as local authorities, are
tackling the issues that matter to them, and obviously community crime,
antisocial behaviour, neighbourhood crime—whatever you want to
call it—is pre-eminent in that. Thirdly, they want to know how
to contact the police and what to expect.<a class="bkMark" name="11011865000044">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">If they do
not get those things, which they do not get at the moment anywhere near
as sufficiently as they should, they do not pick up the phone and
report crime. The confidence in the police and the criminal justice
system to act on their behalf to tackle criminals is not good enough.
One of the reasons for that is that there is a disconnection in police
accountability to the public. The previous Administration—it is
no secret as it is in the public domain—wrangled for years over
how to get police accountability right. It is my view that this step is
better than what currently happens because the reform will mean that
somebody, somewhere has to answer the public and victims very directly
about what is happening to tackle crime in the neighbourhood, what the
priorities are and how things are done. That, frankly, would be a major
step change in the right direction. That has not happened so far and it
is a mismatch.<a class="bkMark" name="11011865000045">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">People do not
have confidence in the criminal justice system; 80% of the public think
it is there to support the needs of offenders and only about 30% think
it is there to support the needs of victims. I accept that there is a
wider picture that Sir Hugh outlined, but certainly elected
commissioners could well be a very positive step in the right
direction. I personally throw my weight behind it for that
reason.<a class="bkMark" name="11011865000046">&#160;</a>

“scrutiny”, “oversight” and
“advice” probably need to be worked through in a bit more
detail so that we can grip them. For me, it is whether a member of the
public knows whom to hold to account when something is not done in
their neighbourhood to tackle crime or when they are a victim of crime
and nobody sees it through. My worry, if it is anything, is about the
police and crime commissioner. There will be a panel. I am not quite
sure of the status of that panel and still there is a chief constable
who is responsible to the citizens for what they are doing on crime.

is for other witnesses on the panel to think this through in terms of
operational independence versus accountability. This is a major step in
the right direction of getting greater transparency to the public about
what the police do, why they do it, why when my house is burgled barely
anyone turns up, yet in another postal district somebody gets the
British version of “CSI”. That is what the public want to
know: why are some crimes treated in some ways and others in another?
That is the starting point. A politically elected person—
somebody elected and accountable to the public—should crank open
that door of information and transparency, which at the moment feels,
and the evidence shows this is the case, very closed. This proposal is
a step in the right direction. I do not know whether it is the panacea

Hugh Orde:</strong>
                           </em> I am grateful for the question. I have a
couple of points to make on the answers given, as a matter of clarity.
According to the British crime survey, 69% of the public say that they
have confidence in their local police. I do not think we need to
undersell what the service is doing. Likewise, as Rob has pointed out,
crime has been reducing for many years, so something is
working.<a class="bkMark" name="11011865000060">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As for
accountability, we are probably the most accountable police service in
the world. We are accountable not just to the police authorities but to
the Home Secretary and the law. That is a critical point in the current
tripartite arrangement, part of which is being modified and part of
which we have no difficulty with.<a class="bkMark" name="11011865000061">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The other
point we should make and reinforce, is that my experience of
negotiating with my police authority, which was quite challenging for
seven years, was a process of negotiation and sensible conversations
around the best possible service being delivered to the local
community, balanced with the very difficult and increasing challenges
we have to face to keep citizens safe through the national policing
agenda. One of the unique features of this country is that that is
delivered through local policing. If we do not have that sensible
conversation, the biggest danger is that the new commissioner or
current police authority would come up with a plan that the chief, on
his or her best professional judgment, says is simply not deliverable
with the resources they have. That is the fine balance.<a class="bkMark" name="11011865000062">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We are
currently facing substantial threats through terrorism, and the public
order agenda is increasing, as experienced recently in London. The
national police response enabled us to support the commissioner in
London with resources from other parts of the country. Many of the home
counties sent assistance to London—it is a two-way process. We
have to protect that if we are to protect the critical national
infrastructure, as well as deliver local policing. That is the complex
balance that I hope would be resolved in 99% of the cases, through
sensible conversations between the police and crime commissioner and
the chief.<a class="bkMark" name="11011865000063">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The biggest
difference is that we will have somebody who is elected. It is a very
different structure, with 17 or 19 people being replaced by one person
with an elected mandate. There may well be some tensions. As I have
commented to the Minister on a number of occasions, if I wanted to be
elected in Sussex, which is where I live and where the
Minister’s constituency is, my agenda would understandably be
local. That is what the public would be interested in, and that is what
the public would be voting on. We have to make sure that it is clear 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 9<a class="bkMark" name="Column9">&#160;</a>
                           </div>that a chief constable must deliver his or her
national obligations while using their operational independence to make
judgment calls about how to apportion resources. None of that means
that we shouldn’t be held to account vigorously for what we
decide.<a class="bkMark" name="11011865000064">&#160;</a>

public are not daft. They are not stupid. I came here on the tube this
morning, and I am watching the 7/7 inquiry with some interest. I hope
to God that the Metropolitan police, and everybody else in the police
service and in government, are looking at what we can do. I realise
that they have to do it behind the scenes and behind closed doors, but
I hope that they can do it in the same way as the work I have seen
Lancashire police do behind closed doors on child exploitation, which
is an issue that has also been in the newspapers over the weekend. If
we say to the public—police and crime commissioners should be
able to do this—“I support the chief constable in
fulfilling the national priorities. Do you understand that you
won’t know a great deal about X% of their work, but it’s
about stopping another 7/7?” you would get cheers in public

that we have people in public life who are able to manage that tension,
and manage it maturely, and that there are some checks and balances in
this process. I agree that there are some issues on the panels and
other such things, but there should be enough checks and balances in

weight to be given to neighbourhood policing, protective

violence—and response policing. The chief constable followed

we still expect them to be addressed but we are giving them greater
freedom, so that in one part of the year you might give more weight to
one of those and not the other. You still need the commissioner to be
able to write to their chief constables and give that kind of strategic
advice after consulting the public. If you take that away, we will not
achieve what we are trying to achieve here.<a class="bkMark" name="11011865000074">&#160;</a>

briefly to this question of the pilots, which Mr McKeever and Ms Casey
are perhaps understandably a bit fatigued with now. Given that this is
such a major and radical reform, and to the best of my knowledge there
is no systematic evidence that supports it—there is a lot of
anecdotal evidence about people being dissatisfied with the operation
of police authorities, but I am not aware of any systematic evidence
that says that this is the way forward—and given your aversion
to, or fatigue with, pilots, do you think there should be some
systematic Home Office review and research into how this works so that
we are clear that we are learning some lessons about this process, or
do you think it should be another Government initiative that we take on
good will and faith?<a class="bkMark" name="11011865000075">&#160;</a>

that it is not really for me to decide how we should be held
accountable and how Government should go about their business. I take
the point that there will be some unintended aspects of whatever is

constables, will be very professional and there will be some excellent
examples around the country. I think there will be one or two, perhaps,
where there will be some grating between the chief and the commissioner
as well; I think that is inevitable. We do not have a single model, and
we cannot answer for how every relationship between the commissioner
and the chief constable is going to work. Clearly, there will be 42 or
43 different models around the country, depending on those
relationships that they build up. I am sure that the press will be more
interested in the relationships that do not work than in those that do,
and we have to bear that in mind.<a class="bkMark" name="11011865000077">&#160;</a>

to the pilot, I am not a great fan of pilots anyway. They tend to be
fairly skewed, and they do not represent the true dynamic within which
something will be rolled out and operated nationwide or wherever. I
very often find that they do not actually prove very much at all. If
the Government want to introduce a new form of accountability for us,

Hugh Orde:</strong>
                           </em> I think that the world has moved on, as
there is a clear Government intention to this, which is why we are
saying that although we understand and respect that, we must have
absolute clarity on how this works. Frankly, the clarity is not yet
there, but we are certainly working with the Government to achieve it.
I recently attended a transition board chaired by the Minister for
Policing and Criminal Justice, where a lot of good work was done, and
where some of our concerns are clearly being listened to. There are big
challenges, and I think some of them have already been raised
here.<a class="bkMark" name="11011865000079">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The strategic
policing requirement is the result of our conversation with the
Government, and it is a clear recognition that we must establish with
some precision what it is that chief officers deliver to the national
agenda and how that is protected against the local agenda. Part of that
is very much about checks and balances, and again some shifts have
taken place as a result of our conversations around the power to hire
and fire the chief constable. That must now be referred to the police
and crime panel; you will have to form your own view on whether that is
an effective second chamber, for want of a better description.
Likewise, regarding those who are eligible to become
chief constables, we would argue very strongly that they must
be professionals who are qualified to deliver that job, so they must
already be serving officers who have attended the senior command course
and the police national assessment centre. Much of that needs to be
thrashed out in Committee.<a class="bkMark" name="11011865000080">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The role of
the PCP I see as very important. The notion of one person representing
the 2.5 million people in the constituency of West Yorkshire with one
chief constable—clearly that individual will need some support
and advice from the diverse communities we are charged with protecting
if we are going to deliver that bespoke policing service we all talk
about. It is a huge ask for one person. Again, clarity on whether there
is any consistent structure, which would support this individual, would
be helpful and would reassure the public. If there is just one person,
they will be busy, not only with police issues, but with other issues
around the criminal justice system. We need clarity on whether there
will be a proper infrastructure, so that we can be held to account
professionally, properly and from a well informed
position.<a class="bkMark" name="11011865000081">&#160;</a>

specific example that we have been discussing in the Home Affairs
Committee and that is a live issue within the Cambridgeshire police
authority? Let us say that under the new model a police commissioner
was elected, having said that they did not want officers in their force
to use Tasers. If the chief constable wanted to use a Taser, whose
decision would that be? I would be interested in a relatively brief

of

                           </em>I will start. If that
situation came before me as a chair of a police authority, I think a
chief constable needs to have that operational decision; they have the
experience and the training to say, “We need to use Tasers in
this situation,” or “We should send an armed response
team.” That clearly has to be an operational decision. A
commissioner or the chair of a police authority will want to know how
much we are spending on Tasers, and how it is planned to use
them—what are the circumstances, and the accountability behind
that; we have to make sure that we are not saying, “Okay, go and
buy them and use them,” because the commissioner, or as happens
now, the chair of police authority, is answerable to the public.
Furthermore, with a commissioner, if something goes wrong, it will not
only mean the Independent Police Complaints Commission, an
investigation and letters; it will be the commissioner in the press who
says, “You’ve got to hold your chief constable to account
over this.” It is still an operational decision, quite rightly,
but whether the constabulary buys them, where it will use them and the
guidelines, protocols and training are something that the commissioner
will have a say
on.<a class="bkMark" name="11011865000083">&#160;</a>

Hugh Orde:</strong>
                           </em> First, operational independence is not
murky; it is complicated and it is a hugely important area to us. Rob
has aptly described it. I lived through exactly the example that you
gave, Dr Huppert, when I was in Northern Ireland. Understandably, a
number of members of that police authority were completely opposed to
the issuing of Tasers. What we did not do was say, “It’s
a matter of operational independence.” In law, we would argue
that it was, and we took legal advice on that particular point. There
was a case on it that was recently decided in Northern Ireland, which
supported our position.<a class="bkMark" name="11011865000084">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We spent a
lot of time in discussion with the authority, bringing world experts to
brief it on the medical implications of Tasers—for example, what
if these things were used against children, young people or vulnerable
people, as they quite often sadly have to be? The other side, which we
made the authority very clear on, was “If you deny us, or are
very keen for us not to have, Tasers, there is a consequence:
you are denying a less lethal option than a firearm. You are
restricting my officers’ ability to use a less lethal form of
violence in appropriate circumstances, which, sadly, may have more
severe
consequences.”<a class="bkMark" name="11011865000085">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
debate was full, and it took a long time. We did not resolve this issue
in less than 12 months. In that time, I was prepared to carry the risk
of an event like that happening, where we shot someone—I had a
fully armed service and armed response vehicles, but that is no
different from here—where we could have used something that we
were not allowed to have. I thought

                           </div>that that was a risk worth taking and a balance to be struck, because it
gave the board the proper place; a very public debate took place. I
agree with Rob—it is an operational decision. That does not mean
that we steamroller these things through. We listen very carefully to
those who hold us to
account.<a class="bkMark" name="11011865000086">&#160;</a>

have said. I see it very clearly as an operational decision, but that
decision must be accountable to the police commissioner, and you must
explain why it is that you want to use Tasers or any other weapon or
implement in the service. The commissioner should not be allowed to
impinge on that operational side of policing. That is the sort of area
that needs to be clarified as the Bill goes through Parliament, to
ensure that there is an understanding and that we do not have
bickering. The last thing you would want is to have a grating between
the commissioner and the chief constable about whose toy it was that
they were playing with. That has to be established at a very early
stage. If you do not establish that at an early stage, you are just
paving the way for dispute. That is not where we want to go. We want to
have smooth

people, their experience of policing will hopefully be rare and remote.
That is how we would like to live our lives. Involving the police often
means that something has gone wrong or could be going wrong. For them,
it does not impinge on their everyday life, and they are looking at it

view.<a class="bkMark" name="11011865000089">&#160;</a>

enough, that is also the way that most police officers see it. They are
going to carry on performing in pretty much the same way as they did
before. The overall direction might change slightly, and the overall
targets—if I can use that word here—might change slightly
as well. The actual processes that they go through on the street,
however, will remain pretty
consistent.<a class="bkMark" name="11011865000090">&#160;</a>

is much like having a management change or a new way of doing business
in another organisation. The actual processes that you undertake should
stay the same. I think that the best organisations, such as Proctor and
Gamble, keep the structure and processes the same, but you can change
the management team if you want to. Effectively, that is how most
police officers view what is happening here. It is the same for members
of the public: it is not going to impinge on their everyday life.

accountable in 101 different ways anyway. We are held to account
through our local communities and through consultation with them, and
that is right and proper. We should be held to account, and we should

are right: when a police officer goes along to the local surgery and
speaks to the 20 or 30 people who may turn up, they are not even
interested in local priorities of perhaps robbery, burglary or drugs;
they are interested in car parking and dogs fouling the footpaths. That
is an experience that police officers have on a regular basis, too. The
strategic level of accountability, however, is where the Bill actually
addresses the issues that it is intended to. I do not think that it is
at all intended to work on the micro level. That is my understanding of
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11011865000096">&#160;</a>

are two things that I want to say. I think it would be such a shame if
this major reform did not do something much better for the public than
what has just been said. In my view, regardless of politics, the public
need to know what is happening, in terms of tackling crime in their
area. At the moment, they do not know that in sufficient detail. People
are not informed as to why they are unable to leave their house or let
their children play out. When they go along to meetings, they do not
always get the answers that they should. People just say,
“Sorry, we can’t tell you.” I dispute the fact
that, in Newham and in areas of Greater Manchester, people are talking
about dog crap. They are talking about knives and about the fact that
teenagers are being killed, and they are extremely
worried.<a class="bkMark" name="11011865000097">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Up
to around September of either 2008 or 2009—I cannot remember
which—the top concern of the British public was crime. That was
overtaken by the economy only as the recession started to bite. It was
not health or education, but crime. Sometimes one just has to step
aside from how you implement all these things and realise that, yes,
they may not be local enough, and I agree with that. However, one of
the things that these police and crime commissioners should surely be
doing as part of their job is ensuring that the police chief in
Hull—whoever it is—is accountable in a more transparent
way than at the moment. I do not just mean being able to know whether
crime is up, down or going sideways, but who they have nicked, when

for individuals?”, is, I think, a really good one. I am not
entirely sure, apart from the opportunity to remove that person four
years later if people do not think they have done a good enough job.
For me, the criticality of accountability is as described by Paul:
making sure that it is not just this one person. There is a PCP, with a
group of people, which is by definition more diverse, that will cover
the large number of constituencies that people are going to operate
across. Under that, there are formal, semi-formal and informal methods
of control that get you into those communities, where—I
absolutely agree with Louise on this—people are concerned about
violent crime, but we are talking about something that can be delivered
locally. It is unreasonable to expect the chief to have all that, plus
run a force against a reducing budget and deliver against the national
agenda, hence the need and search for
clarity.<a class="bkMark" name="11011865000102">&#160;</a>

different. Of course, apart from policing, the elected Mayor is
responsible for everything else in London; transport, for example, and
all the other things that keep him very occupied. It is a different
model or structure in the counties as envisaged, where

much just the policing agenda and some other bits around the criminal
justice system. Of course, the Mayor also has a non-elected deputy to
run the system on a day-to-day basis. I think it is slightly different,

found that the people missing from the register are black and ethnic,
and live in council houses, social housing, privately rented houses and
houses of multiple occupation. They are young people, generally from
poor and deprived neighbourhoods. Those people are not even on the
register. No vote, no voice. So if we have a middle class area with a
massive 80% or 90% turnout, and areas that are not even on the

to? In theory, you will say, “Everybody equally”, but in
practice, who will a streetwise, savvy PCC pay more attention to? Will
it be somebody in a middle class area who says the branches on his tree

Otherwise, I think you have a huge issue. The big danger is the
politicisation of policing for the first time in the history of our
country. We can fix that by having a proper accountability framework
decided by the Government, as is their absolute right, balanced by the
right of a chief to say, “I know, in my professional judgment,
having listened to all the people we would clearly listen to, that the
best way of keeping everybody safe in this area is by doing x or y and

me earlier, Miss Phillipson: these things need to be looked at
carefully so that a very close eye is kept on this extraordinarily
fundamental reform, and so that the sort of things the Committee has

the chief constable or the public. The checks and balances will be
important in the Bill, because the democratic mandate will win out in
public opinion and the media in the end. That means, yes, there is
operational independence, but there cannot be areas on which a chief

head-to-head—the last thing we need are 43 head-to-heads on day
one. We need to have those mature debates, which is why we would argue
very strongly that there must be checks and balances to ensure clarity
of understanding before we go into this, rather than trying to work it
out as it happens. That goes back to the national requirement, the
local requirement and the bespoke roles the commissioner will hold,
such as holding us to account and the responsibility to the chiefs to
deliver operationally independent views on how they should deliver
policing.<a class="bkMark" name="11011865000121">&#160;</a>

my experience, and from receiving correspondence from MPs over the
years, one hits the brick wall of not knowing how to get a
problem sorted out in a neighbourhood and wondering why anything is not
going on. I wonder what he does with his 30 letters when he gets a
letter from someone in Newham, which says, “Nobody is listening
to me. I have been living with this. It’s not going anywhere.

have worked for plenty of people and know plenty now in the room who
know that I have said relentlessly that I do not think we are getting
complaints and the right of redress of the public right. The police
crime commissioners will get traffic of that kind. My question is what
will they do about it because at the moment the way in which the
complaints procedures are set up is all about the conduct of a police
officer. Whether he has overstepped the mark is a disciplinary issue.
Such matters are not about “None of us in our street can leave
our houses on a Friday night. We have evidence of that. No one is doing
anything about it.” “What are you, crime commissioner,
going to do about it?” is where such matters will
head.<a class="bkMark" name="11011865000133">&#160;</a>

about feedback to the public and transparency, and that is where some
of the tensions will be. At the moment, the public do not get an answer
to that question in a straight way at all or else I would not get
letters from MPs asking me such questions. It is also one of the
reasons why the concession from the Government to get the voice of
victims literally in the face of the Bill was so important. That is the
sort of thing that they are concerned about. They want to know how to
get a right of redress, and that will come up during the consultation

good thing in and of itself, just having someone that the public feel
they can write to with their problem or complaint is a good thing. It
is better that they feel they can write 300 letters a week, rather than

notwithstanding the conduct of officers that Louise talked about, a
result will be that if lots of letters come in about a problem, perhaps

area in a different way, which could lead to solving some of the
problems. Just having that communication makes the situation better

however, that I have dealt confidentially with issues from members of

middle-class people in posh areas are probably able to negotiate their

are the sorts of things that they are able to say to the police and the

would feel if they were listening—that an extra number of
letters is a way of defining success. I think they would think that I
had gone mad. I am not against people getting redress where they have a
problem. In the context of taking evidence on this Bill, surely the
measure has to be: what kind of complaints did you get, who did they
come from and how were they dealt with? Surely, that has to be written
into the policing plan and any scrutiny of it. Otherwise, all that is
going to happen is that when councillors get someone complaining, they
are going to say, “Ah, what you do is write to the police
commissioner.” When MPs get somebody complaining, they are going
to say, “Ah, I know where this goes now.” It is nonsense.
That is not a way of creating better redress; that is a way of creating

interested in the debate between a force-wide commissioner and the
accountability that a force-wide commissioner brings to a local
community, and how that reconnects in the way that we would all wish,
or improves the system of accountability. If you take somewhere the
size of Devon and Cornwall or north Wales—or indeed my own
situation in Nottinghamshire—and elect a police and crime
commissioner for the whole force area, why would the people in one
part, such as the Isles of Scilly, feel that the introduction of the
police and crime commissioner improves accountability for them, if that
commissioner is in Exeter?<a class="bkMark" name="11011865000158">&#160;</a>

commissioner know the needs of that particular community? There might
be one particular type of crime they want addressed in the Isles of
Scilly, while in Exeter it might be another, in Plymouth another, in
Portsmouth another. Whether it be knife crime, antisocial behaviour,
burglary or whatever, I do not see how accountability or reconnection
between the public and the police would mean anything on a force-wide

to each of the witnesses is: why would having one person representing
an enormous area make somebody 70 or 100 miles away feel that
accountability is improved? Would people not prefer improvement at a
neighbourhood level? Would they not prefer that level of
accountability, in terms of getting a better response, rather than
having a remote commissioner, with one person taking on the
responsibility of 17 or 18 people? Whatever we think of all the
different checks, balances and operational independence, is not the
model itself flawed, because it does not give people the accountability
that they
want?<a class="bkMark" name="11011865000160">&#160;</a>

that situation, our concerns are about taking away local
accountability. We were asked to give evidence to you today: just under
half of police authorities were inspected. There was no evidence that
the current system was flawed or was not delivering in terms of linking
one member of a police authority to one geographical area, and making
that person responsible for local community

highlights the problem that we discussed earlier. A chairman or a
resource board of a police authority committee might say,
“Everything seems to be fine.” However, having that local
accountability gives that member the ability to say, at police
authority meetings, “Actually, you may think that—the
figures and stats may say that—but on my patch, it is not
fine.” We value that highly, because the person on the patch
knows their inspector, their safer community teams, the public and the
community. They are working on the patch and then feeding back. That

Sir Hugh that the pressure will be on those police commissioners to
reinforce and support local relationships that already exist and are
working well. The question is, where those relationships do not
exist—where the public and the police are not in

a huge geographical area, to create them, so that information can be

I have never had experience of that. I would have thought that having

help. It would be much more transparent. Every district will have
someone, and you will know who that person is. Presumably it will be
the leader or the cabinet member for public safety. Do you not think
that that would help that link rather than hinder it? If there is a
weakness in police authorities it is that the public would never dream
of going to them if there was a problem in their area. If you want some
evidence of that, the Gloucestershire constabulary website has a link
to the police authority on its front page; it is a long way below
freedom of information, data protection, useful links and SMS texting,

of the force areas and to fully understand the issues that affect the
people they represent, would you expect the commissioner to visit every
ward in the force area on a quarterly basis and to visit every
neighbourhood watch? I understand that local mechanisms are already in
place, but it seems to me that this person will have so much vested in
him or her to reflect the needs and concerns of the people he or she
represents. Everybody will want to speak to him or her. How do you

have 43 very different models around the country. We have one good
example of Devon and Cornwall, which is geographically enormous. There
are some force areas like the West Midlands where there are 10,000
police officers covering a huge area. Next door there is Warwickshire
where there are around 1,000 police officers. So you are not comparing
like with like. To be prescriptive and say you must do this, this and
this, might work in one police area, but it might not work in another.
You have to be careful that you are not too prescriptive, but at the
same time that you put in those requirements so that they will engage
in some way, shape or form. What that is, at this moment I do not
know.<a class="bkMark" name="11011865000174">&#160;</a>

of the panel and the strengths and powers of the panel underneath. One
individual could be pulled two ways. One, the panel could demand so
much of them that they could not do their job or the chief constable
could demand so much of the commissioner that they are briefed on so
much that they cannot do the job. That is why we would say strengthen
that panel and perhaps a word that might be missing is
“overview”. If in a large area something is highlighted
on crimes, victims or the way policing is conducted, you could say to
the panel, “Look, we are getting some noises coming from that
area, we think it is about drug abuse.” It could be any issue,
but you could ask the panel to do some work on that and have a look at
it. Whether the panel does the work or it goes back to its councils and
does the work, or the commissioner commissions some of that work, you
will need a strong panel with the ability to do that but also to
understand the constabulary. The failing in the system as proposed is
that the panel will just scrutinise the commissioner. The panel needs
to be able to scrutinise the constabulary performance as well, hand in
hand with the

                           </em> I absolutely agree with Rob that they will
need to understand the business. How they go about that will be a
matter of personal choice, but I sense that chiefs would give them
every opportunity, if they want to get involved in understanding how we
operate. To make sure that they are fully informed, so that they can
hold us properly to account, would not be a problem. Part of that may
be about visiting and understanding what we do. Certainly, as an
operational police officer, you learn far more by visiting a local
police station than you do by sitting in your office. The police, and
indeed, the public, would welcome that involvement. Of course, there is
that fine line, which I am sure can be managed, between understanding
the business and not trying to direct it from an operational
perspective. Visiting police stations is different from actually trying
to run them. Again, making sure that there is clarity about whose role
is whose will be very important in achieving
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11011865000176">&#160;</a>

and the example of Cornwall has been used, that one person might be
stretched in fulfilling the role of police and crime commissioner. Is
it not the case that we already have individuals, such as the chief
executive of Cornwall council, the chief constable of Devon and
Cornwall police or the chief fire officer of Cornwall fire and rescue
service—or those in any other county—who have operational
responsibility as well as strategic-direction responsibility? The
police and crime commissioner will also have staff. Does the panel not
agree that there is every reason to believe that, appropriately staffed
and resourced, the police and crime commissioner will be able to handle
that, in the same way as those other officials and chief constables can
no doubt handle their operational responsibility, especially looking at
this as the difference between operational and strategic? Does the
panel agree that there is not that need— whereas a chief
constable may wish to visit every police station in his area, the
strategic responsibility of the commissioner is different? Would each
member of the panel like to address
that?<a class="bkMark" name="11011865000177">&#160;</a>

Cornwall council is not seeking the electoral mandate, which is
important, because once commissioners have that mandate from all over
the patch, through the ballot box and by talking to people, they will
have the confidence of the public. They will be elected to do a job;
chief execs do not have that. Chief executives can choose their risks
and their priorities—that this is a higher risk than
that—but they do not individually go back to people and say,
“I would like your vote for the job that I did for you.”
If commissioners are so stretched that they cannot do the job, the
whole system
fails.<a class="bkMark" name="11011865000180">&#160;</a>

are introducing a system under which you will say to members of the

commissioner, who will give democratic accountability and hold the
chief constable to account all across the policing patch. You’ve
access to him and you now know who he is.” That person has got
to be able to respond to all people, wherever they are, because
otherwise, when he comes up for re-election, should he seek that, the
public will say, “Well, I’ve got no confidence in you. I
never saw you. You never answered my letters,” or whatever. The
reason why you have officers and politicians is that chief execs do not
have the same kind of view of the public, I should imagine, because
they are not chasing votes. They want to provide a good service, but
that electoral mandate is extremely
important.<a class="bkMark" name="11011865000181">&#160;</a>

very diverse geographic area, being rural and urban—varied. If
someone was elected in Berwick, on the Scottish border, they would
serve the area right down to the border with Durham. If we are talking
about representatives from district councils, such councils do not
exist in Sunderland, which is a city of 280,000 people. Would we have
only one representative, while an area with a smaller force but several
district councils has more people on the panel, so that we would have
reduced representation? I do not know how that would work, and I am not

Would it help in your geographical area? I think that is left to be
seen, and that is the concern that we have. At the moment, as I have
said, we have a system that has been inspected and has not been found
to be failing in that respect. It is being replaced by a different
system, and you have to ensure that the public in each and every corner
have a voice, because they have a vested interest in the commissioner

Hugh Orde:</strong>
                           </em> As you know, there is no one system in
America. It is a remarkably complicated policing environment, with more
than 15,000 law enforcement agencies, some 80% of which consist of
fewer than 30 people. Many have elected sheriffs, sworn
officers who are elected and have to stand for re-election based on how
the generally small local communities think they are doing. There are
some sheriffs, in California, for example, who are in charge of huge
geographical
areas.<a class="bkMark" name="11011865000187">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There
are some clear facts. Bill Bratton was over recently—I have
known Bill for many years and he is now quite an institution in
policing—and he would describe this proposal as nothing like
anywhere in the United States. This is different from the United
States, which is why the Committee needs to look at it on its merits,
rather than comparing it, and, frankly, making some fairly false
comparisons, with the United States, because there are all sorts of
other systems in
America.<a class="bkMark" name="11011865000188">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">If
one takes New York, for example, it is a fact that the mayor can hire
and fire the chief constable. There have been two-and-a-half times as
many commissioners in New York as there have been in London over the
same period of time. It is a matter of judgment whether that is a good
thing or a bad thing. Mr Bratton was fired for being too successful,
rather than failing in that state. A fair analysis would be that he
out-mayored the mayor, as a result of which he
disappeared.<a class="bkMark" name="11011865000189">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There
are also lots of checks and balances. New York has many checks and
balances on policing. The city council is a very powerful body that not
only can order anyone to attend to give evidence on policing issues,
but sets the budget or agrees the budget set by the mayor. There are
also other checks and balances. Federal investigators can be appointed,
and, indeed, Mr Bratton operated under a consent decree for the whole
seven years he was in Los Angeles. In other words, there was Government
involvement in local
policing.<a class="bkMark" name="11011865000190">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">My
personal judgment—having known and on the odd occasion spoken to
many of the outstanding police leaders in America, for whom I have
great respect—is that it is very different. One has to look at
the United Kingdom and, in this case, England and Wales and work out,
against our policing model, what is the best system. It is a matter of
fact that people travel from across the world to examine and look at
the British policing model, because of the principles upon which it is
built, which go back to Sir Robert Peel and are still in place. So it
is very different, and it is a bit risky just to look to see if there
are any
parallels.<a class="bkMark" name="11011865000191">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> You say that it is based on the Peel model of
policing. We are particularly looking not so much at that, but at the
tripartite structure. I believe that Ministers are concerned
that—this has been my experience—there has been a
democratic deficiency, particularly on the behalf of police
authorities, because local people do not know who is in charge. I refer
to Louise Casey’s report “Engaging Communities in
Fighting Crime” in which 67% of the public said that they did
not know who to go to with a complaint about the

area and 59% said that they found it very difficult to challenge local
police on the way in which their areas were policed. Having been a

dealing with local government, for example, is when local government
officials say, “Well, you’ve done your crime survey, Rob;
we need to do one.” They start off with questions such as: what
is the priority? Is it feeling safe at night? Well, everyone is going
to say, “Yes, it is feeling safe at night,” but actually
they are safe at night, so stop asking inane questions of the public.

have to take the views of the public. That is not only on precept and
the policing plan but on redress, because that is an area that needs to
be tackled. A member of the public who has a complaint against the
police is quite often told, “Oh, well, the best thing is to make
an official complaint and then we will definitely deal with it in so
many days.” After six months they are told, “Well,
actually, the officer was not negligent and we have looked into it.
Isn’t everyone happy?” No. We probably could have solved
that by—and I have done this—the police authority member
and the local inspector going round to visit the member of public and
saying, “What’s your beef? What happened here?”
After talking to them, the police say, “Look, we’re sorry
this happened. These are the steps that we’re taking to make
sure it doesn’t happen again.” That is how we should be
dealing

immediate redress and they know they have been listened to. I would
hope that the Bill gives powers to commissioners to address such issues

redress can be had without recourse to a long administrative,

                           </strong> I think Paul McKeever said before that we should
not be prescriptive about where the PCC should go, but if you do not
have some guidelines there are a number of ways in which a PCC will
decide where he is going to go. He may get invites from neighbourhood
watch and residents’ associations; where you have got social
capital and where you have civic society operating he will get loads of
invites, quite often in middle-class areas. Where you have not got it,
he will not get those invites. So if he is just responding to invites
he will go to middle-class areas. If he is politically savvy, he may
want to go to those geographical areas where his vote is. But I would
suggest, and I think there need to be strong recommendations on this,
that person should be going to the most crime-ridden areas in the first
instance. Whatever system we develop on that, details of his or her
public visits should be publicly available—where the PCC
went, how long he spent there and what the outcomes were. Otherwise,
that person, if he is a directly elected politician—if he is a
police commissioner, he will not do it—is going to seek to
please. He who votes the piper in picks the tune. They will definitely
be chasing votes. What are the panel’s opinions on

represents generally—I have to be careful here—how
perhaps politicians would work. You are absolutely right. I became a
police officer because I cared deeply about the most vulnerable in
society. That is why I became a cop. I saw what was happening where I
was living when I was at university in south-east London. I wanted to
do something to help. We must ensure that the most
vulnerable—the very people whom you highlight—are not
neglected, that they are accounted for and that their views are taken
into account, which is very important. I said that we must not be too
prescriptive —there must be some prescription there—but
if that is the sort of area that Members feel is important, it should
be taken into account. They are the ones who need us the most, they are

the tensions that chiefs have to manage. Clearly, it depends on who
stands and who gets elected, as some may have a substantial in-depth
knowledge of policing already, but some may not. They all start from
fairly different places, but if they are doing their job properly and
asking the chief challenging questions about where their resources are,
that should point them in the right direction.<a class="bkMark" name="11011865000206">&#160;</a>

are deployed against those who need our protection the most, which, as
you have defined, will be in the areas where crime is high and where
there are more victims of crime, rather than places where crime is low.
The tension that the individual will have to manage will, I suspect, be
the frustration of some of their constituents who feel that they should
have more policing, when the stats and numbers simply do not add up to
them deserving more policing. There are many low-crime areas that are
almost self-policing and rightly

my review—thank you for quoting from it—showed that what
is really interesting is that we are really bad at asking the public
what they want, and we are certainly even worse at telling them
anything about crime. Most people do not want to trip out on a wet
Thursday night to a local community meeting when there is nothing wrong
in their area or nothing is happening to them. They do, on the other
hand, want to know what the crime issues are and what is being done to
tackle them. I can get fairly obsessed with police websites,
newsletters and meetings, and there will be a greater tension, because
I have sat through police authority consultation meetings, and, Rob,

great at consultation, and we are even worse at informing the public as

one of the most striking, that I often quote from my review is that
something like 40% to 50% of the public said that knowing that action
would be taken and that they would be kept informed would most
encourage them to report crime. That goes straight back to the first
question in this Committee, which was put by Mr Coaker, which was

showing that the percentage has dropped by 3.8% this month, and that it

by my own group and those non-elected members, and they say,
“Chair, we keep you there, because you don’t play
politics.” Now, if I turned around to the chief constable and
said, “Look, I know where the Conservative votes are in
Gloucestershire, that’s where we need a few more police on the
street to show a bit of presence. Never mind over there, that’s
a bad crime area and they’re not Conservatives”, my 17

                        <p class="tabbed">You asked me
about the kind of people who might stand—I think that members of
police authorities should be allowed to stand. With such a radical
change in policing, you need the experience carried forward. If you do
not have a transition period and pilots, you should not throw
everything out. Whether they stand down at the point of election, or
whether they are allowed to continue, but with awareness of
purdah—that they cannot make announcements—I would not
want, for instance, to see a chief constable or senior officer being
allowed to retire one day and stand for election the next.<a class="bkMark" name="11011865000225">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Why do I say
that? Some people might say, “Well, that’s the chairman
of the Association of Police Authorities; he has a vested
interest.” My worries would be about a number of situations. One
is the tensions that may be caused in the run-up to an election, where
a chief constable is trying to instil public confidence in policing and
run a constabulary. Others might see a tension, because they want to be
commissioner and could be the chief constable’s elected boss a
few months down the line. There could also be a situation in which a
chief constable thinks, “I’m retiring in a couple of
years’ time. I want to be on the front page of the newspaper
instead of the commissioner.” You would then have a battle
between the commissioner and the chief constable. Both of them should
have an eye on delivering good policing and public confidence, but they
might suddenly get into a political battle about who is on the front
page of the newspaper. There are, therefore, various reasons why I
think a police officer should not be able to stand for membership of a
police authority for four years, as it is at the moment. That should be
carried through to the new
system.<a class="bkMark" name="11011865000226">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Will
independent people stand? I am sure they will. People have said to me
that independents will have no chance of getting in, and it will all be
political parties sorting out the candidates. However, it happens in
Parliament; I cannot remember the name of the gentleman who got in over
the hospital issue. That might perhaps be opened up a bit more in
policing. The public might say, “We do not like the politics.
Here is someone I know. Let’s have a look at them as an
independent.”<a class="bkMark" name="11011865000227">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> One of the ways that was suggested to get around
the conundrum of one person being responsible for a huge area was to
stress the importance of the police and crime panel and the people who
will be on that. Bridget Phillipson already mentioned the issue of
population difference between some of the constituent authorities. Sir
Hugh has referred on a number of occasions to the lack of clarity
around a whole range of different measures in the Bill, none more so
than with respect to the police and crime panel. On reading the Bill,
it is not clear to me whether the purpose of the police and crime panel
is to actually oversee or scrutinise the work of the commissioner or to
hold the commissioner to account. That is not clear. The only evidence
we have is the fact that the police and crime panel has very little
power. It has a couple of veto powers, but to use them it has to have a
three-quarters majority, which seems quite excessive. Given that we are
saying that, to reconcile the fact that one person in the neighbourhood
deals with some of the issues that have arisen, the police and crime
panel is an important body, what do each of you think the purpose of
the panel should be? Should it be a simple rubber stamp? An oversight
body? Should it hold the commissioner to account? What should its
function be? I am not clear from the Bill exactly what its function
should be. I personally think it has a very important role and should
oversee what the commissioner is doing and hold him or her to account.
What is your view on the role of the panel and do you think there is
clarity in the
Bill?<a class="bkMark" name="11011865000239">&#160;</a>

Garnham:</strong>
                           </em> My concerns centre around seemingly
providing too much clarity—perhaps that has not been
provided—because here is a chief constable, the commissioner
will hold them to account, and the PCP will hold the commissioner to
account and scrutinise what they have done. Does that mean that they
cannot then request the chief constable to come along or look into or
request information from other officers? I think the strength of this
will lie in the powers of the police and crime panel, which is
extremely
important.<a class="bkMark" name="11011865000240">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
has already been given some veto powers. What do I mean by power? It
has to be public and it has to be transparent. Perhaps some operational
discussions will be held behind closed doors between the chief
constable and the commissioner, but the two of them cannot get together
and start taking decisions on issues that quite rightly should be in
the public domain. Public transparency is an important part of the
checks and balances of the police and crime panel. You have to make
sure that the police and crime panel is not given an adversarial role
and does not say, “Right, we’re going to get the
commissioner. We disagree with what they are doing.” The panel
has to have the buy-in of what success looks like. What do we want to
be policed? How will we measure the success of policing in this county?
I can see close work between the commissioner and the PCP.<a class="bkMark" name="11011865000241">&#160;</a>

questions in the public arena. We are seeing that coming through local
government at the moment. It is extremely powerful. That would answer
some of the earlier questions about areas that may feel disfranchised.
Some 5,000 signatures demanding the public appearance of either the
chief executive or commissioner to come along to answer questions is a

some of the public. Here are the facts. Here is where we can compare.

                           </em> As a chief constable, it is clear that the
chief is held to account by the police and crime commissioner, not the
police and crime panel. That does not mean that chief officers should
step back from speaking to panels in any sense, but there is need for
clarity about to whom the chiefs are properly held to account. As you
know, panels carry specific functions. From our perspective, they
confirm the appointment of a chief, but they cannot overturn it.
However, there is a clear role if a chief is to be dismissed. It
requires a veto of 75%. Panels may consider consulting Her
Majesty’s Chief Inspector. We argue that they should consider
the professional judgment of Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector when
looking at the dismissal of a chief
officer.<a class="bkMark" name="11011865000245">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">It
would be a matter of fact in many parts of the country. For want of a
better description, the political colour of the panel will be the same
as that of a commissioner. Again, the Committee will have to reassure
itself whether that is a proper and effective check and balance. The
old system and one of the great strengths of the Police Authority for
Northern Ireland was the role of independence. Less independence will
be found in the current model. What was added from a police perspective
were different areas of expertise on which they could advise the chief,
be it business, finance, personnel, human resource issues and so on.
Again, the panels may need to look at how such advice could be drawn
from the current structure because that was seen as quite a value to
chiefs.<a class="bkMark" name="11011865000246">&#160;</a>

some of the poorer police practice. I want to be sure that we do not
set up a system that just goes through the motions of what we are
already doing and does not tackle what is needed. We need a radical
approach to informing the public regularly about one of their top
issues. That is what is worrying me about the Bill. However, I am
satisfied with what I have so far, but if the door were open, I would
push it further to get a greater description of the level of service
provided to victims and their treatment, although that does stray into
criminal
justice.<a class="bkMark" name="11011865000251">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
wish to make a point about the last thing that I was ruminating on
because it is connected. I am troubled slightly on behalf of victims
about the roles. We have a police crime commissioner, a police chief
constable and more likely borough commanders who often are in the frame
for most of the debate about what happens locally. Now we have a police
and crime panel as well. I do not know whether such an issue is put in
a Bill or in guidance, but I am slightly troubled by the public now
having three different people who are potentially holding each other to
account. For
what?<a class="bkMark" name="11011865000252">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">At
the moment, there is not enough transparency and accountability
for the public. The elected police commissioner is supposed to help to
deal with that, so that the public know who is accountable for the
local policing priorities, can go to them on that basis and know that
their views will be taken into account. The position needs to be made
clear. I accept that it is less of an issue in respect of scrutiny and
those sorts of things, but I do not want the public to have yet someone
else to have another conversation
with.<a class="bkMark" name="11011865000253">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">A
police chief has operational independence to deal with what needs to be
dealt with locally, and there is a police and crime commissioner who I
vote in. Yes, it is only every four years, but I vote them in and they
are responsible to me for whether or not they have done what I voted
them in to do. It is a bit like MPs. There is clarity in that process.
It is not for me to have a view on such matters because I am not
involved in the bureaucracy, but I am troubled by the third element of
the police and crime panel and whether it is somehow another wheel to
the axe that I am supposed to hold to account? I have enough already,
Rob, and I do not really want to add in another one for members of the
public. I ask the MPs scrutinising the Bill to take that plea into
account.<a class="bkMark" name="11011865000254">&#160;</a>

too much in this particular argument is that it is, as we see it,
mainly to do with the strategic overview of the force. We represent
officers from chief inspector to constable rank, and I accept fully
that the Bill will have an effect on us, but it is not a direct effect.
It will affect the business of officers of Association of Chief Police

in the debate than we have because of that. I am not saying

                           </em> I am grateful for the opportunity. There
are a number of things. The strategic policing requirement is an
essential part of this Bill, which recognises in explicit terms the
need for the local contribution to the national policing agenda if we
are to make sure that we keep this country safe from 21st-century
threats in the absence of any decision by this Government or the last
to look at the policing structure itself. So, we need to do
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11011865000257">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">That needs to
be underpinned by a code, a memorandum of understanding or something
that is pretty explicit about the roles that the PCC plays, so that we
understand the distinction in strategic terms—one role being to
hold us vigorously to account for what we do, and the other being to be
make sure that operational independence is not offended.<a class="bkMark" name="11011865000258">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Finally, from
a slightly selfish point of view, we think it is important that the
people who are eligible to be appointed to chief constable status
should be qualified to be so appointed. We think that should also be
in the Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11011865000259">&#160;</a>

Garnham:</strong>
                           </em> Perhaps I can just give a few points,
thinking off the top of my head. I think there is agreement that you
need a national body to represent the commissioners, and whatever form
that body takes—that is for commissioners to decide—it
should be a statutory consultee to keep the strength of the tripartite.
I think the Bill is removing that at the moment. I see that as
extremely important.<a class="bkMark" name="11011865000260">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I would like
to see the control of police staff and assets remain with the
commissioner and not be transferred to the chief constable. Greater
emphasis on the commissioner playing a role, for instance, on local
criminal justice boards is extremely important. These are police and
crime commissioners, and there is a way through for that. That needs to
be in.<a class="bkMark" name="11011865000261">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I would
probably also, to represent some of the views heard from Opposition
Members, like to see local flexibility. Will one size fit all? Will the
governance of Gloucestershire, with 550,000 people, be the same as that
of Devon and Cornwall or West Yorkshire, with a massive population
spread over a large area? Is there any way of creating local
flexibility in the way the panel is constructed?<a class="bkMark" name="11011865000262">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">What I am
pushing all along is that if you give the PCC an electoral mandate,
they have to be involved in governance from the local level all the way
through to the setting up of the national crime agency. If you do not
involve them from the local to the national, and you have people who
are perceived as being elected on local issues, some of the national
measures and efforts to tackle crime across the country will be doomed
to failure. You have to tie the local into the national, as Sir
Hugh

We hear figures showing people do not know who their police authorities
are and that authorities are invisible. Actually, when you look at what
police authorities were set up to do—to deliver an efficient and
effective service in their areas—I think we have done pretty
well on that. We have delivered on every Government efficiency agenda
and target that we have been given, and crime is down. On the idea of
making us stronger—I think you can do that with the stroke of a
pen. Police authorities disappear and you have renamed us independent
policing boards. I think the public would suddenly say, “Ah,
here’s an independent board I can go to.” It is
publicised and you have done the job in one; but we are where we are,
are not

but as we said at the beginning, at the risk of sounding rather
mealy-mouthed, it is not our role to say how we should be held to
account; but I would say, in fairness to Rob, accountability is not
necessarily a function of noise and visibility, and I certainly felt
that I was rigorously held to account by a structure that is slightly
different, I accept, from the general UK model, in Northern Ireland.
But it was very public, very visible, extremely noisy and very
challenging indeed. There are models of doing it, but what we would ask
for is that whatever else happens as the Bill proceeds, it must be an
effective way of holding police to account, because the cornerstone of
British policing has always been the citizen being held to account by
the citizen, albeit now in a slightly different
form.<a class="bkMark" name="11011865000266">&#160;</a>

fairly narrow issue, aimed probably more at police authorities and
those of ACPO rank. It is the nuclear option, the hiring and firing,
which at the moment extends to chief constable, assistant
and deputy; but it is envisaged in the Bill as it stands that
that would only relate to chief constables. Is that merely about your
worry about giving chief constables too much power, or is it the view
that perhaps it is an operational decision for a chief constable to
live with those types of
things?<a class="bkMark" name="11011865000267">&#160;</a>

                           </em> I think there is the view that if there is
even more direct accountability of the chief constable to the
commissioner, and it is public-facing, you will have those debates. The
commissioner is going to hold the chief constable to account in, it
will be perceived, a much more public, open way. I think chief
constables are saying, “Well, therefore I need my team around
me—the team that I choose in a professional manner.” The
concerns would be “How is that team chosen?”<a class="bkMark" name="11011865000268">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">At the
moment, for instance, with my last assistant chief constable, deputy
chief constable and chief constable, we moved to a system where the
police authority sat on the side and we asked the candidates to present
to a panel made up of members of the public, representing 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 40<a class="bkMark" name="Column40">&#160;</a>
                           </div>health, local government, young people—that kind of diverse
panel. We wanted to judge the interaction between the teams and how
they were going to work with the public. Then, as the police authority,
we made the decisions. I think whenever decisions are made at those
senior ranks about selection, you have to give weight to the question,
“Will this person work, understand our locality, the public, the
authorities they have to work with?”<a class="bkMark" name="11011865000269">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">So I would
see collaboration in choosing that, but I can see where the views of
chief constables are coming from: “I would like to choose my
team.” The commissioner needs to make sure that team is chosen
for the right reasons, and due regard is given to the population that
they are
serving.<a class="bkMark" name="11011865000270">&#160;</a>

good idea, let’s go along to the meeting. We’ll chew this
subject over.” It has to be structured. The clarity needed is
over whether it is the body corporate with the commissioner and the
PCP, or is the commissioner the sole individual, with the police and
crime panel separate? One of the community scrutiny panels, on a
district-wide area or upper tier authority area, might morph into that
police and crime panel. In that case, you have local government picking
up the cost—and I know the Local Government Association has said
it does not want to do that—but the commissioner is then
standing alone. That is the debate that we need to tease out. Is it
going to be the commissioner? That is similar to what is there
now—is there a body with a leader and someone holding them to

clear—and this was from polling rather than by asking the usual
suspects—that over two-thirds of the public agreed that they
should be able to elect a person locally whom they could hold to
account. I think they do want to hold an individual, a personality,
whatever way you want to look at it, to account locally for issues of
crime. When they are at force-level or county-level or such an
“up here” level, the danger is that they are not
necessarily able to fulfil what the public want of a person locally
whom they can hold to account. It is a conundrum that needs to be
worked
through.<a class="bkMark" name="11011865000277">&#160;</a>

know who is going to be on the panels. Again, we are talking about 43
different models around the country. As long as assurances are given
that they are supported and will be capable and effective in what they
do, with an effective board, that is fine. The crossover must not
happen. The commissioner is there to deal with the chief constable, not
the panel. The panel is there to hold the commissioner to account, if
you like, not to hold the chief officer to account. It skews the whole
relationship. All you are then doing is creating a commissioner who is
just a member of a panel who might have some more powers than the rest
of the panel. That is not how I see the Bill being written. There is a
distance.<a class="bkMark" name="11011865000280">&#160;</a>

citizen policing and the connection between the citizen and the police.
Ms Casey, you have spoken of the importance of transparency and
accountability and the fact that two thirds of the general public when
surveyed are interested in having someone that they can directly make
accountable. This Bill does that, does it not? It localises, does it
not? It gives more power and is much more likely to engage local people
and has masses more transparency and accountability than the current
rather anonymous system. Ms Casey would you agree with that? Mr
McKeever, do you think that will reduce the bureaucracy, because the
centralising system that we have had heretofore has perhaps encouraged
bureaucratic endeavours and this will have a lessening effect? Can I
put that to you both, and perhaps the other two witnesses might like to
contribute?<a class="bkMark" name="11011865000282">&#160;</a>

McKeever:</strong>
                           </em> In terms of bureaucracy, we have tied
ourselves up an awful lot in the past with the specifics of what we
actually do. Jan Berry, who may still be sitting in the room behind me,
did some very good work to identify those areas and processes where we
get tied up in red tape and bureaucracy. I do not think that it would
have a great effect on what we do so much in that respect—the
actual specifics—but it could change the culture and have an
influence on that. We disregarded that to a large extent in the past.
It is the culture that generates a lot of the bureaucracy. Very often
it is the culture of fear, worry and having to record things for the
sake of recording them. So it might cut the Gordian knot and release us
from a lot of this bureaucracy, but only time will tell—we do
not know. There could be a positive outcome. I am not saying that it
will happen. It might not—it depends on the individuals, how
motivated they are and how good they are. Again, we will have 43
different models.<a class="bkMark" name="11011865000283">&#160;</a>

freeing the front line up to succeed is something that is completely
supported by every chief constable. We will certainly look for top
cover when officers do not write things down for the right reasons at
the right moment in time, when post-event analysis chooses to
castigate them for not completing every form in triplicate, which they
have been required to do because of that post-event analysis of the
imprecise world in which we live. In terms of the model, I do not know,
to answer your question, whether it is a better system until it is
tried.<a class="bkMark" name="11011865000284">&#160;</a>

                           </em> My experience of the current model is that
while it may have offered varying degrees of visibility, every chief
took it extremely seriously. They always attended the meetings as
required. I cannot think of one event when a request—one can
only be requested—to attend a police authority meeting was
turned down by any chief. In Northern Ireland, I was obliged to attend.
The law was far harder. They never had to use that law because I always
attended.<a class="bkMark" name="11011865000286">&#160;</a>

the current system as opaque. My system was slightly different. It was
a very transparent system. If one looks at British policing in the
round, its willingness to commission investigations if it is found to
be wanting, the willingness to report on things where we have not got
things right, we have a fairly good record. I wait to see whether the
new model is even more transparent. We welcome transparency. It is part
of the British model of policing. It is a transparent
service of citizens in uniform being held to account by the citizens
themselves. We would support anything that makes that a better
