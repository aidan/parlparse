						Turning
to the amendments to clause 131, relating to standards for councillors,
the remit of the code of conduct for council members is important. We
are dealing with two issues. The hon. Member for Hazel Grove raised
this matter on Second Reading and during the evidence-taking. It is
important that I explain what the Government are trying to achieve. I
am convinced that there will be consensus on that, but I am conscious
that hon. Members, after reading the explanatory notes and the clause,
will have the impression&#151;for reasons that I shall
explain&#151;that we are trying to do the opposite of what we are
really trying to do. In addition, it is very important to the
Government that, as far as possible, there should be parliamentary
consensus on the standards code. It is not a party-political matter,
but is designed to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column420" />Column number: 420</div>achieve two things: to ensure that there is probity in the conduct of
councillors, and&#151;this is perhaps more difficult&#151;to ensure
that that is seen to happen. To achieve that second objective, I must
try to persuade the Committee that there is consensus. I shall listen
especially carefully&#151;even more carefully than I usually
do&#151;to the points made by hon. Members on both sides of the
Committee so that we may have
confidence.</div>

							<b class="B">Tom
Levitt</b> (High Peak) (Lab): I would be grateful if my hon.
Friend would add a third principle to his list, given the changes that
are proposed. It is one that came up during the scrutiny and evidence
sittings: the principle that there should be consistency across the
country. Without a national Standards Board, it might seem difficult to
ensure that the same standards were being applied
throughout.</div>

								Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> I thank my hon. Friend for raising that important
point. Throughout our deliberations on the Bill we have debated how to
obtain devolution and decentralisation along with equity and
consistency. Squaring that circle has been a challenge for Governments
of all persuasions. I believe that the balance and mechanism needed to
achieve those things has been reached elsewhere in the Bill, and I
shall explain when we consider later clauses how, we believe, through
regulation and resourcing, we can move towards our goal. There are some
important Opposition amendments&#151;I believe that they probing
amendments&#151;which will allow us to tease out my hon.
Friend&#146;s point. The point came up at the annual standards
conference that I attended in
Birmingham.</div>
					<a name="07030146000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
amendments will enable us to achieve the policy objective of
encompassing within the code of conduct instances where members acting
outside their official duties receive a criminal conviction. Such a
conviction would lead to action being taken against the member by the
authority&#146;s standards committee or, if appropriate, the
Standards Board. We are trying to say that the code of conduct should
not cover a councillor&#146;s private life, with the caveat that if a
criminal conviction was involved, that should be taken on board by the
standards
committee.</div>

							<a name="07030146000134"></a>Andrew
Stunell:
						</b> I very much appreciate what the Minister has said
which, as he quite rightly points out, goes against what appears to be
the plain meaning of subsection (4). That subsection is the subject of
amendment No. 124, which I will speak to in a few moments.
Notwithstanding the plain meaning of that subsection, will the Minister
explain why it does not mean what everyone thought that it
meant?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07030146000135"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>Yes, of course. I am grateful for the
opportunity to do so&#151;perhaps I should have done that at the
beginning of my speech. The problem lies in the court judgment on the
Livingstone case&#151;the Mayor of London case. In layperson&#146;s
terms, the judge said that the law currently does not allow the code of
conduct as it stands to be considered. That was, in essence, the
conclusion of the judgment. In order to allow the remit of the code of
conduct to be along the lines that I have prescribed&#151;not to
include the private life of the councillor&#151;and to comply with
the judge&#146;s remarks, we have to amend the law, which makes the
remit of the code of conduct appear tougher in law, but allows the code
itself, which is public, to be restricted. In other 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column421" />Column number: 421</div>words, the law has to be widened and clarified so that the code can be
narrowed. That is the contradiction that we are facing. As we go
through the clause, I hope that all will become
clear.</div>
					
					<a name="07030146000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07030146000136"></a>
							<b class="B">Robert
Neill</b> (Bromley and Chislehurst) (Con): I have sympathy for
what the Minister is trying to achieve. However, as the amendment stems
from the judgment in the Livingstone case&#151;some of us have had
the benefit of seeing the whole text of that judgment&#151;does the
Minister consider this to be an exceptional circumstance in which he
would be prepared to publish the legal advice that forms the basis for
him saying that it is necessary to broaden the law to narrow the code
so that we can see the rationale behind his proposal to get around the
awkward judgment?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07030146000137"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>I have not seen such legal advice. Of
course I have seen the judgment and I have read extensively the
interpretation of the judgment of outside sources. The policy that I
wish to adopt with regard to the code has been known for some time.
Indeed, there has been consultation on the code. I will be very open
with the hon. Gentleman because I wish to persuade him that I am
proposing the right course of action. The instruction to the
parliamentary counsel in preparing this section of the Bill did not
involve me relying on legal advice. The Department may have been
involved in considering such advice, but in drawing up this policy and
this Bill, I did not rely on such advice other than that which said
that I needed to amend the law to achieve what I wanted to achieve. The
questions that the hon. Gentleman, the hon. Member for Hazel Grove and
my hon. Friend the Member for High Peak have asked were the same as
those that my colleagues and I asked our officials and advisers,
because the issue is important for
councillors.</div>
					
					<a name="07030146000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07030146000138"></a>Robert
Neill:
						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>I appreciate what the Minister is saying,
but will he clarify one point? He will have seen the memorandum
submitted by the Mayor of London, and there are a number of specific
concerns. First, the clause as drafted appears to contradict the advice
of the Committee on Standards in Public Life. Secondly, the clause
appears to contradict articles 8 and 10 of the European convention on
human rights. Will the Minister tell us how the amendments will address
those
issues?</div>
					
					<a name="07030146000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07030146000139"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> I am a great fan of the Mayor of London, with whom
I work closely on civil resilience and other matters. As a result of
their advice surgeries, hon. Members will be familiar with the notion
that article 8 has many interpretations. The Lord Chancellor has
recently clarified the law on that. To save time, I will continue with
my remarks and then answer questions.</div>
					<a name="07030146000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">Getting the remit of the code
of conduct right is, of course, a central element of the conduct regime
for local government. Let me set out the context of the policy for
developing an effective conduct regime that will be fit for purpose and
that will carry public confidence in the way in which I have described.
We take the promotion of high standards of conduct seriously&#151;as
do all hon. Members. Poor standards of behaviour by members would
threaten the vital bond of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column422" />Column number: 422</div>trust between councillors and their electorate and contribute to public
disengagement from the political process. I am taking care to put in
place a regime that does not contribute towards disillusionment with
politics because of how it is used in practice. At the heart of the
regime is the code of conduct for each authority, which sets out the
behaviour expected of members. It is the duty of each authority to
adopt such a code and to have regard to the model code set out in
regulations under the Local Government Act 2000.</div>
					<a name="07030146000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">Alongside the code provided by
Parliament in the 2000 Act, which the Bill will modify, a regulatory
regime will be introduced by which councils&#146; standards
committees and the Standards Board&#151;the national body&#151;can
ensure that allegations of misconduct are investigated and that high
standards of conduct are promoted locally. To give the public an
assurance that high standards will be followed and to underline our
expectation that members should set an example of leadership to their
communities, we consider that they should act lawfully at all
times&#151;even when they are not carrying out their work as
councillors. We consider, therefore, that conduct in a member&#146;s
private capacity that has been found to be criminal&#151;conduct that
has resulted in a criminal conviction&#151;should be covered by the
members&#146; code of conduct in every local
authority.</div>
					<a name="07030146000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">The purpose
of Government amendments Nos. 185 to 187 is to ensure that enabling
powers are provided in the model code of conduct to allow members to
refer to a member&#146;s behaviour at all times. Through such
enabling powers, our policy will apply to codes everywhere that cover
private conduct that has resulted in a criminal conviction. Let me make
it clear that I am not proposing that the model code should cover any
aspect of a member&#146;s conduct outside his or her role on the
council other than that resulting in a criminal
conviction.</div>
					
					<a name="07030146000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07030146000140"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
David Burrowes</b> (Enfield, Southgate) (Con): In the
Government&#146;s response to the Graham committee, they said that
the code should be restricted to matters regarded as unlawful. The
Government are now restricting it to matters that are criminal, but
unlawfulness covers more than simply criminal
behaviour.</div>
					
					<a name="07030146000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07030146000141"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on picking up
that point. When I gave evidence on the standards code, that was one of
the matters that was discussed. In defining unlawful, the Bill contains
a definition of criminal, but hon. Members would, I am sure, like to
know that a criminal conviction resulting in a prison sentence of three
months or more is already covered by legislation. We are talking about
criminal convictions below&#151;I am sure that that is not a legal
phrase&#151;three months&#146; imprisonment, rather than the wider
point that the hon. Gentleman makes about
unlawfulness.</div>
					
					<a name="07030146000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07030146000142"></a>Mr.
Burrowes:
						</b> If that is the case, are the Government defining
criminal actions as recordable offences, or ones that cover the
expanding remit of criminal convictions? That covers environmental
protection. Some offences are not necessarily recordable, but may be
defined as
criminal.</div>

Woolas:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman is quite reasonably trying to
push me into areas on which I am not qualified to comment. I will get
an answer for him because it is important that the matter is
understood. We are providing for a situation in which a councillor who
has been convicted of an offence in a court, but who
wants&#151;probably against the wishes of the council and his or her
colleagues&#151;not to be covered by the standards committee. I know
of two such examples in recent months. I emphasise that bad behaviour
on the part of the many tens of thousands of councillors in this
country is very rare. I thank the hon. Gentleman for his point and I
shall give him a specific answer either later in the proceedings or in
writing.</div>
					<a name="07030146000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">We want to
provide that a member must not, in his private capacity, use his
position as a member to confer an advantage on himself or others. Under
the current regime, it is not open to an authority to extend or
increase the mandatory areas of private behaviour covered by the code.
We proposed that approach in our discussion paper of December 2005 and
it has been supported by the Local Government Association. We are
consulting on the precise provisions of the code and, in the light of
responses, we shall either confirm our intention or reconsider our
approach.</div>
					<a name="07030146000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments provide improved drafting of the original reference in the
Bill to the aim that the principles that underline the code of conduct
for members and the provisions of the code itself should not be limited
to principles or provisions applying to a member only in his official
capacity. It is important to make it clear what remit the clause is
required to cover. To improve clarity, the original wording is replaced
with reference to the fact that the principles and provisions are to
apply to a member at all
times.</div>
					<a name="07030146000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">In contrast,
Opposition amendment No. 124 would to retain the current position with
regard to the code of conduct following last year&#146;s High Court
judgment in the case of the London Mayor, which is that conduct in a
member&#146;s private capacity is excluded from the code unless it is
closely connected with the member&#146;s official role. That leads to
a number of anomalies, which I hope the Committee will agree are not
desirable.</div>
					<a name="07030146000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						For
example, an assault by a member arising from a dispute with a fellow
councillor at a council meeting would be proscribed by the code, but an
assault carried out on a member of the public in the street or in the
member&#146;s home would not be likely to be covered, apart from the
caveat that we have discussed. Behaviour committed by a member,
including sexual offences for which the member has been convicted,
might not be covered by the code if there were no direct link between
the behaviour and the member&#146;s role as a councillor. The
amendment would retain anomalies such as that, which I hope the
Committee agrees does not provide a sensible framework for ensuring
public
confidence.</div>

								Dr.
John Pugh</b> (Southport) (LD): The assumption behind the
changes is a clear distinction between a member&#146;s private
capacity and his capacity qua councillor. When a councillor is
functioning as a councillor, clearly he is covered by the code of
conduct. Equally, when he is on a body ex officio or as a nominee of
the council, he is acting as a councillor. However, councillors are
invited to perform lots of other roles. They are asked to participate
in quangos, partnerships, community associations and so on, where they
are billed and described as councillors. Is that the private world and
thus not covered by the code of conduct? I think that following the
Livingstone ruling, that is what the Standards Board
thinks.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07030146000147"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> The behaviour of a councillor in conducting his or
her duties in such public roles would be covered by the code. The issue
that I was most concerned to address, and to which I hope we shall
come, is the double-hatted issue. Under the code as it stands, a
councillor acting in a different role&#151;perhaps as a member of an
external body&#151;is debarred from advocating in the council on
behalf of that body. That was brought to my attention by my hon. Friend
the Member for West Ham, the mayor of whose council was a member of the
Olympics committee but who was debarred under the code from acting as
an advocate for the Olympics in Newham, despite the fact that he is its
mayor. The double-hatted approach is not sensible if councillors are to
be allowed to do their job. Where the councillor is a member ex officio
of another body, that is covered by the code. The clauses refer to
&#147;official duties&#148; in that
regard.</div>
					
					<a name="07030146000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07030146000148"></a>Dr.
Pugh:
						</b> It applies where councillors belong ex officio or
are deliberately appointed by a council, but they may peradventure join
a body that is publicly funded where they are identified as a
councillor. For instance, they may be invited by a local community
association to become a member because they are the local councillor.
In such circumstances, is that the private or the public
world?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07030146000149"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> If they are representing the council, it is
covered. If not, it is not. That is precisely the sort of point that we
need to debate, because such circumstances might result in a situation
in which the fact that a person is a councillor might not be the reason
why they have been appointed to a body such as a community association,
but public perception is otherwise. If one pursues such a function as a
councillor, even though the purpose of one&#146;s being on the body
is irrelevant to one&#146;s position, of course the standards
committee will want to have a say. It is the same for any ethical code.
The issue is similar to those that our own codes consider, although in
fact our code is slightly wider.</div>

							<a name="07030146000150"></a>Andrew
Stunell:
						</b> As the Minister rightly says, my hon. Friends and
I tabled amendment No. 124 on the assumption that the words in the Bill
mean what they say. <i class="I">[Interruption.]</i> Although I have been here
for a number of years, I am still na&#239;ve enough sometimes to
believe that that could be the case.</div>
					<a name="07030146000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">I acknowledge that the Minister
has said all that I could have hoped he would say in response, but he
has led us into an Alice in Wonderland world where we must expand the
scope of the law to catch even more people in even more cases so that
we can let them off. I am sure that he will not mind if I am a little
concerned and wish to explore exactly where that will take us. I hope
that, in the spirit in which you allowed the Minister to set out a
broader context, that you will not mind if I do the same,
Mr. Chope.</div>
					<a name="07030146000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Liberal Democrats have a
long-standing concern, one widely shared in the local government
community, about the way in which the Standards Board for England has
worked and the consequences of that over the years. In some cases, it
has resulted in a trivialisation of the complaints procedure and in the
Standards Board becoming another weapon in a partisan dialogue. On many
occasions, it has traumatised good councillors, who have found
themselves subject to Standards Board procedures and, because of the
rather bizarre process, have not been made fully aware of the charges
they faced and left in limbo, not just for a few weeks, but for months
or even a year or two.</div>
					<a name="07030146000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">The problems have been
compounded by our risk-averse society which means that when they are
asked &#147;Might this possibly, at the very outer limit, be an
interest?&#148; monitoring officers on councils will always reply,
&#147;Yes, of course it is. You must declare and you must not
participate.&#148; The process of monitoring has often resulted in
tightening, often in directions that clearly produce an anti-democratic
outcome in which elected representatives are not able to participate in
key decisions affecting their local communities. Some of the proposed
changes will deal with part of that problem, but not all of
it.</div>
					<a name="07030146000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Even now, in
essence, if someone is local, they are disqualified. That seems to be
the reverse of what we ought to be creating, which is strong local
representation by people who can participate in decision making and
bring to bear their own facts and information. I hope the Minister will
give some assurance that the &#147;if you are local, you are
disqualified&#148; rules that have come to pass for the Standards
Board and for monitoring officers are going to be a thing of the past,
and that delays in cases being dealt with will be very
shorter.</div>
					<a name="07030146000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">On Second
Reading, I pointed out that the draft code and the Government&#146;s
commentary have been published but they will not, as far as I can tell,
be subject to debate in this House, other than the debate that we are
having this morning. I hope that the Minister will also say that he
will be open to a wider debate and that he will have a word with the
Leader of the House about providing an opportunity for the code 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column426" />Column number: 426</div>to be the subject of discussion in the House at some future time. To
make a simple point, that future time needs to be before he decides
what the code is to be.</div>
					<a name="07030146000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">On Report, we may well want to
say something about predisposition and bias, both of which are core
limitations on the application of the code and the effect on
members&#146; conduct.</div>
					<a name="07030146000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						As the
Minister said, amendment No. 124 is designed to ensure that the code
applies nine to five and not 24/7. His interpretation of the amendment
is absolutely correct. A clear understanding needs to come out of this
Committee and be embedded in the legislation. If we are going to extend
the application beyond nine to five&#151;beyond on-duty
hours&#151;what exactly are we extending? The Minister has been clear
that we are going to extend it only to events which have resulted in
criminal convictions. As he rightly said, if the criminal conviction
results in a sentence of three months or more, it is already covered by
a disqualification rule and no one would seek to overturn
that.</div>
					<a name="07030146000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">Can the
Minister give some assurance that, having broadened the law to include
the 24/7 concept, the risk assessors who have got us into so much
trouble in the past&#151;the monitoring officers&#151;will not be
saying, &#147;Ah, well, I think that that ought to be
included.&#148;? There is a mandatory element to the code and a
discretionary element, which might be added by a particular council or
a particular monitoring officer or, on a particularly bad day, by an
interpretation by a monitoring officer. How will the Minister protect
councillors from that ad hoc creep of rules and rulings as a
consequence of the huge broadening of the impact of the
code?</div>
				
					
					<a name="07030146000101"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10
am</div>
					<a name="07030146000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">We all know of
many examples, which go far beyond the Livingstone case, where one
might ask questions. Clearly, if somebody speeds in their own borough
council area and gets a conviction, that will be subject to the code.
However, if they speed while on holiday in Tenerife, will that be
subject to the code? Many such examples show that there is scope for
all sorts of mischief making to occur. I hope that, if the Minister
cannot answer such questions now&#151;I will understand if that is
so&#151;he will ensure that the Committee is fully appraised of how
the Government intend to
proceed.</div>
					<a name="07030146000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our amendment
is simple, blunt and straightforward and is intended to retain the law
of the land as the courts decided it was in the outcome of the Mayor of
London case. That is clearly sufficient for the courts, and we thought
that it should be sufficient for Parliament. Underpinning the amendment
is a view that the same level of standards and code of conduct should
apply to all elected representatives in the United Kingdom democracy.
What is good for Members of Parliament sitting on this Committee should
be good for councillors and vice versa. It is not right for Members in
the House to impose on councillors a higher duty of care and a higher
level of conduct than we are prepared to impose on ourselves. That also
goes to the heart of the predisposition and bias argument, which I
understand is not the subject of this amendment, Mr. Chope,
but is something that we all want to raise on
Report.</div>
					<a name="07030146000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would have
pressed other points strongly if the Minister had not already conceded
them. I must 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column427" />Column number: 427</div>acknowledge that he clearly wants&#151;or says that he wants&#151;to
go exactly in the same direction as we do. To have a residual 24/7
theme that picks up the rest of the criminal convictions seems
sensible.</div>
					<a name="07030146000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">I accept
that amendment No. 124 does not allow for that and I concede that my
amendment probably should not stand in its current form. Perhaps it
should be tweaked slightly to include criminal convictions. However, I
should prefer to see in the Bill a clear, specific limitation of the
extension only to matters that have led to criminal convictions, rather
than opening it up to everything and leaving it to the discretion of
the Minister, and subsequent Ministers, and the good will of the House
and monitoring officers not slowly to extend, subsequently, into other
areas. There will always be an outlandish incident that results not in
a conviction, but just in national outrage. I can see the Minister, or
some future Minister, saying, &#147;We will eliminate that now and
change the code&#148;, but never coming back and referring it to the
House.</div>
					<a name="07030146000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that the
Minister gives a good account of himself. Whether I shall press
amendment No. 124 depends on his
response.</div>

						<a name="07030146000151"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Robert Syms</b> (Poole) (Con): It will probably save time if
we have a slightly more gentle debate at the start, then we can whizz
through the other business. I have a lot of sympathy with what the hon.
Gentleman has said and I am grateful for the Minister&#146;s open
approach. We all want to get the Bill
right.</div>
					<a name="07030146000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						My
party&#146;s view on the Standards Board is clear. We fought the last
election on the policy of abolishing it. Our current policy is evolving
and we will come to a view&#151;<i class="I">[Laughter.]&#151;</i>having no
doubt widely consulted. I suspect, however, that at the end of the
deliberations on the Bill, we will have to consider seriously the
regime that we get. In doing so, we will rely on talking with many of
our friends in local government to see whether they are happy. Clearly,
people are not happy with the current regime. Anyone who really wants
councils to have a good discussion need only mention the standards
boards; councils will just not stop going on about the difficulties
that they have.</div>
					<a name="07030146000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
glad that the Minister briefly mentioned that we shall come later to
the issues around double-hatting, because they are constantly raised.
The hon. Member for Hazel Grove raised the point about things being
local, and people have talked to me about school reorganisations and
about living in wards where monitoring officers prevent them from
speaking on planning committees. Clearly, there is some nonsense going
on, and I hope that we shall at least be able to put an end to some of
it by the time we reach the end of the Bill so that people can
genuinely represent their constituents. The old regime, based on
pecuniary interest, was a lot better and, in some respects, a lot
clearer. When we reach these issues later, therefore, I hope that we
shall be able to narrow the scope of the provisions somewhat to allow
people to be good local
representatives.</div>
					<a name="07030146000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
other thing that has always concerned me is speed, and some complaints
can, indeed, go on for two years. We shall come later to the clauses
that deal with the complaints process, and I think that that period may
be too long. I hope that the regime that we get will 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column428" />Column number: 428</div>be much speedier, because it is no fun, however innocent someone feels,
to have an allegation hanging over one&#146;s head for a long time.
Some of the most disappointed people in local government are those who
have had complaints made against them and been cleared, but who have
gone through months, and sometimes years, with a cloud over them. That
takes a lot of the fun out of representing one&#146;s local
community, so we really need to tackle that issue.</div>
					<a name="07030146000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						At the
beginning of this section of our debate, the Minister talked about
widening the law to narrow it, and we shall clearly need to be
reassured about how narrow it is by the time we get towards the end of
the Bill. Although I have an advantage in not being a
lawyer&#151;[<span class="SmallCaps">Hon. Members:</span> &#147;Hear,
hear.&#148;]&#151;I wish I had been one, because I keep having to
turn to those of my hon. Friends who are lawyers to find out where the
boundaries are. We need to be very specific in the guidance. The hon.
Member for Hazel Grove mentioned speeding, but my hon. Friends say that
that offence would not be included, although drink driving and careless
driving might be. What about cruelty to animals?</div>

reassurance from the Minister, although perhaps not now, about what is
in and what is not.</div>
					<a name="07030146000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
agree with what the hon. Member for Hazel Grove said about creep: we do
not want monitoring officers bringing in rather more extraneous issues
so that the boundaries start growing. As the provisions are drafted,
there is scope for extending the boundaries, and we should like things
to be rather clearer. That is a job for the Government lawyers, who can
give advice on these issues as we get further into the Bill.</div>
					<a name="07030146000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have an opportunity to have
the highest standards in local government, while making it easy for
people to do the job that they were elected to do. I hope that we take
that opportunity and that our friends in local government will thank us
for that.</div>

							<a name="07030146000154"></a>
								Dr.
Pugh:
						</b> I rise to endorse the sentiments that have been
expressed, and I do so on the basis of my observations, which are
perhaps shared by most people who have served on local councils. For as
long as the standards bodies have existed, many quite decent
councillors have felt that their reputations have been besmirched,
often through acts of political malice, and quite unnecessarily so. The
Standards Board must accept some blame for that. Not so long ago, I got
a huge brown paper parcel, which I opened to
find&#151;<i class="I">[</i>
						<i class="I">Interruption.</i>
						<i class="I">] </i>I can assure hon.
Members that it was not a backhander. In fact, it contained about 100
brochures from the Standards Board about how to complain about a
councillor, and I was asked to distribute them to all and
sundry.</div>
					<a name="07030146000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">The board was
therefore encouraging people to make complaints and touting for work,
and it did that against the background of a lack of clarity. Legal
officers sometimes have difficulty knowing how to advise a planning
committee; indeed, anybody who knows anything about planning seems to
be debarred from talking about it to anybody at all. I had a
particularly nice dilemma in my neck of the woods, where there was a
schools reorganisation, which 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column429" />Column number: 429</div>affected every school. Practically every councillor, quite reasonably,
was on a governing body, so I asked the director of legal services
whether any of them could actually vote on the council&#146;s policy.
I found that about 80 per cent. were debarred from doing so, so the
council was more or less rendered inquorate in making a very difficult
decision. In the end, rather than clear up the rules, the council
simply wrote to the Standards Board for an exemption or some protection
for what it was doing, but there was a complete muddle. There have to
be some regrets about a body that is boisterously set into action,
suggesting that there is a series of standards that it wants to
enforce, but that leaves the standards themselves very unclear to the
people who have to implement
them.</div>
					
					<a name="07030146000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07030146000155"></a>Robert
Neill:
						</b> I support what has been said. I have a number of
concerns about the way we approach standards. That is not to come to
the defence of my good friend the Mayor of London. Although my view as
to the boorishness and stupidity of his conduct is on the record, I am
inclined to agree with his basic contention that it should not have
been for the Standards Board to get into the situation of trying to
remove him from office. There is an underlying malaise with the current
arrangements.</div>
					<a name="07030146000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">A couple
of other points concern me. The principal point, made by the hon.
Member for Hazel Grove, is that there is an inherent sense of injustice
among many people involved in local government who feel that we in the
House set higher standards for them than we expect of ourselves. That
needs to be addressed and I hope that the Government will seize this
opportunity to do so. The situation simply cannot be right as a matter
of principle and I am not sure that the amendments, even those from the
Government, address that point
yet.</div>
					<a name="07030146000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second point
was made by my hon. Friend the Member for Enfield, Southgate, who has
particular expertise in these matters, having practised in the criminal
courts as a solicitor. The Minister&#146;s test, probably sensibly,
is what is a recordable offence, but members of the public often do not
draw a distinction with certain types of offences that are criminal in
a layman&#146;s interpretation but are not recordable. Those among us
who are lawyers will have come across them. My hon. Friend the Member
for Poole highlighted that point. It is therefore very important that
it is spelt out that we are talking about a recordable offence, and it
is also important that the public are aware of what is
recordable.</div>
					<a name="07030146000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">I may be
corrected by my hon. Friend the Member for Enfield, Southgate, but I
think that if, for example, someone receives a fixed penalty ticket
because they have fallen foul of a speed camera, that is not
recordable. There comes a point at which they might, if they have been
particularly foolish, end up being disqualified under the totting-up
procedures, which involves a court appearance, and they might be
unlucky enough for the local journalist to be there and to pick up on
who they are. I do not think that that is recordable
either.</div>
					
					<a name="07030146000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07030146000156"></a>
								Mr.
Burrowes:
						</b> Just to challenge my hon. Friend slightly, it
may be&#151;this is certainly consistent with the Government&#146;s
response to the Graham Committee&#151;that the provision should be
extended beyond recordable offences when, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column430" />Column number: 430</div>say, councillors are repeatedly fly-tipping in their own ward. That
would not be a recordable conviction, but it would be a criminal
conviction. <i class="I">[Interruption.] </i>To many people, it would be. Perhaps
that is a matter that affects conduct and should be taken into account
and properly adjudicated on by a standards committee. There are other
examples&#151;perhaps even repeated speeding up and down a road.
Again, that is not a recordable offence, but it results in a criminal
conviction and it may be one that should be taken into account. Those
matters need clarification, particularly as we know what has happened
in the magistrates courts. The Government have been repeatedly
extending the ambit of the criminal courts to cover more areas, so that
areas that normally would not be within the ambit of the criminal
courts now
are.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07030146000157"></a>Robert
Neill:
						</b> I am grateful to my hon. Friend because he makes
the point very well. There is a real problem. I would prefer that we
did not have this structure, because I think that it is overblown, for
the reasons that have been set out, but if we are to have it, there has
to be some rationale in the way it works and there has to appear to be
a rationale to ordinary members of the public. Certain types of
conduct, although deplorable, might not, in isolation, constitute
something that the public regard as so important that it affects their
view of the councillor&#146;s fitness for office. An example might be
someone falling foul of a speed camera. As my hon. Friend says,
however, there could be other types of conduct that at the moment would
not come within the definition of recordable, such as fly-tipping,
which manifestly would affect the public&#146;s view, so we are in an
odd situation unless there is much more
clarity.</div>

					<a name="07030146000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">I recall, a
long time ago, before the Standards Board regime, acting for a
councillor who had been given a suspended sentence of three months in
prison, which resulted in his disqualification. We went to the Court of
Appeal and persuaded it to reduce the sentence to two months so that
the councillor was not disqualified. Part of the argument we put was
that it should be for his electorate to judge his fitness to be a
councillor in the light of his conduct. The Court of Appeal
agreed. At the next election, his electorate booted him out of
office, which perhaps was the just outcome for all concerned. However,
the matter was resolved without any bureaucracy, so the hon. Gentleman
is absolutely right.</div>

Levitt:
						</b> A couple of years ago, High Peak borough council
had an independent councillor&#151;that is important because it means
that he was not subject to party discipline&#151;against whom very
serious allegations of bullying both officers and other councillors
were made. The councillor was suspended, taken off the council, and
banned from public office for two years by the Standards Board, and
rightly so. However, because it was so intimidating for councillors and
officers to give evidence in the case, it took an outside body deal
with it. The councillor&#146;s removal was quite right. He was then
replaced, so people in that ward had a proper representative for two
years, rather than continuing in the limbo that the hon. Gentleman
suggested would result if there was no referral
mechanism.</div>

Neill:
						</b> I think that the code covers the situation that the
hon. Gentleman describes, and we have to be careful due to the danger
of making broad legislation on the basis of hard cases, which is a
worry for many of us. This goes back to the point that was made about
mission creep. There have generally been other means, using elements of
the code, of dealing with cases of blatant bad behaviour. I take the
point that was made about party discipline, but I do not think that
that in itself is an argument for the major broadening that the measure
potentially involves, however good the intention behind it is&#151;I
accept that the Minister has good intentions.</div>
					<a name="07030146000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						My final
point relates strongly to an issue that we have not debated under this
group of amendments: the question of predisposition and planning. Many
of us with experience of local government find the increasingly
restrictive interpretation of predisposition ludicrous because, in
effect, it almost gags local councillors from dealing with
controversial planning issues in their wards. I will give an example
from a ward in which there is a proposal to build a major housing
development on the local golf club, which is an important factor
because the course is one of the major green areas in the
ward.</div>

Neill:
						</b> It is not my golf club, and it is not in Pratts
Bottom, and I hasten to add that the club is not even in my
parliamentary constituency or my Greater London assembly constituency,
although I am familiar with it. The proposed development is the biggest
issue in that area because of the implications of building there. The
club is in a local authority that has elections by thirds and the issue
has been rumbling along for some time, so at every election people
quite rightly want to know where the candidates stand on the proposed
development. However, if any candidate for the ward stands as being for
or against the development, they will be unable to vote on any planning
committee that deals with the matter. What a lot of nonsense that
is&#151;it is a ludicrous situation. I would like to have some
assurance that we can use the opportunity presented by the Bill to get
rid of that absolute absurdity. I can think of nothing that turns
people off democracy more than the kind of situation I described. What
the hell is the point of voting for a candidate who can take no part in
making a decision on an issue because they have previously expressed a
view on it? It is a nonsense, and surely to goodness we can use this
opportunity to get rid of the problem.</div>

							<a name="07030146000164"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> Thank you for your chairing of this sitting,
Mr. Chope. I am sure that the Committee appreciates your
lenience. Despite the fact that the blinds have been put down, I intend
to regain my golden haze by agreeing with what the hon. Gentlemen have
said and by explaining how we can implement the policies that have been
discussed.</div>
					<a name="07030146000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Enfield, Southgate raised an important point about recorded
crime and the meaning of the term &#147;unlawful&#148;. As has been
mentioned by hon. Members, the Government are running a consultation
exercise on the code. This morning we are discussing the law that will
bring about that code. The Government support the idea of having a
debate on the code. The statutory instrument that will introduce it
will be subject to the negative procedure, which will require a Member
to pray against it. I undertake to speak to the Leader of the House
about this because if a debate was possible, it would help to give
people confidence in the code, as well as giving hon. Members the
opportunity to speak about it.</div>
					<a name="07030146000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						In the
consultation, &#147;unlawful&#148; means a criminal conviction, but
as the hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate may know, whether that should
include recorded convictions is a matter for the consultation. The
views expressed will of course be taken on board. I am sure that there
will be a lot of interest on that point. Importantly, to address the
problem that was described as creep, if the model code provides such a
limitation on criminal convictions&#151;it will be a mandatory
provision of the code&#151;individual councils would not be able to
go further in their own codes. That, of course, is our intention, and
we will clarify that in the code.</div>
					<a name="07030146000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Hon.
Gentlemen said that we should not be doing anything that sees Members
of Parliament in a better light than councillors. My hon. Friend the
Member for High Peak served as a distinguished member of the Standards
and Privileges Committee for some six years. I can testify to that
because, to his credit, despite my probing him harshly, he refused to
talk to me about a case in which I was indirectly involved. I am happy
to put that on record. The law debars people from being Members of
Parliament if they have been sentenced to more than 12 months&#146;
imprisonment. However, the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards can
investigate and make recommendations to the Standards and Privileges
Committee in other circumstances. Parliament is a sovereign body; that
is a unique situation and, in effect, it is the reason why we regulate
ourselves.</div>
					<a name="07030146000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">In future,
it will be possible under this regime for councillors not to be
disqualified because they have a local interest, including for planning
permissions. The caveat will be that if a councillor has a greater
interest than another member of the public in that ward, he will be
restricted&#151;in other words, that will be the case if there is
direct self-interest. Other than that, the Government agree with what
was said by the hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst and others. The
model code on which we are consulting directly addresses that local
issue. It will provide that ward councillors will be able to
participate in decisions about their wards if their interests are no
more than those of others who live in that ward. That is important, and
I thank the hon. Gentlemen for their
comments.</div>

					<a name="07030146000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
point about speed, the regime that we hope to put into place will
abolish the national adjudication role. It was the adjudication
committee and the adjudication process, not the Standards Board itself,
that caused the severe delay in the Islington case, which caused such
controversy. I am grateful to the hon.

democratic process. The changes that we are making to the regime will
improve the standing of the democratic process and elected
