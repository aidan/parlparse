                           </strong> Welcome back to Committee, Mr Chope. I have given
the Committee notice of the amendment, which relates to
disqualification criteria for candidates. We discussed the issue to
some extent when we debated the conditions under which a police and
crime commissioner should be suspended.<a class="bkMark" name="11020872000051">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">At present,
the disqualification criteria are limited to those who have served a
sentence of three months or more, which is the same relatively
stringent test that applies in local government elections. However, I
have reflected on a general agreement—it is certainly
the  
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 482<a class="bkMark" name="Column482">&#160;</a>
                           </div>view of the Association of Chief Police Officers—that the
importance of the police and crime commissioner post means that it
requires a higher standard. I agree, because those elected individuals
will hold a police force to account, and members of the police force
are themselves held to a higher standard for obvious reasons. There is
a case, therefore, for treating PCCs differently from those in other
elected posts. That is why I brought forward the amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11020872000052">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Under the
amendment, any person convicted of an imprisonable offence at any time
will be permanently disqualified from standing as a police and crime
commissioner. I emphasise “an imprisonable offence”; the
amendment does not suggest that the person has to have been sentenced
to a term of imprisonment. That is a very high standard that is
unprecedented for a UK election. The position, however, is
unprecedented, too, and the nature of the post demands a higher
standard. The standard is higher than any that has been suggested in
either Government or Opposition amendments. It is a stringent measure,
but it is right, so I hope that the Committee will understand why I
tabled the amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11020872000053">&#160;</a>

                           </span> Good afternoon, Mr
Chope. The Minister has tabled a good amendment and it would be
churlish of me not to say so. Under the original drafting, a person
would be disqualified from being elected had they been sentenced to
a<a class="bkMark" name="11020872000054">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“term of
imprisonment of 3 months or longer…within the previous 5
years”.<a class="bkMark" name="11020872000378">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>He
is right that such a test would not have been stringent
enough.<a class="bkMark" name="11020872000055">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Whatever our
differences about the role of the police and crime commissioner, this
debate is not about whether the model is right, but about the model
working as well as it can and the position having credibility if it is
set up. All of us would want that, whether we agree with the model or
not.<a class="bkMark" name="11020872000056">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
cannot overestimate the importance that members of the public will put
on the integrity of the person who is standing for police and crime
commissioner; it would be inconceivable not to have the most stringent
test for a PCC. I am pleased that the Minister agrees and has brought
forward the amendment. The test is stringent, because it
includes<a class="bkMark" name="11020872000057">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“any
imprisonable offence…whether or
not”<a class="bkMark" name="11020872000379">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>someone
is sentenced to a term of imprisonment. As the Minister rightly said,
that is an exceptionally tough condition of eligibility to stand, but
it is
right.<a class="bkMark" name="11020872000058">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
have a couple of questions for the Minister. Just to be sure that I
understand—this might sound idiotic, but I will ask it anyway
because it is important—is it obvious when someone has a record
that disqualifies them, or would someone ever have to make a judgment
about that? For example, I suppose an enhanced criminal record check
would make it obvious whether someone had received some such sentence.
Are we talking about that sort of thing? Would the information come up
automatically as a result of such a check? Would someone standing for
the post of police and crime commissioner make a statement about
whether the test applied, or would the returning officer require some
sort of enhanced criminal record check to verify what was said by the
candidates? In the vast majority of cases, what they  said
would be true, but would that be part of the 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 483<a class="bkMark" name="Column483">&#160;</a>
                           </div>process? Would the returning officer do any such check, or would someone
else be responsible? It would be interesting if the Minister could
clarify the
process.<a class="bkMark" name="11020872000059">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Secondly,
my understanding of the Bill is that someone standing for police and
crime commissioner must be 18. Is that at the time the person agrees to
stand for police and crime commissioner, or by the time of the
election? I think it is at the time someone decides to
stand.<a class="bkMark" name="11020872000060">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Also,
is there anything before us that refers to 18 or 19-year-olds standing
for the post of police and crime commissioner? Does the amendment refer
only to the criminal records of people who are over the age of 18, or
does it refer to a criminal record that someone may have got before the
age of 18? Does the Minister know, or can he get some advice, about
that? There is a difference between adults and juveniles—I think
we would all agree on that—but someone could have been sentenced
for an extremely serious offence at 17 or 16 and decide, perhaps a few
years later, to stand for that post. I do not want to damn everyone and
everything, but will the Minister say whether the amendment refers to
the criminal records of under-18s, or just to those of over-18s? Also,
who regulates
that?<a class="bkMark" name="11020872000061">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

Herbert:<a class="bkMark" name="11020872000439">&#160;</a>
                              </span>
                           </strong> Those are all important points, and I am grateful
to the hon. Gentleman for making them in Committee. On how we will know
whether someone has a conviction, we propose not a
check but a declaration on nomination. That will be provided for in
regulations. I am open to discussion on whether there should be a
formal check, or whether that declaration is sufficient. I think that
people who wanted to stand for the office but knew that they had a
criminal conviction would know that it would almost certainly come out
later, so they would not stand. However, if there is a strong view to
the contrary, I will certainly consider the
issue.<a class="bkMark" name="11020872000062">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">On
the age requirement, a person needs to be 18 or over when they are
nominated for the election, not when they are actually elected. The
provision will apply to any youth offences, and we need to go back to
that. The test is very stringent. With all the debate that we have
had—there was the suggestion that the test relating to
suspension was not stringent enough, and so on—I do not think
that we can agree to such stringency but then say, “They may
have committed a relatively minor offence when they were young.”
Well, an imprisonable offence is not likely to be so minor. We apply a
test of that standard to police officers, and we are consciously
applying a much higher test to police and crime commissioners in a way
that is not done for a person in any other elected
office.<a class="bkMark" name="11020872000063">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
is true that in other elected offices we allow the public to forgive
people and say, “You made a mistake.” Somebody can be
open about it and the public can judge. We might have allowed that
democratic check: let the public decide. I think that the Committee has
taken the view, which is shared by ACPO, that because this post
involves supervising a police force, there should be an automatic
disqualification. Otherwise the individual is susceptible, in that they
are not subject to the same standard as the people whom they are
holding responsible for the efficiency and effectiveness of the force.
In agreeing to the amendment, we need to be conscious that it is a very
stringent test indeed. I am certainly not minded to make it any more
stringent for precisely the reasons that the hon. Member for Gedling
suggests.<a class="bkMark" name="11020872000064">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I thank the Minister for that reply. I am grateful
for his clarification on under-18s. As the Minister knows, very serious
offences may be committed by under-18s, but I understand the point he
made about the provision applying to any imprisonable offence committed
by an under-18. He makes the point very well—this agrees with
the point that I am making—that the necessity of the credibility
and integrity of the person being above reproach is such that the test
has to be the same as for a chief constable, or indeed any police
officer. It is simply not tenable to have it
otherwise.<a class="bkMark" name="11020872000065">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
am not sure what the view of the rest of the Committee is, but I think
that there is a need for the Minister to reflect on the checking
points. It is inconceivable that somebody would stand for such a
high-profile position and not expect it to come out that they had been
guilty of an imprisonable offence; it is extremely
unlikely. The problem is that it is not certain that no person who was
guilty of an imprisonable offence would stand and then be found out;
then, there would be all the kerfuffle and rigmarole of having to run
the election again, with all the cost and disruption that that would
involve. However, it is probably worth considering how easy that would
be. Criminal records checks for all sorts of things are almost a matter
of
course.<a class="bkMark" name="11020872000066">&#160;</a>

would be simpler to make it an offence not to disclose such a

                           </strong> I can hear some mumbling from my legal adviser. If
I heard correctly, it might already be an offence knowingly to make a
misleading statement, as I might say as a pupil barrister. I see
nodding from across the room. My hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham,
Selly Oak, makes a good point. If it is a criminal offence, perhaps
that needs to be made explicit when people are giving in their
nomination forms. If it is not—or even if it is—perhaps
the Minister needs to consider whether a check is needed. It would be
churlish and silly not to recognise a good amendment—an
amendment that goes further than the one that we tabled in the next
group. I welcome the Minister’s

this afternoon, as we have debated many of the principles in part 1,
apart from those in one clause. Under the disqualifications—my
hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Selly Oak mentioned
this—why is membership of the House of Lords not a
disqualification for holding office as a police and crime commissioner?

commissioner?<a class="bkMark" name="11020872000082">&#160;</a>

That does not alter the fact that clause

police and crime commissioner”—does not discuss whether

with the postponement of an election. It provides that the day to which
the election is postponed will be treated as the day of the election
for the purposes of legislation governing elections. As drafted,
subsection (3) uses the term “relevant provision” to
refer to that election legislation, and subsection (5)
defines “relevant provision” as<a class="bkMark" name="11020872000095">&#160;</a>

they should be in the policing of a local area. The purpose of
amendment 166 is to ensure that not only the chief officer of police,

national priorities include many things that we would all regard as
essential for police forces to tackle. For example, domestic violence,
sexual violence and trafficking are all national priorities and matters
that we regard as extremely important, but would a police and crime
commissioner with a local mandate campaign or stand on the basis of
such issues? Our amendment would deal with that tension, and the
Minister is aware of the
problem.<a class="bkMark" name="11020872000112">&#160;</a>

clause 5(5), the commissioner is required to have regard to the
strategic requirements laid out by the Secretary of State. I accept
that but, when the police gave us evidence—I apologise if I am
wrong—it was interesting that Assistant Commissioner Lynne Owens
and Chief Constable Chris Sims both said that there was a need for much
tougher and stronger words to be used in the Bill to make it even
clearer that strategic national priorities could not be ignored by
police and crime commissioners.<a class="bkMark" name="11020872000113">&#160;</a>

locally for police on the streets to do something about the kids in the
park, drunken behaviour and neighbourhood crime. I am sure that each
and every one of us has had people in our surgeries asking us to talk
to the police and local authorities about what are real problems and
what can be done about them. Behind the scenes, what is done by the
specialist units that work closely with local partners on many other
matters is just as important as neighbourhood policing, but would
commissioners, in standing for election, have that as high up their

that were stronger than “have regard to”, so we came up
with “take into account”. However, we can have regard to,
take into account or think about something, yet do absolutely nothing.

that we can be sure that a police and crime commissioner, as well as
the chief constable, will have regard to strategic

the other side of the coin this morning. Might chief constables with an
assertive police and crime commissioner, who has just been elected on
local policing priorities, feel constrained about how much regard they
can have to the national policing priorities when they are worried that
that commissioner might say, “But that is not what I
want”? I do not want to go back to the argument about sacking
and so on, but chief constables might be concerned about what a police
and crime commissioner will do if they do not follow the local policing
priorities. I wonder, therefore, whether “have regard to”
is strong

us be frank, some of the strategic national priorities are things that
are not at the front of people’s minds and things about which a
chief constable has to be pretty strong and stand up for, such as the
policing of Traveller sites or support for women in refuges. Giving
resources to such groups is not always the immediate priority that
galvanises an electorate. That point is very

I will not try the hon. Gentleman, but he is clearly worried about how

last amendment before us is one that the National Society for the

of where we can put one particular thing in the Bill with respect to
the strategic policing requirement. We could have made eight or nine
different amendments to take up different issues that are hugely
important and some of national importance. None of us here would
disagree with the requirement to safeguard and promote the welfare of
children. Everyone would agree that that is a really important function
and a national policing priority.<a class="bkMark" name="11020872000126">&#160;</a>

competing priorities. It could be argued that everything is a priority.
We can see one of the problems in the situation described. We
all get complaints from constituents that there are not enough police
on the estates and streets and so on. Perhaps that is because too many
officers have been sucked into specialist units. This is a
counterweight to their being sucked into those units as a result of

                           </strong> That is an interesting point, which goes to the
heart of what is meant by front-line policing. I take the point that
the hon. Member for Cannock Chase has just made. There is of course a
balance between visible officers and those performing other roles. It
is difficult. Let us have a more general philosophical debate about it.
Policing is much more complicated in the modern world. The police deal
not only with criminal behaviour but with social dysfunction and
failure, which they would not have dealt with in the past. Communities
often dealt with such problems themselves. Hence there is a big
increase in the workload of the police that people like my dad, when he
started, would not have had. They just policed criminal activity, not
antisocial activity, as they are expected to do now.<a class="bkMark" name="11020872000130">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It is
relevant to what the hon. Member for Cannock Chase has just said and to
our discussion of the clause and the amendments that society demands
that we have specialist units and officers. At some point in the
future, when the hon. Gentleman is sitting where his hon. Friend the
Minister is sitting, and there is a debate on domestic violence, child
protection, trafficking, fraud or internet crime, every single MP and
outside organisation will say, “Isn’t what we need a
specialist officer who has the skills to deal with those particular
problems?” While visible front-line policing and an officer
patrolling the streets is an important part of our police force, do we
not need those specialist officers as well? So is it not the case that
the tension that to which the hon. Member for Cannock Chase has drawn
attention exists? I agree that people demand visible officers on the
street, but I also know that, to tackle some of the most serious
crimes, which we all want dealt with, there is a need for specialist
units and specialist
officers.<a class="bkMark" name="11020872000131">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> This is a very important debate, and I appreciate
the tone in which it is being conducted. My point is that it is a
balance. I am not saying that we do not need these specialist officers;
I am just saying that it will always be a balance with finite
resources, where

slightly out of kilter towards the Whitehall dictators sucking officers
into specialist units, and the result of that imbalance is fewer police
on the streets responding to the local community’s priorities.

have seen something tragic happen and formed an organisation to take
account of where things have moved on, whether it is the internet or
something else? There is a lack of joined-up policing, such as one
police force not passing information on to another force or a lack of
overall co-ordination. That is why we end up with a special
group.<a class="bkMark" name="11020872000134">&#160;</a>

Bill goes forward as it is currently constructed, there is a real
danger that the balance of the joined-up work of the specialist units,
which are helping to protect children, will swing too far the other
way. My hon. Friend is right. We have to avoid a tragedy happening,
after which all hell breaks loose and everyone demands new units, with
more specially trained officers and so on to tackle what has occurred.
There is a danger that the Bill, in seeking to give local priorities to
these newly elected PCCs, will undermine some of the work on delivering
the strategic national priorities, which the chief constables believe
is

of officers away from visible and available roles into specialist
units. It identified a number of reasons for that. One was bureaucracy
and another was management of risk. The report concluded that the
proportion of officers who were visible and available—some 11%
on average—was too low. Does the hon. Member for Gedling agree
with that and understand that there is an issue, as my hon. Friend the
Member for Cannock Chase said, of officers being drawn away from
visible and available roles, important as specialist roles are? HMIC is

occurs, everybody will say, “Well, if we had the specialist

                           </strong> These amendments are about the strategic policing
requirements, which are not about the priorities or responsibilities
that may be important in general. Of course, police and crime
commissioners will want to take those seriously. The strategic policing
requirement is about threats and policing capabilities that cannot be
assessed locally because they are cross-boundary in nature or issues of
national importance such as national security. The fundamental
principle here is that police and crime commissioners will be
responsible—as police authorities are—for holding the
chief constable to account for the totality of the policing of their
force. We want forces to remain vertically integrated; we are not
trying to top-slice national responsibilities off forces or make some
kind of top tier of police force who are accountable to anyone other
than the local authority that should hold them to account for the
totality of their performance. That is a fundamental principle of the
existing system and of our future
system.<a class="bkMark" name="11020872000139">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">However,
many crimes cross force boundaries. I have often talked about the
paradox of policing in the past—that the centre has paid
insufficient attention to these national policing issues and yet been
too ready to interfere in the local. It is important to reflect on the
fact that there is a problem under the existing
system.<a class="bkMark" name="11020872000140">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> There is always an argument about whether enough
central funding is given to police support and how much money comes out
of the area police force. What would the priority be for the police
commissioner? Would he say, “The crime is not really here.
I’m not too bothered about what comes in and what goes across
and causes a problem in someone else’s area”? Where would
the priority be, for instance in the case of
ports?<a class="bkMark" name="11020872000141">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> These are exactly the sorts of issues that I am
seeking to address here—those crimes that cross force
boundaries. We have to accept that there is a problem at the moment.
Under the existing system, some of these threats are insufficiently
addressed, so we should not characterise the problem as one that is
about to be created by the elected police and crime commissioners. As
the Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police reminded us in a speech a
few months ago, there is still a serious gap in our tackling of serious
organised crime. We would address that gap, partly through this
provision, but also through the creation of the national crime agency,
the subject of a separate Bill. A new problem is not being created by
the fact that police forces will be

                           </strong> I will come to that issue.
The hon. Gentleman suggested in relation to amendment 166 an
insufficiently strong duty on chief officers to have regard to the
strategic policing requirement. That phrase is commonly used in
legislation. It does not mean that the chief officer has to follow the
requirement blindly, but he cannot depart from it without good reason.
It is a strong legal
provision.<a class="bkMark" name="11020872000145">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
accept that ACPO has expressed concern about whether the duty is
sufficiently strong. I discussed it with Sir Hugh
Orde at lunch time today and undertook to check back with our legal
advisers about the nature of the duty. I have not had time to do that
before our discussion on the amendment today, but I am currently
advised that the duty is sufficiently strong that chief constables
would be required to follow it and not depart from it without good
reason. It seems strong enough to me. Under the hon. Gentleman’s
proposal the chief constable would merely have to take the strategic
policing requirement into account. That suggests that the chief officer
would merely have to treat the requirement as one of a range of factors
that he should take into account without attaching any particular
weight to it. I believe that it would be a weakening of the
duty.<a class="bkMark" name="11020872000146">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Gentleman also referred to the role of police and crime
commissioners. He acknowledged that we have already made specific
provision under clauses 5(5) and 6(5) that police and crime
commissioners should have regard to the requirement when determining
local resourcing decisions through their police and crime plans, and
that police and crime objectives should include the police force
discharging its national or international functions. The existing
provisions will therefore enable police and crime commissioners to work
with their forces to balance local priorities and pressures with their
national and international responsibilities and ensure consistency in
how they are
delivered.<a class="bkMark" name="11020872000147">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
556 would specify child safeguarding within the strategic policing
requirement. That goes to the hon. Gentleman’s question whether
the particular list of offences he referred to would be included in the
requirement. Clause 79 provides that national threats may
include<a class="bkMark" name="11020872000148">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“a
threat to national security, public safety, public order or public
confidence that is of such gravity as to be of national importance,
or…a threat which can be countered effectively or efficiently
only by national policing capabilities to counter the
threat”.<a class="bkMark" name="11020872000387">&#160;</a>

                        </div>
                        <p>It will base the
assessment of such threats on the professional advice from chief
officers and police and crime commissioners, and in consultation with
other partners. We have already started discussions with the
Association of Chief Police Officers about the strategic policing
requirement.<a class="bkMark" name="11020872000149">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
would not be right or appropriate to judge in advance what the threats
may be without listening to that professional advice. That is the right
way to proceed, but on the specific issue of child safeguarding,
provision is made elsewhere to safeguard the welfare of children. Under
section 11 of the Children Act 2004,<a class="bkMark" name="11020872000150">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“the police
authority and chief officer of police for a police area in
England”<a class="bkMark" name="11020872000388">&#160;</a>

                        </p>
                        <p>The
Bill amends that provision to provide that police and crime
commissioners will also discharge their functions having regard to the
need to safeguard and promote the welfare of children. The hon.
Gentleman’s concern has therefore been
addressed.<a class="bkMark" name="11020872000152">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
strategic policing requirement is an important provision in the Bill. I
do not agree with the suggestion—or accept the premise of the
argument—that police and crime commissioners will focus on local
policing issues to the exclusion of all others. However, the provision
might allay concern over that happening, because chief constables will
have to comply with the strategic policing requirement and they will be
held to account over it. In particular, given the nature of the threats
confronting us, which can cross force boundaries, the provision will
help to ensure that police forces work together. That is the right
approach as long as we have 43 police forces—or about that
number—which is certainly the Government’s policy,
despite the best efforts of the hon. Member for Gedling to change the
position.<a class="bkMark" name="11020872000153">&#160;</a>

the requirement; as I have said, the police and crime commissioner has
to hold the chief constable to account for that. Secondly, the Home
Secretary has back-stop powers. Under clause 95, which is titled
“National and international functions”, the Secretary of
State may direct police and crime
commissioners.<a class="bkMark" name="11020872000155">&#160;</a>

perfect already. I know that these are more minor matters, but although
we gave increases to the police, the chief constable of South Wales
police spoke about whether he would still have enough resources to
police football matches and motorways, so even at that time there was a
threat that such functions might be withdrawn. There were already
problems, albeit not as serious as the national

effective, but we will have strategic policing requirements, which is a
significant difference. The Bill is a recognition that threats,
including the terrorist threat, mean that police forces must work
together. It is also a recognition that although we wish to keep the 43
forces, they should work together. As I said in a speech a couple of

might lead to unintended consequences, or whether improvements will be
made. One of the most important things that the Minister said was that
he met the president of ACPO, Sir Hugh Orde, at lunch time and
discussed whether the duty is strong enough. The Minister is not
certain about that, but he is asking for it to be checked, which is
extremely helpful. I do not know whether there is a stronger legal

the Minister clarified, for all those children’s organisations

that the amendment is not necessary. Existing legislation achieves the

                           </strong> It would help the Committee if the Minister said a
bit about the process by which he expects the new document—the
strategic policing requirement—to be set out. Does he think that
Parliament will see the document—I am not necessarily suggesting
that it should be subject to the affirmative procedure—and that
it will be involved? Given that the Minister has discussed national
threats and counter-terrorism, perhaps Parliament should see
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11020872000167">&#160;</a>

agencies such as the Serious Organised Crime Agency, the Child
Exploitation and Online Protection Centre, and the National Policing
Improvement Agency fit into the strategic policing requirement? Will
the Secretary of State have discussions with such bodies to agree what
should be set out in it? It would be interesting for us to debate at
some point how the Minister is going to overcome the gap between the
local and force level, and the national
level.<a class="bkMark" name="11020872000168">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
Minister is right that we all support the retention of the individual
forces, but the merger debate—whatever its rights or
wrongs—was about trying to address a problem at a regional
level. When we are talking about tackling problems such as serious and
organised crime, it is collaboration at a regional level that is
important. I will be interested to know how the Minister thinks the gap
in the current structure will be dealt with, whether by existing
agencies or the national crime agency, which I believe is due to come
into being in 2013, subject to
legislation.<a class="bkMark" name="11020872000169">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I shall raise a couple of brief points about the
clause. I want to deal with the issue of consultation, when the
Secretary of State obtains advice from representatives of the chief
officers of police and representatives of local policing bodies, which
I presume is the commissioner’s office. I notice that again an
opportunity has been missed specifically to include police and crime
panels, even though there is an additional element in the clause that
says that the Secretary of State can consult other persons as she
thinks fit.<a class="bkMark" name="11020872000170">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">One of the
issues that has run throughout our scrutiny of the Bill has been that
when there are complex forces—such as West Midlands police,
which covers a large geographical area and has a diverse
community—there is doubt about whether the police commissioner
themselves could hope to represent adequately the full spectrum of
needs and opinion of that area. I know that the Minister sticks to the
idea that police and crime panels are there simply to scrutinise the
commissioner, but during the debate on them, we also touched on the
question of whether they could provide a slightly broader perspective
of local needs and interests. If the Secretary of State is going to
consult on drawing up a strategic plan, she may, at least when we are
dealing with complex forces, want to consider people such as police and
crime panels, who may have something to
offer.<a class="bkMark" name="11020872000171">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">On
the question of how the plan will be drawn up, I presume that the sort
of things that the Minister has in mind are problems such as the
potential for cyber attacks, complex computer fraud and other kinds of
terrorist activities. I am not sure how any force would be able to cope
with those problems if we took the advice of the hon. Member for
Cannock Chase and turned them all into PC Plods, because that would
cause a bit of a difficulty. We should be arguing for the retention of
such areas of specialism.<a class="bkMark" name="11020872000172">&#160;</a>

that it is inefficient for police officers to patrol in pairs, and that
if he had his way, he would insist that they patrolled on their own. He
also said today that he thought that the balance on specialism was
wrong and that the specialisms that my hon. Friend the Member for
Gedling was discussing were squeezing out police efficiency. I am
simply making the point that the Minister intends such a contingency to
deal with specific problems that would require a degree of specialism,
and that might be harder if the hon. Member for Cannock Chase were to
get his
way.<a class="bkMark" name="11020872000176">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
was really asking whether the Minister envisaged specifying in the
strategic plan any minimum requirements that a force would have to
retain to be equipped for dealing with such national priorities. Is
that the kind of thing that might be in the plan? Presumably, for a
hard-pressed force to know exactly what might be demanded of it would
be difficult, if it were engaged in a process of readjusting its
priorities. To be fair to the hon. Member for Cannock Chase, the force
might seek to do that by squeezing a number of specialisms out of its
system. Would the force be able to meet the strategic plan, if the plan
were to specify some minimum
requirements?<a class="bkMark" name="11020872000177">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">On
the same basis, I was interested to hear the Minister’s comments
about the age of fiefdoms being over. It occurred to me, however, that
a hard-pressed police force, knowing that a plan from the Secretary of
State can be called upon when emergencies happen, might be tempted not
to spend sufficient resources on particular specialisms, safe in the
knowledge that, if specified in the plan, another force might have to
be called upon. In which case, the force could leave the onerous task
to the other
force.<a class="bkMark" name="11020872000178">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
example I have in mind is that of a large force neighbouring a smaller
one. The smaller force might be tempted to scale back the number of
murder inquiry officers or reduce training. It might be tempted to do
the same with computer specialists or armed response officers. That
would be perceived as extremely unfair by local
taxpayers.<a class="bkMark" name="11020872000179">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I guess that is the point. We already witness
difficulties. Certainly some HMIC reports have questioned how well

                           </div>a huge emphasis on community police activities. Inevitably, the budget
savings in such a rebalancing operation might well be in specialist
areas, which could leave certain forces ill-equipped and relying on
other forces to come to their aid. In the interests of fairness, I am
trying to figure out how the plan would deal with that, so that there
is no danger of forces not having minimum requirements, or leaving that
responsibility to another force. I do not think that that would be
particularly
fair.<a class="bkMark" name="11020872000182">&#160;</a>

final question is about the philosophy of what is proposed. The whole
essence of what the Minister seeks to do in his approach to policing is
tackling what he sees as the centralising tendency of which the
previous Government fell foul. He has, at various times, made that
case. Having engaged in a political experiment to set up underfunded
forces with political commissars in charge of them, the forces might
eventually reach a stage when they are not doing the very things that
the Government had anticipated. It is possible that they will take off
in a direction that the Minister does not foresee. Under proposed new
section

                        <p>What

Perhaps that will not happen with the right hon. Gentleman because he
has a different philosophy, but what about his successors? What is to
stop the documents becoming a succession of directives that
increasingly centralise the demands on the police and prevent the
individual opportunities that he says are the whole purpose and spirit
of his police

like to make some points, many of which have already been touched on,
concerning the balance that must be struck between local priorities and
the Government setting national direction. We all appreciate the
importance of local priorities. We hear about them each time we hold a
constituency surgery. Constituents write to us expressing their worries
about crime and disorder, and about antisocial behaviour. However, it
is important to recognise the valuable national direction that the
Government have given in areas such as domestic violence and child
protection. That is not to say that local forces did not already do
good, valuable work, but sometimes when the Government make it clear
that they expect certain offences to be taken seriously and that time
and resources should be put appropriately into dealing with such
crimes, that sends a clear signal to local police authorities and to
chief constables that action should be
taken.<a class="bkMark" name="11020872000185">&#160;</a>

about the direction that he envisages for policing in this country, and
I have some disagreement with him on that. While it is important that
the Government are clear about their direction, it is vital that local
people have input into policing in their area. The right hon. Gentleman
has talked, including at the weekend, about front-line policing and the
drift of officers at 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 499<a class="bkMark" name="Column499">&#160;</a>
                           </div>specialist units. Yes, of course, clearly a balance must be struck
between what the public regard as front line, visible policing and the
work that goes on in specialist units, but what do we mean by front
line and what is meant by “visible”? Does it mean visible
to the victim who meets the officer who takes a
statement regarding child abuse, or in circumstances when a video
statement is taken from a child witness at a specialist
centre?<a class="bkMark" name="11020872000187">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">That is not
“front line” in the sense of looking out of the window
and seeing the officer patrolling. If I were a victim of such a crime,
I would expect a response from someone who was properly qualified,
skilled and sensitive to such issues. Specialist units are important in
allowing officers to develop particular expertise that allows them to
deal with particularly difficult crimes. We do not have to go back too
far to find cases in which police officers, when called to deal with
domestic violence offences, would say, “It’s just a
domestic. No crime has been committed.” I am glad that we have
come a long way since those days, but it is important to examine why
that has occurred. I am pleased that there has been a societal shift,
which is hugely important. Clearly, pressure has been brought to bear
by a range of organisations so that police forces ensure that policing
reflects their communities, which means dealing with crimes that can be
hidden and are often not as visible as, say, a gang of youths kicking a
football at the end of the
street.<a class="bkMark" name="11020872000188">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We
need to be careful that we do not end up with a false dichotomy between
front line and specialist units. I am not sure, either, whether the
benefits of those specialist units have been properly considered.
Perhaps the Minister will ask the inspectorate to do some research on
that. Do cost savings result from the work that goes on? For example,
if a specialist unit is able to go and lift a repeat offender, put them
before the courts, see action taken and a prosecution brought, does
that mean that police officers are not frequently called out to the
same address, time and time again? That costs money, and not only to
the
police.<a class="bkMark" name="11020872000189">&#160;</a>

specialist units in this debate. It is as if we are only discussing
some elite element of the organisation, when perhaps we are also
discussing specialist tasks. For example, in my constituency, police
officers meet people who are about to be released from prison, check
where they will be staying and point out that they will call to check
up on them. That seemed to have a dramatic impact on the reoffending
rate in the early days of release, which is a major problem, as the

a proper response from someone who is skilled and experienced in
dealing with the crime of which they were a victim. However, how often
do we hear the voices of the most vulnerable in our community? That can
sometimes be very difficult, particularly with children. As
constituency MPs, how often do we engage with children, outside of a
nice, happy school visit? It can be difficult to make sure that those
voices are heard. In recent years, there has been an important change
in making sure that police forces are responsible for tackling some
difficult crimes that are little

crimes that are dealt with by specialist units, whether it is fraud,
domestic violence or child protection, require a different kind of
response from the uniformed response when someone reports a crime
immediately. That has come about in direct response to local need and
provides great local benefit. Unless someone directly receives services

that there are issues of national importance that have been dealt with
in a variable manner by some forces. The example given by my hon.
Friend makes very clear the variability that can sometimes arise in
local forces. I am not suggesting that the Government say
prescriptively to local forces, “You must deal with this kind of
crime in this kind of way”, but a clear signal had been sent in
recent years from the Government that forces should perhaps change the
way in which they approached the investigation of certain crimes and
make sure that specialist officers were able to respond
appropriately.<a class="bkMark" name="11020872000198">&#160;</a>

will draw my comments to a conclusion, but I reiterate that, while much
is made of the inspectorate’s report on the availability of
police officers at any given time, the figure that the Minister often
refers to is an important one. Perhaps the Government could look at the
impact of the changes that have been made in recent years and the
improvements that we have seen, and

not simply about the benefits to the victims but about whether we
ultimately save money in the long run. Although we can put people
before the courts, we can improve safety and tackle the lack of
responses that can sometimes occur. There are also the knock-on savings
to children’s services departments and health authorities, for
example, in tackling problems with a co-ordinated response sooner
rather than later.<a class="bkMark" name="11020872000199">&#160;</a>

that the coalition Government do not fully appreciate the work done by
the units. I spent 25 days with North Wales police on a police
parliamentary scheme. I visited many units, including the helicopter
unit, the dog unit, armed response, port police and traffic police. I
spent a whole day—sometimes two or three days—with each
unit, and they did fantastic work. They are responding to strategic
national initiatives. We need to apprehend terrorists at the port. We
need to respond in a timely fashion with our armed response units. We
need to reduce the number of road deaths every year. When I have been
out with those brave officers, such as the traffic police, they go to
the most stressful situations we can imagine, where there have been
multiple deaths on the motorways, dual carriageways and country lanes.
They deal with the death of children or sometimes the death of whole
families. To say that they are wasting their time responding to Labour
Government initiatives is wrong. They are brave people doing excellent
work.<a class="bkMark" name="11020872000200">&#160;</a>

spent two days with the port police at Holyhead. Again, they were doing
excellent work combating the trafficking of drugs and child and adult
prostitutes. They are responding to national targets and doing a great
job. The North Wales police helicopter has saved dozens of lives. We
are not talking about people twiddling their thumbs. They are
professional people doing a professional job. If they read extracts

importance of specialist units. Of course they are important parts of
what police forces do, but that is a quite different question from the
extent to which they are resourced, or resourced efficiently. The
inspectorate raised that issue when it pointed out that there was a
problem with visibility and availability, which vary between forces.
That is a crucial point, because some forces have higher visibility and
availability than others. If we can bring up the standard to that of
the best forces, we would improve visibility and availability within
existing resources.<a class="bkMark" name="11020872000203">&#160;</a>

argue that antisocial behaviour, which people regard as an incredibly
important issue, is a national threat. They are both problems that
police forces must deal with, but the clause relates to crimes that
cross force boundaries and that therefore require interoperability on

intention is clear. The provision relates to crimes that require a
national response, but that response will be delivered by individual
police forces. We need to take care before taking the requirement into
areas that are about significant crimes that are committed in local
areas and that require local responses entirely from an individual
police force, irrespective of the actions of neighbouring
forces.<a class="bkMark" name="11020872000210">&#160;</a>

the concern raised by the hon. Member for Birmingham, Selly Oak that
the provision might be centralising, I say again that it is acceptable
for the Secretary of State to make such an arrangement because we will
strengthen the local accountability of policing but not interfere in
matters that should be for local determination. In that sense, the
provision rebalances the proper role of the centre—not to
interfere in the local, but to pay more attention to areas where police

to the terrorist threat the development of policing capability across
forces. It is perfectly possible to argue that that cuts across the
normal local operation of forces, but the threat is regarded as
sufficiently serious to merit it—I do not think that there is
any dispute about that. That, together with serious and organised crime
and other issues that cross force boundaries, is the kind of territory
that we should be talking about. That is the purpose of the clause, and
it has been drafted in such a way to ensure that it meets the
threshold. It is not intended to license a foray by a future Secretary
of State to return to the bad centralising ways of the previous
Government through the abuse of the provision. However, I am grateful

who represent the views of local policing bodies—police and
crime commissioners. As far as our consultation is concerned, we are
already discussing the issues with relevant people, including SOCA, and
it is important that we do so. The provision will not require a
statutory instrument, so there is no proposal for formal parliamentary
scrutiny, but this is something of sufficient interest that we would
consult on the

they collaborate and set up provisions for collaboration agreements. My
view is that we are going to strengthen the requirement in the Bill to
ensure that forces collaborate so that we will have 43 forces that are
vertically integrated and responsible for policing in their own areas.
Police and crime commissioners will be responsible for the totality of
policing and for holding forces to account by ensuring that there is
interoperability and minimum standards for issues that cross force
boundaries and when national threats exist. I think that that is the
right and appropriate balance, and I think it is a welcome, novel and

the intention behind clause 84(2), which removes the requirement for
inspectors of constabulary to report to the Secretary of State? The
intention might be that inspectors will report for the benefit of the
public at large, which I can understand, but should not the Secretary
of State be concerned about what is stated in HMIC reports? Reporting
for the benefit of the public is fine, but presumably the Secretary of
State will receive the report anyway.<a class="bkMark" name="11020872000231">&#160;</a>

has not been replicated in its functions to inspect local policing

                           </strong> The purpose of the clause is to ensure that the
inspectorate of constabulary becomes independent of police forces and
of the Government. In the past, the inspectorate has enjoyed quite a
close relationship with both. In the spirit of transparency, proper
governance and accountability—the themes running through the
Bill—we are sure that it is right for the inspectorate to be a
fearless body that serves the public and ensures that forces are
delivering on efficiency, effectiveness and value for
money.<a class="bkMark" name="11020872000233">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">That
is the basis of the changes we set out in the Bill. That is why we made
the change about reporting to the Secretary of State. One
provision still ensures that the inspectors must send a copy of their
reports to the Secretary of State—in answer to the question of
the hon. Member for Gedling, of course they will still do
that—but we are seeking to change the previous practice whereby
the inspectorate had a close relationship with the Government. Indeed,
the chief inspector of constabulary was the Home Secretary’s
formal adviser on
policing.<a class="bkMark" name="11020872000234">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> We want to ensure that we move away from the
practice of the inspectorate exercising any kind of performance
management of local policing, whether by accident or design. The reason
is that the police forces will be accountable to the police and crime
commissioners for delivery at a local level. We do not want the
inspectorate to judge whether the police and crime commissioner has
been successful, because that is for the public to do. I want the
inspectorate to judge the effectiveness of the police force, and for
that professional opinion to inform the public’s judgment of the
police and crime commissioner.<a class="bkMark" name="11020872000238">&#160;</a>

trying to achieve proper distinction between roles. We are ensuring
against the inspectorate becoming a body that confuses the importance
of revealing what is happening and, therefore, producing reports upon
which elected officials can act, with managing performance, which I do
not think that the inspectorate should do. That close performance
management, by any of the national bodies, has created such
interference in the delivery of local policing. We need to achieve a
change, so that we give the professionals the space and discretion to
do their job, but hold them to account for the delivery. That is what
we seek to achieve in the new
arrangements.<a class="bkMark" name="11020872000239">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Again, this is an important clause. It introduces
schedule 11, which deals with crime and disorder strategies, which in
turn have formed an interesting part of our discussions on part 1 of
the Bill. I wonder whether the Minister could explain his thinking
about why it is the case that police and crime commissioners are not
members of the community safety partnerships. Why not? If they are not
members of those partnerships, has the Minister envisaged how they will
know what is going on? The Minister might say that they will do so
through the police and crime panels and he might add, “If the
hon. Member reads the schedule, it does say 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 507<a class="bkMark" name="Column507">&#160;</a>
                           </div>they can have meetings as appropriate, request information” and
all those sorts of things. I know all that, but it is still quite
difficult to understand how the police and crime commissioners will
know exactly what is going on in every community safety partnership in
a manner that will allow them to inform themselves of all the different
problems, particularly when they cover such huge areas.<a class="bkMark" name="11020872000251">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It might be
that the Minister should consider one other suggestion that people have
made in respect of the membership of the police and crime panel. The
Minister will say it is a matter for local discretion, and such like,
but the councillor who has lead responsibility for community safety
might be the most appropriate person to be on the police and crime
panel. In that way, there would be a link between the police and crime
commissioner, the police and crime panel and the community safety
partnership. If that is not the case, there will have to be another
means by which that can
happen.<a class="bkMark" name="11020872000252">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
think this is quite an important part of the Bill. The Minister knows
that, whatever our discussions and disagreements about accountability,
one of my great concerns is that I do not believe that an
accountability problem exists at force level. It often exists at
neighbourhood level, and as the police and crime commissioner is not
required to be a member of the community safety partnership, there is a
real issue of how we plug that gap to overcome the possibility to that
deficit, and ensure that the commissioner is plugged into those
partnerships.<a class="bkMark" name="11020872000253">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> My general response to the hon. Gentleman is to
agree about the importance of community safety partnerships and the
role that PCCs should play in that regard. As I have said before, PCCs
having a wider responsibility for community safety is important. We
made this change because it is not practical that the PCC should be
directly represented on each partnership. If we take the example of
Thames Valley, which has the largest number of authorities covered
within a force area, it would require 18 different partnerships. The
powers are set out in the clause to bring these partnerships up to
force level. Others may attend in relation to local police
representation on those panels, as happens now.<a class="bkMark" name="11020872000254">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There are
provisions in the Bill, as the hon. Member for Gedling noted, for
acquiring information from the partnerships. The role of the police and
crime panel is also important, because each council will nominate a
member to that panel. It may well make sense that the lead councillor
on community safety in each area sits as the representative on the PCP.
That sounds like a sensible arrangement, but it should be determined at
a local level—we should not prescribe that. Our general
philosophy on these local arrangements for partnerships is to be less
prescriptive and to allow arrangements, which work for that local
community, to evolve at the local level. We do not stand in the way of
the lead councillor sitting as the representative—there is
clearly a lot of sense in that—but I do not wish to prescribe
it. I want to put on the record that the strong engagement of a PCC
with community safety partnerships will be very important, but that is
not the same as saying that they have to have formal representation on
them.<a class="bkMark" name="11020872000255">&#160;</a>

rolls out, the relationship between the PCC and the PCP in community

will be chief constables with an office, police and crime commissioners

partnerships. Making all that link together will be

                           </strong> Yes is the answer. They must behave in a
reasonable and proportionate way. As for the hon. Gentleman’s
wider point that we have police and crime panels, police and crime
commissioners and community and safety partnerships: we already have
police authorities and community and safety partnerships. It could be a
great deal worse, because under his proposal, we would have police
authorities with elected chairs and community and safety partnerships.
We therefore have to recognise that local authorities have an important
and continuing role, and that the governance of policing is related to
that, but separate. That is why it is important to have a police and
crime panel as well as community safety partnerships. There are clearly
opportunities to ensure that the same individuals are involved. The
cost of the police and crime panels should not be the factor that the
hon. Gentleman fears. We are making provision for the cost of a
scrutiny officer, but I do not see why police and crime panels as a
scrutiny body should be costly bodies because their responsibility is
not to hold the force to account, but to scrutinise the police and
crime
commissioner.<a class="bkMark" name="11020872000262">&#160;</a>

to be a good thing. Are existing collaboration agreements specified
under legislation, which the clause will change or will such agreements
be new? I apologise to the Minister for not knowing the present
position. What is the difference between the sort of informal
arrangements that exist between police forces that are usually agreed

need to specify such arrangements in such a

such an effect is not the case. Let me clarify the position. Clause 90
and schedule 12 bring the existing legislation on police collaboration
agreements, which is provided for in section 23 of the Police Act 1996,
into line with the introduction of police and crime commissioners, and
the key role that they will play in driving collaborative working in
the interests of efficient and effective policing. Not all members of
the Committee will agree about the importance of collaboration between
forces. In its report, “Valuing the Police”, which we
have already discussed today, the inspectorate made it clear that
collaboration has not proceeded at a fast enough pace. It is important
that this is driven not only in the interests of securing greater value
for money but to secure more effective
policing.<p class="tabbed">We

introducing proposed new section 22A, the clause replaces
the current requirement for separate collaboration agreements between
police authorities and between chief constables with a single agreement
that can include them both, with the addition that other
parties—for example, local authorities—may be
included.<a class="bkMark" name="11020872000276">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Secondly,
it sets out in proposed new sections 22B and 22C a strong duty for both
police and crime commissioners and chief constables to collaborate
where it would be in the interest of efficiency or effectiveness.
Thirdly, it introduces in proposed new section 23FA a new power for the
Home Secretary to specify by order particular policing functions that
must be provided collaboratively by all forces, supporting the
service’s call for a stronger co-ordinating drive from the
centre on collaboration in areas of strategic importance. It remains
the case that police and crime commissioners are responsible for the
totality of policing in their
areas.<a class="bkMark" name="11020872000277">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

                           </strong> The issue is not just collaboration between
forces, which is important, and the Minister is right to try to drive
greater collaboration on back-office functions and other policing
functions. Is there anything in the arrangements that tries to deal
with the gap that has always existed between the national and the
local? The merger debate was about trying to introduce a regional tier,
whatever the rights and wrongs of it. Is there anything in the
collaboration arrangements whereby the collaborative arrangement
between some police forces to provide operational capability can link
more effectively to, for example—in 2013—the national
crime agency? The lack of regional capability in the national agencies
has often been the
problem.<a class="bkMark" name="11020872000278">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> That goes back more to the debate about the
strategic policing requirement. In future, the national crime agency
and other agencies can be part of collaboration agreements, so that
answers the question directly.<a class="bkMark" name="11020872000279">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I agree with
the hon. Gentleman about the importance of closing the gap. We may have
disagreed in the past about force mergers, but the reality is that they
will not happen. I do not believe that the current
House of Commons would vote for force mergers. Even if we, the
Government, took the view that forced mergers—compulsory
mergers—were a good idea, and we do not, I do not believe that
there is support for
them.<a class="bkMark" name="11020872000280">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
is essential that we move on from that debate and recognise that 43
forces will continue to exist—by and large, and excepting one or
two voluntary mergers which might take place. Therefore, we must
address the areas in which it is important that the forces collaborate
more effectively, to improve value for money and to secure more
effective policing. The provisions are sensible and will enable that. I
hope that we will see, even before the legislation is passed,
collaboration proceeding at a greater pace than it has until
now.<a class="bkMark" name="11020872000281">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I recognise the clear logic in what the Minister
is trying to achieve, but if he intends to retain 43 forces, by and
large, at what level will he continue to insist on collaboration? It
would be possible, by insisting on a high level of collaboration, to
come perilously close to reducing the number of forces. What is to
prevent that from happening as a result of the measures in the
Bill?<a class="bkMark" name="11020872000282">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I doubt very much that the public have a problem
with the idea of their forces collaborating, in particular on
back-office functions that members of the public never see, but even on
certain operational functions, such as the specialist units we were
talking
about.<a class="bkMark" name="11020872000283">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
landed at Luton airport recently and a police vehicle outside was
marked “Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire Protective
Services”. I was not a supporter of a merger between the
Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire forces, because it did not have local
political consent. For that reason, a merger was never a runner in my
view, and so I would not be drawn into enforcing mergers that I did not
think were accepted by at least one of the counties and their local
political representatives. However, nothing need stop those forces
collaborating more closely in such areas. I think that that would
receive public support, in particular if it could save money and ensure
that the front line is
protected.<a class="bkMark" name="11020872000284">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
do not have a problem with stronger collaboration and I do not believe
that the public do either. What the public want to see is local
political accountability, and they fear a loss of such accountability.
The creation of more distant units underlay much of the public anxiety
about ever-larger police forces, which is why I thought that the
previous Government were on the wrong
track.<a class="bkMark" name="11020872000285">&#160;</a>

one or two points that I wish to make. It would be churlish of me not
to congratulate the Minister on clause 92, which ensures that the
existing powers of the Secretary of State to give directions to failing
police forces or police authorities continue to apply in relation to
police forces, and to police and crime commissioners. I searched the
Bill to find where the Secretary of State had the power to step in,
should all else fail. I thought that the Minister was so localising
that he would desperately be trying to avoid that, and felt sure that I
would not find such a provision. But then we reach clause 92 and the
Secretary of State retains the power to give
directions.<a class="bkMark" name="11020872000298">&#160;</a>

the Home Office and everyone is running around, I am afraid that they
will not say that, under the localism agenda, things are not down to
him. TV cameras and everyone will be queuing at the Minister’s
door and the Home Secretary’s door asking what they are going to

statistics and such things. I suppose they are not much use. I then
think, “My goodness, the Minister will not require crime stats.
He is not going to require reports to find out what is going
on”, but then I remember clauses 92 and 93, under which the
Secretary of State retains powers to require certain
things.<a class="bkMark" name="11020872000305">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
read under clause 93 that the Secretary of State can require different
things from the chief constable. I am not about to ask a stupid
question, given what the first part of the clause states, but can the
Minister confirm that the Secretary of State will still require crime
statistics to be collected nationally so that we can know what is
happening with crime not only at a local level, but nationally? Is it
the right hon. Gentleman’s intention that there will still be a
national collection of crime statistics even though the Bill states
that a chief officer “may” be required and so on? It is
important that the position is
clarified.<a class="bkMark" name="11020872000306">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Yes, I am happy to reassure the hon. Gentleman.
It is essential that we have such information and that the public have
confidence in the information. That is why we have asked the national
statistician to conduct an independent review of the crime statistics
to see if we can arrive at a measure that will command the support of
both sides of the House. I want to take the opportunity to say to the
hon. Member for Gedling that there have been fierce exchanges about
crime statistics over the past few years, and the Government are
absolutely genuine in their wish to move on and see whether we can
arrive at an agreed
measure.<a class="bkMark" name="11020872000307">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
national statistician has asked the Opposition for meetings to discuss
her review, and it is my earnest hope that we can arrive at a measure
that has cross-party agreement and addresses the particular
deficiencies regarding the recorded crime figures and the British crime
survey. That would considerably aid public debate. The hon. Gentleman
and I have had this exchange briefly before in a Westminster Hall
debate, but I want to repeat it because I think it is
important.<a class="bkMark" name="11020872000308">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Those
statistics are not the only means by which the public are going to find
out about crime. A week ago, we launched national crime mapping. Since
the launch of police.uk a week ago, the website has received
310 million hits. It has a hit rate of 15,000 to 20,000 a
minute, which is the equivalent of 900,000 to 1.2 million hits an hour.
The public appetite for localised crime information is immense, and
that is another means by which we are going to provide information that
the public can value and trust, although I reiterate that that is not
the only means. National crime statistics remain important, and we must
try to build confidence in them. I urge the hon. Gentleman and the
official Opposition to join the process of reaching an agreed measure
so that we can stop the partisan debate about the
statistics.<a class="bkMark" name="11020872000309">&#160;</a>

there are registrars in each force. Separately, there are other

inspectorate has been looking at what exactly is collected. There are
issues related to antisocial behaviour and how that data are collected.

the provisional arrangements on moving from the current police

ensure that. I am confident that we will meet the concerns that the

legislative provision which, immediately before the relevant
commencement day, applied to chief constables of police forces
maintained under section 2 of the Police Act 1996 is to apply in the
same way to chief constables established under section 2 of this Act
(except where the context otherwise
requires).(2) Any relevant
legislative provision which, immediately before the relevant
commencement day, applied to the Commissioner of Police of the
Metropolis is to apply in the same way to the Commissioner of Police of
the Metropolis established under section 4 of this Act (except where
the context otherwise
requires).(3) Sub-paragraphs
(1) and (2) are subject to any provision to the contrary
made—(a) by or under
this Act, or(b) by any other
Act passed, or subordinate legislation made, on or after the passing of
this Act.(4) In this
paragraph—“relevant
commencement day”
means—(a) in relation
to sub-paragraph (1), the day on which section2 comes into
force;(b) in relation to
sub-paragraph (2), the day on which section4 comes into
force;“relevant
legislative provision”
means—(a) provision of
an Act made before the relevant commencement day,
or(b) provision of an
instrument made before the relevant commencement day under a public
general Act which is of a legislative
character;but provision which
applies only to specified chief constables of police forces maintained
under section 2 of the Police Act 1996 is not relevant legislative
provision.’.<p class="tabbed">This
is a technical amendment to clarify the application of existing
legislation to chief officers after the Bill comes into force. As the
Committee knows, we do not intend to change the fundamental powers and
duties of chief officers, but we will change their legal status by
making them corporations sole, so that they can employ staff in their
official rather than in their personal capacities. Without this
amendment, the change in legal status could lead to doubt as to whether
the many existing references to chief officers in legislation continued

that they applied to chief officers as constituted under the Police Act
1996. Clearly, we would wish to avoid any
uncertainty as to whether the chief officers continue to have all the
statutory powers and duties that they have now. I trust that the
amendment will meet with the approval of the Committee. It is necessary

As I said at the time, if he thinks there is a better way to prevent
police and crime commissioners from employing political advisers, I
would be happy to consider it. I want to make it clear that it always
was the policy intent—it was in the Bill and our
response document—that PCCs should not have political advisers.
I am grateful that the Opposition have recognised that, because for
some considerable time they were continuing to allege that that was
going to be permitted under the Bill. We decided that it should not be
so permitted. That is important, because of the nature of these

copy.<a class="bkMark" name="11020872000363">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
should point out that clause 99, which gives effect  to
schedule 15, relates to minor and consequential amendments. It would
not be good use of the Committee’s time to consider each
amendment individually, which is why we think it better to table a new
clause and schedule giving effect to the revised
provisions.<a class="bkMark" name="11020872000364">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
am happy to debate the new content when the new clause and new schedule
are tabled. The change is to assist the Committee, and I reiterate that
the amendments are minor and consequential. I somehow doubt that the
hon. Gentleman intended to speak to them in any
case.<a class="bkMark" name="11020872000365">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> My long experience suggests that minor and
consequential amendments are minor and consequential 99.9% of the time,
but somewhere, usually, is tucked away something quite significant.

                           </strong> Just for clarity, does defining crime and disorder
reduction negate anything to do with clause 79, on the strategic
policing requirement? The question is serious. Is the clause stating
only what “crime and disorder reduction” means
wherever it is mentioned? Does it have any broader
definition?<a class="bkMark" name="11020872000369">&#160;</a>
