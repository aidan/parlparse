</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Tom Brake </B>(Carshalton and Wallington): I beg to 
move amendment No. 31, in page 5, line 3, leave out from 
"time"	 to end of line 5.
<P>
The purpose of the amendment is to remove the 
12-month limit. The 12-months during which people have 
either to accept or to decline a water meter is an arbitrary 
period. It is certainly not sufficiently long for people to 
gain a clear understanding of what their water bills are 
likely to be with a meter, because the use of water from 
one year to the next may vary significantly, depending on 
how hot or otherwise the weather is. If the limit were 
removed, people would be able over a longer period to 
establish clearly whether having a water meter was to 
their advantage.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will be willing to accept the 
amendment on those grounds alone, but it would also help 
to reduce the possibility of creeping metering. Under the 
Bill as drafted, once people have accepted their meter, 
that will be it, they will be stuck with it. If the limit were 
withdrawn, consumers would have a much longer period 
in which to assess the meter, and so some of those who 
initially thought that they wanted to stay with a meter 
might revert to non-metered charges.
<P>
The amendment is straightforward, and I hope that the 
Government will be willing to support it. Removing the 
12-month limit will allow consumers a longer period in 
which to establish whether there are advantages to water 
metering, and I hope that the Minister will respond 
positively to the amendment.
<P>
<B>The Minister for the Environment (Mr. Michael </B><P>
Meacher): I understand the purpose of the amendment, 
which the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington 
(Mr. Brake) has made clear. The hon. Gentleman wants 
an increase in customer choice which is a key theme of 
the Bill, and to which I am most sympathetic. He said 
that his second motive was the desire to reduce creeping 
metering, as I think he called it. I am not sure that I go 
along with that, because I believe that for significant 
sections of the population, including some poorer 
people for example, elderly people who use very little 
water, metering may well be an advantage,
<P>
On Second Reading and in Committee, we have spoken 
about the importance of ensuring that the water charging 
system provides sufficient water for essential needs to 
everybody at a fair and affordable price. I am sure that 
that is universally accepted. However, we are also aware 
of the water industry's needs. As I keep saying, it is a 
matter of striking a balance between the two. If the water 
industry is to function efficiently, it must be aware of its 
source of revenue; it must be able to predict pretty 
accurately what revenues it will receive in a given period. 
That is necessary for water companies properly to plan 
their investment, but it is also important to consumers, 
who expect to know what they will have to pay for their 
water.



<P>
I assure the hon. Member for Carshalton and 
Wallington that we have thought a good deal about the 
provisions that relate to consumers switching between 
measured and unmeasured charging. As regards the 
12-month period, we could have chosen a different period. 
It is a matter if judgment as to what is right.
<P>
The amendment raises an important point about the 
right that we are giving consumers under the Bill to have 
a meter fitted. I want briefly to explain why we have 
included the right to revert to an unmeasured charge in 
the Bill before I explain why we have deliberately time 
limited it.
<P>
Paying for water on a measured basis might be 
attractive to some people, such as those who live on their 
own and who are likely to use only limited amounts of 
water. There is evidence that people who pay on a 
measured basis are more economical with water and use 
perhaps up to 10 per cent. less.
<P>
The right that we are introducing to revert to an 
unmeasured charge is in line with the focus of the Bill 
another piece of consumer protection. One way of looking 
at it is to compare it with the protection that is given 
under consumer credit legislation. Under such legislation, 
consumers can change their minds about a product or 
service for which they have paid within a specified period.
<P>
The hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington asked 
why we want to time limit the right to revert. Our answer 
is that it is right to strike a balance between providing 
greater choice for consumers and ensuring stability in 
water charging. We are keen to ensure that there is a 
proper balance between customer choice and certainty 
about future bills. Our view I cannot prove that this is 
exactly right is that a period of about a year provides 
the right balance between adequate consumer protection 
and providing water companies with certainty about future 
revenues. As a result, it provides consumers with certainty 
about the level of their bills.
<P>
For that reason, the right to revert is important. If there 
is to be stability and an assurance for water companies, 
however, that right has to be time limited. A year is a 
reasonable period. The hon. Gentleman said that it was 
not sufficiently long for consumers to make a measured 
judgment about whether metering was appropriate for 
them. I disagree a year is long enough. For those 
reasons, I hope that he understands the rationale behind 
the Bill and will not press his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Donald Gorrie (Edinburgh, West):</B> We are not 
wholly impressed by the Minister's reply, but this is not 
one of the issues that we shall press to a vote. When the 
Bill is implemented and activities can be monitored, the 
12-month period might be seen as too short and 
consumers might want to change back beyond it. I hope 
that the Government would then consider making a small 
change in the future. Only time wil tell whether 12 months 
is adequate for budgetary calculations.
<P>
The Minister raised one other point. He suggested that 
metering reduced water use. Some of the briefing papers 
that we received from interested bodies argued that quite 
a few people used more water after their consumption was 
metered. They were not great users of water, and metering 
reduced their costs so much compared with what they paid 
under the rateable value that they could waste a lot more 
water and still be charged less than they were before.
I am not entirely sure whether the Minister's point stands 
up. Although we have a good point, we will not press it 
to a vote.



<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I shall respond to the hon. Member for 
Edinburgh, West (Mr. Gorrie), who made a reasonably 
understanding comment. Perhaps I can reciprocate by 
saying that we will closely examine the impact of the Bill. 
If our judgment is that 12 months is significantly too short 
a time, we will consider the provision again to see how 
we can amend it. I doubt whether that will be necessary, 
for the reasons that I have given. The point of allowing 
reversion within 12 months is to encourage people to 
move to metering who might be fearful of finding it to be 
a more expensive system. Such people might at least be 
willing to try metering if they are given a reasonable trial 
period to understand the effects.
<P>
Reversion is not an innovation in the Bill. It is already 
practised by a number of companies, and provides 
comfort to customers. Experience in industry shows that 
when companies have provided the right to revert, very 
few people have gone back to unmeasured charging. That 
is the philosophy behind the clause, and we shall watch 
the effects carefully. If we have seriously miscalculated 
them, we are prepared to consider how we can make 
amends.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brake:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the 
amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Clause 6 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 7</center></H4>
<H4><center>Restriction on change in basis of charging</center></H4>
<P>
<B> <p5>Mr. Brake:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 32, in page 
6, leave out lines 20 to 27.



<P>
This is a probing amendment that seeks clarification. 
Lines 20 to 27 imply that if someone moving into a house 
has not received a first bill, he or she can receive a 
metered bill without requesting it. If my understanding is 
correct, that provision is against the spirit of what the Bill 
is seeking to achieve. Is my understanding correct, or does 
the clause contain a small drafting problem?
<P>
<B>Mr. Oliver Letwin </B>(West Dorset): This is indeed a 
probing amendment, because it draws to the Committee's 
attention the extraordinary contrast between what the 
Minister and his Friends actually practise and what they 
claim to practise when they preach the gospel of horror 
at the suggestion that Opposition Members might want a 
movement to full-scale metering. I read lines 20 to 27 in 
exactly the same spirit as the hon. Members for 
Carshalton and Wallington and for Edinburgh, West.
I cannot see how anyone could read them differently, but
I wait to be surprised by the Minister's response. I have 
taken the trouble of asking a leading counsel of my 
acquaintance whether he would read them differently, and 
he informed me that he would not. I wait to be even more 
surprised, if it turns out that the magisterial weight of the 
legal advice available to the Minister is that the clause 
reads in another way.
<P>
If our reading is correct, the clause is part of the 
impressive ratchet device that I have already mentioned. 
The turnover of housing is high, and higher in some parts 
of the country than in others. Labour Members from urban 
constituencies will be especially aware of the very high 
turnover in many areas. If the clause is to be read as it 
was by the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington, 
it will rapidly move people to metering on its own. The 
Minister has carefully featherbedded people who see 
themselves as likely to have lower bills as a result of 
metering that goes back to the discussion on the 
previous clause to ensure that they are willing to take 
the leap and go for metering in the knowledge that they 
can revert within 12 months. It seems likely that the 
Minister has been cautious in his estimates, and that that 
combination of factors could double, triple or quadruple 
the current rate of movement from one basis of charging 
to another.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
I have drawn that conclusion, while standing to be 
corrected by the Minister's Department, whose staff are 
very knowledgeable about such matters, because I believe 
that the average turnover of housing in the United Kingdom 
is several percentage points each year. If one adds to that 
the leap that people are voluntarily making towards 
metering and compares it with the 1, 2 or 3 per cent. of 
movement towards metering that the Minister described as 
the current annual average, a 7, 8, 9 or 10 per cent. change 
may occur each year. That would lead, pretty remorselessly 
over a 10-year period, to something like universal metering. 
Is that the Minister's intent? Does he envisage that ratchet 
effect? It would be helpful if he would clarify that. The 
Minister appears at least to have committed the drafting sin 
of not being clear to the layman. That is undoubtedly how 
the combination of provisions in clauses 6 and 7 would 
appear to any normal, uninformed observer.
<P>
If it is the Minister's intent to create such a ratchet, he 
should not accuse Conservative Members, in tones of 
horror, of foreseeing a time when, with due allowance for 
sensitivity such as the Bill provides, there would be 
almost universal metering. That brings us face to face with 
the point that the Minister wants the kind of economic 
transparency that is involved in metering to be extended. 
He rightly pointed out it was a most enlightened 
remark that that will also have an environmentally 
sensitive effect, because it will give people an incentive 
not to use so much water. However, the Minister does 
not want other kinds of transparency, and would therefore 
appear to be convicting himself of a certain degree of 
inconsistency between his approach to metering and his 
approach to charging. That is odd, as under the Bill 
metering is, by and large, to be the basis for charging 
in future.

<P>

<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> The hon. Member for West Dorset (Mr. 
Letwin), who always argues his case well, seems to take 
the view that there is a sinister or dark agenda behind the 
Bill in this instance, that we are ratcheting up the 
number of people who will use metering. He was arguing 
just before lunch that the only proper way to charge was 
on the basis of relating revenues and costs precisely in 
other words, as I was at pains to say, he was looking to 
the Government to meter universally. He cannot seem to 
make up his mind whether he wants metering to be 
universal or whether he wants to accuse us of ratcheting 
up the amount. I really think that he should make up his 
mind.



<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> Mischievous.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> It could be, as my hon. Friend the 
Member for West Chelmsford suggests, that the Minister 
is being mischievous. However, it is more likely that he 
was attending to other matters while I was speaking.
<P>
I am not saying that there is any deep and mysterious 
plot, nor that there is anything wrong with ratcheting 
gradually towards metering. There is, however, something 
wrong with the Minister speaking in tones of horror about 
Conservative Members' desire to see a gradual move 
towards metering when he is performing that very move 
himself. I am drawing attention to the {**au1,2**}{**xuMinister's 
inconsistency rather than objecting to his policy.
<p5**}Mr. Meacher: I made it clear that the Government  support a gradual move towards metering as long as that  is consistent with a measure of consumer choice and  protection for those who move into new homes who might  not be able to afford the cost of metering I repeat again:  people with particular medical needs, people on low  incomes or people with a significant number of children. <P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> Perhaps I might seek clarification. When 
the Minister said, just now, that he foresaw the move 
towards metering and quoted the exceptions of some of 
the more vulnerable members of society, was he 
envisaging that the move towards metering would occur 
voluntarily?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> As I am sure that the hon. Gentleman 
understands from reading the Bill, those people who move 
into new homes 
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> I am sorry, but the right hon. Gentleman 
misunderstands. I am not talking about the Bill I am 
very familiar with what it says. However, the Minister 
seemed to be speaking about the future and what would 
happen after the legislation was implemented. He spoke 
about a move towards metering, and gave the impression 
that over time the whole country would probably end up 
with meters, except possibly a number of specified groups 
of people who were vulnerable or had special needs, 
whom he mentioned. In the context of those comments, 
does the right hon. Gentleman envisage that move to be 
voluntary, or does he expect the Government of the day 
to force it?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> The Government of the day, who are 
currently in power, do not intend to force it. I cannot of 
course speak about any future Government of a different 
complexion, if there is one in the next millenium.
<P>
Perhaps, instead of bandying remarks with Members on 
the Opposition Front Bench, I could turn to the sane and 
sensible points made by Liberal Democrat Members. The 
Government are proposing to end compulsory universal 
meeting of homes by giving consumers the new rights in 
clause 7. No one will be able to have a measured charge 
imposed on them in their present home where they are 
using water only for normal and essential purposes. 
However, the situation is different when a person moves 
into a new home. New occupiers are starting afresh; the 
numbers are significant, year by year. They do not have 
an established habit of water consumption and method of 
paying charges in the new home; it is the start of a new 
situation. I believe that, in those circumstances, it is 
reasonable to allow the water undertaker to change the 
basis of charging if it wishes to start a new occupier on a 
fresh basis of charging from the first bill in their new 
home. I emphasise that last point. We are allowing the 
company that one window of opportunity only a point 
that is significant in relation to the amendment. If the 
water company has begun to bill the new occupier on 
an unmeasured basis of charging, that occupier will have 
established just the same right to remain on an 
unmeasured basis of charging as their predecessor. That 
is important.
<P>
The proposal to assist vulnerable groups by passing 
regulations under clause 5 was discussed this morning, 
and I need not go through the arguments again. As was 
outlined in the debate on clause 6, we consider that the 
Bill strikes a fair balance between providing greater 
choice for consumers and ensuring stability in water 
charging. This is a repeated theme of the Bill. I commend 
that approach to the Committee, and hope that the hon. 
Member for Carshalton and Wallington has been 
persuaded to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> Will the right hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I have completed my remarks.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The Minister has finished 
speaking. Mr. Burns.




<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> I was going to make a brief point that I 
hoped that the Minister would answer. In his winding-up 
speech, he spoke proudly about how the Bill would give 
greater choice to the consumer. There is a contradiction 
in terms in that claim. Under these provisions, when 
someone moves house and before the first bill arrives, it 
is the water company that has the window of opportunity 
and freedom of choice to decide whether the water will 
be on a meter or on a rateable value charge, not the 
customer. That restricts choice.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset was 
absolutely right, despite the Minister's comments. That is 
a back door ratcheting up of water metering whatever 
one wants to call it, that is in effect what it is. There is 
not much choice for a consumer moving into a new home. 
The Minister can answer that rather weakly by saying, 
"Caveat emptor"	, and logically, he is right. Anyone who 
is about to move to a new home 
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Or any home.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> Indeed, any home will know before he 
buys that there will be a choice: the water company may, 
before the first water bill, be charging water on a metered 
basis or on rateable value. I bet my bottom dollar and I 
suspect that if the Department for the Environment, 
Transport and the Regions has done any surveys, its 
statistics show that the water companies will grab that 
opportunity to push in a meter.
<P>
Given the choice and freedom of the consumer, what 
would happen if a couple in their early 40s with four 
teenage children moved into a house of, say, an average 
rateable value? I imagine that that household would 
definitely want to move into a house where water bills 
were paid under the rateable value system rather than via 
a meter. The Minister cannot blithely say that the Bill 
gives greater choice to consumers and customers, because 
this is a classic example of the contrary.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman :</B> Order. Before the Minister winds up 
yet again, perhaps the hon. Member for Carshalton and 
Wallington wants to speak.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brake:</B> I am disappointed with the Ministers 
response. His party campaigned vociferously against 
metering in the run up to the last general election, yet 
these lines go against the spirit of everything that the 
Minister has said in relation to metering. We are talking 
not about passive metering but about an active metering 
policy, which the water companies will, of course, jump 
on. They will see their opportunity and take advantage of 
it. We will therefore push the amendment to a vote.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I intervene briefly to ask a simple 
question, to which I am sure the Minister will know the 
answer. What is his estimate of the total number of people 
who will be on meters 10 years from now, should the 
water companies exercise that prerogative? It is an easy 
mathematical calculation if the Minister knows, as I am 
sure that he does, the average turnover of housing in the 
United Kingdom and makes some set of assumptions 
about the extent to which that is the same set of people 
recirculating through single houses.
<P>
The answer would be illuminating for Committee 
members, and I will eat some object such as my hat if, 10 
years from now, the figure is much less than 50 per cent. 
The right hon. Gentleman jolly well ought to be able to 
give us an answer, because his Bill will have such an 
effect and clearly, he ought to know the extent of it.



<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> To take the last point first, I cannot give 
that precise figure. The hon. Member for West Dorset 
knows the basis on which it might be calculated as well 
as I. It is not a purely mathematical calculation, because 
it depends on the rate at which people move and, as the 
hon. Gentleman said, the extent to which they move back 
to their own homes although there will be few such 
cases.
<P>
We have never said that there would not be an increase 
in metering. Indeed, I think that I said on Second Reading 
that there would probably be some acceleration in the rate 
of metering, which at the moment is very small there is 
an increase of about 1 or 2 per cent. a year. The overall 
figure is now 14 per cent. across the country, 10 years 
after privatisation. That rate may well increase slightly.
I would point out to "disgusted of Tunbridge Wells"	, or 
rather the disgusted Liberal Democrat Member for 
Carshalton and Wallington, that we did not say before the 
election that there would be no increase in metering; we 
said that we were opposed to compulsory universal 
metering, and that position is reflected in the Bill 
[Interruption.] I know what the hon. Member for West 
Chelmsford is going to say that in the next 150 years, 
we shall be there anyway.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> Will the right hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I shall sit down in a moment and listen. 
There will be a gradual increase in metering. That is 
entirely consistent with what we have said. I must tell the 
hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington that there is 
nothing wrong with that. It is not the case that an increase 
in metering is somehow bad. There are some people for 
whom it is an advantage, especially those who live alone 
such as a number of elderly people and some people on 
low incomes. It is wrong to suggest that any increase in 
metering is a great disadvantage and that the Government 
are letting people down. We will protect those people who 
find, as a result of moving, that they are metered and at a 
disadvantage because they are in a vulnerable group.
<P>
We are trying to get the best of all worlds. Some 
metering will benefit people in general, but those who are 
in a vulnerable group and for whom a meter is detrimental 
will be protected. However, it would be wrong to impose 
a limit on metering or to say that there should be no 
metering. That would be a severe disadvantage to many 
consumers.

<P>

<B>Mr. Brake:</B> Will the Minister clarify that he is not 
against metering in principle, but that he is just against 
compulsory metering?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> That is the case. We have never 
suggested anything else. I am not saying that we are 
against metering in principle, for the reasons that I have 
given. Metering will benefit many people. I do not know 
how many millions of people live alone, but a large 
proportion of those will almost certainly gain from 
metering. If the hon. Gentleman told them that we want 
to prohibit the use of a meter, which seems to be Liberal 
Democrat policy, they would be extremely disquieted. 
Our policy is that there should be a gradual increase in 
metering and that we should protect vulnerable people.
<P>
The hon. Member for West Chelmsford wishes to make 
the point that we are in favour of compulsory metering.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> No, I do not. The Minister should not 
anticipate me. Will he give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> No. I want to answer his original point 
before he makes another.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman was concerned that a large number 
of people move into new homes each year and that water 
companies have the right to install a meter in those homes. 
Indeed, it is a great deal cheaper to put a meter into a 
newly built home. Water companies have an incentive to 
do that because I have made it clear that if they fail to 
install a meter immediately and a new occupier starts on 
an unmeasured charge, the occupier can continue on that 
charge.
<P>
Let us assume, however, that that will not happen and 
that there will be an increase in metering. The Bill does 
not change anything. We are continuing current practice. 
The hon. Gentleman ought to take that on board.



<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> I would be grateful if the Minister could 
clear up this fundamental problem. I fully understand 
what he said about newly built houses and I realise that 
that has been the situation for many years. I am not 
arguing about that. However, unless I am wrong, the Bill 
will introduce a new power of compulsion. If someone 
moves to a house that is not newly built but it is a new 
house to that person, the water company will have the 
right to determine before the first water bill arrives 
whether the water is to be charged on a metered basis or 
on a rateable value basis. Is that the right interpretation?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> It is correct.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> If that is so, the Minister 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Member for West 
Chelmsford was merely intervening.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> Let me put the hon. Gentleman straight. 
He is correct. I understand his point: we are discussing 
the powers of water companies 
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I would prefer it if hon. 
Members, who may speak as many times as they like, 
made long speeches rather than long interventions because 
it is difficult to keep the record straight.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I find it difficult to respond because the 
hon. Member for West Chelmsford tends to interrupt me 
during each sentence, but perhaps I am too generous in 
giving way.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman is right to say, and I fully admit, 
that there will be an increase in metering. As I have said, 
that may well benefit many people. I have made no secret 
of the fact that those in vulnerable categories who would 
lose by the measure will be protected.
<P>
Where possible, people should know the basis on which 
water charging will be made before deciding whether to 
move in to a property. It should be possible to establish 
fairly readily the basis on which the previous occupier 
was charged. Certainly, anyone for whom such 
information is important should have access to it before 
deciding whether to buy or to rent the property in 
question.
<P>
However, I accept that we need further to examine the 
position of someone who moves in to a property for which 
water was previously supplied on an unmeasured charging 
basis. I also accept the strong argument that, as part of 
the moving process, such a person should be able to 
establish the future charging basis. In particular, where a 
water undertaker has a settled policy as several do to 
transfer a property to metering upon a change of occupier, 
that information should as far as possible be made 
available. I have received letters from consumers; 
including a former constituent, complaining that that was 
a point of which they were unaware. We should examine 
the matter as part of the detailed implementation of the 
Bill, but I do not believe that it is necessary to change the 
Bill. The Government and the regulator will deal with the 
matter when we consider the charges schemes that will 
govern the application of new charge measures by 
individual companies.
<P>
I hope that I have dealt clearly with all the points that 
were raised, and on a basis that is fair and equitable for 
all groups.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> May I first simply ask the Minister a 
question to which he must know the answer, and which 
requires no calculation: what is the average annual 
turnover in existing dwellings in the UK?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I cannot tell the hon. Gentleman the 
answer off the top of my head, but I believe that it is 
approximately 7 per cent., to 9 per cent. a year. If those 
who have better information on the matter can give it to 
me, I shall inform the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Steve McCabe (Birmingham, Hall Green):</B> I want 
to raise a particular point with my right hon. Friend, by 
which I have become increasingly bemused. This 
morning, Opposition Members told us of the danger of a 
Bill that will give further power to Ministers, who will 
interfere with the laudable actions of water companies and 
the proper functioning of the market. Unless there is 
something wrong with my hearing, they are now saying 
that they want further intervention to prevent sharp 
practice by water companies that may impose metering 
charges on people before they realise what is going on.



<P>
It seems strange to be told in the morning that the Bill 
is dangerous because it will enable Ministers to intervene 
in such matters, only to be told in the afternoon, "Get in 
quick with a bit of intervention, because water companies 
may indulge in sharp practice"	.
<P>
In order to resolve the problem, would my right hon. 
Friend consider preventing water companies from 
indulging in sharp practice by requiring them to provide 
early notice to new tenants and purchasers? As he said, 
such matters can be dealt with without changing the Bill. 
If water companies were required to provide a simple 
information leaflet before imposing metering charges, 
consumers would know their rights and would be able to 
make clear a wish not to be subject to volumetric 
metering. Such information might even deal with some of 
the concerns expressed by Opposition Members.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I am delighted to note that our 
investigation and scrutiny has begun to alert Labour 
Members to what is going on. I fear that the news is worse 
than they imagined. We are discussing not rights but a 
compulsory ratchet, which the Minister admits will affect 
about 7 per cent. of the population each year. A quick 
calculation suggests that 1.07 to the seventh, added to the 
13 per cent. who, as the Minister said, already have 
meters, means that more than 60 per cent. of the 
population will have meters in seven years, and that more 
than 70 per cent. of the population will have them in 10 
years. To that must be added those who genuinely 
voluntarily have meters, of which the number will be 
unspecified.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> indicated dissent 
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I should be interested to hear the 
Minister's figures, but I doubt that he will be willing to 
give them.
<P>
Does the Minister deny that unless there is a lot of 
reverting to unmeasured charging he said that he did not 
expect that, and I certainly do not the implication of the 
figures that he gave is that the bulk of the population in 
10 years will have been pushed on to meters, most of 
them compulsorily because they have moved? The 
Opposition have no objection to the general principle of 
pushing people gently towards metering, but we object to 
the Government claiming to be horror struck at the idea 
of any compulsory metering and then introducing a Bill 
that engenders a large increase in compulsory metering. 
If the Government want to make a case for compulsory 
metering, they should tell the public fair and square.
<P>
The Minister is playing an interesting game of words. 
He said that he is not in favour of compulsory, universal 
metering, but the Bill will produce compulsory, near 
universal metering over a period that is slightly more 
gradual than immediate. Does the Minister accept that that 
is a fair representation of his Bill?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> No, I do not. The Conservative 
Government removed rateable value as a basis for water 
charging from 31 March 2000, so they were and, from 
what the hon. Member for West Dorset said this morning, 
still are in favour of universal compulsory metering. The 
Government are prepared to accept some limited 
movement towards further metering, which we accept will 
be in the interests of many people, particularly those who 
live alone.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman's argument contains two flaws. 
First, it assumes that water companies will maximise the 
opportunity to install meters, but that is unlikely because 
the cost of installing meters if £150-£200. Water 
companies must pay the cost of installing meters and will 
be required, if the right to revert is exercised, to remove 
them. I do not believe that they will be as keen 
<P>
<B>Mr. Shaun Woodward (Witney):</B> Will the Minister 
give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I shall not give way to the hon. 
Gentleman now because I am responding to the hon. 
Member for West Dorset on the Opposition Front Bench.



<P>
The first flaw in the argument of the hon. Member for 
West Dorset is that the figures that he is rapidly 
accumulating are not accurate. The second is that many 
people who move home will already have meters. Those 
who move will not be only those on unmeasured charging. 
Both categories will move. The more who acquire meters, 
even if the rate of movement is the same, the greater will 
be the proportion of those who already have meters.
<P>
I am not pretending that there will not be a significant 
increase in metering over quite a long period, but metering 
will not be universal in 10 years, nor will 60 per cent. of 
the population be metered in 10 years. The increase will be 
considerably slower.

<P>

<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for 
giving way.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The Minister is not giving way. 
The hon. Gentleman is about to make a speech.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> It is important to put on the record 
that throughout our deliberations, and particularly in this 
instance, we have been very short of facts. It has been 
striking how, whenever the Government are challenged, 
they show that they have failed to do any significant 
homework on this subject. It is important to put it on the 
record again that when the Minister says that he knows of 
water companies that do not wish to proceed with 
metering, he cannot give the names of those companies.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> The Minister has been extraordinarily 
reasonable during our sittings, but I want to nail one 
statement that he has now repeated twice to my 
knowledge, once this afternoon and once on Second 
Reading, which is quite fallacious. That is that the 
Conservative party, in government, wanted and supported 
a policy of compulsory metering for everyone. it is not 
true, and the evidence does not show it. The Minister also 
suggests that part of the evidence for that is that we 
intended to abolish rateable values on 31 March 2000.
<P>
As the Minister knows, in the late 1980s we were 
planning to change the basis for charging water between 
then and the year 2000. For other reasons, we could not 
use the original system proposed to replace rateable 
values and we never changed the basis, but we were on 
record before the last election as saying that we too would 
have to bring in similar legislation on the dating of 
rateable values: they would have expired next year and 
we would have had to extend them to continue the 
rateable values in the same way as this Government are 
having to do, because an alterative system had not been 
devised and introduced. That is different from saying that, 
because of that date in the original legislation, we would 
still, at the end of our term of office, abolish rateable 
values and have compulsory metering.
<P>
There is one other thing that the Minister cannot get 
away with. All through this debate he has talked about 
choice for consumers, and in many ways he is right: the 
Bill provides that customers will have 12 months in which 
to choose whether to go to a meter from a rateable value 
and then return to rateable value if they do not like their 
bills or for any other reason. I agree with the Minister: 
that is choice. However, the hon. Member for Carshalton 
and Wallington has flushed out in his probing amendment 
one area in the clause which shows that in one small 
aspect the Bill brings in a form of compulsory metering, 
and there is no way round that. When I questioned the 
Minister on it, he confirmed it.
<P>
If a couple move not to a newly built house but to a 
house where the previous occupants, say for the past 100 
years, have paid their water bills by the rateable value 
system or an unmetered system, they will not necessarily 
know, before they receive their first water bill, whether 
the water company will charge them thereafter for their 
water on a rateable value basis or a meter. The customers 
have not choice if: the water companies opt for the meter 
system, he will be forced to have a meter. As I said in my 
intervention, I imagine that the last thing in the world that 
a couple in their early 40s with four teenage children 
would want is a meter. They will not have the choice that 
others will have between the two systems, because a meter 
will be forced on them, if that is the system that the water 
company decides to use.
<P>
The Minister referred to a window of opportunity. It is 
a wonderful window of opportunity if a water company 
wants greatly to enhance the number of water meters in 
its area. Even if one accepts the reasonable qualifications 
that the Minister has made, the figures suggest that over 
10 years a significant number of people who have moved 
into old rather than newly built houses will probably be 
on a metered system and will have had no choice.



<P>
Presumably the Bill places no statutory requirement on 
a water company to tell someone who moves house, 
before he or she signs the contract and buys the house, 
whether charges will be made on a meter or rateable value 
basis. There is not the same element of caveat emptor as 
applies if someone decides to buy a newly built house, 
because that person will know before making the purchase 
that a water meter will be installed.
<P>
It is patent nonsense for the Minister to accuse the 
Opposition in Committee of wanting to force everyone to 
have meters, and to say that the Bill is all about choice 
and the Government are completely against forcing 
anyone to have a meter. The clause shows that, in one 
circumstance, there is a window of opportunity for water 
companies to impose a water meter against the choice of 
the householder. The Minister should come clean and 
qualify his language when talking about this wonderful 
expansion and freedom of choice because, in this respect, 
it does not apply.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I suggest to the Minister that he should 
consider the following proposition. First, if he is right, as I 
am sure he is, that one must take into account the existing 
number of occupants who have meters, and that each year 
7 per cent. plus of the population moves house, we have 
a declining series, starting with 13, to which he must add 
seven times 0.87 and then seven times 0.8, and so forth, 
down to the terminal value of seven times 0.05. That 
series takes us to 100 per cent. over 14 years.
<P>
The Minister maintains that there are two reasons why 
that series is wrong. The first is that some water 
companies will not wish to follow that course. I wonder 
whether the Minister has interrogated his experts to 
ascertain what the long-term effect would be on the price 
cap set for water of inflating the water companies' asset 
base by a major increase in the amount of metering, which 
costs £100 a shot or so, as the Minister rightly said.
I wonder whether the Minister's experts have advised him 
on what the propensity of water undertakings will be 
towards metering, given that inflationary asset base at 
each review. I suspect that the answer he will receive is 
that water companies will have a high propensity to move 
in that direction.
<P>
The Minister's second point was that one must believe 
that the figures could be wrong because there will be 
reference to those people who are already in dwellings 
with meters. I have taken account of that, but the Minister 
did not take account of the additional acceleration that 
will occur from the voluntary metering for which the Bill 
provides. It would be extremely interesting if the Minister 
let the Committee know I accept that he cannot do so 
now whether, on mature reflection, he and his experts 
accept that the tendency of all these things to come 
together will be to produce near on 100 per cent. metering 
during the course of 10 or 15 years. It would be extremely 
interesting to hear whether he can summon up the courage 
to deny that proposition in writing to the Committee.
I very much doubt whether he will want to do that, and 
on mature reflection I suspect that he should admit that he 
has produced a recipe for gradual, progressive compulsory 
metering exactly the tactic that he was accusing the 
Opposition of adopting.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Before the Minister replies,
I ask him not to stray too far into the question of rateable 
values, because that would spoil our fun on clause 8.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I shall try to abide by your edict,
Mr. Atkinson.



<P>
It is difficult to know where to start. I have already 
made all the relevant points clearly and comprehensively, 
but Opposition Front Bench spokesmen persist in drawing 
false conclusions from them.
<P>
In response to the hon. Member for West Chelmsford, 
I shall not repeat my earlier comments or flog a dead 
horse over what the previous Government may or may 
not have intended to do between 1997 and 2000. Some 
people may believe him, but thousands do not, and I am 
in the latter category. However, I shall not repeat my 
comments again we have had enough fun with the 
subject already.
<P>
I must challenge what the hon. Member for West 
Dorset said about the rate of shift towards compulsory 
metering. He has been doing lengthy mathematical sums 
to several decimal places, but all that he showed was that 
in 14 years we should reach 100 per cent. However, one 
does not need to do a lot of sums to show that 100 divided 
by seven is about 14, and doing so to two decimal places 
is spurious accuracy. His approach is nonsense, for the 
reasons that I gave. First, as I said, several water 
companies may not want to indulge in the associated 
costs, which are considerable. Secondly I did not say 
this earlier, although, on reflection, the point is just as 
telling several water companies have no wish in 
principle to move to water metering.
<P>
The hon. Member for Witney (Mr. Woodward) taunted 
me for not coming forward with facts or names, so let me 
produce the names of two companies that do not wish to 
proceed to metering, for very good reasons. The first is 
Hyder Welsh Water which does not have a great 
problem supplying water to meet its consumers' needs 
because there is abundant water in Wales. It would face 
substantial costs if it installed meters, which, because of 
the rainfall, are not necessary. The other company is 
Wessex Water, which, for different reasons I suspect to 
increase its revenue base from those who are on higher 
incomes would much prefer to have a system of council 
tax charging rather than metering. It is wrong to suggest 
that all water companies are itching to maximise every 
conceivable opportunity to move towards metering.
I repeat again that a gradual progress is involved, 
although one will find increasingly that rising numbers of 
people who are not metered are unwilling to be metered 
and will exercise their choice not to be metered. 
Moreover, those who move are not necessarily those who 
are unmeasured those people may already be paying on 
a metered basis and that, too, will influence the figures.
<P>
I make it clear yet again that the Bill involves no 
increase in compulsion. All of the compulsion that exists 
was previously available. People who move to new homes 
can be metered by the water companies, which do not do 
so universally because they do not wish to do so. 
However, they have previously done so frequently, and 
people who move to new homes will find that they are 
metered.

<B>Mr. Burns:</B> Will the right hon. Gentleman give way 
briefly?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> Very well.



<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> I am most grateful to the right hon. 
Gentleman for his generosity. I am fascinated by what he 
has just said I have never come across that fact. What 
is the statutory reference for that power?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> It is contained in the Water Industry Act 
1991, which was introduced by the previous 
Conservative Government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> Which section?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I do not have all of that Act's sections 
at my fingertips. If the hon. Gentleman wishes to go to 
the Library to do some research, he should do so. 
[Interruption.] I should be grateful if he would accept that 
what I said is correct. I refer to people who move to a 
new home that is new to them as an occupier. In that 
case, water companies have already had the opportunity 
to install water meters if they wish. The rate at which 
there has been an increase on that basis is  I repeat 
1 per cent. or 2 per cent. a year. The figure might increase 
slightly, but it will be very small. It will take far longer 
than Conservative Front Benchers believe before we get 
anywhere near a majority, let alone totality.
<P>
The combination of measures in clauses 6 and 7 represent 
a significant increase in consumer choice compared with the 
present situation. There is already a degree of compulsion in 
the present situation. We are amending that by increasing 
consumer choice through clauses 6 and 7. There is a 
legitimate debate about how far we should go in promoting 
choice and to what extent we should fetter companies' 
discretion. The Bill achieves the right balance between the 
interests of consumers and companies.

<P>
I want to respond to the comments made by my hon. 
Friend the Member for Birmingham, Hall Green
(Mr. McCabe) because Conservative Front Benchers 
latched on to them with such vigour. He has a point and 
I am quite prepared to consider it. How can one ensure 
that someone who moves into new premises is assured of 
the basis on which he will be charged for his water 
supply? The first most people know about it is when they 
get a water bill through the door. We should consider 
whether the water company might be required to give the 
new occupier the information prior to receipt of the first 
bill. I do not like to make policy on my feet in Committee. 
I would, therefore, like to go away and consider how far 
we can go to meet my hon. Friend's concern. He has made 
a reasonable and sensible point.
<P>
On that basis, I hope that we can agree that clauses 6 
and 7 considerably increase consumer discretion, that 
there is no increase in compulsion and that we have 
achieved a reasonable and fair balance, which is better 
than the present one.

<P>
</FONT><B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to

tax bands 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`1. (1) Section 145 of the Water Industry Act 1991 shall be 
amended in accordance with subsections (2) and (3) below.

(2) In subsection (2)(a), for "2000"	 there shall be substituted

from
1 April 2001, have their charges scheme replaced by a scheme 
based on the council tax band valuation of the premises as fixed 
by a valuation under the Local Government Finance Act 1992.'.
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Brake:</B> The arguments in favour of using council 
tax bands as a basis for charging were rehearsed on 
Second Reading, so Labour Members may be pleased to 
hear that I shall keep my comments short. On Second 
Reading, the Minister said that he was willing to consider 
the use of council tax bands. I am giving him another 
opportunity to do exactly that.
<P>
We know that the rates are unfair. In many cases, 
revaluations have not been carried out for 20 years or 
more. Council tax bands are much more up to date and, 
therefore, much fairer. I accept that council tax bands 
would require some tweaking to become a means of 
charging for water, and that additional bands might need 
to be introduced. The scale of work involved would, 
however, be very small.
<P>
The proposed new clause suggests 1 April 2001 as the 
date by which such changes would have to be made. That 
would allow water companies the time necessary to 
change their systems to cope with the use of council tax 
bands as a means of charging, bearing in mind the fact 
that during the next 12 months the water companies will 
be heavily involved in sorting out the latest problem: the 
millennium bug.
<P>
Our proposal is sensible, and the Minister has indicated 
that he is willing to consider it. I hope that since Second 
Reading and perhaps during the Christmas recess he has 
been considering nothing other than the possibility of 
introducing council tax bands as a means of charging for 
water. I hope that he will respond positively.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> I shall be brief.
<P>
<B>Mr. Graham Allen (Vice-Chamberlain of Her </B><P>
Majesty's Household): Slow and brief.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> I shall ignore the Government Whip.
<P>
I can see the superficial attractions of the proposed new 
clause. If there is to be a dual charging purpose for water 
and sewerage, the use of a system based I speak from 
memory on the 1972 or 1975 valuation 
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> It is 1973.



<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> I am grateful to the Minister. The use of 
such a system is in many ways ludicrous, because it is so 
outdated. On Second Reading, the Minister or one of his 
ministerial colleagues made an extremely valid point. 
Although, superficially, the council tax system seems a 
simple way of switching from the current rateable value 
system, just moving the system sideways has potential 
pitfalls. A number of people have highlighted the 
problems that could have adverse effects, especially for 
less well-off families.
<P>
I hope that the Government will not rule out the use of 
council tax bands, but I sympathise with their desire not 
to rush into changing the system. Such dramatic change 
to the existing system would have to be right. Any system 
will have winners and losers, but it is obviously desirable 
to introduce a system that minimises the number of losers. 
The Minister may want more work to be done to 
investigate how to adjust, tamper or play with the council 
tax banding system to make it a better vehicle for change, 
or to decide whether other systems should be introduced. 
I am prepared to give the Government the benefit of the 
doubt at this stage in their period of office. Above all, it 
is important to get the system right rather than to get 
things done in a hurry.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I would never be one to look a gift horse 
such as that in the mouth. We are sympathetic to the 
proposal, but it needs a great deal of care. Council 
tax-based water charging is not a panacea. It has some 
unfortunate side effects, which we want to consider very 
closely. I should like to make it clear, however, that we 
do not rule it out. Perhaps that assurance sounds rather 
curmudgeonly. Frankly, I am keen to consider the 
possibilities, but they involve some hurdles that have to 
be met.
<P>
The clause removes the prohibition in the Water 
Industry Act 1991 on the use of rateable value as a basis 
for water charging after 31 March 2000. It is a very 
important part of the Bill in some ways, it is at its heart. 
Without it, water companies would have no secure basis 
on which to charge the remaining 86 per cent. of 
households that do not have a water meter after March 
2000, nor would they have the time to introduce one. By 
retaining a basis for unmeasured charging, we are 
ensuring that consumers have real choice. I emphasise 
again that that is the Bill's key theme.



<P>
A number of people, including the hon. Member for 
West Chelmsford, have said that rateable value is out of 
date, and it is true that the last revaluation took place 25 
years ago a very long time ago. It should be replaced 
with a more up-to-date system that people understand, 
such as council tax banding. I repeat that we shall be 
happy to receive suggestions for alternative bases of 
unmeasured charging. I shall say more about that in a 
moment. However, that does not remove the requirement 
for a basis of charging to be in place while alternative 
schemes are worked out. Removing the relevant clause in 
the Water Industry Act 1991 will provide continuity in 
water charging for those customers who pay on that basis.
<P>
New clause 1 proposes the replacement of rateable 
value-based water charges with ones that are based on 
council tax bands. On Second Reading, the hon. Member 
for Carshalton and Wallington asked me about the 
Government's position on using council tax bands as a 
basis of charging. That is an idea with which I have great 
sympathy. The Government do not have a dogmatic 
preference for one method of charging over another. The 
issue is not the method, but the distributional 
consequences for water charge payers. I say that, unlike 
some who have advocated wholesale metering, or others 
who have advocated the indisputable benefits of particular 
unmeasured charges. One needs to take a much more 
eclectic and pragmatic view. We do not therefore believe 
that rateable value is the only way forward in the longer 
term. We are quite prepared to permit water companies to 
introduce council tax-based charges. But before we allow 
that, we want to be convinced that the effect on 
customers' bills will be fair and acceptable. That is not 
unreasonable. I have seen some models that would lead 
to many on low incomes being substantial losers. That 
would not be a good idea, and there needs to be some 
protection against it happening.
<P>
As the hon. Member for West Chelmsford said, we are 
not rushing to apply a new compulsory system across the 
country which might cause drastic changes in charges paid 
by individual customers, simply on the principle that any 
system using council tax must be better because it is 
modern. That is not our view, and I do not think that it 
is defensible.
<P>
For the foreseeable future, we shall need some way 
or ways of setting unmeasured water charges. At 
present, the majority of household customers pay a charge 
based on the rateable value of their property. As I have 
explained, we have no objection to changing that to a 
different basis of charging. Council tax may offer a way 
to an acceptable alternative system. Some companies, 
such as Wessex Water and Hyder, think that an acceptable 
alternative system can be created. Fine let them produce 
it for us and the Director General of Water Services to 
consider.
<P>
Council tax bands may appeal to a water company as a 
useful pre-existing database on which it can draw. We are 
not yet persuaded that those bands are necessarily the best 
basis for water charges, whether one believes in reflecting 
the costs of water used or in wider concepts of social 
fairness and ability to pay.
<P>
I could say a great deal more about the work that we 
have been doing. We have been encouraging water 
companies to come up with alternative models. We have 
been looking at models and reworking them. I repeat that, 
in my view, it is for the water companies to come forward 
with such models, rather than the Government, but when 
that happens, we will certainly consider them 
sympathetically. If we judge that the overall distributional 
equity would be greater on some form of council tax 
basis perhaps on a different ratio from the current one 
we are quite prepared to allow that change to proceed, as 
long as the impact on charges to water payers is fair and 
affordable, and does not lead to a significant number of 
poorer people being significantly disadvantaged.
<P>
I hope that, on that basis, the hon. Member for 
Carshalton and Wallington will be satisfied that we share 
his view, and that he will accept that an immediate and 
total shift to council tax charging would not be wise. Let 
us suck it and see. If it works, we will use it.

<P>

<B>Mr. Gorrie:</B> The Minister's reply was mildly 
encouraging. I do not know whether the Under-Secretary 
of State for Scotland, the hon. Member for Western Isles 
(Mr. Mcdonald), wants to contribute to the debate. He will 
have received any objections to the operation of the 
system in Scotland. As an ordinary Member of 
Parliament, I am not aware of widespread dissatisfaction 
with the way in which using council tax bands to 
determine water charges in Scotland works. If we are to 
have a property-based system, we might as well have a 
slightly more sensible property-based system, rather than 
one from the middle ages.
<P>
The system in Scotland works reasonably well. If, as 
the Minister says, it might work to the disadvantage of 
some poorer people presumably in smaller houses, 
caravans, or something we could extend some bands, as 
my hon. Friend the Member for Carshalton and 
Wallington suggested. From our experience in Scotland, 
council tax bands appear to work quite well. The Minister 
is seeing mirages, problems and phantom elephants 
trampling around where they do not exist. The issue is 
much less complex than he makes out.
<P>
I hope that the Government will proceed in the way 
that the Minister has described which encourages us 
and will move towards identifying a system based on 
council tax bands. To have yet another local government 
tax system to determine water payments would be 
extraordinarily foolish. Life is too complex anyway; let 
us stick to the council tax system and improve it where 
necessary. It would be absurd to invent a totally new 
system.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I shall briefly respond to the hon. 
Gentleman; I think that he is broadly agreeing with what 
I have said. Contrary to what he said, I am not seeing 
mirages, shadows or difficulties where there are none.
I have looked at models based on the 3:1 ratio of the 
current council tax charging system, and, as I was saying, 
they lead to a significant number of people on the lowest 
incomes those in the A band being obliged to pay up 
to, say, £20 a year extra, which may be 10 per cent. or 
even 15 per cent. of their water bill.
<P>
In other words, a significant number of people in 
low-income bands the poorer people in society would 
be losers. If that were the consequence, introducing such 
a system would not be justified. If we can find a way to 
amend that system to avoid such unintended and 
undesirable effects, I assure the hon. Gentleman that the 
Government would permit the water companies to go 
ahead.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 8 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 9</center></H4>
<H4><center>Restriction on charging for metering works</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the 
Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brake:</B> Earlier, the Minister asked what Liberal 
Democrat policy on meters is. It is not to block people 
from taking a meter if that is what they choose to do; it 
is about providing them with genuine consumer choice 
in other words, to allow them to choose whether to have 
a meter or not to have a meter at any point in time.
<P>
However, in relation to clause 9, people would be 
required to cover the installation costs of a meter. There 
is no such thing as a free meter. The cost of a free meter 
will simply be spread across the customer base there is 
no doubt about that. It is fairer for people who want a 
meter to pay for the cost of that meter and, at some point 
in the future, if they want to have the meter removed for 
them to cover the cost of that as well. That is why I tabled 
an amendment seeking to have clause 9 removed entirely, 
which would do away with the requirement for water 
companies to provide free meters. I hope that the Minister 
will consider that and conclude that it would be the fairest 
way of doing things. People would have a genuine 
choice they could choose to have a meter or not while 
customers who did not choose to have a meter would not 
be required to cover the costs of installing or removing 
meters.



<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> We are learning, during the 
Committee's debates, a little more about Liberal 
Democratic party policy on meter changing. I had thought 
from the hon. Gentleman's use of the phrase creeping 
metering, which I took to be pejorative 
<P>
<B>Mr. Brake indicated assent.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> He nods his head in agreement. I had 
thought that it was something to which the Liberal party 
was opposed. However, I now understand its position to 
be that when people want a meter they should be able to 
have one. The hon. Gentleman is getting closer to our 
position. It seems to me that the only division between us 
now is who has to pay for the meter, which could, as I 
said, cost between £150 and £200: it is a significant cost. 
The hon. Gentleman made a fair point that if the cost is 
not to be borne by customers and many of those who 
would gain from a meter, such as poorer people living 
alone, many elderly, could not possibly afford £150 it 
has to fall to the water companies. The hon. Gentleman is 
right that the companies would then undoubtedly 
redistribute those costs among the rest of the water charge 
payers. Indeed, although the hon. Gentleman did not use 
those words, we are talking about the balancing of the 
tariff basket. Depending on how far there is a demand for 
meters, a significant cost could be involved, meaning that 
those who are not enjoying the benefits of a meter and 
who remain on unmeasured charging could find that their 
costs begin to rise significantly.
<P>
If that began to happen on a large scale, the Director 
General of Water Services and the Government would 
need to address the issue. However, I doubt that it will 
happen, because many water companies already offer free 
meters. In fact, just under half do so, which is also 
relevant to the argument that took place in an earlier 
debate. Where there has been an option for water 
companies to introduce a meter, less than half have 
exercised that option. That is another reason why I do not 
believe that we are going to see a pell-mell, Gadarene 
rush towards metering universally all over the country.
<P>
I have already spoken about the overall costs of free 
metering. I mentioned on Second Reading that the director 
general's estimate is that it would cost £300 million over 
five years for all metering not just the increase in 
metering that will result from the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brake:</B> The Minister will be aware of the 
document produced by the Secretary of State for Health, 
to which I referred on Second Reading, in which a figure 
of £3 billion to £4 billion not £300 million was stated 
as the cost of metering.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I think that I know of the document to 
which the hon. Gentleman refers, but I cannot comment 
on the exact figure that he quoted. The director general 
has undertaken a detailed investigation of the subject, and 
the best estimate that he can make is £300 million in costs 
over five years that is, £60 million a year. That includes 
the shift towards metering, and not just the metering that 
results from the provisions of the Bill.
<P>
The point that I was making is that those costs are 
pretty modest when compared with the overall turnover 
of the water industry, and to the cost of the environmental 
improvements that we are asking water companies to 
undertake over the same period of the next five years, 
which is between £8 billion and £8.5 billion. The costs 
that are involved are therefore relatively small. I do not 
think that requiring them to be borne by the water 
companies which, as the hon. Member for Carshalton 
and Wallington says, will shift the burden on to the 
remaining consumers who are charged on an unmeasured 
basis will significantly alter the balance between those 
on unmeasured charging and those on meters. However, 
if that turns out to be wrong and a rebalancing of the tariff 
basket is necessary to any significant degree, we shall 
consider the matter closely and make changes as required.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<B>Mr. Gorrie:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 23, in page

<P>

No. 24, in page 8, line 30, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`including their common interest in achieving sustainable 
development'.



<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Gorrie:</B> There was a debate this morning about 
achieving sustainable development. The Minister depicted 
a scene in which the Government would produce the 
greatest all-round programme of sustainable development 
policy that anyone had ever seen and Britain would be 
transformed overnight into a green utopia. That was a 
welcome statement, which he made in the course of 
arguing against introducing sustainable development into 
the Bill in the way that the amendment tabled by my hon. 
Friend the Member for Carshalton and Wallington would 
have done.
<P>
Clause 12, which applies to Scotland, will not take 
effect until the Scottish Parliament is up and running. That 
Parliament might try to do other things and may well not 
be a party to that Westminster-based all-singing, 
all-dancing environmental programme. Thus, there is still 
an argument for including in the parts of the Bill that 
relate to Scotland the concept of achieving sustainable 
development. The amendments would ensure that both the 
water commissioner and the consultative committee 
would be instructed to include the customers'.
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"common interest in achieving sustainable development"	.
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
when working out their policies for the water industry.
<P>
As far as I can understand, there is no argument about 
achieving sustainable development; it is a question 
whether it is sensible to put such a provision in the Bill. 
The Minister might make a satisfactory argument on that, 
but we think it an important issue, and we would like it 
to be reflected in the Bill.
<P>
We also propose to replace the words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The Secretary of State may"	
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
in line 35 with the words, "The Scottish Parliament shall"	.
<P>
As I said, by the time the Bill takes effect it will be an 
item for the Scottish Parliament rather than the Secretary 
of State. It therefore seems sensible to accept that from 
the start and to make it clear that this is part of the Scottish 
Parliament's duty. Thus, the Scottish Parliament will be 
seen to be completely in control, rather than any residual 
power resting with the Secretary of State. If the Minister 
has a better explanation, we will listen with care, but we 
think that these two amendments imposing the duty of 
achieving sustainable development on the water 
commissioner and the consultative committee, and giving 
a clear indication that the Scottish Parliament is the body 
that is meant to drive on and supervise the regulatory 
system are worth making.

<P>

<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for </B><P>
Scotland (Mr. Calum Macdonald): There is not much 
between Liberal Democrat Members and the Government 
on this matter. I agree that sustainable development is an 
important principle; I think that we are at one in asserting 
that. Indeed, we support the broad spirit of emphasising 
the importance of environmental protection which, as the 
hon. Gentleman knows, is mentioned later in the Bill, and 
of sustainable development, but we do not believe that the 
amendments are the appropriate way to implement those 
principles.
<P>
Clause 13(4)(c) makes it clear that protection of the 
environment will figure in the advice that Ministers give 
to water authorities in the first place. To place a similar 
duty on the commissioner would obscure the separation 
of duties between Ministers and the commissioner which 
we need to maintain if there is to be proper democratic 
accountability.
<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
In this context it is Ministers, accountable, as the hon. 
Member for Edinburgh, West says, to the Parliament, who 
will set the environmental standards that the water 
authorities will then meet by drawing on expert advice 
which is available form Scottish Natural Heritage and the 
Scottish Environment Protection Agency. For those 
agencies sustainable development is clearly a core 
objective. It will be Ministers' responsibility to assess and 
strike the proper balance required by the concept of 
sustainable development. It is not for the commissioner to 
make that judgment in the first place but for the Executive 
democratically accountable to the Parliament to do so and 
then to require it of the commissioner.



<P>
The commissioner's role will be to provide proper and 
professional advice to Ministers on the cost of meeting 
the environmental standards that the Parliament, through 
its Ministers, decides to set. The hon. Gentleman's 
amendment would undermine and obscure that clear 
separation of functions and would reduce the Parliament's 
ability to exercise its own discretion on this front.
<P>
A second objection to the amendments, which relates 
to my last point, is that it is preferable to leave the 
definition of the customers' general interests to the 
commissioner, in the light of guidance that will be issued 
by Ministers to the consultative committees. The 
alternative would be to produce an exhaustive list of all 
the customers' interests. Sustainable development might 
be one item, but with such a list we would risk missing 
out a particular feature and restricting the commissioner's 
and the committees' scope to exercise their judgment. 
That again would not be a proper basis on which to 
establish the new arrangements.
<P>
While I appreciate and sympathise with the motives 
behind the amendment, I do not believe that it represents 
a sensible way to promote sustainable development. The 
Bill gives the Parliament, through Ministers, the power to 
guide the commissioner and the committees on what 
should be in the definition of the interests of consumers, 
which can include sustainable development. It is proper 
for the Parliament to determine that through Ministers 
rather than for us to give that function, in the Bill, to the 
commissioner directly.
<P>
As regards the reference to the Secretary of State, I 
assure the hon. Gentleman that that is a power which, 
post-devolution, will be exercised by the Minister and not 
by any Secretary of State who remains in Westminster.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gorrie:</B> I am not impressed by the argument that 
by establishing an adviser we limit the scope of that 
answer to ignore important issues. That is a strange 
argument. However, the other argument that promoting 
the interests of customers can be taken in its widest 
sense is a bit better. Will the Minister make it clear that 
the interests of customers will include long-term interests 
such as sustainable development and not just how many 
pounds and pence people will have to pay for next year's 
water? Will he also confirm that it will be in order for the 
Scottish Parliament to interpret the Bill, which it will put 
into effect, in such a way that it can take account of the 
long-term interests of customers in achieving sustainable 
development, and that that issue relates to the 
commissioner and the committee? I accept the argument 
that it is sensible to keep the wording as broad as possible.
<P>
<B>Mr. Macdonald:</B> I can give the hon. Gentleman the 
assurance that it will be possible and proper for the 
Parliament, through the Ministers who will issue 
directions and guidance to the commissioner, to require 
the commissioner to take account of environmental 
matters and sustainable development. It will be proper for 
the Parliament to make those judgments rather than for us 
to put them on the face of the Bill. I think that the hon. 
Gentleman would agree with that in principle and, 
although I appreciate the spirit of the amendments, I hope 
that he will accept that they are not the right way forward.



<P>
<B>Mr. Gorrie:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the 
amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 20, in page 
8, leave out lines 35 to 38.

No. 25, in page 8, line 35, leave out
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`The Secretary of State may'
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and insert `The Scottish Parliament shall'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I shall briefly mention, for the sake of 
good order, that it appears that the Minister was right to 
say that there are existing powers. It must also be right, 
therefore, that the water companies will use them much 
less than I imagined, in which case he must also be right 
that the ratchet effect towards metering will be a great 
deal slower than I thought. We have recognised the error 
of our ways on that matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allen:</B> The hon. Gentleman will have to eat his hat.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Yes, I will.
<P>
Amendment No. 20 is a probing amendment. Its 
intention is to discover what or whom the commissioner 
really is. Lines 35 to 38, which the amendment would 
remove, give the Secretary of State powers of total 
direction over the commissioner. We want to discover 
how the Government envisage using those powers and, 
indeed, how their successors in title may use the powers. 
We also want to know what body or person will be left 
as commissioner. Will the commissioner be a regulator 
based on the model to which we in the United Kingdom 
have become accustomed a person who broadly acts 
within a remit that has been set in statute and occasionally 
in regulations and licences or is he meant to be a civil 
servant de facto who operates on a day-to-day basis under 
direction and regulation? If the latter is correct, why is the 
position being established? If the former is correct, under 
what self-denying ordinance will the Secretary of State or 
his successors in title operate?
<P>
We have tabled the amendment because we want those 
questions answered. I hope that the Minister will be able 
to give us sufficient assurance that the provision will 
operate in a way that leaves the commissioner with a real 
existence, so that we can rest easy on that point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gorrie:</B> I strayed into speaking to amendment
No. 25 during the previous debate, so that has been 
covered satisfactorily.
<P>
<B>Mr. Macdonald:</B> Of the two options mentioned by the 
hon. Member for West Dorset, it is the first option that is 
being pursued. It is not a civil servant, as he mentioned, 
but a regulator, who will have a great deal of authority in 
his or her own right.



<P>
The power to give directions will be based very much 
on the fact that the water industry in Scotland will remain 
in the public sector, and the power of direction will be 
part of that arrangement. That is why we do not believe 
that it would be acceptable to remove the power of 
direction, as the Opposition amendment proposes, because 
it would undermine the principles of public ownership and 
the democratic accountability.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman asked me to say something about 
the respective roles of the Executive and the 
commissioner, and I shall try to do that. We recognise 
that the post of commissioner requires operational 
independence, which is obviously necessary for the 
commissioner to have the authority to promote the 
interests of water customers. However, as an office whose 
remit is to cover a publicly owned and controlled industry, 
that independence cannot be absolute; it must be exercised 
within the context of Scottish Ministers who are 
accountable for the industry to the Scottish Parliament. 
That accountability is an inescapable consequence of the 
fact that the industry will remain in the public sector.
<P>
Therefore, Ministers will answer to Parliament for the 
industry and for the quality of service that it provides to 
customers. That responsibility must be matched by the 
power, if necessary, to direct the commissioner in various 
ways. I want to stress to the hon. Member for West Dorset 
that, at present, Ministers can direct the water authorities, 
precisely because they are within the public sector. 
However, in practice, the power to issue directions to 
water authorities is rarely used. Similarly we do not 
expect the proposed power over the commissioner to be 
invoked often. Ministers may use it, for example, to set 
the general framework of guidance within which the 
commissioner will exercise his or her functions. However, 
there is no question of the power being exercised in an 
unsupervised or arbitrary way. At all times, its use will 
be subject to proper procedures and scrutiny.
<P>
As the clause makes clear, a direction would be issued 
only following consultation with the commissioner about 
his terms. The direction itself would be in the public 
domain and, therefore, Parliament and the wider public 
would be fully aware of any requirements or conditions 
that Ministers intended to place on commissioners. The 
transparency should reassure the hon. Member for West 
Dorset, who may be worried that Ministers will seek to 
bring undue or hidden influence to bear on the 
commissioner.
<P>
We have tried to set out a clear and proper separation 
of roles. Ministers will be responsible for policy, subject 
to the provisions in the Bill, and will set the framework 
within which the commissioner will operate. From time 
to time, if circumstances change, they may need to alter 
the framework, by direction if necessary and may be 
called upon to justify and explain to Parliament the 
directions and the general framework.
<P>
Within the framework established by Ministers, the 
commissioner will operate independently without 
intervention by Ministers. If the Parliament wishes, it can 
call the commissioner to account for the way in which he 
discharges the remit set down by Ministers.
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
Although it may be more relevant to clause 13, it might 
be worth reminding the hon. Member for West Dorset that 
the commissioner will be required to publish his advice 
to Ministers. Any amendments that Ministers decide to 
make to that advice and the reasons for them will be 
published by the commissioner in a form that he decides is 
appropriate. That transparency provides the best assurance 
that the commissioner will have proper operational 
independence in this crucial area. With that assurance, I 
invite the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
(6) The Secretary of State may not exercise any of his powers for 
the purpose of restoring to the new water and sewerage authorities 
any economic loss arising as a result of charges fixed according to 
the Commissioner's advice'.</FONT></UL>
<P>
This is also a probing amendment, and is derived 
closely from a discussion between the Minister and I. If 
it is genuinely the Government's intention that the 
commissioner should be in approximately the same 
position vis-aÁ-vis the nationalised industry as the regulator 
occupies to a lesser degree vis-aÁ-vis a privatised industry, 
will it follow that there should not be an attempt by the 
Secretary of State or, subsequently, the Executive to 
undermine the efforts of the commissioner to instil
 economic rigour in the operation of the undertakings 
parallel to that which the combination of regulator and 
market instil in them in the rest of the UK?
<P>
The purpose of the amendment is that if any mysterious 
process or notice was absorbed into the Bill by the 
Government, a self-denying ordinance would be enforced 
on the Secretary of State and, subsequently, the Executive, 
preventing them from undermining the commissioner's 
work by resubsidising a nationalised undertaking which 
had been forced into economic loss by the commissioner 
attempting to force it into efficiency. The circumstances 
that I am thinking of are very clear. The commissioner 
might decide that it was appropriate to set a certain X 
factor in the charging scheme, and that would imply a 
degree of annual increase in productivity by the 
undertaking. The Secretary of State could, in theory, 
under the provision, give a direction that would undercut 
that action by the commissioner by forcing the 
commissioner, in the subsequent year, to relieve the cap 
to make good the loss that arose because the undertaking 
had not achieved the productivity gains that the cap 
implied. That would turn the commissioner into a game 
rather than serious regulator.
<P>
That fear arises because these are nationalised 
industries and, inevitably, there will be some conflict of 
interest because the Secretary of State and, subsequently, 
the Executive act as both the supervisory regulator over 
the commission on behalf of customers and as the owner. 
It is all too easy, especially in the context of devolution, 
to believe that the Executive might seek to prevent its 
limited tax-raising powers and its limited powers over 
expenditure both of which are limited by fundamental 
statute from being undermined by increasing losses in 
the industries of which it will be the effective owner. It 
might do so by seeking to undercut efforts by the 
commissioner of the kind that I described. In other words, 
that is a real-life possibility. For example, an aggressive 
commissioner of an inefficient undertaking in the 
nationalised sector in this industry in Scotland might want 
to make that industry more efficient, but he might find 
himself thwarted by an Executive which is keen not to 
see losses in that which it owns.
<P>
The Minister can resolve the matter by making it clear 
that the Government have no intention of permitting the 
Secretary of State or subsequent Secretaries of State to act 
in that way. I hope and expect that clarification to have 
some force in law if necessary. The right hon. 
Gentleman's remarks might run in parallel with those that 
he made about amendment No. 20. I realise that that is 
not as good as acceptance of the amendment's rigorous 
prohibition, but it would at least go a long way towards 
reassuring us. His clarification would also have some 
effect in law if the matter were subsequently debated, as 
it might be.
<P>
As I understand it, such matters are justiciable. A 
consumer might go to court to challenge the Secretary of 
State or the Executive if he or it acted in such a way, and 
that court might refer back to the Minister's comments. 
This probing amendment therefore has a specific legal 
purpose.
<P>
Finally, subsection (5) of the amendment involves 
precisely the same sort of probing, but in another form. 
Under clause 13, the commissioner will offer advice 
which, as the Minister said, will be published and we 
take some comfort from that. The advice will be about 
what is to be taken into account or left out of account 
by the authorities when they fix their charges. The 
amendment is intended to probe whether the Secretary of 
State or the Executive would normally reject any part of 
that advice. Is the normal understanding that they will 
accept such advice in full? I do not expect the Minister 
necessarily to accept the full rigour of the amendment, 
which would prevent anything other than total acceptance, 
but we want reassurance about whether he thinks that in 
the normal course of affairs the advice will be accepted 
in full.



<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Gorrie:</B> I have some points that are about clause 
13, Mr. Atkinson, but they are not about the amendment. 
Is this the appropriate moment to discuss them?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The occasion for discussing 
those matters is during the clause stand part debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Macdonald:</B> I can give the hon. Member for West 
Dorset the reassurances that he seeks. I assure him that 
our intention is not for this Government or future 
Governments to step in to stem losses that arise from the 
inefficiency of water authorities we do not expect that 
to happen. We do not think that it will be the norm for 
Ministers to reject advice from commissioners and to 
substitute their own advice. If that was going to be the 
norm, there would be no point in having a commissioner.
<P>
I shall briefly clarify the way that we hope the system 
will operate. The starting point is the fact that the 
authorities are under public ownership. That is not to say 
that Ministers or the Executive will run the businesses 
they cannot, and they should not try to do so. That is 
why we gave the water authorities their present structure. 
However, the Executive will take major strategic 
decisions about the authorities. For example, it will 
allocate public expenditure resources to the authorities, 
approve the annual corporate plans and appoint board 
members. That is why the Executive's powers must 
remain intact.
<P>
The commissioner's job will be to make an objective 
assessment of how much charge income the authorities 
will need to run their businesses. The assessment will take 
into account the requirements placed on the authorities 
by statute and by Ministers to meet certain standards in 
environmental protection, water quality, and so on. The 
assessment will also take account of authorities' ability to 
achieve various efficiency savings.
<P>
On the strength of that assessment, the commissioner 
will frame his advice to Ministers on the extent to which 
charge levels should be permitted to increase or decrease 
during the period covered by the advice. Ministers will 
consider that advice in the light of the commissioner's 
supporting reasons. If they are content with the advice, 
Minister will accept it as it stands. If they are worried 
about any aspect of it, they will be able to amend it, but 
only in extreme cases will they wish to substitute it with 
their own advice.
<P>
It is crucial that the entire process is transparent to the 
Parliament and the public. When amending the 
commissioner's advice, Ministers must state their reasons. 
Subsections (7) requires the commissioner to publish 
original advice and amendments to or substitutions for it, 
along with the Ministers' reasons for making such 
changes. Those changes, and Ministers' grounds for 
making them, will therefore be in the public domain and 
open to scrutiny. Parliament will thus be able to ensure 
that Ministers are held to account for changes that they 
make.
<P>
On losses, and the Executive's ability to intervene in 
such cases, Ministers will seek the commissioner's advice 
on the basis of the continuing ability of water authorities 
to provide essential services. That will involve balancing 
the accompanying cost against water authorities' ability 
to secure efficiencies. Should the commissioner not secure 
that end, he will have failed to give the required advice, 
although we do not foresee such a circumstance.
<P>
Nevertheless, unexpected events could conceivably 
cause the implementation of the commissioner's advice 
inadvertently to result in a water authority getting into 
financial difficulty. In those circumstances, Ministers' 
overriding duty must be to ensure that the authority 
regains a sound financial basis so that it can continue to 
provide the full range of services.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Macdonald:</B> I shall continue because I can perhaps 
answer the question that the hon. Gentleman might have 
in mind.
<P>
In order to protect public health, Ministers must ensure 
the sound financial basis of authorities. However, the 
amendment would prevent them from doing that. In the 
case of a publicly owned industry, there are no 
shareholders to bail out the business. Only Ministers, on 
the public's behalf, could provide the necessary funds, 
whether through additional borrowing or grants.



<P>
Ultimately, Scottish Ministers will be responsible for 
ensuring that the water industry serves its customers. To 
do so, they must have the power to act decisively when 
necessary. As I have said, we do not expect the 
commissioner's advice to result in economic losses for the 
water authorities, but if by some accident, which we 
would regard as a very rare or extreme event, it were to, 
it would be crucial to the maintenance of an essential 
service that Ministers be able to step in with public funds.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I understand the Minister's point about 
external shock and have no problem with that. However, 
let us imagine a case in which the commissioner advises 
setting charges that would be thoroughly achievable while 
producing a normal return on the asset base in 
circumstances in which the authority achieved efficiency 
savings as envisaged by the commissioner. Let us further 
imagine that it turns out at the end of the year that the 
authority has failed to achieve those efficiency savings. It 
may not be driven positively into loss in the sense of the 
profit and loss account, but it has made an economic loss 
as a result of the commissioner's action or, rather, as 
a result of its failure to act properly in the light of the 
commissioner's advice.
<P>
Does the Minister envisage that in those circumstances, 
to protect, for example, the full amount of the negative 
external financing limit owed to it, the Executive could 
step in and ex post change the price cut for example, for 
the following year to earn back, so to speak, for itself 
as owner and shareholder, that negative EFL in the 
subsequent year? If so, the Minister would surely agree 
that that would undermine the purpose of a commissioner, 
because the authority would know that if it failed to 
achieve the efficiency target, nothing worse would befall 
it than to have its price cut reversed in the following year.
<P>
<B>Mr. Macdonald:</B> If the Executive has accepted advice 
from the commissioner on the charges appropriate to 
achieve the objectives set, including efficiency objectives, 
it would be intent on ensuring that the water authorities 
could meet those targets within the context that the 
commissioner sets. The Executive would be mindful and 
keen that efficiency targets be met.
<P>
Ultimately, the Executive has various powers to 
provide such encouragement as the hon. Member for West 
Dorset advocates. Its ultimate power would be to exercise 
its right to appoint the chairman and board of the water 
authority. There is no sense in which that power, which 
is designed to deal with such unforeseen circumstances, 
would be used by an Executive which takes a relaxed 
attitude towards water authorities' failing to achieve their 
targets year on year. On the contrary, given that the 
Executive would have endorsed the targets, having 
received advice from the commissioner, Parliament would 
want to ensure that the Executive ensures that the water 
authorities meet the targets. The ultimate sanction for the 
Executive is its power to appoint the chairman and the 
board. I shall expect that discipline to be enforced because 
it is in the interest of customers generally that efficiency 
targets are met.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> That is reassuring news. I mentioned on 
Second Reading that we would look with great interest in 
due course, two or three years down the line, to ascertain 
whether this first and noble attempt to introduce into the 
relationship between Government and a nationalised 
industry an independent regulator proves effective or mere 
window dressing. The Minister clearly intends it to be 
effective, which is good news. He has said things that 
may make it easier for the general public to try to make 
it effective, in the courts if necessary in due course. I wish 
him and it godspeed, without much optimism on my part 
or on that of Opposition Members that it will in practice 
prove effective, as there seems to be too much danger that 
the Executive will find ways to support its own industry, 
so to speak. However, we shall see. At least the Minister 
intends the right thing, and therefore, with the leave of 
the Committee, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the 
amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the 
Bill.



<P>
<B>Mr. Gorrie:</B> Some of the wise groups who come to see 
foolish MPs came to see me and made points that I 
thought were worth checking out with the Minister.
 <P>
First, subsection (2) (b) states that schemes must be set
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"during such period as the Secretary of State may specify"	.
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I understand that in England the period has been set at 
five years. There is merit in specifying a period, because 
otherwise the period set by the Secretary of State or the 
Scottish Parliament as it will be may be too short to 
work properly or too long to achieve the aim of 
compelling the water boards to focus on medium-term 
budgeting.
<P>
Secondly, I am surprised that there is no mention of the 
commissioner consulting all and sundry. In my limited 
experience, Bills often give instructions on the 
consultation of all sorts of people instructions that are 
often ignored, but which it is nevertheless helpful to 
include in legislation. It would be interesting to hear the 
Minister's views on giving specific instructions to the 
commissioner to consult the local councils and other 
appropriate bodies and on providing elsewhere in the Bill 
that the commissioner has to pay attention to the results 
of such consultation.
<P>
My third point may be covered, but I should like the 
Minister to give clarification. Subsection (4) (a) states that 
the functions referred to in subsection (3) (b) are
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"complying with any duty to which an authority are subject by virtue 
of any enactment"	.
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Does "enactment"	 cover regulations and other legislation 
set down by the European Union which are very 
important in regard to water purity, beach cleanliness and 
so on?
<P>
My fourth point perhaps raises a more interesting 
philosophical point. Subsection (4) (c) states that services 
should be provided
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"at such other standard or level as the Secretary of State may 
specify"	.
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It has been suggested to me that those standards should 
be prescribed by law. The law set out first by this 
Parliament and then by the Scottish Parliament and, 
presumably, the European Parliament will lay down 
standards; the standards imposed on the commissioner by 
the Secretary of State should be the same standards. One 
could conceive of a situation in which the relevant 
Minister in the Scottish Parliament were an over-zealous 
advocate of green issues who imposed standards that he 
or she thought were suitable rather than those legislated 
for by the various Parliaments. The successor Ministers 
in the Scottish Parliament should not be allowed to act on 
whim, even well-intentioned whim.
<P>
My last point refers to subsection (7). It may be a 
pedantic point, but people are suspicious. The subsection 
states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The Commissioner shall arrange for the publication, in such 
manner as he considers appropriate"	
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
of the various forms of advice. There would be merit in 
including the phrase "as soon as practicable"	 because 
people who, for whatever reason, are not anxious to air a 
subject can often find reasons for delaying publication on 
it. Although I have not tabled amendments on those 
points, they are worthy of consideration. I hope that the 
Minister will respond to them and, perhaps after 
consultations with his civil servants, meet some of them 
in due course.
<P>
<B>Mr. Macdonald:</B> Perhaps I can answer all those points. 
If I get something wrong, I am sure that I will be 
corrected. I shall write to the hon. Member for 
Edinburgh, West.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman is right to say that the purpose of 
having a longer-term look at charges schemes is to allow 
the sort of stability that water authorities seek for their 
financial planning. The expectation is that charges 
schemes will be between three and five years' duration. 
Ultimately, that will be a matter for the Executive and 
Ministers to advise on under the guidance of the 
Parliament.



<P>
The second point made by the hon. Member for 
Edinburgh, West was about the commissioner and the 
requirement to consult local authorities. It is important to 
note that we have issued guidance for water authorities, 
stating that they should consult local authorities and take 
heed of local interests. Of course, the consultative 
committees, which the commissioner will chair, will be 
composed of consumers and will be in tune with local 
interests. In that way, there will be no gaps that could 
cause worry in terms of feeding in the viewpoints of local 
authorities and local communities, both to water 
authorities directly and to the commissioner and the 
consultative committees. The water authorities will be 
expected to comply with all relevant European legislation 
as it applies in Scotland.
<P>
The hon. Member for Edinburgh, West asked about the 
environmental standards for the water authorities and the 
commissioner. He said that they should include not only 
those set down by the Secretary of State but those 
contained in statute law. The intention is that the relevant 
environmental standards in Scottish law will apply to the 
water authorities.
<P>
Finally, the hon. Gentleman asked about the 
commissioner publishing advice and the possibility that 
that might be in some way delayed for some sinister 
reason. I think that the hon. Gentleman can take 
reassurance from the fact that it is not the Executive which 
will publish the advice; the commissioner will decide 
when and how advice, and the response that he has 
received from the Executive, should be published. That is 
a vital power to leave in the hands of the commissioner 
because it provides a safeguard for his operational 
independence.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gorrie:</B> I wish to clarify two points. As the 
Minister has said, part of the consultation will be 
undertaken through the consultative committees. 
However, it is not clear whether the commissioner will 
have carte blanche as to whom he appoints to those 
committees; or whether, as part of the consultation 
process, the Parliament and the Scottish Minister could 
specify that the members of the council had to be 
representative in some way.
<P>
The Minister said that all the legal standards will be 
applied, but it was unclear whether it will be all right for 
the Minister to impose more severe standards than the 
legal standard, or will he have to adhere to the legal 
standard?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Macdonald:</B> If the Minister wished to impose a 
more severe standard, he would have to have authority 
from the Scottish Parliament to do so. Certainly the 
standards could be upped by the Parliament and then 
imposed on the commissioner. The commissioner will 
appoint the consultative committee, but I imagine that that 
will be done in the context of guidance about the 
composition of the committee provided by the Parliament 
through the relevant Minister. Part of the commissioner's 
task will be to assess the degree to which local authorities 
are carrying out their various duties and obligations placed 
on them by the Parliament. One of those is the obligation 
to consult local authorities and local interests in framing 
their policies and strategies.
