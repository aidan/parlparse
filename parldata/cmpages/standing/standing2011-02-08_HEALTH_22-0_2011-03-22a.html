                        <p class="tabbed">At the last
election, my experience was that members of the governing coalition
parties made great play and political capital of campaigning against
any hospital or acute service closure, or even possible closure. Does
the Minister have anything to say to the experienced and dedicated
staff who will face the full impact of his plans for upheaval and
disruption? Will he describe market failure to them? There seems to be
a reluctance to describe it to the
Committee.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000055">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Many
questions on the future of the bureaucracy in the NHS still need to be
answered. Great play has been made of the fact that the Secretary of
State has promised that this is not a top-down reorganisation of
bureaucracy, but the abolition of it, and the Prime Minister said last
Wednesday at Prime Minister’s
questions:<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000056">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“We
are not reorganising the bureaucracy of the NHS… We are
abolishing the bureaucracy of the NHS.”—[<em>Official
Report</em>, 16 March 2011; Vol. 525, c.
292.]<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000949">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>In that
case, how would the Minister describe the two thirds of the Bill that
set out the rules for competition? Will he venture a guess or an
estimate now of the cost to the NHS of the proposals both for failure
regimes and for
designation?<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000057">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">If
Committee members are not minded to support my arguments, perhaps they
might want to listen to the arguments being made by the hon. Member for
Totnes (Dr Wollaston), a former GP who serves on the Select Committee
on Health and who I understand wished to serve on this Committee. She
said that the plans would result in the NHS going
“belly-up”, not “top-down”. She went on to
say
that<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000058">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“if
Monitor, the new economic regulator, is filled with competition
economists with a zeal for imposing competition at every opportunity,
then the NHS could be changed beyond recognition. It is no use
‘liberating’ the NHS from top-down political control only
to shackle it to an unelected economic
regulator.”<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000950">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>We
have not seen anything in the Bill that would rein in Monitor, and I
hope that the Minister will look again at making significant changes to
the current approach, which will result in service failures, a
bureaucratic nightmare and an over-powerful economic regulator
dictating local service closures—not based on quality or local
needs, but on economics and competition.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000059">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Okay. May I take him up on the first issue of the
principle of designation? Presumably, if he is against the principle of
designation, he is in favour of a system whereby all services,
regardless of their value to the community or their indispensability,
are judged by, broadly speaking, the same criteria when people make
decisions on whether to use those services or not. I thought that we
were all genuinely uncomfortable with that, and the legislation seems
to indicate that most of us on this side of the Committee would be
uncomfortable with that because we feel that some services in a special
category ought not to fall due to any sort of market failure or
commercial competition, and that other services are in a rather
different category. I think the general public feel like
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000063">&#160;</a>

has to visualise what the situation would look like if we were to take
away designation per se. I think it would look similar to what it is
now. As I understand it, there is no process of designation at the
moment. If we compare, for example, the Co-operation and Competition
Panel with Monitor, we see what Monitor would look like without
designation.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000064">&#160;</a>

did he support so many of those requirements that were put into health
legislation and demanded competition? We have an organisation somewhat
similar to Monitor, existing today, called the Co-operation and
Competition Panel, which does similar sorts of things. It has to
balance collaboration and competition. As far as I know, it was not
tasked by the previous Government to do anything about health
inequalities. It has similar functions to Monitor, although Labour
wants Monitor to do something about health inequalities. It has to
consider the impact and availability of choice and competition, which
Monitor has as a parallel
function.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000066">&#160;</a>

charged with striking a balance between collaboration and competition,

                           </strong> We will accept that there has been a degree of
mission creep in what it does. We are debating what Monitor can and
cannot do. I am not aware that there was any parallel debate with
regard to the creation of the Co-operation and Competition Panel,
although it impacts in all our constituencies. Apparently, we cannot
even abolish it, because officially it is not a statutory body. It is
something that has emerged and been implemented by the previous
Government; presumably it was implemented because the Secretary of
State at the time thought that there was a purpose to it.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000070">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Most of the
criticisms that the hon. Member for Halton has made of Monitor in this
debate—there are others to be made, which I might share with
him—are also criticisms that could be made of the Co-operation
and Competition Panel. It is unaccountable. There is a huge issue about
accountability, particularly of these organisations that are making
important judgments with a balance of considerations, which have a
strategic impact. There is a question mark over whether an organisation
such as that is strictly speaking just a regulator, or whether it is
more of a strategic body. None the less, I think he would accept that
both bodies are unaccountable. I have never written to the Co-operation
and Competition Panel, nor have I found a way of doing so, but it has
impacted in my constituency. My hospital, to make ends meet,
because it has a fairly substantial deficit, has had to work with other
hospitals in a collaborative way and share pathology services
throughout Merseyside. Before it could do that,  however, it
had to go to the Co-operation and Competition Panel to satisfy it that
there was sufficient competition
around.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000071">&#160;</a>

Well, I do not know where the Co-operation and Competition Panel lives,

down. All those things could be said about the pre-existing

through <em>Hansard</em>, part of his critique of Monitor doing its
designation process was that it cannot do that properly because it is
not in touch with the local scene. I do not know how far the
Co-operation and Competition Panel is in touch with what goes on in the
Southport and Merseyside health economy, but I doubt that it is not
more in touch than Monitor would
be.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000075">&#160;</a>

hon. Members look at the provisions of the Bill dealing with what
Monitor will do, they will see that the additional clauses in the Bill
make it fairly explicit that although the panel does not have to take
on board financial aspects and consequences, Monitor will have to do
so. In a sense, it is an attempt to finesse a model that already
exists. That said, however, I take the point that if Monitor is to
perform a series of complex processes—balancing considerations
and working out what is designated and what is not—there is a
genuine issue about
accountability.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000076">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
accept the point made by the hon. Member for Oldham East and
Saddleworth that the remit of the two organisations is not exactly
identical, but the functions that they will perform within the health
system have similar consequences. Members should not content themselves
with the belief that there is a bad world ahead, and that the sort of
things that they complain about are not happening now. In the past 24
hours, I have discovered that the dermatological unit at the local
hospital in my constituency will be deprived of a contract, because
Assura Medical has bid for and got it—presumably on price
competition. It has got the unit although it does not have a consultant
urologist, or a base to work from. That is what is
happening.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000077">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There
is a case for defining more clearly in legislation than we have done so
far what fair competition is, because appalling things have happened.
To cite another example from my constituency—I am not shy of
citing examples, unlike the Minister—the urologists in my local
hospital are working partly in a private hospital that also gets
patients who are referred from the local community. In effect, they are
using their talents and abilities to worsen the budget of the local
hospital and create a financial problem. Simultaneously, they are paid
by the NHS and getting NHS pensions. One hospital picks up their
pension bill, and the other picks up the reward for their services,
through the commissioning that the PCT gives it. That does not strike
me as fair
competition.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000078">&#160;</a>

of my examples are current today; they are live at the moment. We have
to recognise that, if we accept that there has to be a degree of
competition, it has to be framed so that the competition is fair. The
Bill must do that; simply leaving things alone is not an option. The
Bill will not get rid of cherry-picking, because that is happening
today in

Orwellian term, “designation”, is precisely the degree of
competition to which we are about to open the
NHS.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000086">&#160;</a>

my extremely experienced right hon. Friend the Member for Rother
Valley, I understand absolutely what designation means. The Minister
has told us on several occasions, effectively, what it means: it is
about protectionism—a permissive protectionism within the NHS.
It is identifying those areas of NHS services that are not too big to
fail, but that are too important to fail, and therefore need to be
protected from
competition.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000087">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The Minister is shrugging his shoulders, rolling
his eyes and looking exasperated, but that is precisely what he has
said on a couple of occasions today: that designation is about
affording protection—<em>[</em>
                           <em>Interruption.</em>
                           <em>]</em> With
respect, I am precisely mirroring the context. He said that it was
about affording protection to vital services which need to be
protected. The question therefore is: protected from what? Clearly, the
answer is: protected from the impact of being competed with and
competed out of the market; the impact on patients of a service either
not having competition at all, and therefore needing to be preserved
because it is the only service 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 942<a class="bkMark" name="Column942">&#160;</a>
                           </div>available to patients in that locale, or having other competitors coming
into the market and potentially eroding and undercutting that service.

                           <em>Interruption.</em>
                           <em>]</em> I am not going to go into price
competition, no. We know precisely what the measure is about:
competition, the interrelationship between designation and competition,
and allowing protectionism within the NHS and ring-fencing certain
services so that they are not undermined by competition. That is clear,
and I think the public will understand it as
well.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000089">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">What
is much less clear is how designation will work. We have already heard
a lot of questions about how designation will work. We read in the Bill
and the explanatory notes that local knowledge will be the key driver
of designation. I assume that local clinicians who are commissioners,
and the commissioners they employ, whether private sector or
transferees from the primary care trusts and strategic health
authorities, will be the people with the local knowledge to determine
which services ought to be protected—in other words,
designated.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000090">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
problem with such a system is that, as far as Monitor is concerned, the
key criterion for allowing designation is whether there is
competition—alternative providers. I understand how a
commissioner and a clinician locally can judge whether his service is
so intrinsically valuable to his patients that it absolutely ought to
be designated, but I cannot understand—I ask the Minister to
explain—how those local commissioners in their local hospital or
GP consortium will have sufficient knowledge of the nature, type and
availability of alternative providers out in their local marketplaces
such that they can deem that their service need to be protected. I
cannot see how that could be the
case.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000091">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Also,
in the Minister’s comments to date, I cannot see an answer to
what he means by “local”. In a world where there are
multiple entrants into the health care market, how are we to determine
whether a service—radiotherapy or pathology services, or
technical assays, which are vital to determining whether a patient
ought to be given medicine x or y—that is being provided by a
multinational corporation, or one operating on a pan-UK basis, but at a
local level, constitutes the competition that means a service cannot be
designated? If so, local knowledge will seriously be called into
question, because it will not have sufficient insight into pan-UK
issues.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000092">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Secondly,
we have heard repeatedly from the Minister that quality will be the key
arbiter or determinant of decisions—not price, but quality. How
on earth can we expect local commissioners, who are the people who have
to determine whether a service ought to be designated, to understand
and to have sufficient insight into the quality of the alternative
providers’ offers such that they can determine that the
provision will not be sufficiently robust, safe or worth while for
their patients, and therefore ought not to be allowed to compete for
the delivery of that service? I cannot see how they would have any
insight into the quality of the alternative providers’ services.
Monitor, too, from its lofty heights in London, will likewise have very
little insight into the relative qualities of the local provider and
the new competitive entrant into the
marketplace.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000093">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Thirdly,
why are all of the changes happening? The language is absolutely clear.
Most of the phrases in the Bill and in the mouth of the Minister today,
including about inefficient providers being bailed out wholesale,
market mechanisms not working properly and poor 
<div class="columnNumber">

Chancellor or the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and
Skills in the context of economic regulation than they are in the mouth
of a Health Minister. They reveal the economic drive behind all the
changes—the financial drive and the drive to see competition
delivering quality and improvements in the NHS. The Minister has not
persuaded us that quality is the key driver. He has not persuaded
anyone that the Bill is well thought through, because in this instance
as in so many others, there are more holes in it than a Swiss
cheese.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000094">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
have two brief points about the definition of words in the clause, and
I would appreciate the Minister’s help. First, it is extremely
important to have clarity on what constitutes a service. Services can
be salami-sliced down to very small items or, as others have said, they
can be an agglomeration. One could say that, in an acute hospital, a
service is not only the accident and emergency, but some—not
necessarily all—of the other wards associated with it. That
might constitute a block of service or, under other definitions,
several services. How will Monitor interpret that
word?<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000096">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

                           <strong>
                              <span class="hs_CLMember">Liz
Kendall:<a class="bkMark" name="11032362001076">&#160;</a>
                              </span>
                           </strong> As a first step, does the hon. Gentleman agree
that not only is it the GP commissioners who need to say whether a
service is essential and cannot be allowed to fail, but that, to
determine that, they need to understand what the knock-on effect of the
failure of one service would be on other services? Not only Monitor,
but GPs must have that understanding. Does he believe that GP
commissioners fully understand the integrated nature of all the
available
services?<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000097">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

                              </span>
                           </strong> That is a good point. In most cases, GP
commissioners probably do, and clause 69(1) states that
the<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000098">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

Monitor”.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000951">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>The
ball is therefore very much in the GPs’ court and I expect them,
particularly as they grow used to the idea of commissioning services,
to pick that up quickly. Certainly, in my experience, local GPs have a
very good understanding of the need for a core block of services. What
that block constitutes might differ from a district general hospital to
a major teaching hospital, but it is extremely important that Monitor
appreciates that and does not take a nit-picking approach to what
constitutes a service. I would welcome the Minister’s
comments.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000099">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">My
second question—apologies for being tedious about this—is
on the definition of “alternative providers”. To take an
example from my own area, stroke services used to be provided by what
is now the University hospital of North Staffordshire, by New Cross
hospital in Wolverhampton and by Stafford hospital. Stroke services are
no longer provided by Stafford hospital for various reasons—not
only economic but quality reasons, I understand—although I hope
those services will return at some
point.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000100">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
all Members will know, what is vital in providing a stroke service is
how quickly the patient can be got to where the service is provided.
The location, the road

                           </div>network, the density of traffic and whether there are constant traffic
jams—as there are in certain parts of the west midlands, so that
it can take half an hour to travel two miles—are all extremely
important in defining who is a willing provider. A hospital 10 miles
down the road may be a willing provider, and on the map it may look to
Monitor as though it is an extremely good provider, but in realistic
terms a patient would not have a hope of surviving a stroke if it was
the local provider because all those road transport factors would mean
that the ambulance service, as the hon. Member for Leicester West will
know, would not be able to guarantee to get the patient to that
hospital in
time.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000101">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
am looking for some assurance from the Minister on both those points.
Can he assure me that Monitor will not take a desiccated
accountant’s—I am an accountant myself—approach to
what constitutes a service, but will take a realistic approach,
informed by local commissioners, to what a local alternative provider
is and what constitutes a block of services that makes sense for an
area?<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000102">&#160;</a>

just that—one cannot set a time scale on that. The hon.
Gentleman refers to time scales of “not until after the first
year of designation” and “within 10 years of
designation”, but that relates to the requirements to review the
designation decision taken. What he was talking about just now is
future needs in a generality of what should be designated, which is
slightly different. I do not think there is much further we can go on
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000114">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I will take the hon. Gentleman’s word for
that. My response will reflect what I have already said. It will not be
for Ministers to define how and when the designation processes will be
run. It will be for Monitor to give guidance on the process, based on
the clear criteria in the Bill and building on best practice in other
sectors. Monitor will be required to run a full consultation on its
guidance, on the designation process and on the methodology to define
how much designated services providers will pay into the risk pool. In
that, as in other functions, Monitor will be under a duty to promote
the economic, efficient and effective provision of health care services
and to avoid imposing unnecessary burdens.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000121">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The hon.
Gentleman asked whether GP consortia will have the skills required to
run a designation process. Anything that is relatively new to some GPs
will of course offer some challenges, although they will be aided by
Monitor’s guidance. However, we believe that GPs are ideally
placed to make decisions on which services need additional regulation,
as they have the hands-on clinical knowledge and expertise regarding
the needs of their patients. The designation process will be a key part
of the commissioners’ role, which they should be gearing up from
the start to deliver
effectively.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000122">&#160;</a>

Southport has said. Monitor is in charge of the whole process, not the
Government—the Minister says it will be up to Monitor to decide.
Will he put on the record that the Government, who are putting the Bill
through Parliament, have no idea when the process of designation will
start, how long it will take, or how much it will cost?

                        <p class="tabbed">Let me try
the next lot of questions. The hon. Gentleman has asked whether GP
consortia have the required skills to run the designation process. As I
have said, that will be challenging, but aided by Monitor’s
guidance and that of existing PCTs in the run-up to the changeover, GPs
will have the relevant expertise or will develop it. I do not share the
hon. Gentleman’s doubts. As he will appreciate, the designation
process will be a key part of commissioners’ roles, which they
should gear up to from the start to deliver effectively. Help from the
PCTs, guidance and some GPs’ experience of commissioning will
enable an effective and efficient system of commissioning for
patients.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000129">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The hon.
Gentleman suggested that designation would lead to some kind of
free-for-all for management consultants. On the contrary, Monitor will
learn how best to design the process from the experience of other
regulated industries. I would be happy to get into a debate on
management consultants with him, given the previous Government’s
record of using them and the fact that this Government have introduced
a moratorium on public sector use of management consultants; however, I
would not like to fall foul of you, Dr McCrea, by straying beyond the
remit of the clause.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000130">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The hon.
Gentleman asked about separating designated and non-designated services
in a provider, as the same equipment could be used. There is no reason
why equipment cannot be used by both designated and non-designated
services, as designation is not about closing services but about
deciding which ones require additional regulation. It will be for
providers to decide how best to use their staff and equipment. In doing
so, they can build on the experience of other sectors: health services
are different from other services, but there is valuable experience to
draw on in other areas. I get the feeling that if we had not looked at
the strengths, weaknesses and relevance of other areas from which to
draw best practice, or anything that would help to make the proposals
far more effective and efficient, we would be criticised for not having
done so, so in that respect, where the hon. Gentleman is concerned, it
is a lose-lose situation, because he will not accept anything that does
not fit into his
criteria.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000131">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Gentleman asked why some essential services may not be designated.
I shall repeat a point I made earlier, as it is at the heart of this
debate. Whether a service is designated is not the same as whether it
is essential. Non-designation simply indicates that alternative
providers are available. Where services are not designated, the
mechanism for securing service continuity will be led by commissioners
through legally binding
contracts.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000132">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Members for Halton and for Easington raised concerns about how
others will be involved in commissioners’ decisions on
designation. Commissioners will be required to run a full consultation
on what services they wish to designate, as set out in clause 69(9) to
(11). Those subsections require commissioners to consult service users,
local authorities and healthwatch, so there is significant scope for
local involvement in the designation
process.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000133">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Member for Halton suggested that service designation would be a
top-down exercise imposed by Monitor. On the contrary, the decisions
will be made 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 948<a class="bkMark" name="Column948">&#160;</a>
                           </div>locally by commissioners in consultation with local patients and
communities. Monitor’s role— I hope the hon. Gentleman
listens to this—is simply to ensure that the criterion for
designated services is met and that there have been proper
consultations.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000134">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
is, to my mind, somewhat ridiculous to suggest that Monitor would
somehow become omnipresent, as the hon. Gentleman implied. The Bill
opens up decisions about services to an unprecedented degree of
transparency and democratic scrutiny, and it ensures that those
decisions are made locally. I have to tell the hon. Gentleman that that
is a huge improvement on the current situation in which an
unaccountable, hierarchical bureaucracy is free to intervene in local
decisions with very little transparency at all. Let me be clear: our
proposals will put an end to the hidden subsidies that have been used
in the past to prop up failing and inefficient providers taking money
out of the budgets of successful providers or forcing commissioners to
pay artificially high prices to reward poor management
elsewhere.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000135">&#160;</a>

to the Committee in detail when we debated clause 175, and I do not
propose to re-open that debate, Dr McCrea. I will simply add that I
entirely agree with the point made that reconfiguration will not happen
if left to market forces alone, as I think the King’s Fund
recently argued. The Government have never suggested that approach.
Consortia will be able to work together and with the commissioning
board to make strategic decisions about services across large areas
where that is necessary. Where there are interdependencies between
services or a need for integrated care pathways, that is something that
commissioners will be able to plan
for.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000140">&#160;</a>

What I said was that we will not force patients to use, or taxpayers to

propping up failing providers, there will be a transparent mechanism
for managing provider failure that protects essential services and
allows commissioners to replace services with higher quality or better

                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Member for Pontypridd asked a number of questions. One was on how
often services would be reviewed for redesignation. We will deal with
that in later amendments, as I said earlier. It would be sensible to
wait until we get to that part of the Bill, which will be soon. The
hon. Gentleman raised the perfectly valid point of what counts as
local. It is simple. The local population is that which a commissioner
is responsible for. Local services are those available to the local
population to meet their needs. In that way, commissioners would review
the availability of services to meet the needs of their population and
would apply to Monitor where additional regulation was needed to secure
continued access to services in the absence of alternative providers.
The hon. Gentleman also said that designation is the protectionism of
services that are too important to fail. I would not altogether agree
with that. Designation is about the protection of services that are
provided by a sole provider in that locality. If such a service should
fail, and the impact of that failure would cause significant harm to
patients, that service needs additional regulation to ensure the
continuity of that
service.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000151">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">My
hon. Friend the Member for Stafford asked what the definition of
services was for the purposes of designation. I hope I can reassure him
on that point. It would be for the responsible commissioner to
determine what constitutes a service, or block of services, for those
purposes. As I said this morning, commissioners would need to have
regard to any interlinkages between services, as well as the
availability of alternative providers of 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 950<a class="bkMark" name="Column950">&#160;</a>
                           </div>those services. Those considerations would be different for emergency
stroke care, compared with elective specialities such as orthopaedics
or dermatology.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000152">&#160;</a>

                           </span> This is on the same
point, because this is about designating a service as opposed to an
institution. Can the Minister see a situation where a department in a
local hospital—for example, radiography—was not
designated, so the commissioners ask for it to be designated and
Monitor says no, because it does not think that it is up to standard
and because radiography is available elsewhere in the area? I say that
because I represent an urban seat and there are plenty of hospitals
with radiography services within travelling distance of my house. Can
he envisage a situation where a service was not designated and so would
not be offered by that
department?<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000153">&#160;</a>

alternative to the NHS provider could be. It could be the private

                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Member for Pontypridd asked how quality will be built into the
designation process. Monitor’s guidance will be key in
explaining to commissioners how quality should be built in. Monitor
will run a full consultation on its guidance, and it will seek
responses from the Care Quality Commission to ensure that quality is
built into that
guidance.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000156">&#160;</a>

suspect that the hon. Gentleman can anticipate from past experience
what my answer will be. I will most certainly not speculate on what may
or may not happen in the future. However, it is beyond doubt that the
previous Administration presided over a system in which successful
organisations were forced to bail the same failed management out year
after year. The evidence is for all to see in the published NHS
accounts. Apart from not being transparent, the problem with the old
system was that it maintained the wrong incentives. Successful
organisations were penalised, failing organisations could duck
difficult decisions, and patients and taxpayers ultimately lost
out.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000157">&#160;</a>

control over Monitor’s competition duties to safeguard
patients’ interests. The Bill provides the legal framework

continue the practice of paying non-transparent bail-outs that may

properly, are not being supported, or where guidance is not being
followed in terms of procedure and support, he should say what they
are. Interestingly, on designation and non-designation,

                           </div>he says that Monitor will stick to what the guidance says. It is
Monitor, however, which draws that guidance up. That will be crucial in
terms of how this process works, and we have no sight or idea of it,
which is frankly, appalling. I hope that the Minister will look again
at whether he can give us more information.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000170">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The Minister
also does not know how long the process will take, when it will start,
or when it will end. There is no guidance on that, which is incredible.
This is a major change to the health service, but we do not have that
information. Finally, perhaps the Minister will write to me, because he
did not answer my question about whether designation in the clause
applies to GP services.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000171">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Sorry, I did forget that. I apologise—I had
forgotten initially, but I have the answer now. Will GPs be designated?
In principle, they could be, but I do not want to go into too much
detail on what services will or will not be designated, because it will
be for the commissioners to
decide—<em>[</em>

periods for which services will be designated. As drafted, the clause
provides that commissioners must conduct reviews of designated
services, to ensure that they continue to meet the criteria for
designation, at some point between one and 10 years after the previous
review. These amendments will enable Monitor to specify when in that
period the reviews should take place. Having regulatory periods for
designated services set by Monitor would ensure that the system on
designation and the review of designation were clear and transparent to
all. It would also enable Monitor to properly manage the financial
mechanisms that would provide financial assistance to providers in
health special administration and ensure the continuity of designated
services in the event of
failure.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000209">&#160;</a>

the fund met that risk. In its written evidence to this Committee, the

an important point when she asked the Minister why it was 10 years and
in fairness, I do not think he explained the rationale behind that.
What if a mistake were made with the non-designation of a service in
the first six months and so outside the first year? Does he think the
levy payment to the risk fund will influence commissioners’
decisions to commission services? I am not sure whether the money would
come directly from the designated service provider or whether the
commissioner would have to pay for it. It would be useful to know

answer to my question. If the key determinant of whether a service
ought to be designated is whether there is adequate competition for
that service, will there be further reviews of designation between that
one and 10-year period when new entrants come into the market? If it is

also asked how the decision between one and 10 years is made. I will
repeat the point: it has been considered that 10 years is a reasonable
time limit for an upper limit. It would be for Monitor to determine,
having regard to the nature of particular services and the contents of
the evolving health economy. However, Monitor’s powers would be
to set the timetable for reviews when the criteria are met. There is no
arbitrary limit on duration of designation per

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment 512
is a minor, technical amendment that clarifies the drafting of clause
71 to make it clear that Monitor is able to refuse or accept an
application. The current drafting might suggest that Monitor must
accept an application. The amendment also makes it clear that Monitor
must only agree to the removal of a designation if the criterion is no
longer met.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000256">&#160;</a>

513 and 514 are consequential amendments to clause 71 to reflect new
clauses 12 and 13, which enable complaints to be made against
Monitor’s decision following an application under clause 69.
Amendment 515 removes subsections (8) to (10) of clause 71,
which detail how Monitor must handle complaints on decisions to
designate. These provisions will be replaced by four new, more
comprehensive clauses that will extend the right to complain and will
provide greater transparency on how Monitor must respond to complaints
about its decisions on designation. They will, for example, require
Monitor to explain the reasons why it has refused an application for
the removal of a designation.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000257">&#160;</a>

new clauses 12 and 13 are similar to new clauses 10 and 11 in
clarifying the appeals process with regard to designated services. They
will govern how complaints could be made in response to
Monitor’s decision to accept or refuse an application from
commissioners for the removal of designation under subsection (3) of
clause 71. Clause 71(3) allows commissioners to apply to Monitor for
the removal of a designation of a particular service if they believe
the criterion for designation is no longer met. That might be, for
example, because the commissioner has been able to introduce new
providers locally and therefore the additional protection that
designation offers is no longer needed.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000258">&#160;</a>

new clause 12 will allow the provider of a designated service to
complain against Monitor’s decision to remove the designation.
The new clause will require Monitor to re-examine its original decision

tribunal if it believes that Monitor’s decision on the complaint
was based on an error of fact, was wrong in law or was

described a situation in which a provider—I presume that he
meant an NHS provider—might complain about the removal of the
designation of a service by Monitor. Will he confirm that the
complainant about a designation might also be an alternative provider,
whether it is an alternative hospital or a private provider intending
to offer the service in that local health economy? Might such providers
complain to Monitor that the service ought not to be provided? If so,
it speaks to the question that I asked earlier—perhaps I was not
clear—about whether the complaint would then trigger a re-review
by Monitor of the designation. How often in that period between the
first and 10th years might re-reviews of designation occur, and is it
not most likely that fewer and fewer services will be designated as
more and more entrants come into the market, reducing the rationale for
designation under the

                        <p class="tabbed">From our
discussions today, the process of designation seems technically
complex. It will require commissioners to determine what local services
are essential by judging and measuring outcomes and travel times. Those
are complicated issues that the national commissioning board, civil
servants and primary care trusts already find extremely challenging to
determine. The commissioners will have

                           </div>to assess future health needs and the links between different services.
If one service is designated but another is not, what will be the
knock-on effect on providers? They will have to consult relevant
stakeholders, draw together all the evidence and put it to Monitor, who
will then judge by guidance that has not yet come out. The Minister
said in a previous discussion that Monitor’s annual budget will
go up to £140 million from £20 million at
present; no wonder, when it has all that to do. What estimate has he
made of the costs of that technically complex and politically
challenging process for GP commissioning
consortia?<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000269">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I will answer the hon. Lady in two ways. First,
there is the cost of the modernisation programme as reflected in the
White Paper and the Bill, and which is in the impact assessment. As we
have discussed before, it is a one-off cost of £1.4 billion. I
will spare her and the Committee the other side of that, which is the
savings that will be made.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000270">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Secondly, it
is premature to give a figure on the cost of the designation process to
GP consortia. As the hon. Lady knows, we have pathfinders at the
moment, which we are looking at carefully. At the appropriate time, we
will have to reach a decision on the sum that we will provide to
consortia for their management costs. We have taken no final decisions
on that because of the pathfinders, and we will not do so until the
appropriate moment in the light of those pathfinders. There is some
other information that may help the hon. Lady with regard to the skills
of consortia, but I will save time now because the she does not need
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000271">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Will the Minister clarify whether the pathfinders
are looking at the cost of the process of designation? Will the cost of
designating a service have to come from the admin costs that the
Government said they have capped to, I think, £35 or £40
a
head?<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000272">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> On the first question, I would reverse the process.
With the pathfinders, GP consortia will be learning a lot, and so will
we, by watching the example of the development of the pathfinders and
their operations, so that we will be able to reach
decisions—<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000273">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> No, not specifically. The pathfinders at the moment
are, as the hon. Lady knows, voluntary bodies of GP practices joining
to form consortia so that they can begin the process of developing the
full range of GP consortia when the modernisation is fully implemented.
They will work with a number of people, such as the PCTs, and look to
employ people with experience and expertise where they wish, to help
them with their commissioning. We will study what they do, their
experiences and the pros and cons of what emerges from those
pathfinders so that at the appropriate moment we will be able to reach
realistic decisions on questions such as the cost of management. The
hon. Lady used the figure in the public domain; it may be somewhere
between £25 and £35 per patient per year. At this stage,
however, it is a little premature to say what the costs will be and how
much money will be made available for management and administration. We
will have to wait and see.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000275">&#160;</a>

with them and others to estimate the total amount of money that they
will require, including designation. It is all part and parcel of the
process, and we will have to take decisions when we have more

intention is to ensure that regulatory burden would not be imposed
where it was not needed, keeping the system targeted and proportionate.
For example, GPs providing only traditional primary care
‘gatekeeper’ services might be exempted as, initially at
least, they might not require sector-specific competition regulation or
additional regulation to support the continuity of
services.”<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000952">&#160;</a>

Minister may recall I asked before whether designation would apply to
GP services and the Minister said that it could. Here we have another
part of the Bill which says that, in terms of licensing—this
comes under Monitor again—gatekeeper services might be exempted
initially, therefore they could be. This could apply to them in the
future. Also, would he like to say whether there are other services GPs
provide which would be subject to this licensing procedure?<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000313">&#160;</a>

licensing procedure could also apply to GP services—certainly
gatekeeper services. There are other services that GPs provide as well.
Does that exclude the other services or just gatekeeper services? This
is important because we are finding now that GP services can be subject
to competition. I do not know whether GPs are aware of this, but they
might have quite an interesting conversation with their
representatives.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000318">&#160;</a>

exemptions from the need to hold a licence. The exemptions can be for a
type of provider or a type of activity, conditional or unconditional

notwithstanding the exemption—to comply with certain directions

                        <p class="tabbed">We want to
ensure that regulation is necessary and proportionate. The clause
allows the Secretary of State to make exemptions from the general
requirement to hold a licence. Exemptions are
important to avoid creating an unnecessary burden on providers where it
is not necessary or proportionate to impose price controls and other
economic conditions on their operations, over and above contractual
requirements.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000320">&#160;</a>

to the Government’s consultation expressed support for a
transparent and proportionate system with no exceptions for large
providers and a test of materiality for smaller providers. Regulations
would create exemptions in respect of individual providers, types of
provider or the provision of particular services. For example, they
could provide an exemption for GP practices or providers of general
medical
services.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000322">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
clause provides sufficient flexibility for exemptions to be temporary
or permanent and conditional or unconditional. For example, regulations
could exempt a provider from the general requirement to hold a licence
on condition that the provider would nevertheless be obliged to comply
with certain directions from Monitor. Such flexibility would enable the
Secretary of State to provide for the wide variety of circumstances
that might arise.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000323">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">However, the
details of the exemption regime will be of key importance and interest,
which is why the clause provides that before making regulations, the
Secretary of State must consult Monitor, the NHS commissioning board,
the CQC and HealthWatch England. He must also publish notice of the
consultation, which must last not less than 28 days. The provisions
ensure proper transparency and accountability in relation to the
exemptions
regime.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000324">&#160;</a>

inserts a new provision stating that the Secretary of State must give
notice to providers if he plans to withdraw an exemption that has been

or Monitor to give providers notice of any proposed changes in their

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment 449
would modify clause 77 to require the Secretary of State to give a
minimum of 28 days’ notice before giving a direction withdrawing
an exemption from a person who belongs to a group of exempted persons.
The 28-day period would start on the day after that on which the person
received the notice stating the Secretary of State’s intention
to withdraw the exemption. It is stipulated elsewhere in this part of
the Bill that notice periods should last for 28 days beginning on the
day after that on which the notice is received. That is a standard
approach in line with regulatory best practice. Clause 133(2) makes
provision about when a notice is to be treated as having been received.
To give providers clarity about regulatory requirements and avoid
confusion about regulatory processes, we believe that it is important
to standardise the provisions relating to notice periods throughout the
Bill. The amendment proposes to make the provisions in clause 77

                        <p>We
propose to remove the reference to accountability from the clause to
avoid confusion and clarify the role of the economic regulator. To be
clear, we absolutely recognise the need for accountability throughout
the health-care system. Regulated bodies should be accountable to their
regulators, directors and governors of foundation trusts to their
members, and providers and commissioners to the patients and members of
the public whom they serve, just to highlight a few
examples.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000345">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">However,
the examples that I have just given illustrate the complex system of
accountability that is needed if the NHS is to function correctly. Many
different groups and individuals need to be held accountable by many
others if patients are to be protected and quality of service to be
improved. Therefore, we felt that it would be unhelpful and potentially
confusing to place a single duty on Monitor to set licence conditions
designed to ensure accountability, as it would not be the sole
responsibility of Monitor to bring that about. Instead, we propose in
the clause to allow Monitor to set licence conditions related to
governance, which is for an economic regulator to oversee. Monitor is
then given powers elsewhere in the Bill to ensure that the regulated
bodies that it oversees are accountable to it—for instance, the
ability to take enforcement action against bodies that do not comply
with licence conditions or the requirement to hold a
licence.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000346">&#160;</a>

could not exercise over independent providers. However, the amendment
does mean that Monitor will have to examine its proposed regulatory
regime and ensure that any differences in the way it treats providers
based on their ownership or status are fair and can be justified. It
will sit alongside subsections (3), (4), (5) and (6) of
clause 87, which limit the ability of Monitor to set differential

effect of the amendment is to ensure that Monitor’s licensing
regime cannot tilt the competitive playing field towards a particular
type of licensee—for example, away from NHS organisations and
towards independent providers—in a way that is unfair. We are
seeking to be helpful and make sure that there is no doubt, and that
Monitor is not able to play the system—for want of a better

suggests that, in order to address the issue of a level playing field
and the NHS having advantage over a private provider, as assessed by
Monitor, the private provider would have access to the facilities in an
NHS hospital on a rota basis. The paragraph specifically refers to

complying with the requirements of the regulator by arguing that the
scope of appropriate regulatory action was not defined by the Bill, or
that the Bill did not give Monitor the power to stipulate that

the provision, licensees might seek to avoid complying with the

regulatory action was not defined in the Bill, or that the Bill did not
give Monitor the power to stipulate that providers should comply with

measure obviously gives Monitor a massive amount of power. I apologise
if I have in any way misinterpreted what the Minister said, but Monitor
could, basically, write the rules itself. Given the Minister’s
explanation, Monitor seems to have no parameters, with the Government
saying, “There’s your role, get on with it. You set the
rules.” However, if providers or commissioners think a decision
based on a power given to Monitor in the amendments unreasonable, what
is their
redress?<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000371">&#160;</a>

                        </p>
                        <p>That
is another example of Monitor’s priority being to promote
competition rather than the interests of patients. There is no mention
of health improvement or of ensuring the provision of services. It
might be said that that is to be expected, because the subsection
relates to licensing, but it again indicates how the emphasis in the
Bill is on the promotion of
competition.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000405">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
clause gives draconian powers to Monitor to force the NHS to provide
access to its services. Will the Minister give us an idea of what
assessment has been made about how often and to what extent services
might be used by private providers? Will that provision apply to all
NHS services? As previously mentioned, paragraph B107 of the impact
assessment states that Monitor will be able to
impose<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000406">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“special
licence conditions on individual providers to promote competition. For
example, where an incumbent provider has significant market power,
require the incumbent to grant access to its services to other
providers (e.g. operating theatres, diagnostic scanning) at
predetermined
prices.”<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000956">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>I
shall be interested to see what services that applies to, and whether
there is a definitive list of them. Has an assessment been carried out
on the proposal’s application to a range of services; for
example, throughout the whole of a hospital trust? We touched on that
matter when we discussed designation, but the Minister needs to say
more about any such assessment. An example or model for a hospital
trust must surely have been considered before the Government decided to
go down the route of making such changes. What if there is no spare
capacity in a trust when a provider wants to use its facilities?
Obviously, the provision will be biased towards NHS services.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000407">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">To
return to my theme, as I feel I have to do, will the proposals apply to
GPs? Will the providers have access to GP surgery facilities? It will
be interesting to know whether that is the case. Will that provision
apply to people—for example, to neurosurgeons, other clinicians,
cleaners or porters? I do not know. We need to understand whether the
use of services is about facilities or people, or both, as that is
important.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000408">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">On
subsection (4), could the Minister give some examples of where it would
be impracticable for a licence holder to install another service or to
provide the proposed access? Will he give the Committee information
about the level or percentage of investment that the licence holder
should put in and how that will influence Monitor’s decision?
Again, subsection (4) contains nothing about Monitor having regard for
promoting the interests of patients, but the need to secure effective,
long-term competition is written into it. Does the licence holder have
a right of appeal against the decision to allow another licence holder
access? Will there be consultation about such proposals with the health
and well-being boards and local authority scrutineers? The Minister
made a big point about the importance of consultation on designation.
We are not the only ones who have concerns about this. In its
submission, the King’s Fund
said:<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000409">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“Licensing
allows the regulator to impose conditions on providers…A key
element of the licence is the requirement that providers should allow
other providers to use their services. This will allow Monitor to
require a provider such as a large foundation trust to make some of its
facilities available to a competitor. Currently, private sector
providers usually have access to NHS intensive care facilities in the
event of a major incident in their own facilities. If they were denied
this, the scope of their activity would be severely limited. Similarly,
a new provider may wish to access the diagnostic services of an
established larger provider to allow it to enter a market without major
investment.”<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000957">&#160;</a>

                        <p>Diagnostic
services were mentioned in the impact assessment, so that is an
interesting point. Echoing the point that I have just raised, the

                           </strong> Right. I do not want to inflame the Committee, but
the word nitpicking comes to mind with some of those
questions—no synthetic shock-horror, please. I will first
explain the whole of clause 90, before turning to the questions that
the hon. Member for Halton has raised. He is right to raise them, of
course, but the word that I have mentioned sprang to mind on one or two
occasions regarding one or two of the questions.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000412">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The clause
sets out examples of the types of standard and special conditions that
Monitor could include in the licence. The list is illustrative but not
exhaustive, which indicates the sort of conditions that Monitor could
include but leaves it the freedom to tailor its licence and the
conditions it contains. Consultation would inform the first set of
standard conditions.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000413">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The clause
places some limits on conditions regarding access to facilities and the
notification of mergers. In directing a licence holder to give another
provider access

                           </div>to the holder’s facilities—that does not include staff; it
refers to facilities—Monitor must consider whether the other
provider could install its own facilities; whether it is practical to
provide such access; the investment that the licensee has made to
create the facilities; and the need to secure effective long-term
completion. The conditions should ensure that providers in the system
have the right incentives to invest in their own facilities but that
some competition can be introduced when facilities are monopolistic by
nature.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000414">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The clause
also specifies that Monitor can require only foundation trusts or
bodies that used to be NHS trusts to notify the Office of Fair Trading
of their intent to merge, and that a condition of this type can be in
place for only five years. The other example conditions in the clause
are of the type that may be required for Monitor to carry out the
functions that are set out in other parts of the Bill, such as the
charging of licence fees, conditions to protect patient choice and
requiring providers to charge in accordance with the national
tariff.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000415">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The hon.
Member for Halton asked a number of perfectly reasonable questions. I
have answered his question about whether the proposal applied only to
facilities, or whether it covered staff as well; it applies only to
facilities. He asked what would happen if there were no spare capacity.
If there were no spare capacity, it would not happen—that is
obvious—because there would be no spare capacity to enable it to
happen. He asked about access to facilities. That is consistent with
previous Government policy, as set out in the principles and rules for
co-operation and competition—principle 7—published in
March 2010. I think that was under the previous Government, so it is
not that new or foreign a concept.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000416">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The hon.
Gentleman asked about patients and competition. Once again, a key
misconception rears its head. Monitor’s role is to act to
protect and promote the interests of patients, through competition
where appropriate. The hon. Gentleman also talked about redress: how do
licence holders object to conditions? Modifications of licence
conditions must have the agreement of providers. In the case of
standard conditions, clause 91 provides a process for
objections to be made. If sufficient objections are made, Monitor
cannot adopt the modification without referring the proposal to the
Competition Commission for consideration under clause 92.
Directions to licence holders under licence conditions, to do or not to
do certain things, could be challenged by an application for judicial
review.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000417">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I think I
have answered all the hon. Gentleman’s questions. I would like
to place one thing on the record, as it may reassure him. If anyone
does use another provider’s facilities, whether it is the NHS
using private providers of vice versa—of course, it is a two-way
process—they would have to pay for the use of those facilities.
For those reasons, the clause should stand part of the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000418">&#160;</a>

national tariff. My question is about patients who are not entitled to
NHS services, in effect not UK citizens, but citizens of the

providers to inform when they provide services to such citizens? As the
Minister may be aware, the amount of money that the UK spends on paying
for UK citizens overseas to have treatment within the EEA is about
£130 million a year, whereas only £25 million
is charged by the NHS to citizens of EEA countries. Is there an
opportunity to make it a condition for providers to inform when they
provide such services? We might see the takings of the UK increase
through
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000419">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The Minister did not say that, though; if he wants
to say it, let him put it on the record. Basically, this could apply to
GP facilities—that is what he is actually saying. We can talk
about the difference between services and
facilities.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000428">&#160;</a>

Government have a great commitment to open up the health service to
competition, but there is no way that a very large hospital trust that

no capacity for the other providers to

facilities, not personnel. It is a practical consideration. Imagine
that an NHS foundation trust

			Column number: 971<a class="bkMark" name="Column971">&#160;</a>
                           </div>had invested in a major diagnostic piece of equipment, such as an MRI or
CT scanner that cost £1 million; it is inconceivable that a
private sector provider would hire that facility without hiring the
specialist diagnostic staff who operate it. It seems bizarre. There are
major inconsistencies between the impact assessment, the clauses in the
Bill and what the Minister is telling
us.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000430">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">As
a number of hon. Members have said, including my hon. Friend the Member
for Leicester West, it is notoriously difficult to make an assessment
of the tariff, for example; it has a very complicated formula. If
Monitor addresses the issue of creating a level playing field, and
Ministers have previously ruled out giving the private sector tax
breaks or a differential pricing system to get new
entrants—private sector health companies—into the
markets, I find it difficult to understand why this mechanism is being
used.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000431">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">There is a
risk, despite the Minister’s earlier assurances, that the
private health care provider could effectively be profiting from the
NHS by using its facilities without paying for the wider costs that the
NHS foundation trusts would have to bear, because of the complicated
pattern of cross-subsidies for overheads and all the other things that
go into the mix to determine the cost of a particular
service.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000432">&#160;</a>

place, I will answer the hon. Member for Halton, who is a past master.
On the question of GP surgeries, which was his example, I repeat what I
said earlier, because I stand by that. I will not be tempted down the
road on which the hon. Gentleman wants me to go. What I will say, as I
said then, is that it would be extremely unlikely that what he
described would happen with regard to a GP surgery, not least because a
GP surgery is not categorised as a specialist facility. That is what I
am putting on the record, not what the hon. Gentleman is trying to
tempt me to
say.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000433">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I hope that I can be brief, so that the Committee
can make progress. The Bill will require Monitor to notify sector
bodies, including the commissioning board, of any reports received from
the Competition Commission following references that Monitor makes to
the commission seeking modification of provider licence
conditions.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000446">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Two parts of
the Bill place an obligation on Monitor to carry out the
notification—clause 92(5)(a)(ii), which will introduce and
establish the power for Monitor to make a notification, and schedule 8,
which presents details of the reference process. To ensure clarity and
to establish a single notification requirement, amendment
391 will remove the duplicated and unnecessary provision from schedule
8. There are similar amendments to clause 128, to update references to
the notification process in that
clause.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000447">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">With
regard to the amendments to clause 128, the removal of subsection 6(b)
will not mean that Monitor will no longer have to notify the objecting
providers, because those same providers would be covered by subsection
6(a)(ii). The amendments, taken together, will mean that appropriate
processes for notification of references to the Competition Commission
are established in the Bill, ensuring that appropriate bodies will be
informed of and able to scrutinise the referrals made by the regulator.

the amendments simply brings the wording of clause 102(5)(a) into line
with the language used in clause 90(1)(c). Clause 90 deals with
requirements that might be included in a provider’s standard or
special licence conditions. As we have discussed, it makes it clear
that such conditions could require a licence holder to do or not do
certain things and specifies how those things should be done and in
what
period.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000483">&#160;</a>

464 makes it clear that licence conditions can not only require a
foundation trust to do or not do certain things but specify the manner
in which those things should be done. It is important that the two
clauses be consistent. Amendment 465 is similarly minor and technical,
as are amendments 466 and 467. For those reasons, I urge the Committee

                        <p class="tabbed">Our
rationale is that clause 52 of the 2006 Act allows Monitor to intervene
in foundation trusts before they become insolvent. For example, where
there is a risk of failing to comply with requirements, Monitor can
remove the entire foundation trust management. It is about the early
intervention duty and powers, and our amendment would effectively keep
Monitor’s existing role, in relation to ensuring compliance and
financial risk ratings. We want the type of monitoring and early
intervention that is set out in the 2006 Act, which is why we seek to
keep section 52 of that legislation.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000490">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">It is
straightforward for the Minister to respond to those points. I will not
spend too much time on the subject this evening, because we will return
to it when we debate insolvency and foundation trusts. It is important,
however, because we believe that the Government have shifted away and
talked a lot today about failure regimes, and about dealing with
failure. Our original Bill, which

			Column number: 976<a class="bkMark" name="Column976">&#160;</a>

helping foundation trusts. The amendment would do that, but as I said,
we will return to the subject.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000491">&#160;</a>

Burns:<a class="bkMark" name="11032362001285">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I understand the hon. Gentleman’s concerns,
and I sympathise with the underlying purpose of the amendment. I am
confident that we agree that failure should be the last resort. Where
providers find themselves in difficulty, there should be robust
measures to ensure that, above all else, the interests of patients are
protected and the continuity of essential services is maintained. The
Bill, however, already achieves that. It contains a wide range of
provisions to ensure that patients’ interests are protected in
the event that a provider gets into difficulty. One of Monitor’s
core roles would be to support commissioners in ensuring the continuity
of essential local health services, if a provider became insolvent. Not
all services or providers are equally successful.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000492">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Government will not force patients to use poor-quality, inefficient
services or providers, nor will it force taxpayers to subsidise them.
Whereas in the past, the response to failure has usually been to prop
up the provider as an institution, in future, there would be a clear
and transparent mechanism for managing provider failure, which would
protect services for patients, but not ineffective management or
poor-quality care. That would enable commissioners to replace existing
services with higher-quality or better-value options smoothly, and
without the risk of interrupting patient access to services.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000493">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The Bill
gives Monitor a broad set of legislative intervention powers to ensure
the continuity of essential services, including, in exceptional
circumstances, powers to direct an organisation to take specific
actions in order to prevent failure. If any provider breaches its
licence conditions, Monitor would be able to intervene to enforce
compliance under clauses 95 and 96. Its powers in that regard include:
the power to require a provider to take action to ensure that the
breach does not recur; the power to take action to restore the
situation to what it would have been, had the breach not occurred; and
the ability to fine providers in breach of their licence conditions.
Those would be permanent enforcement powers, which Monitor would have
at its disposal to protect patients’
interests.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000494">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
are also putting in place robust measures to ensure that the transition
to the new system is managed effectively and smoothly. We are,
therefore, giving Monitor transitional intervention powers on a
strictly time-limited basis to intervene, if necessary, in foundation
trusts that have yet to develop effective internal governance, in the
event that serious failings have developed, or that a foundation trust
has encountered difficulties that threaten its ability to provide
services to NHS patients.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000495">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Monitor’s
transitional intervention powers would be exactly the same as the set
of powers that it has now in relation to failing foundation trusts
under section 52 of the 2006 Act. Those powers include: the power to
require a foundation trust to take, or refrain from taking, certain
actions; the power to suspend or remove a foundation trust’s
directors or governors; and the power to disqualify such people from
holding office again. Those powers would only apply to foundation
trusts that require additional oversight. Foundation

			Column number: 977<a class="bkMark" name="Column977">&#160;</a>
                           </div>trusts that have effective governance and perform well would not be
subject to the transitional intervention
powers.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000496">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Gentleman seems to want Monitor to retain its ability to intervene
in foundation trusts on a permanent basis. I hope I have made it clear
that that is unnecessary, because Monitor would have the ability to
intervene in any provider that breaches its licence conditions. That
applies not only to foundation trusts, but to independent providers,
including private companies, charities and social enterprises. That
strengthens Monitor’s ability to protect patients’
interests.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000497">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Whatever the
hon. Gentleman’s intention, his amendment simply would not
protect patients’ interests, nor would it help to minimise the
risk of provider failure, because it would preserve a power for Monitor
that, in practice, it would be unable to use. The amendment would
retain section 52 of the 2006 Act, which allows Monitor to intervene in
a foundation trust to enforce compliance with its terms of
authorisation. The terms of authorisation would cease to have effect
when the licensing regime begins. While Monitor would have a nominal
legal power, it would in fact be redundant. Monitor's enforcement
powers need to be based on licensing and that is precisely what the
Bill provides. This amendment is therefore not only unnecessary but
unworkable. For those reasons I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000498">&#160;</a>

pricing. The amendments in my name clarify that we do not want Monitor
to have to specify every possible price payable for every service
included in the national tariff. Instead, Monitor will set a national
price, agreed with the NHS commissioning board, for the services
covered by the national tariff and set an adjustment that will be
applied in certain circumstances. Rules will be included to specify how
the final price to be paid is calculated.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000528">&#160;</a>

amendment, Monitor will specify a base price for the service and a
series of adjustments, based on, for example, location, the complexity
of treating the patient or any other factors deemed to be appropriate.
The provider would then be able to calculate the prices that it would
receive for treating its patients by applying the rules and
adjustments. For example, a specialist provider in central London would
add the London uplift and specialist additional cost to the base price
to easily calculate the price it will be paid for the service. The
final price paid to providers will be transparent and simple to
calculate. The need for Monitor to specify all prices in all
circumstances for all providers is
unnecessary.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000529">&#160;</a>

555, 559 and 562 ensure that the national tariff includes rules
governing the application of variation to the national price. Such
rules will be transparent, legally binding and enforceable by Monitor.
Rules on variations in tariff will specify when the price set
in the national tariff changes, which may include when
adjustments are made to it to take account of volume—with a
marginal rate being applied when fixed costs are
covered—complexity of treatment and the location of

                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">These
amendments remove Monitor’s ability to set national tariff
prices as the maximum. This means that for all services covered by the
tariff there can be no competition on price. The provisions for Monitor
to set maximum prices were never to be used to introduce price
competition. Competition should be based on quality, and wherever
possible the price must be fixed before beneficial competition can take
place. The use of maximum prices was included to allow Monitor to
regulate price increases for non-competitive services, again, among
monopoly providers. However, Monitor’s competition powers are
sufficient to deal with any abuse of the dominant position and we are
able to remove the references to maximum. Let me remind hon. Members
that for the first time the Bill introduces a framework in primary
legislation to govern the use of the tariff in the NHS. That is a very
significant change, which Labour Members can appreciate and
support—although they did not legislate for it when they were in
power.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000549">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Where
a service is covered by the national tariff, competition should only
ever be on the quality of care that the provider can provide to its
patients. Being covered by the tariff means not only that we can be
certain that competition is focused on quality, but that the risk of
cherry-picking is mitigated by the setting of accurate prices that
fairly reflect costs. As hon. Members will be aware, the setting of the
tariff is a complex process, which must take into account a wide range
of considerations. That has contributed to the current situation where
the tariff is not comprehensive and many clinical areas that would
benefit from having a national tariff are not covered. That is not good
enough.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000550">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">It is
interesting that the Minister is denying it was the intention to have
price competition. The explanatory notes state on page
117:<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000557">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

                        </p>
                        <p>That
is in the Government’s explanatory notes. How can they deny
their own explanatory notes? As usual, the right hon. Gentleman tried
to make a good fist of his Government’s appalling policies. I am
sure that he will look back with fondness on some of the things he has
had to say, and perhaps cringe at some of the others. The fact is that
competition was—I am going to explore whether it still
is—the purpose of the Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000558">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We believe
that outright competition on price is unacceptable. There is a large
body of evidence to show that such an approach is detrimental to
quality. It is worth noting that in addition to their own and the
public’s general concerns about price competition, many of the
experts we heard from during the Committee’s evidence sessions
expressed concerns. Dr Clare Gerada of the Royal College of General
Practitioners
said:<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000559">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“All
the evidence appears to show that if you base competition on price you
drive down quality. That is what we are concerned about, that it will
be a race to the bottom.”<em>––</em>[<em>Official

                        <p>Dr
Gerada’s concerns were echoed by others during the evidence
sessions, but I will not go into that because we were all there. In
particular, however, it is clear from the evidence of experts that
there is a real danger that price competition will be damaging. We were
not the only ones who felt that we were moving towards price
competition; lots of experts outside did, too. I do not know how the
Minister can deny
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000560">&#160;</a>

                        <p>I am unsure what is the
best evidence for that that I have heard during this Committee, but
perhaps we have just heard it now. Just this morning the Minister said
with exasperation that, given my mindset, it would be an uphill battle
to convince me of the arguments. Well, he certainly has a big uphill
battle to convince
us.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000562">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">In
this instance it is lucky that I was not convinced by the right hon.
Gentleman’s previous arguments on price competition. He has said
numerous times to the Committee that there will be a genuine market,
but he has never said that there will be a genuine market in quality.
It is lucky that we were not convinced by what the Government have
said, and it is lucky that the medical professionals and the public
have not been convinced by the plans. As a result, would he like to
take this opportunity to apologise for his previous comments and accept
that, in this case, it is he and the Government he represents who
appear to have failed correctly to understand their own Bill? That is
quite remarkable.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000563">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">As we have
noticed quite a few times during this debate, Ministers lack
understanding of what is in the Bill and how it works, not least in
terms of competition. I am sure you will not let me go down that road,
Dr McCrea, but it is a very important point. In the light of
that, I can only hope that the Government take the opportunity to
reread some of the evidence we have received, particularly on the role
of Monitor, to see whether there are other policy shifts that might be
in the best interests of the national health service. I feel that, in
the Minister’s words, it might be “an uphill
battle”. Despite the Government’s talk of having regard
to price competition, which is a deviation from their original
position—I use that word carefully—we remain unconvinced
that they will go far enough to ensure that price competition cannot
and will not take place in the
NHS.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000564">&#160;</a>

regulator? Where is the need for reorganisation on such an
unprecedented scale? If the Government truly want to rule out price
competition, why not simply introduce an amendment that states, perhaps
on Report, that competition on price is not allowed and that anyone who
believes that such a practice has occurred may lodge a complaint with
the NHS commissioning board, Monitor in its current form, or any other
body that the

                        <p>That
is the regulator! Is the Minister going to sack him? Quite frankly, it
completely contradicts the Government’s policy. Could the
Minister confirm whether, in his opinion, the new head of Monitor is
incorrect, and what is he going to de about it? If he will not, will he
accept that there is a need for the Government to consider tabling
further amendments? They need to clarify their position beyond any

                        <p class="hs_brev">“First
of all, let us be clear about the fact that the reforms are about
cutting bureaucracy and improving patient care. They were drawn up by
us as a coalition to improve the NHS. Let me answer the right hon.
Gentleman’s question very directly. We have already made some
real strengthenings to the
Bill”—<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000970">&#160;</a>

there is the issue raised by the Liberal Democrats, with which I
completely agree: we must avoid cherry-picking by the private sector in
the NHS.”—[<em>Official Report</em>, 16 March 2011; Vol.

                        <p class="tabbed">Yet
again, the Prime Minister’s promises do not match his actions.
Nothing in the Bill rules out cherry-picking. Let us be clear what we
are talking about with cherry-picking, and it is important to separate
the various comments of the Minister and his hon. Friends. It is about
bidding only for services that present less complex problems—in
other words, healthier patients—and about private providers
choosing certain profitable services or people to compete over, taking
away activity from existing providers and so undermining the financial
stability of NHS trusts, which have to provide unprofitable services,
so endangering local hospitals. We have, again, a charter for putting
hospitals—I hate to use the phrase—out of business. One
of the consequences could be that NHS trusts stop providing services
that they cannot make a profit from, and do not want them
designated.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000574">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

could go on, but we clearly have the Government denying that they want
price competition, while all the facts point in the opposite direction,
including their own explanatory notes. We have the chairman of Monitor
completely contradicting what Ministers are saying. The whole system is
chaos, a mess and going nowhere other than to the detriment of the
future NHS. We already know from the Minister’s comments in
Committee that European and UK competition law will increasingly apply
to the NHS. That is what the Bill is about—no matter what the
Minister and the Government say, it is about competition on

is a short amendment, but it deals with an issue that the Minister must
address. At present, major investment projects are dealt with through
regional planning, and normally require PCT and SHA approval. The funds
come from either the private sector through private finance initiative
schemes, or through the Department of Health granting public
expenditure capital dividends under the market system. It is not clear
how that will be achieved in future, so it needs to be allowed for in
tariff rates. The amendment allows a debate on this important issue,
but it is a probing amendment. Although we have to a certain extent
already debated strategic responsibility for capital investments under
the board clauses, it would be useful to get further information from
the Minister.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000593">&#160;</a>

amendment makes explicit that Monitor will have to include how it has
treated the cost of capital when publishing the pricing methodology. It
is unnecessary. As the list of things the pricing methodology will
cover can never be exhaustive, it is inappropriate to place in

be considered, as they may be seen as having precedent over those that

                           </strong> I beg to move amendment 204, in
clause 104, page 95, line 8, at
end insert—<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000607">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">‘(3) Any
agreement reached under subsection (2) must be approved by the Board in
order to have
effect.’.</p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Clause
104(2) deals with where a commissioner and provider may vary the price
of a service. The measure was initially seen in the context of price
competition, and our views differ on whether that context remains.
However, having made strong arguments, I will not go over that ground
again until we debate clause stand part.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000608">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Under the
amendment commissioners and providers would be able to vary the price
only where the national commissioning board allowed it. It would stop
the harmful practice of price competition, which we feel has not been
stopped by the Government proposals. Commissioners might have attempted
to have competition for services based on price, which then hurt
quality. Our idea is that the national commissioning board would be
able to tell them that that was not allowed.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000609">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Under the
Bill, it is for Monitor to specify where price variations will be
allowed. However, we know that Monitor will be pro-competition and will
not have as much expertise on services or on the wider NHS. We assume
that the commissioning board will have such expertise and so will be in
a better position to judge whether variations of price, if there are
any, could harm quality. I would welcome the Minister’s comments
on
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000610">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">

Burns:<a class="bkMark" name="11032362001346">&#160;</a>
                              </span>
                           </strong> The amendment would ensure that the NHS
commissioning board had to approve all agreements made under the rules
for varying the service and/or price specified in the national tariff.
It is not needed and would only serve to add levels of unnecessary
bureaucracy to the system.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000611">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The rules set
out in subsection (2) will be legally binding and enforceable by
Monitor. If hon. Members feel that agreements might be made that are
not in the interests of patients and taxpayers, I assure them that that
is not the case. First, the NHS commissioning board will have the lead
responsibility for developing the rules under clause 105(9) and
agreeing them with Monitor. Those rules, unlike the current system,
will be legally binding. The commissioning board will, therefore, not
propose rules that may lead to unsatisfactory agreements, so the
approval of the agreements made under their rules is
unnecessary.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000612">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Secondly,
Monitor will have the power to enforce the rules, as I have said
previously. For those reasons, I do not support the amendment and urge
the hon. Gentleman to withdraw it.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000613">&#160;</a>

will be brief, so that the Committee can make progress. The amendment
allows for the national tariff to include rules on payments for
services. The rules will be transparent and legally binding, with
enforcement by Monitor, and will ensure a smoother running of the
tariff system. The rules on payments will be used to outline how and
when payments for services in the national tariff should be made. For
example, the rules might include whether the provider is paid in
arrears for services delivered or up front for expected activity
levels, with the opportunity to reclaim moneys when the patients
treated are less than expected. The provision will enforce rules that
must be followed by commissioners and providers with regard to services
specified in the national tariff.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000641">&#160;</a>

brief. Amendment 560 offers clarity over how the services in the
national tariff can be specified. It also ensures that commissioners
and providers can vary the specification of the service and the price
only within a transparent rules-based system. Subsection (1) of the new
clause allows the NHS commissioning board the flexibility it needs when
specifying the services, or currencies, to be covered by the national
tariff.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000646">&#160;</a>

NHS commissioning board can, among other things, split a service into
its components. It could split rehabilitation from a surgical

                           </div>can bundle a service together along a patient pathway. An example of
that is the combining of diagnostic testing and treatment to attach one
price. The board can group services with similar costs to apply a
single price for the group. Therefore, if the treatments for more than
one condition are sufficiently similar in cost, they may be grouped and
priced together. That is currently done using health resource groups
under payment by results. That inclusion makes subsection (4) of
clause 104 unnecessary, and amendment 560 removes
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000647">&#160;</a>

                           </div>but we want to get a handle on that. Will there be a different rate or
different conditions, or will prices be constant irrespective of
designation? The Bill sets up a risk pool, and providers or
commissioners must pay money into a central fund to deal with risk and
problems with stability and perhaps even failure. We are worried that
that will be an extra burden on NHS services, but not so much on
private providers. Again, I would welcome the Minister’s
explanation, because we are not clear about the matter. Does the risk
pool apply only to NHS providers, or to providers across the piece? It
is important to understand that, and I presume that the Minister wants

things might happen that will never happen, but because of the extra

because they would have to find the money from their budget. I am not
sure of the extent of that in terms of how often and how
much—obviously, the Bill does not include the details—but
it could be a disincentive to designating a service. Similarly, I do
not know whether a provider might decide not to bid for or apply for a

amendments are all related to Monitor’s ability to set
differential prices for designated services and in relation to
different types of provider. Amendment 205 would remove
Monitor’s power to set differential prices for designated
services and different providers. That would have a disastrous effect
on the NHS system. First, Monitor’s ability to set differential
prices for designated services is an important tool to enable prices to
be adjusted to ensure the sustainability of designated services. Linked
to that, the adjustments will be used to correct unavoidable
differences in costs associated with delivery for some providers; for
example, to account for geographical variations in wages and the cost
of land. We have tabled amendments to make the provision’s use
crystal clear.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000662">&#160;</a>

adjustments are made to tariffs in the current system through the
market forces factor to reflect the additional, unavoidable costs that
some providers face over others. The provision enables those vital
adjustments to continue in the new system. Without that power, Monitor
would have to set constant prices across all providers regardless of
their cost base. That would lead to huge waste, or a reduction in
quality or accessing services. If it is still felt that the power would
be used to fund inefficiencies or promote entry among some provider
types, I assure the Committee that that is not

                           </strong> I want ask the Minister for clarification. In an
area with only one provider—perhaps a rural area—there
may be many designated services that cannot be allowed to fail. Monitor
will be allowed to charge higher costs in those areas because it must
have the extra money to keep services going so that they do not fail.
There will be price competition under the system. Commissioners in
areas where there are high levels of designated services will generally
have to pay more, and that is not a fair and level playing field

amendment 192 will make it clear that Monitor cannot set prices based
on the ownership of the provider. That means that differential prices
can be set based only on other criteria, such as the location of the
provision and the complexity of patients’ needs. The amendment
does not represent a change in policy intention, only a clarification
of our position due to the many misrepresentations that have been made
in the area. The amendment on differential prices was thought necessary
due to the misconception that it may be used to promote entry by some
providers. That is not true, and the amendment will make that clear.
The Government have never considered paying certain providers more for
delivering the same work under the same conditions, as that would not
be a responsible use of NHS
resources.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000670">&#160;</a>

we recognise that a one-size-fits-all tariff is not appropriate because
there are unavoidable cost differences for providers. The tariff needs
the flexibility to pay a higher price for provision in higher-cost
areas, such as central London, due to the cost of labour, land and
buildings. As I have said, that is an adjustment made under the current
system through the market forces

Providers should be compensated for those costs, and pricing may be the
best way to do that. When prices are set differently, it will be
supported by an evidence base and agreed by the NHS commissioning board
under its duty to agree the pricing methodology. The amendment will
make it clear that although differential prices may be based on
evidence of unavoidable differential costs, it cannot be set
arbitrarily for certain types of provider.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000674">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment 613
would add an additional limitation to the national tariff’s
opportunity to set differential prices. I take this opportunity to
thank the hon. Member for Halton for his support on amendment 192, and
I will concentrate on the difference between the two amendments, which
relates to restricting Monitor’s ability to set differential
prices for incumbents and new
entrants.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000675">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">First,
in practice, it would be difficult to distinguish between a new entrant
and an incumbent, so that part of the amendment would be difficult to
enforce. However, we agree with the spirit of the amendment. Our
intention has never been to set a differential price to entice new
entry or to favour particular types of providers. Instead, it is to pay
the same price to providers that deliver the same work under the same
conditions.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000676">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
again reassure hon. Members that the differential prices will be
developed by Monitor, but must be agreed by the commissioning board
before taking effect. The organisations will have to ensure that the
setting of a differential price helps in the delivery of their
objectives and acts in the interests of patients and taxpayers. This
ensures that the differential prices act in the interests of the
system, and are used to reimburse providers that face genuine,
unavoidable higher costs. It will not be used to promote new entry for
the sake of it; that would be an irresponsible use of taxpayers’
money. For those reasons I am resisting the
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000677">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
614 would remove Monitor’s ability to set differential prices to
cover the costs incurred with differences in tax arrangements and
access to the NHS pension scheme. The amendment is disproportionate and
restrictive. It is not appropriate for the legislation to specify to
this level of detail what Monitor and the commissioning board may wish
to look at when considering setting differential prices to reimburse
providers for unavoidable differences in
costs.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000678">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Placing
such a list in legislation would also be too restrictive. Even if
Monitor did not want to set differential prices now, it might need the
opportunity to address these issues in the future for the benefit of
patients and taxpayers. As I said, the power to set differential prices
is only to be used to reimburse providers appropriately for the work
that they deliver to take into account differences in costs arising,
for example, from location or the complexity of case that they
treat.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000679">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
have already tabled amendments to ensure that this power cannot be used
to set differential prices based on the ownership or status of the
provider. To include a further list is unnecessary and
disproportionate. There are sufficient checks in place to ensure this
ability is used only as intended. The differential prices must be
agreed between Monitor and the commissioning board, which ensures that
these adjustments will act in the interests of patients and taxpayers.
The price differentials will be transparent and evidence-based. They

the record, Mr Chairman, as they relate to the amendments we are now
debating, I would like to respond to the comments made by the hon.
Member for Easington regarding the Government’s impact
assessment, as I believe they misrepresent our position and must be
clarified for the record. The hon. Gentleman said that the majority of
quantifiable distortions work in the favour of NHS organisations, but
he failed to set that in its proper context. It is right that the
quantifiable distortions, tax, capital and pensions distortions, work
in favour of NHS organisations. However, the impact assessment makes it
clear that only some of the fair playing field distortions have proved
quantifiable through analytical work, and that some of the distortions
identified by stakeholders but not quantified are likely to work in
favour of private providers. This reduces their costs relative to NHS
providers—<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000681">&#160;</a>

Minister has covered part of amendment 613. Part of the argument
concerns whether Monitor might pay a higher price for new entrants
that, by definition, will not be NHS providers, as specified in the
impact assessment. It could be argued that that is in line with the
duty to promote competition, which is a stated primary objective when
setting prices. Even more glaringly, an analysis of different cost
bases could be performed, along the lines of the KPMG study in the
impact assessment, and a description of the providers could be framed
as those who do—or do not—have access to NHS pension
schemes, pay tax and so on. Neither of those arguments would explicitly
mean paying private providers more just because they are privately
owned, but the result would be the same. The Government amendments do
not prevent private providers from being paid more in the manner
envisaged by the impact assessment; it would simply make what was going

recent study of fair playing field distortions was able to quantify the
impact of some of the distortions identified. The majority of the
quantifiable distortions work in favour of NHS organisations; tax,
capital and pensions distortions result in a private sector acute
provider facing costs about £14 higher for every £100 of
cost relative to an NHS acute
provider.”<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000978">&#160;</a>

                        <p>Does
the Minister intend to use that figure to subsidise the private sector?
He effectively accused us of fixing the markets, and I would be
interested to see whether the Government use that figure in terms of
private sector providers. It is a simple question; the Minister can
deny it or not.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000697">&#160;</a>

it would be interesting to have more information about how the

want on this Committee, the hon. Gentleman’s point

			Column number: 994<a class="bkMark" name="Column994">&#160;</a>
                           </div>is correct. We are concerned that there has been no commitment from the
Government to look at the other side of the fence and at the costs of
training and education, which are a vital part of the national health
service. They are expensive and time-consuming, but essential to
providing the service we have. I am interested to hear what the
Minister has to say. Will he publish the data behind his assumption, as
in the impact assessment? Will the Government rule out paying
£14 or thereabouts to private sector providers? The Minister is
not replying.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000699">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I will be brief, but I want to put a few points on
the record. During the debate on pricing, we heard again how
bureaucratic the system is. It needs arbitration, which requires
discussion between various bodies in the health service. We talked
about distortions in how the Government will try to help out the
private sector, possibly even—the Minister did not deny
this—by providing a £14 subsidy. The Minister can get up
and deny it, but that difference is in the impact assessment. The
Government have made a big thing during the Committee about the
previous Labour Government fixing the market in terms of independent
treatment centres, but while our figures on average were £11,
they are talking about £14. They cannot have it both ways, so it
would be interesting to know whether that is the case.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000788">&#160;</a>

was made about training and education, and it seems that it is all

clear. The KPMG study on the fair playing field that was commissioned

conscious of the time. I have mentioned before the issue that the
Government never intended price competition. I have already quoted from
one of the paragraphs in the explanatory notes, and I bring their
attention to paragraph 699, which
states:<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000804">&#160;</a>

does not mention improving quality. I come back to the point that the
Minister has raised a number of times that this is about a genuine
market and it is about quality; they never said that. I will leave that
one there. The evidence, as far as I am concerned—I have now
read it on to the record—is that they were intending to do that.
I am sure we will explore this with others on Report, but we are not
clear on how we can ensure that there is no price competition. We look
forward to getting the support of the Government on that, if they are
so confident about price competition, although we have seen in the
impact assessment that there is already price
variation.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000805">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> This is a really good one, this one, because
this is not an academic argument about the importance of distortions;
this is a Department of Health document called “The Fair Playing
Field Project”. It
states:<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000810">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="hs_brev">“The
existence of these distortions, whether they favour the NHS or non-NHS

                           </strong> My hon. Friend makes a powerful point. I hate to
repeat the Minister’s comments, but competition law will
increasingly apply to the NHS— “increasingly
apply” are the words of the Minister himself.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000813">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I want to
briefly finish on a couple of points. I have not had the time to go
through the explanatory notes and see how many references or
comparisons there are to the utilities in what the Government are
proposing. The Government, upsettingly, say that the NHS will become a
utility. The number of references in the explanatory notes to a
comparison with utilities is profound. We know which way the Government
are going. No matter how the Government try to spin their story on the
Bill, it is clear that as time progresses the NHS and its patients will
be at the mercy of competition law and the market. There will be price
competition and the Bill in no way stops that—it promotes it. It
will lead to greater inequalities, a longer waiting list, greater
rationing and more of a postcode
lottery.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000814">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I will not detain the Committee for long, but there
are one or two things that I want to say. First, however much it may
disappoint the hon. Gentleman, we do not want price competition and we
have never intended it. It may be unpalatable to him, but he will have
to live with it. He has also—I do not want to end on a sour
note—played that typical game of an Opposition MP, which is to
ask for information from a Government that no Government of any
political party would be prepared to publish, because they are internal
working documents for devising policy.

West has woken up.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000815">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Opposition have kept asking whether we will publish the analysis. We do
not accept the £14 figure. Nor, because we do not want price
distortions of a deliberate nature that benefit the private sector, do
we accept a policy of giving more than the rate we pay for NHS services
to independent sector treatment centres, and the Bill will very
effectively stop that abuse. We therefore stand by the impact
assessment. As I said in an earlier debate on the clause, a more
extensive piece of work is ongoing on this issue.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000816">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Let me say
one thing to hon. Members, because it tickles me. The hon. Member for
Halton, no doubt followed by the Greek chorus, has been asking whether
we will publish the data and analysis behind the impact assessment, and
I have to tell my hon. Friends that that is breathtaking in its gall.
The KPMG analysis referred to in the impact assessment was commissioned
in 2009, under the previous Administration, which, I understand, 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 999<a class="bkMark" name="Column999">&#160;</a>
                           </div>decided not to publish it. The hon. Gentleman shakes his head in
disagreement, but to be frank with my hon. Friends, I do not believe he
had a clue about that, and it has come as news to him, just as it has
to me and my hon. Friends. In conclusion, I urge my hon. Friends to
ensure that the clause stands part of the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000817">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> It was a good try from the Minister, but the KPMG
study informed the impact assessment. The Department has had its
deliberations and discussions, and it has the data, so the Minister can
publish that—it is up to him.

one final point. On competition and prices, the chairman of Monitor
said in a recent BBC

                        </p>
                        <p>Was
he correct? He was also quoted on GPonline as saying:<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000820">&#160;</a>

exercising functions under subsection (5), the Board and Monitor must
act with a view to securing the standardisation throughout England of
the specification of health care services in the national tariff under
section
104(1)(a).’.</p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendment makes it crystal clear that when the NHS commissioning board
is developing the list of services to be covered by the national
tariff, and agreeing those with Monitor, it must specify the services
in standard units to be used in the national tariff document. As I have
said to the Committee many times, our intention is that competition
should be based on the quality of care delivered and not price. We have
tabled amendments to remove the ability for Monitor to set maximum
prices to make that clear. The setting of a mandatory national price
for services requires consistent units of service, or currencies, on
which to attach the price. This amendment spells out that the national
tariff will specify nationally set currencies that can only be varied
within rules set under clause
104(2).<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000860">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Of
course, the development of standard currencies for use in the national
tariff is very likely to have happened anyway. As Monitor would need a
consistent set of services in order to attach a price, it would only
agree to interventions organised into standard units of service. This
amendment just puts this intention beyond doubt and ensures it happens
by placing a duty on the NHS commissioning board and Monitor to develop
standard units of service for national price setting purposes.
Furthermore, at a later stage we will bring forward amendments to place
a duty on the NHS commissioning board to develop and maintain a
comprehensive set of national currencies. This will, amongst other
things, reduce the opportunity for providers to cherry-pick.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000861">&#160;</a>

prices are set in the NHS has important and significant consequences.

driver in

                        <p class="tabbed">I
am sure that Ministers know from their discussions with organisations
within the NHS, think-tanks and others that people are unclear about
the role of the national commissioning board and of Monitor in price
setting; that has been a regular theme of discussion since the White
Paper was published. The Committee ought to acknowledge the great
uncertainty about the subject. I also want to discuss the process for
price setting, so let us be clear about what it is, if we can
be.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000868">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Once
the national commissioning board has set a structure for the tariff,
Monitor will determine the price. It is supposed to consult with local
GP commissioning consortia and providers, and then to come up with a
solution. That in itself is a huge task. As the explanatory notes on
the clause make clear, there is obviously potential for the national
commissioning board and Monitor to disagree, otherwise the notes on
page 119 would not
state:<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000869">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“If

                        </p>
                        <p>The
Minister ought to say who will do that independent arbitration and how
it will
work.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000870">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Monitor
then has to notify all the commissioners, licence holders and others it
considers appropriate about the national tariff document. Objections
can be made within 28 days of publication. As part of the process,
other issues arise under clauses 106 and 107, so I need to ask for the
Chair’s advice if he does not want me to stray beyond the
clause. However, I want to keep my comments brief, and I would not need
to come back on the later clauses if I mention those issues now. Those
clauses allow commissioners and providers to challenge the methodology
used to set the prices, while there is also a role for the Competition
Commission, to which referrals can be made if GP commissioners or
providers do not feel that the price is
appropriate.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000871">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
have some experience of the wonder that is Richmond house, but setting
prices is complicated. Going through that procedure, including
consultations with commissioners and providers, and the possibility of
objections within 28 days and of Competition Commission references, is
an extremely time-consuming and bureaucratic process. Where the
ultimate responsibility lies is not clear—the clauses suggest
that, ultimately, the Competition Commission will decide the prices in
the
NHS.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000872">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">That
explanation is in the Minister’s own notes for the Bill. I have
asked before what experience the Competition Commission has of health
care that enables it to know what price would be best. The matter is
serious, so I will be grateful if the Minister can say whether the
Competition Commission is the independent arbitrator referred to in
clause 105. Similarly, does the ultimate decision on the price for an
NHS service, if it goes to arbitration, lie with the Competition
Commission?<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000873">&#160;</a>

framework for prices is put into effect.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000874">&#160;</a>
                        </p> 
                        <div class="columnNumber">

                        </div>
                        <p class="tabbed">People will be
able to voice their views on the services to which prices and rules
would apply and on the proposed national prices for services. By
requiring consultation with both commissioners and providers, the
clause would help to ensure that prices did not favour one side over
the other. The clause is relatively strong. Subsections (5) to (9)
provide for the key elements of the national tariff to be agreed
between the commissioning board and Monitor before the consultation.
Independent arbitration will be used when agreement is not achieved. I
will answer the point made by the hon. Member for Leicester West in a
moment.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000875">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Those
subsections also make clear the need for responsibilities for
determining particular elements of the national tariff. The NHS
commissioning board will lead on services covered by the national
tariff and the rules about when services and prices could be varied by
commissioners and providers. The board will be required to seek
Monitor’s agreement to those elements. Monitor has agreed on the
pricing methodology and the price levels, as well as the rules for
determining prices outside the scope of national price
arrangements.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000876">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Monitor will
be required to seek the agreement of the commissioning board to those
elements. There is a need for clear agreement to each element because
pricing is vital to the objectives of each organisation. The board will
have an interest in the prices set and the rules governing local price
setting because it will be the body that oversees the purchase of NHS
services and GP consortia, as well as being the guardian of the NHS
budget. Monitor will have an interest in how services are defined, as
that will affect the level of competition.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000877">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The clause
also makes provision for consultation. Subsection (1) requires Monitor
to send a notice to each commissioning consortium, each licence holder
and other people who it considers appropriate before publishing the
national tariff. Subsection (2) requires Monitor to publish the notice,
and subsections (3) and (4) set out what the notice must include.
Subsection (10) provides for a consultation period of 28 days,
following publication of the notice. Those provisions are intended to
ensure that there is a proper consultation ahead of each national
tariff being’s put in
place.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000878">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Member for Leicester West mentioned the question of price setting
being important and needing scrutiny. She is quite right: price setting
is important. That is why our Bill puts price setting on a transparent,
statutory basis for the first time ever. Parliament has never before
had the chance to debate NHS price setting and agree how the price
process should operate; currently, it is simply part of the sweeping
discretionary powers of the Secretary of State. In future, there will
be a transparent and independent process to ensure that prices are
accurate and
fair.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000879">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Lady also raised the issue of what Monitor and the NHS
commissioning board will do with regard to pricing. That is extremely
clear, which I hope reassures her. The NHS commissioning board will
develop currencies and Monitor will develop the pricing methodology and
set the prices, as I mentioned in my introductory comments to the stand
part debate. They will need to agree each product with the other
organisation to ensure that it is acceptable to others in the
system.<a class="bkMark" name="11032362000880">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The hon. Lady
also raised the question of arbitration, which potentially flows from
that. Arbitration will be carried out in accordance with the
Arbitration Act 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 1003<a class="bkMark" name="Column1003">&#160;</a>
                           </div>1996. The board and Monitor will agree who arbitrates. If not, each
party will appoint a person to arbitrate. Such persons will appoint
another person as a third arbitrator. I hope that that answers the hon.
