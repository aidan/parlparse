<P>
<B>The Minister for Transport in London (Ms Glenda Jackson):</B> On a point of order, Mr. Stevenson. I had to be in the Chamber before the Committee concluded at 1 pm yesterday, and I was unable to speak in support of the amendments. Amendments Nos. 28 and 39 have been jointly tabled by the hon. Member for Ceredigion (Mr. Dafis) and myself. Amendment No. 38 appears under my name. The amendments' purpose is to show that the Bill will not set United Kingdom-wide targets, but national targets for England, Scotland and Wales. That is a point that the hon. Gentleman made yesterday, with no small relish.
<P>
Amendment No. 28 would oblige my right hon. Friends the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions, the Secretary of State for Scotland, and the Secretary of State for Wales to publish targets for their respective territorial areas of responsibility within the United Kingdom.
<P>
The hon. Member for Ceredigion and myself have tabled new clause 9, which clarifies the position of Northern Ireland. The Government wish to see the Bill's provisions extended to Northern Ireland, but road traffic reduction there is a devolved matter.
<P>
Some worry has been expressed about the lack of a time limit for the Bill's extension to Northern Ireland. The procedures that will make that extension will be established by an Order in Council. As road traffic reduction is a devolved matter, it is regrettably not possible to give a time limit.
<P>
The negative procedure used is intended to shorten the time that would otherwise be taken under an affirmative resolution. The Northern Ireland Office is unaware of any instance of an Order in Council not being made following a negative resolution. That procedure was used for the Disabled Persons Act 1981, for the Housing Act 1996 and for the Housing Grants Construction and Regeneration Act 1996. An Order in Council is normally made within three to four months of a Bill's enactment. The Government have no intention of delaying that process.
<P>
On reading the Official Report of yesterday's Committee, I understand that the hon. Member for Worthing, West (Mr. Bottomley) asked how a United Kingdom target could be derived from the four national targets. As I mentioned in a letter to the hon. Member for Ceredigion, the Government want the four reports to be drawn together, and there will be a report for the United Kingdom as a whole. In some instances that would be a simple mathematical exercise. However, such a report would be subject to the different ways in which the exercise is approached in each territory, and would be subject to any devolution of powers.
<P>
I trust that what I have said this morning clarifies the matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Christopher Chope (Christchurch):</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> No, I have finished speaking.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman wish to speak?
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> Yes, Mr. Stevenson. The Minister sat down and deprived me of the opportunity to intervene. The hon. Lady referred to individual targets for the separate elements of the United Kingdom: England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. If the Minister's amendment is accepted, the Bill will deal with individual national targets rather than targets for the whole of the United Kingdom. She has just implied, however, that the Government will not be responsible for setting an overall national target. It will be left to England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, as the constituent elements of the United Kingdom, to set their own individual targets. When those individual targets are drawn together for a report, the Government will add the individual targets together to arrive at the national target figure. Will the Minister confirm that the Government will set an overall target for road traffic in the United Kingdom?
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I am sure that the hon. Member for Christchurch (Mr. Chope) will agree that there are many variables to be taken into account when considering the United Kingdom. For example, there is no equality between the four constituent parts of the United Kingdom in terms of car ownership. Regrettably, after 18 years of Conservative rule, there are also wide disparities in economic potential and employment prospects. There are many other variations throughout the United Kingdom's comparatively small land mass.
<P>
The Government have, on a wide range of issues, committed this country to playing its part both as a member of the European Union and in the wider international community. In reducing greenhouse gases, for example, each of the four territories of the United Kingdom is responsible for playing its part in achieving national targets. Given the enormous geographical variables involved, setting a flat rate for every territory of the United Kingdom to work towards would be unachievable, ineffective and not in the best interests of all the territories concerned.
<P>
The Government have given a clear commitment that the individual reports will be brought together into one report. The achievement of a reduction in road traffic is undoubtedly the aim in all the territories of the United Kingdom.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> We are now entering into a useful debate. Does the Minister's logic extend to the English regions? If so, she should accept amendment No. 14, which would allow for separate targets for the individual economic planning regions of England. Some of those regions are larger than the Principality of Wales and have a larger population than the Province of Northern Ireland. She said, quite rightly, that different circumstances apply in different territories of the United Kingdom. Does she therefore accept that different circumstances apply in different regions of those territories?
<P>
<B>Mr. Cynog Dafis </B>(Ceredigion): Amendment No. 14 would create a situation whereby there are only regional targets, and no overall United Kingdom target.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> I hear what the hon. Gentleman is saying, but the Minister has implied that the Bill will not provide for a United Kingdom target either. Are the regional targets suggested in amendment No. 14 unacceptable merely because a national target is excluded? Would the hon. Gentleman accept an amendment that enabled us to build up a national target from individual regional targets, in the same way that the Minister intends to compile a national target from the individual targets for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland?
<P>
<B>Mr. Dafis:</B> I am happy to accept the amendments. There should be national targets. We should adhere to the terms used in the Bill, whatever we think about the meaning of ``national''. In the Bill ``national'' refers to England, Wales and Scotland. Let me clarify that ``UK targets'' refers to the whole of the United Kingdom.
<P>
I am happy to see national targets that may vary between counties and between different parts of the UK. The Government have international commitments that require all the nations of the UK to make a significant contribution to road traffic reduction.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman, but I am confused. I understand the United Kingdom to be one nation state. We are bringing definitions into the Bill that imply that the UK is made up of four individual nations. In our previous discussions, the national interest, national policy and national Government have referred to the Government of the UK.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman's interpretation of the amendments suggests that we will be talking about four nations for the purposes of road traffic. That has serious implications for definitions and precedents. Will the hon. Gentleman comment on the fears of people who do not wish to see the United Kingdom broken up into regional entities?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Hon. Members will understand that I am getting anxious. It is right for the Committee to discuss regional aspects raised by the amendments, but we should not get into debate about the United Kingdom. Will the hon. Gentleman restrict himself to regional aspects?
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> Certainly, Mr. Stevenson. The title of the Bill is the ``Road Traffic Reduction (United Kingdom Targets) Bill'', but the proposal will alter it to the ``Road Traffic Reduction (National Targets) Bill''. ``Targets'' refers to ``national'', and that implies that the Bill applies to a United Kingdom comprised of four nations.
<P>
That is a significant departure from normal legislative practice. Legislation rarely applies differentially between England and Wales. The Secretary of State for Scotland and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland usually take responsibility for legislation for Scotland and for Northern Ireland.
<P>
The Minister takes the view that the Secretaries of State for Scotland, for Wales and for Northern Ireland will produce separate targets. As there is no Secretary of State for England, I assume that the Minister will assume responsibility for Government policy. Where does that leave the United Kingdom constitution?

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I beg the hon. Gentleman not to draw the Committee into debate on the United Kingdom constitution. Will he bear that in mind?
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Bottomley (Worthing, West)</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> I give way to my hon. Friend.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bottomley:</B> When my hon. Friend and I were successively in charge of the national casualty reduction figures, we discussed Great Britain, but not Northern Ireland; we may have implied that the United Kingdom was involved but the figures applied less broadly. As to the casualty rates in the various nations, Wales has the best road safety record--the record in the other nations within the United Kingdom is less good. My hon. Friend may be making slightly more of this matter than is necessary. The Bill's title will probably be amended, and a reference to national targets will allow targets to be set for a nation within the United Kingdom. I suspect that the Committee has by now understood my hon. Friend's point.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> I hope that the Committee has indeed understood my point, which is that the regions of England have just as much right to be recognised in the Bill as do the so-called countries of Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, which, together with England, form the United Kingdom. In so far as amendment No. 12 is defective, I hope that it will be possible to bring forward on Report an amendment about the right of the English regions to set targets. I note the Minister's comment that the Bill will apply to the whole of the United Kingdom sooner rather than later. We can discuss that matter on Report, so I shall take up no more of the Committee's time.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The hon. Member for Ceredigion (Mr. Dafis) should now move formally amendments Nos. 28, 29 and 30.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tony Clarke </B>(Northampton, South): On a point of order, Mr. Stevenson. Did we not discuss amendment No. 29 yesterday, and should we not now come to amendment No. 39?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Yes, amendment No. 29 was debated yesterday but it should be moved formally at this stage of our proceedings. I am advised that we are following the correct procedure, and I trust that that is the case.

<P>
<B>Mr. Dafis:</B> I shall not detain the Committee for long. The amendment will introduce a preferable and more acceptable from of words. The same applies to amendment No. 32, which related to ``gases'' instead of ``greenhouse gases''.
<P>
Amendment No. 17, tabled by the hon. Member for Christchurch, would replace ``greenhouse gases'' with ``carbon dioxide'', but I do not want to accept that because road traffic emits gases other than CO2, even though it is the most common.
<P>
Amendment No. 33 clarifies the Bill by inserting ``traffic'' before ``congestion''. I would not accept amendment No. 18, tabled by the hon. Member for Christchurch, because, although I am relaxed about including extra criteria, it would delete the word, ``congestion''. The Minister may consider the hon. Gentleman's point when preparing reports on effects on national and regional competitiveness.
<P>
Amendment No. 50 concerns disability. We should recognise that disabled people have benefited from using cars and that taxis are a flexible form of transport. However, an alternative version of that amendment has been tabled today in starred amendment No. 52. I understand, Mr. Stevenson, that you do not feel that we can consider it today. I hope that we may debate it on Report because it would be a useful addition to the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Bottomley:</B> Is the Hon. Gentleman saying that amendment no. 52 would be preferable to amendment No. 50? If so, would you consider, Mr. Stevenson, saving time by putting starred amendment No. 52 to the Committee? Within our rules, we can insert amendment No. 50, with the intention of putting amendment No. 52 in later. However, it might be more comprehensible and straightforward to allow the starred amendment today.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dafis:</B> That is a matter for you, Mr. Stevenson. It would be acceptable to me because amendment No. 52 is not different in meaning or substance from amendment No. 50, but is better drafted.
<P>
Amendment No. 34 simply improves the grammar of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> I have no objection to the removal of ``other'', but what does the hon. Gentleman mean by ``social impacts''?
<P>
<B>Mr. Dafis:</B> I am grateful to have an opportunity to say something about that. I am thinking of such things as the quality of children's lives and their ability to play in the street. I am also thinking of the social damage caused to communities by the scale and speed of traffic travelling through housing estates. Such impacts should be considered when we determine traffic reduction targets.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> I urge you, Mr. Stevenson, not to depart from our usual practice on starred amendments and not to accept amendment No. 52. Amendments are starred because we have had no opportunity to consider them.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. For the benefit of the Committee, I have already advised that amendment No. 52 would be unacceptable.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> I am obliged to you for that ruling, Mr. Stevenson.
<P>
Amendment No. 31, to which the hon. Member for Ceredigion referred, will remove the link between subsections (1) and (2) and subsection (3). In the Bill as drafted, the Secretary of State would have to have regard to all items specified in paragraphs (a) to (g) of subsection (3) in preparing his report. However, under the amendment, the Secretary of State must have regard to those items merely in
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``considering how to comply with the requirements of subsections (1) and (2)''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We know from earlier debate that the requirements of subsections (1) and (2) are minimal, to say the least. Subsection (1) requires the Secretary of State to set and to publish in a report targets for road traffic reduction--but no time scale is specified. Moreover, subsection (2) states that there is no obligation on the Secretary of State to comply with subsection (1) if he publishes a report explaining his reasoning.
<P>
The amendment is significant. The Secretary of State and the Minister are keen to delete the link between the report and subsection (3). Under the amendment, a report explaining the reasoning, produced under subsection (2), will not have to spell out how that reasoning was applied to the items specified in paragraphs (a) to (g) of subsection (3). The amendment further weakens the Bill; I am surprised that the hon. Member for Ceredigion finds it acceptable.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Dafis:</B> If the hon. Gentleman refers to amendment No. 31, I cannot see how replacing the words ``preparing the report'' with
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``considering how to comply with the requirements of subsections (1) and (2)''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
weakens the Bill. I understand that complying with the requirements of subsection (1) and (2) involves preparing a report.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> If it makes no difference, as the hon. Gentleman argues, why propose the amendment?
<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> I understood, as I am sure did other hon. Members, that in his most recent speech about the amendment, the hon. Member for Ceredigion argued not that it made no difference, but that it effectively strengthens the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> The Minister asserts that the amendment strengthens the Bill; perhaps later she can explain how. The Secretary of State's having regard to various matters in preparing a report under subsection (3) would ostensibly appear to be a stronger requirement than the Secretary of State's having regard to those matters in considering how to comply with the so-called requirements of subsections (1) and (2), which, as I have already argued, are weak requirements.
<P>
Amendment No. 32, tabled by the hon. Member for Ceredigion, proposes a more precise definition of greenhouse gases. No one would disagree that there is much to be said for precision, although there is controversy among scientists about which gases contribute to climate change and to what extent. When we talk colloquially about CO2 emissions from road transport and from other energy consumption and production processes, we take the people with us. They understand what is going on, which is why my amendment No. 17 is more precise than the alternative set out in amendment No. 32.
<P>
11 am
<P>
Amendment No. 33, tabled by the hon. Member for Ceredigion, inserts the word, ``traffic'' before the word, ``congestion''. I agree with that absolutely. I also agree that my amendment No. 18 would remove a concept that has some substance. In those circumstances, I shall not press amendment No. 18 to a vote. I hope to redraft it to incorporate the concept of traffic congestion in the Bill without deleting paragraph (d) as amended. I have referred often to traffic congestion, and I shall not continue to do so, but I recognise the importance of including it in the Bill. I am glad that amendment No. 33 will allow that to happen.
<P>
I should like to see a specific reference to national and regional competitiveness. The Committee knows that the Government have published a thick document on regional competitiveness indicators, which includes references to the effect on competitiveness of various transport policies in the regions and of congestion. It is important to incorporate that in the list in subsection (3), and I hope to return to that on Report.
<P>
My amendment No. 19 was criticised by Friends of the Earth for being pedantic. It was not intended to be pedantic. The phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``danger to other road users''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
means road users other than road traffic, which includes cyclists and pedestrians. However, because road traffic, as made clear in our discussion on clause 1, will include motorcyclists, cars and lorries, the effect of restricting paragraph (f) to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``danger to other road users''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
will be to exclude danger to motorcyclists. I am sure that that is not the intention of the Bill's promoter. Amendment No. 19 would be preferable because it deals with the whole issue of road safety without making it so narrow.
<P>
Amendment No. 34 deletes the word ``other'', which I accepted in my intervention. I am grateful to the hon. Member for Ceredigion for saying what he has in mind by using the phrase ``social impacts'', but I am disappointed by his narrow interpretation of it. Instead of defining social impacts more precisely, my amendment No. 20 would add a reference to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``individual mobility and personal freedom.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The hon. Gentleman's concerns, which he identified in response to my question on social impacts, would be embraced by the reference to individual mobility and personal freedom. I hope that that will find favour with the Committee.
<P>
This group of amendments also includes new clauses 1 to 4, 7 and 8, which are of some signficance. New clause 1 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``In preparing the report the Secretary of State shall have regard to . . . the transport need of rural areas and communities . . . the transport needs of people living on low incomes . . . any reports drawn up pursuant to the Road Traffic Reduction Act 1997 and any actions taken or to be taken pursuant to these reports.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is nothing more than good common sense.
<P>
New clause 2 refers to the special role of motorways, inter-urban trunk roads and trans-European networks. Committee members will be aware that there are significant differences in the national traffic forecasts for those types of roads and the function that they perform in the economy. They are not used just for access; much people's anxiety about road traffic relates to roads that should just be used for access but are being used as through routes. Motorways, inter-urban trunk roads and trans-European networks were built, designed and commissioned on the basis that they would take long-distance traffic from one place to another. It is right that they should be given a special regard in any reports.
<P>
New clause 3 refers to the National Road Traffic Forecasts (Great Britain) 1997, and I should have thought that it would be acceptable to the Government, as they produced those forecasts. According to the latest information, however, the Government have not yet produced the six background papers referred to in that publication in October 1997, which they said would be available shortly. That worries me and other hon. Members.
<P>
It will not have escaped the Committee's notice that new clause 4 was drafted by me and has been adopted by the promoter. I hope that the Minister accepts new clause 4 as it accords with common sense and fits in with some of the thinking developed in our earlier discussions. Although the Minister may regard the new clause as something of an unholy alliance between the promoter and me, I hope that she will regard that as an extra reason why she should accept it.
<P>
The other new clauses in this group are new clauses 7 and 8. Members of the Committee will have noticed that, as a result of a drafting error--perhaps my writing was not as legible as it might have been--new clause 7 does not make sense as it stands, so I shall not ask the Committee to consider it. New clause 8 addresses an important point about consultation, and I hope that the Minister will give some undertakings about the nature and time scale of that consultation.
<P>
All those new clauses have one thing in common--the premise behind all of them is that the wording in clause 2(3) remains unaltered. Subsection (3) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``In preparing the report the Secretary of State shall''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That has been changed by recent amendments and, for technical reasons, new clauses 1, 2, 3 and 4 now require minor redrafting. I hope that it will be possible to redraft them, particularly new clause 4 which has the support of the promoter, so that they fit more easily with subsection (3) as amended. I hope that that is the spirit in which we shall discuss the new clauses and I look forward to the Minister's response.
<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> I rise to support the amendments tabled by the hon. member for Ceredigion and myself--amendments Nos. 31, 32 33 and 34. Amendments Nos. 33 and 34 will add clarity to the Bill. Amendment No. 31, which caused the hon. Member for Christchurch some concern, will strengthen the Bill because it makes clear something that was already implicit: that the considerations listed in subsection (3) will need to be taken into account when considering how to comply with the requirements not just of subsection (1) but of subsection (2).
<P>
The Government support amendment No. 32 because it will introduce a definition of ``greenhouse gases''. Amendment No. 17, which was tabled by the hon. Member for Christchurch and which I urge the Committee to oppose, limits to carbon dioxide the greenhouse gases to which the Secretary of State must have regard. All gases that are relevant to climate change should be considered. It is important that we accept that our knowledge in such areas is not finite and complete. Our store of knowledge of what can damage our environment is increasing, if not every day, certainly annually, and limiting the Secretary of State's consideration to carbon dioxide would not be helpful to the desired outcome.
<P>
Amendment No. 18, which was also tabled by the hon. Member for Christchurch, would remove the word ``congestion'' and replace it with
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``effects on national and regional competitiveness''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That would be an excessively broad definition. Important though transport is to both national and regional competitiveness, it is not the exclusive determinant. The Government are seeking to regenerate regions that have suffered from a lack of attention and interest from the previous Administration and there may be beneficial effects from the provision as it stands. I argue strongly that the Committee should reject the amendment.
<P>
Amendment No. 18 refers to road safety. The hon. Member for Christchurch wants to omit ``danger to other road users'' and insert ``effects on road safety''--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I believe that the Minister is referring to amendment No. 19.
<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> What did I say?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> You said amendment No. 18.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I apologise, Mr. Stevenson. I meant to say amendment No. 19.
<P>
In principle, of course we accept that there is not a huge difference in practice between the two formulations, but the list takes into account the broadest effects of road traffic, especially the effect that private forms of motorised transport can have on other groups, especially pedestrians and cyclists. The latest reports show that it is often pedestrians on pavements who are in the greatest danger from road traffic. In considering the danger to other road users we will consider road safety in its broadest sense, but we do not believe that the amendment is sensible.

<P>

<B>Mr. Chope:</B> Does the Minister accept that, as drafted, the Bill does not require anyone to take account of the danger to motor cyclists from other types of road traffic?
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> The hon. Gentleman seems to be arguing that the Bill should list every potential means of movement. He mentioned motor cyclists; does he mean all motor cyclists, or will it depend on the size of the engine? Does he include powered two-wheel scooters? Does he want a list of every means of moving around that is within the ingenuity and the pockets of individuals?
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> I do not want an enormous list, but I want the hon. Lady to consider the issue that I raised in the amendment--that at present the danger to motor cyclists is specifically excluded. In my definition of road safety, motor cyclists and every other group of people who use the roads would be expressly included.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> The hon. Gentleman answered his own question, but he significantly failed to answer mine. I asked about definition, especially in respect of motor cycles and other powered two-wheelers, such as cycles with small electric engines. The hon. Gentleman is arguing for an ever-lengthening list because if one category were in the Bill, why should not every category be included? Would the hon. Gentleman argue that rickshaws, which have been introduced in cities such as Oxford and Liverpool, should be included? The hon. Gentleman's proposal is not a sensible approach to the Bill.
<P>
In preparing reports, all the factors listed by the hon. Member for Christchurch in new clauses 1 to 4 must be taken into account. However, it would not be sensible for the Bill to specify those factors because it is not inclusive; the factors that will need to be taken into account could be very large. The trouble with lists is that they exclude and unless the Bill were excessively long, some of those exclusions could be vital in defining a report that is comprehensible and effective.
<P>
The list appears to pre-judge questions that we would need time to consider: for example, new clause 4 suggests that different targets would be needed for different classes of traffic. I am not prepared to dispute that this morning; it is something that we will need to take into consideration, but it would be a mistake to assume that we need to divide targets in this way before more detailed considerations have been taken into account.
<P>
Undoubtedly we need to consider the beneficial effects of new technology in reducing the adverse impact of road traffic, but new clause 7 is unnecessary as the positive benefits of new technology are widely known, and some are already being employed. I hope that the Committee will reject new clause 8. The Government have consistently said that consultation is at the heart of all our policy-making decisions. We shall consult very widely--there is no reason not to; indeed, in many instances, it will not be possible to define targets in precise terms without that consultation. The new clause is unnecessary.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dafis:</B> I shall not move amendment No. 50.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I understand that the hon. Gentleman does not wish to move amendment No. 50.

<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 35, in page 1, line 26, leave out from `appropriate' to `publish' in line 27.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take amendment No. 21, in page 1, line 27, leave out `three' and insert `two'.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> The amendment, to which I referred in our debate on Second Reading, is necessary to avoid what could become the absurd position of reports having to be produced every three years ad infinitum, unless amending legislation were introduced. That does not mean that we do not value the importance of regular intervals in which to take stock; we are living in a rapidly changing world and time is needed to consider and to check the progress, or lack of it, which could stimulate further action.
<P>
I assure the Committee, especially the hon. Member for Ceredigion, that I expect subsequent reports to be prepared at least once every three years in the initial period after the Bill has been enacted. I hope that with that assurance, the Committee will look favourably on the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> The Minister's undertaking could be accommodated if the wording were revised to require reports to be made at least every three years for the first 10 years after the Bill is enacted. Amendment No. 21 proposes reports every two years. We should be concerned about levels of road traffic, and that is why the Government have been collecting statistics relating to road traffic. If there is to be a policy relating to road traffic, it should be reviewed regularly. If the Government are really committed to having targets, reports should be provided so that we can measure progress against those targets.
<P>
We have regular reports on target setting and achievement against targets in education. We have targets for air quality. None of those targets are of any use unless there is a system for ensuring that reports are produced at regular intervals. That applies to all Governments, of whatever political persuasion, and especially a Government who might be slightly embarrassed about their lack of progress in achieving targets that they had signed up to.
<P>
I take the Minister's point that in 1,000 years' time it might be considered redundant to legislate on the requirement to produce a report only every three years. In the immediate future, particularly when we are talking about targets laid down through international environmental agreements which already extend until 2020, such a time scale is not unreasonable. Certainly, my proposal--that further reports should be published at least every two years rather than just relying on the Minister's word that they would be every three years--is significant.
<P>
What is the starting point for subsequent reports? It is the time at which the first report is published. There is nothing in the Bill to provide when the first report is to be published, so we are relying on the Minister's expression of good intension. Ministers do not always stay in the same position for that length of time and another Minister could say that there was no obligation to publish by a certain time. We know as politicians how gaps in the legislation can be exploited and how ostensible undertakings or statements of intent can be found to be wanting when there is a change of opinion. I will not remind the Committee about the dramatic change between what the Minister and many of her hon. Friends were saying about the subject a year ago and what they say now.
<P>
On the face of it, the issue is not important and it could be said to make little difference. But what cannot be measured cannot be controlled. If targets are to be set, it must be possible to measure achievement against those targets, and do so regularly. It can be awkward for people to have to produce annual or bi-annual reports that enable progress on an issue to be assessed from one year to the next, but I am sorry that the Minister insists on withdrawing the original proposal in the Bill, which was a reasonable requirement.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tom Brake (Carshalton and Wallington):</B> As the Minister has mentioned the initial period after the Bill, could she tell us what that would be? It would not be unreasonable for the report to be produced every three years until 2010, which is a key date in terms of CO2 emissions.
<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes a valid point. If we estimate that the first report would be produced 18 months after the Bill is enacted, that would take us up to the millennium. Given the importance of the date that he mentioned--and 2015 is also important--I see no reason why the Secretary of State should not ensure that reports were made every three years. However, reports may need to be made more often. However, we believe that the Bill, with other policies, will have a marked, palpable effect and it is possible that the time between reports could be extended.
<P>
Despite the arguments of the hon. Member for Christchurch, the amendment would not relieve the Secretary of State of the obligation to publish a report. I am sure that the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Mr. Brake) knows that.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Dafis:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 36, in page 2, leave out lines 4 and 5.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, we may take amendment No. 23, in page 2, line 4, leave out `12' and insert `6'.
<P>
Mr. Dafis
<P>
: Amendment No. 36 is connected with amendment No. 37, which we discussed earlier. The Bill requires the Secretary of State to report to Parliament. The amendment would remove the reference to the period of time in which the first report was to be presented, but it is important to emphasise that, as the Minister said, we would expect the first report to be presented to Parliament within 18 months of the Bill becoming an Act.
<P>
The beginning of the process and the report should not be delayed, because we want to achieve targets by 2010. The amendment has been tabled on the understanding that the first report would appear within 18 months of the Bill becoming an Act.
<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> I support the amendment, which is tabled in my name and that of the hon. Member for Ceredigion. Again, I reasure the Committee that the report will be presented within 18 months of the Bill becoming an Act. If the Bill becomes an Act by August, the first report should be published in time for the millennium.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> No. I have finished.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman wish to speak?
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> Yes. The Minister has not explained why 18 months should elapse before the publication of the first report. If the matter is as important as the Government say, why cannot the report be published sooner? People are worried that the consultation paper for the 1997 Act took so long to appear. No report that covers the United Kingdom needs to await the individual reports that local authorities may provide. Why cannot the Government publish a report within the first 18 months after the Bill has been enacted? The Minister says that she does not want to produce a report within 12 months and asks us to remove the requirement for her to do so from the Bill. She asks us to accept her undertaking to produce a report in 18 months. However, before we accept that, we want a fuller explanation from the Minister as to why she cannot produce the report within, say, six months. I give way to the hon. Lady.

<P>

<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I did not seek to rise. I am entranced by what the hon. Gentleman is saying.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> The Minister's approach seems to be that she is the Government: power has gone to her head and she need not answer any questions or explain her actions. She stands before the Committee, bullying the promoter of the Bill--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I have detected nothing that could fairly be called bullying in the course of our proceedings.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> I am grateful to you, Mr. Stevenson, for your finding. I did not want to imply that such behaviour had occurred in the Committee's proceedings. However, prior to our sitting, something must have happened to cause the amendment to be moved. We know what that was. On Second Reading, the Minister told the hon. Member for Ceredigion that unless he submitted to the terms of the amendment, the Government would not support the Bill. It is a matter of semantics to say whether that amounts to bullying or pressure. An ultimatum was given to the promoter on Second Reading and he has submitted to it.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> Simply on a matter of fact, not semantics, the hon. Gentleman's previous remarks about what happened on Second Reading are completely inaccurate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> The record will show the truth, but because I have not brought my Hansard of Second Reading proceedings with me, I shall have to leave it to others to decide who is right. The Minister certainly said on Second Reading that she did not want to be tied down to a specific timescale.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> If I remember correctly, the hon. Gentleman accused me of bullying during our debate on Second Reading. I am simply pointing out to him and to the Committee that to the best of my knowledge I did not then, nor ever have, bullied anyone.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> The Minister is now getting into semantics. I used an alternative expression: I said that she gave an ultimatum. She will not disagree with that or with the substance of my remarks.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I am sorry to disappoint the hon. Gentleman but I do disagree with that. No ultimatum was given.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> I am sorry that the Minister keeps making points that can be clarified by reading the report of the Second Reading debate. She is neither able nor willing to answer the substance of my point--why can she not provide a reason for not producing a report sooner than 18 months after the Bill is enacted? That is a serious omission and a matter of great regret. I am sure that other members of the Committee will note the arrogant posture adopted by the Government over this issue.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I am amazed at the sensitivities developing in Conservative Members. I have no doubt that the hon. Member for Christchurch was pleased and honoured--if not sycophantic about it--to serve under that embodiment of arrogance par excellence now in the other place, when she was his Prime Minister.
<P>
I should like to refer to the minute substance that was buried in the latest contribution from the hon. Member for Christchurch. He asked why a report could not be published in less than 18 months and why it could not be published within six months. In his earlier contributions, he has stated that there should be widespread and detailed consultation and had tabled an amendment to that effect. Consultation takes time. The Government have made it clear that we believe that consultation is necessary on all policy matters, and it will certainly be necessary in this case.
<P>
Under clause 2(3) of the Bill, Secretaries of State will be required to consider the following: emissions of greenhouse gases; effects on air quality; effects on health; congestion; effects on land and biodiversity; danger to other road users; other social impacts. Many strands will need to be brought together in considering each of those seven headings.
<P>
The kind of report that we are discussing is not some empty, meaningless piece of paper; it is not a glossy document that does nothing. The report will have a specific purpose and a desired outcome. It will require work and consultation. It will push forward the purpose of the Bill--the reduction of the number of vehicles on our roads, with all the concomitant benefits. Those benefits will include improvements in air quality, and in the nation's health; they will ensure that the country is not burdened by unnecessary economic debilities. Everyone engaged in the production of such a report will have to work extremely hard. 18 months is a reasonable period to ensure that the reports are worth the paper that they are printed on and worth reading. They will not only be worthy of detailed examination; they will be instruments in producing the desired effect of road traffic reduction. I am sure that that is the desire of the majority of members of the Committee. However, the contributions of the hon. Member for Christchurch leave me with grave doubts about whether he has any desire to see the Bill make progress at all.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> I am grateful for the opportunity to deal with the ad hominem argument made by the Minister against the distinguished and noble baroness, the former Prime Minister.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am certain that members of the Committee have understood the differences between the Minister and the hon. Gentleman on that matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> You, Mr. Stevenson, will understand the need to exercise the right of reply on behalf of someone who is not present and who has been attacked for arrogance. [Interruption.] I should like to inform the Committee that at a recent meeting of the Select Committee on Modernisation of the House of Commons--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman is pushing this matter too far. He must realise that we cannot consider the deliberations of the Modernisation Committee. I repeat that I am certain that the exchanges that have taken place between the Minister and the hon. Member have left members of the Committee in no doubt whatever about their points of disagreement.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> The Minister's hon. Friend, the hon. Member for Burnley (Mr. Pike), said that during his membership of the House, he regarded the former Prime Minister, the noble Baroness Thatcher, then the right hon. Member for Finchley, as the least arrogant leader of any political party. I put that on record because it is absolutely wrong that the Minister should attack a former Prime Minister in that way. I draw attention to the fact that one of the Minister's hon. Friends, showing a more generous spirit, has praised the noble baroness for her distinguished service to this House.
<P>
The Minister has told the Committee about the elaborate, detailed and painstaking process that will be needed to produce a report that will enable the Government to decide whether to adopt a target and, if so, what it should be. That contrasts significantly with the approach of the Deputy Prime Minister at the Kyoto summit, where he signed up, with representatives of other European countries, to an 8 per cent. reduction in carbon dioxide emissions. About a year ago he and other members of the Government were leading us--Friends of the Earth included--to believe that they were keen to sign up to a 20 per cent. reduction. The Deputy Prime Minister has not produced any detailed reports, and in a much shorter time frame than the Minister was speaking of he has established a United Kingdom target of an 8 per cent. reduction in carbon dioxide emissions, although, as he has said, he does not yet know how that will be achieved.
<P>
The Government have all the way along given the impression that they intended to set the target and then set out the means by which it would be achieved. We now learn from the Minister that things will be the other way round. The Government will conduct substantial inquiries, produce a report and then decide whether a target should be set and, if so, at what level. I am simply drawing to the Committee's attention the contrast between the Minister's attitude to the present matter and the Deputy Prime Minister's at the Kyoto summit
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> I take up the points made by the hon. Member for Christchurch about my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister, who earned the praise of the whole House for his sterling work at Kyoto in ensuring that legally binding targets were agreed internationally. The 8 per cent. figure is, as I am sure the hon. Gentleman is aware, a legally binding international target. The 20 per cent. reduction is the national target to which the Government are committed.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman attempted to put words in my mouth with respect to the compilation and publication of the report. I did not say that the main thrust of the report was to avoid the setting of any target. I made certain points about the complexities inherent in producing a valid, valuable and worthwhile report. It is a time-consuming task and 18 months is an adequate time in which to produce such a report.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> I hear that the Minister says. I disagree, but am sure that other people will be interested that she has reaffirmed the Government's commitment to a 20 per cent. target for CO2 reductions. A rather different impression was created by her right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer in his Budget statement. However, that is outside the context of today's discussions.
<P>
I am disappointed that the Minister is not prepared to explain further the difference between her attitude to the matter that we are considering and the Deputy Prime Minister's attitude to signing up to a legally binding agreement without knowing how it will be implemented. I leave that contrast before the Committee.

<B>Mr. Chope:</B> I should be grateful if the Minister could tell us her estimate of the costs that will be incurred by the Bill. She was unable or unwilling to answer that when the money resolution was debated. Can she give us some insight today?
<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> No, Mr. Deputy Speaker-- I beg your pardon, Mr. Stevenson.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> No, carry on.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> So many Adjournment debates, as Madam Speaker had occasion to say.
<P>
As the hon. Member for Christchurch knows, clause 3 is necessary to provide for any expenses incurred by the Secretary of State arising from the Bill. I cannot furnish him with detail. I am amazed that he thinks that that would be possible. Given his lengthy examination of the Bill, most recently on the complexities of gathering together relevant information and publishing a report, I doubt that my reply will satisfy him. If he would be satisfied with a letter, I would be happy to write to him in greater detail.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> I am very grateful to the hon. Lady for accommodating my desire.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> The hon. Gentleman is deluding himself.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> She blows hot and cold and plays fast and loose. She obviously thinks she has already entered a mayoral contest with Lord Archer.

<P>
Brought up, and read the First time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dafis:</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
I do not wish to say anything of significance about new clause 6. I assume that it is technically unnecessary. I am sure that nothing in the Bill would prohibit any person from driving a motor vehicle, but to avoid doubt, I thought it useful to raise that matter and to put it on the record. That is why I tabled new clause 6.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Member for Ceredigion for introducing new clause 6. I would have been disappointed had he not supported it because it is taken, word for word, from the Bill that he and his colleagues thought they were getting when they received paper No. 10 from Friends of the Earth in January this year.
<P>
The wording of the new clause is of significance to a wider group of people than that in the Committee. It is designed to allay concerns and to fit in with much of what was said by Friends of the Earth and other supporters of the Bill. They did not wish anything in the Bill to be taken as
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``conferring any power to prohibit any person from driving any motor vehicle . . . prohibiting or conferring any power to prohibit any person from driving any motor vehicle on any highway . . . over-ruling, varying, suspending or altering in any way planning permission deemed or granted by any planning authority.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If our worries can be allayed without incorporating the new clause, I agree with the hon. Member for Ceredigion that we do not need to push it to a Division. I hope that the Minister will explain how she intends to allay those concerns.
<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> I hope that I shall be able to allay the hon. Gentleman's fears. The new clause is unnecessary. The Bill does not specify any new powers in the subjects covered. No new powers will be created, and there is no need to spell that out. I understand that the provision is also legally unsatisfactory because it implies doubt where in fact none exists. I trust that that is a sufficiently calming reply and that either the motion will be withdrawn or the Committee will reject it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> In the light of those comments, I shall not press new clause 6 to a vote. I am sure that the hon. Member for Ceredigion will agree.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dafis:</B> I agree, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.
<P>
Motion and clause, by leave, withdrawn.

(b) the need for different targets for urban traffic, inter urban traffic and rural traffic.'.--[Mr. Dafis.]
<P>
Brought up, and read the First and Second time.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The Question is that the new clause be added to the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dafis:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Stevenson. There seems to have been a misunderstanding on new clause 4. The hon. Member for Christchurch drafted new clause 4 and I added my name to it, but I do not believe that the Committee intended to add it to the Bill.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Do I take that as a request to withdraw new clause 4?
<P>
<B>Mr. Dafis:</B> For my part, yes. I wish to withdraw it.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> I am confused because I understood that the Committee had voted to add the new clause to the Bill. We have discussed the arguments in favour of the new clause and, as its promoter, I would prefer it to be part of the Bill. Any defects could be ironed out on Report, and I ask the Committee to stand by its decision to add the new clause to the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dafis:</B> I prefer that the new clause is not added to the Bill at this stage.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> That will be a matter for the Committee. The hon. Member for Christchurch is correct: the Second reading Question was put and the decision has been made. I am obliged to put the matter to a further vote and hon. Members will vote accordingly. The Question is that new clause 4 be added to the Bill.
<P>
Question accordingly negatived.
<P>
Question proposed, That the Chairman do report the Bill, as amended, to the House.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dafis:</B> I shall speak briefly. I confirm that I have not suffered any bullying from the Minister in the process of preparing for the Committee, nor have I been served with any ultimatum. Our discussions have been amicable and our dialogue has been useful. There has been give and take on both sides. My supporters and I have conceded on certain points and on important points we have found the Minister prepared to listen carefully and to agree that provisions be included to give the Bill teeth and to make it significant if and when it reaches the statute book.
<P>
I thank the Minister--and the civil servants who work with her--for her co-operation and support for the theme of the Bill and her recognition of the need for policies that build upon it. I appreciate her agreement to consider amendment No. 41 and to discuss a similar amendment on Report.
<P>
I thank the hon. Member for Christchurch, especially for his solicitude for my welfare. I was moved by his concern that I might have been attacked in recent weeks, but I bear no bruises. He wounded me on one matter: the distinction between the Bill and the Road Traffic Reduction Act 1997. I was unable to respond adequately to him at the time, but I understand that he has received correspondence on the matter.
<P>
More than anything, I thank members of the Committee who sat patiently throughout our proceedings--some of them contributed to the debate--and who had to be more patient than they and I might have anticipated. I am extremely grateful to them and I hope that they will derive comfort from the fact that in sitting on the Committee they have been part of something significant. I have no doubt about the importance of the issue that will now be reported to the House. It is a matter of great seriousness and substance.
<P>
I was glad to hear from the Minister that the Government are still committed to a 20 per cent. CO2 reduction target by 2010, although it is not a legally binding target under the terms of the Kyoto agreement. It is good to know that the Government nevertheless take that original commitment seriously; it is essential. In order to meet that commitment, we must set substantial targets for road traffic reduction of about 10 per cent.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> I begin by thanking you, Mr. Stevenson, for steering the Committee in accordance with proper procedure, and with good humour, to a destination that some of us had no doubt that we would reach--I think that the hon. Member for Ceredigion, the promoter, at times wondered whether we ever would. It is because of your firm chairmanship and guidance on matters relating to procedure and order that we have reached this stage when we have. I am grateful to you, Mr. Stevenson, as, I am sure, are other hon. Members.
<P>
I am also grateful to the hon. Member for Ceredigion, the promoter, for the reason with which he addressed the arguments. I hope that that approach will become infectious and that we shall see more evidence of it from the Government in future. Arguably, at the end of the proceedings, we began to see it from the Minister.
<P>
I also thank the Minister for her participation in the debate. It is extremely arduous being a Minister at any time, but to have three full sittings in Committee considering a private Member's Bill in quick succession, with all the other responsibilities, that the hon. Lady has, is even more so. We are pleased that she could be with us throughout to participate in our deliberations.
<P>
I also thank all other Committee members, some of whom spoke more than others, who ensured that we had a quorum and that the subject could be discussed properly.

<P>

<B>Mr. Brake:</B> I welcome the rapid progress that has been made today. A welcome small step has been taken towards improving the environment and reducing traffic congestion. I congratulate the hon. Member for Ceredigion on achieving that and welcome the support that the Government have given. Over coming months, Liberal Democrat Members will closely monitor progress made under the Bill and under the 20 per cent. CO2 reduction targets.
<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> I also begin by thanking you, Mr. Stevenson, for your chairmanship. I also thank your officials, the Oficial Report and the Door Keeper, who has been important when the Committee has chosen to vote.
<P>
I also thank the hon. Member for Ceredigion for his charming words. I think that I speak for all hon. Members when I reiterate our admiration for him in having worked so hard. I also thank Friends of the Earth for ensuring that the Bill has come as far as it has. I have little doubt that we all wish it well, and look forward to its eventual standing on the statute book. As the hon. Member for Ceredigion said, and as the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Mr. Brake) has just pointed out, it is a small but important step on a road that it is necessary to travel not only for our people, for our quality of life, and for the nation's health and economy but inasmuch as we can show what can be achieved. That is very important in the wider international context.
<P>
I also thank all Committee members, the majority of whom sit behind me. Their support has been palpable and consistent, and I thank those hon. Members for it. I do not exaggerate when I say that we all regard our participation in assisting the progress of this Bill as something of a privilege.
<P>
I thank the hon. Member for Christchurch for his kind words about my appearance in this Committee. I must be honest, and at times I though that the hon. Gentleman liked sitting opposite me so much that he was intent on ensuring that we sat for many more days. I am delighted with the way in which he has co-operatively put his questions--although he has not stinted in either the length or perception of those questions--so that we can be sure in the knowledge that the Bill can be reported as having completed its consideration in Committee.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before I put the Question, I would like to place on record my thanks to all members of the Committee. It will not have escaped hon. Members' attention that some of us are on a fairly greasy pole when chairing Committees. I am extremely grateful for the patience and consideration of all members of the Committee, and would also like to thank the Minister's officials and especially the Clerk. The reasons for my references to shin pads and bruises were due entirely to my shortcomings. I thank all hon. Members, officials and staff who have helped in the progress of the Bill.
<P>
Bill, as amended, to be reported.
