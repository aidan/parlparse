<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020291000407"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Betts.
Your predecessors have made steady progress on the Bill. As you will
have noticed, we have only made it to clause 6 so we hope that, under
your wise chairmanship, we shall be able to make speedier progress
today. We had a good debate on parental satisfaction surveys last week
in which we set out some of our worries about them. We discussed
whether they were likely to prove value for money and whether it was
sensible for the Government to impose them on local
authorities.</div><a name="10020291000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
140 and 142 tabled in my name and that of my hon. Friend the Member for
Mid-Dorset and North Poole express our concern about how the Government
intend to impose the parental satisfaction surveys on local
authorities. As well as imposing the surveys, whether or not the local
authorities want them and whether they think that they will be good
value for money, under subsections (3) and (4), the Government seek
through regulations to prescribe in detail how the surveys are carried
out. The amendments would delete those subsections. They are
unnecessary. We question whether it is sensible to have the surveys
imposed in such a way, but if they are to be, surely there should be
some flexibility whereby local authorities can decide the issues on
which they want to consult parents. There also needs to be something
more flexible than the blueprint that the Government have so far set
out.</div><a name="10020291000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
188 is a probing amendment about the scope within the surveys to look
at different aspects of the provision of education that might be of
concern to some parental groups. It was inspired by the Special
Educational Consortium, which would like a power to be created to allow
local authorities specifically to seek the views of parents of children
with special educational needs or disabilities. The SEC says that that
large group of parents often has particular issues and worries about
the provision of special educational needs not only in one school but
in a whole group. We have serious reservations about the system; we
would like it to be more flexible. However, within the constraints
imposed by that system, we want to test whether the Government are
willing to give local authorities the power to raise other issues
rather than simply test parents&#146; views about education in a
simplistic way, without specifying issues that might cause
concern.</div>
<a name="10020291000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a
further purpose to amendment 188, which the Special Educational
Consortium encouraged us to table. Many other groups dealing with
special educational needs would like to understand better the
Government&#146;s own interpretation of the words &#147;different
descriptions&#148; in clause 1(7), which states that the parent and
pupil guarantees can be applied differently for pupils of different
descriptions. That is also the wording that we use in amendment 188. We
want to hear from the Minister how he envisages using this particular
discretion and whether he envisages that the pupil and parent guarantee
should be watered down for young people with special educational needs,
or whether additional provision and support should be available for
those young people over and above that for other
pupils.</div>
<a name="10020291000044"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020291000408"></a>The
Minister for Schools and Learners (Mr. Vernon
Coaker):</b> Good morning to you, Mr. Betts, and to
the Committee. I, too, welcome you to the Chair.</div>
<a name="10020291000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 146
would remove new section 19J(3), which provides a delegated power to
make regulations about the arrangements made by a local authority for 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column315" />Column number: 315</div>the purposes of carrying out a parental satisfaction survey. This
section enables us to prescribe that authorities should carry out
separate surveys for parents and pupils in different age groups if we
so wish. It also ensures that we can outline to authorities the
practical steps they should take to prepare for the annual
survey.</div><a name="10020291000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">Initially,
we intend to prescribe that local authorities must survey parents of
year 6 children about secondary school provision. However, were we to
extend the duty&#151;for example, to primary school
provision&#151;we would need this delegated power to enable us to
require authorities to carry out separate surveys. That is because, if
we were to seek views on primary school provision, it might be
appropriate to have a different format for such a survey than for
secondary school provision. It must be right that the legislation is
flexible to provide that any such additional survey is fit for
purpose.</div>
<a name="10020291000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 141
would remove new section 19J(4), which allows for regulations to
specify matters relating to the provision of schools on which parents'
views are to be sought and the manner and form in which this should be
done. In formulating this policy, we piloted it in local authorities
and asked parents about how and when they would like to be invited to
share their views on local school provision. The DCSF customer voice
research on parent focus groups was published on 26 November
2009. Feedback from authorities in the trialling of the duty last
autumn was that a level of prescription would be welcome&#151;at
least in the short term&#151;with an agreement to review as the duty
is embedded. Although that does not totally meet what the hon.
Gentleman wants, there is a commitment to review it and see how it
works in practice once the duty has
commenced.</div>
<a name="10020291000048"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020291000409"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> Will the schools to which the amendments relate,
which are defined in the Bill as &#147;relevant schools&#148;,
include academies? In other words, will local authorities also be
surveying people&#146;s views on
academies?</div>
<a name="10020291000049"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020291000410"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> Yes.</div>
<a name="10020291000050"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020291000411"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> So if there is dissatisfaction with schools,
including academies, and further action needs to be taken to deal with
that, will that be a matter for the local authority or for the Young
People&#146;s Learning Agency?</div>
<a name="10020291000051"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020291000412"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> It will be a matter for the YPLA and the local
authority. They will both need to consider how to respond to
that.</div><a name="10020291000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">Regulation-making
powers will enable us to apply the lessons from the trial and future
consultation in order to specify the format of the survey: short,
tick-box questions with an optional comments box. The survey will be
issued to parents residing in the local authority, alongside the
admissions pack&#151;a framework within which to respond to the
questionnaire. The local authorities must make the survey available to
parents both in paper form and online, which will ensure that
parents&#146; opportunity to influence local authority planning is
maximised, and that local authorities up and down the country do not
each have to reinvent the wheel and design their own survey processes
and
forms.</div><a name="10020291000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our
policy aim is for local authorities to seek the views of all parents of
year 6 pupils in the first instance. Amendment 188 is therefore
unnecessary, as it would be needed only for the purposes of clause 6 if
we wished to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column316" />Column number: 316</div>limit the survey to parents of children of a prescribed description.
However, we do not wish to limit the survey in that way. Our underlying
principle is to give all parents an equal voice and influence in the
planning of local schools. Our early work with parents last year showed
that they are keen to respond. We will undertake a formal consultation
in 2010 on the regulations to underpin clause 6, including the
delegated powers and proposed level of description to include more
detail about arrangements for the survey, parents&#146; consent to
the questionnaire and how local authorities would analyse the outcome
and the matters to be dealt with in the response plan. Should any
parent of a child feel that our proposals do not adequately provide for
their specific needs, we would welcome their feedback as part of the
consultation process. It is vital to ask that all have a real voice in
the planning of school
provision.</div><a name="10020291000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
know that the hon. Member for Yeovil is specifically concerned to
ensure that the survey has due regard for parents of children with
special educational needs and allows their children to share their
views. I acknowledge that such parents and children are likely to have
particular views, needs and aspirations. I assure the hon. Gentleman
that we will undertake a full consultation on the content of the survey
to ensure that the important point made in his amendment is addressed
as we put together the regulations underpinning clause 6. I hope that
on that basis, the hon. Gentleman will withdraw his
amendments.</div><a name="10020291000055"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020291000413"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I am grateful, as ever, to the Minister for his
response. We are pleased to hear that there will be a consultation on
the nature of the survey, which may enable some of the views and
concerns raised by the Special Educational Consortium to be taken into
account. I fear that I am not entirely satisfied, however, by the
response, given our concerns about the clause, in particular, the
Minister&#146;s undertaking that new section 19J(3) means that the
measure may be extended to primary schools, and therefore the
Government want to leave further flexibility to expand on the surveys
in the future. It is something that concerns me because it implies even
more costs, and potentially, more waste of public funds. I am surprised
to hear that the feedback he has received from local authorities
indicates that they welcome prescription. I would have thought that
they would argue the case for local discretion. If that feedback from
local authorities is not currently published, will it be possible to
make some of it
public?</div><a name="10020291000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
was also interested to hear that the YPLA, which does not appear to be
mentioned in the Bill, will be one of the enforcement mechanisms in
responding to parental satisfaction surveys. It is important because,
although local authorities will be the ones responsible, presumably,
for carrying out the parental satisfaction surveys, it is quite clear
that the body with strategic responsibility for the quality of
education will be required to make a response. I do not understand how,
if for example, there are problems with academies, the matter will be
dealt with by local authorities. Will the Minister write to the
Committee at some stage to set out how the YPLA will be involved, or
whether the local authority will be involved, where there is concern
about the performance of
academies?</div><a name="10020291000057"></a>

flexibility, the local authorities said to us that in the first

Gibb</b>: I welcome you to our Committee&#146;s proceedings,
Mr. Betts. It is very good to see you here. As the hon.
Member for Yeovil said, I hope that we shall make a bit more progress
than under your two predecessors&#151;not that the blame lies
entirely with the Chairs of Committees such as
ours.</div><a name="10020291000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
need to ascertain three figures from the Government if we are to
understand the provisions of clause 6 properly. We should all
understand the provisions before 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column318" />Column number: 318</div>approving the clause. The first figure we need to know is what turnout
or participation will be or should be regarded as sufficient for the
local authority to rely on the survey as an accurate reflection of the
opinion of the parents
polled.</div><a name="10020291000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
second figure we need to know, in terms of percentages, is what the
following phrase, in paragraph 9 of the policy statement,
means:</div><a name="10020291000333"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Where
LA analysis shows a majority of parents are unhappy with the provision
locally&#148;.</div><a name="10020291000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
statement begs two further questions&#151;what constitutes
&#147;unhappy&#148; and what area is meant by
&#147;locally&#148;&#151;but, for now, the question is: what is a
majority? Is it 50 per cent. plus one vote, is it 51 per cent., or does
the Minister envisage a higher level such as 60 per cent. or 75 per
cent.?</div><a name="10020291000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
third figure we need is the one referred to in paragraph 16 of the
policy
statement:</div><a name="10020291000334"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Where
a particular proportion of parents do not consider that the plan
addresses their concerns, LAs will be required to refer the plan to the
Schools Adjudicator. We will consult on this threshold for
referral.&#148;</div><a name="10020291000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">Appendix
B is not clear about how that response plan will be sent to parents.
Can the Minister confirm that he intends local authorities to send the
response plan, together with an invitation to respond, to all the
eligible parents in the original survey? Perhaps he has in mind a wider
population of parents receiving the plan. Can he also confirm that
those parents will be told that, if a certain percentage of them are
unhappy with the plan, it will be referred to the schools adjudicator?
The question remains: what percentage of unhappiness with the plan
should trigger a
referral?</div><a name="10020291000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
149 seeks to apply a minimum participation rate of 40 per cent. The
amendment is probing, to elicit from the Minister his current thinking.
There needs to be a de minimis and it could, frankly, be a de minimis
that is lower than the 40 per cent. proposed in the amendment. In the
parental responsiveness pilots, the response rates were 4 per cent., 14
per cent., 4 per cent., 20 per cent. and 4 per cent., which all appear
to be low, and too low&#151;I would have thought&#151;to be relied
on. Will the Minister expand further on his
thinking?</div><a name="10020291000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
174, 175 and 176 seek to define &#147;material&#148; for the
purposes of proposed new section 19K(2) in the Education Act 1996. The
amendments, again, are probing. The proposed new section
says:</div><a name="10020291000335"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;If
those results demonstrate material parental dissatisfaction with the
provision of relevant schools in their area, the authority shall
prepare and publish a
plan&#148;.</div><a name="10020291000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
policy statement implies that &#147;material&#148; means a
majority&#151;either 50 per cent. or 50 per cent. plus one&#151;but
what if there is a sizeable minority of parents, say 25 per cent., who
are deeply unhappy with their local school? What if that minority all
related to a certain location? What if 10 per cent. of parents is a
significant bloc because of the sheer size of our larger local
authorities? Reports on the parental responsiveness trial showed that
48 per cent. of parents were unhappy in local authority area 1, while
there was a 32 per cent. unhappiness rate in another local authority
area. Those figures are significant, but they might not be significant
enough to trigger further action. The amendments are intended to enable
the Committee to debate such issues, but they 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column319" />Column number: 319</div>apply also to proposed new section 19L of the Education Act 1996 to
determine what is meant by &#147;not sufficiently favourable&#148;
under proposed subsection
(2).</div><a name="10020291000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
parents&#146; representations in respect of the plan are not
sufficiently favourable, the plan has to be referred to the schools
adjudicator. What percentage does the Minister have in mind? The policy
statement says that he will consult on the matter, but surely if 25 per
cent. of the responses come back as &#147;unfavourable&#148;, that
should be sufficient to trigger a referral. I look forward to hearing
his
comments.</div><a name="10020291000078"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020291000419"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> We have similar concerns to those expressed by the
hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton. The parental
satisfaction survey is not a one-off survey that will inform the views
of either local authorities or the Government, but potentially the
beginning of a long, bureaucratic and costly process that will require
the local authority, if there were material dissatisfaction, to
reconsider its plans and consult again. Referral could happen beyond
the local authority and the democratic process, as well as re-referral
to the local authority, which is required to redraft its plans and put
them to the local population again. All of that could be extremely
expensive and time-consuming, and make changes that sometimes have to
be made in school organisation extremely difficult. We therefore need a
clear idea from the Government whether there is a participation hurdle
beyond which we start to take the results seriously, and that is the
purpose of amendments 149 and
142.</div><a name="10020291000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am grateful to the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton for
questioning what constitutes &#147;material dissatisfaction&#148;.
It is not defined in the Bill, and we are not yet clear what it means.
As for the minimum participation rate, amendment 149 tabled by the hon.
Gentleman would put in place a 40 per cent. minimum participation rate,
while amendment 142 in my name and that of my hon. Friend the Member
for Mid-Dorset and North Poole would provide a 20 per cent. threshold.
There is a further refinement in amendment 232, which would
provide an opt-out from the requirement to take the survey seriously if
participation were less than 20 per cent. However, it allows for action
to be taken and a requirement for a response from a local authority if
it turns out that there is a particularly high response from one
particular
school.</div><a name="10020291000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
other words, although parents might be very happy with most of the
schools in their area, they might be particularly concerned about one
part of the area, and it is crucial that we know the thresholds that
will trigger such a hugely bureaucratic process. I do not have the
relevant documents in front of me, but we know from the pilot we
debated last week that the Government were expecting a response rate of
about 65 per cent., yet the five pilots, as the hon. Gentleman
mentioned, have had extraordinarily low response rates. The rates he
quoted were 4 per cent., 4 per cent., 4 per cent., 14 per cent. and 20
per cent., with a combined rate of about, as I recall, 6.5 per cent.,
which was therefore one tenth of the Government&#146;s expected
response rate. Should those response rates really be taken seriously
when forming a view about the quality of secondary school
provision?</div><a name="10020291000081"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10020291000420"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Ken Purchase</b> (Wolverhampton, North-East) (Lab/Co-op): Does
the hon. Gentleman find a certain replication in the results and those
that were part of the foundation 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column320" />Column number: 320</div>hospital elections to the boards, when the figures of 3 per
cent. and 4 per cent. recurred regularly? Does it show to him, as it
does to me, that people want us to get on with it instead of continuing
to weigh the pig in this
way?</div><a name="10020291000082"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020291000421"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> It may well reflect the fact that sometimes,
top-down, imposed consultation and involvement is not as successful in
improving public services as Governments would like to think. Many
people want responsive public services, but they do not necessarily
want to spend all their time running the services
themselves.</div><a name="10020291000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
reflect that the response and information are on the basis of a pretty
crude survey, which asks only one question&#151;the happiness
question&#151;about the provision of secondary schools in an area.
The question
asks:</div><a name="10020291000336"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Thinking
about the secondary schools in your area, how happy are
you...?</div><a name="10020291000337"></a><div class="hs_brev">Very
happy.</div><a name="10020291000338"></a><div class="hs_brev">Happy.</div><a name="10020291000339"></a><div class="hs_brev">Neither
happy nor
unhappy.</div><a name="10020291000340"></a><div class="hs_brev">Unhappy.</div><a name="10020291000341"></a><div class="hs_brev">Very
unhappy.&#148;</div><a name="10020291000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the basis of that, and on a potential response rate of 4, 6, 14 or 20
per cent., we would have to start the hugely bureaucratic and expensive
process. Therefore, we need a clearer indication from the Government of
what participation rate would trigger such surveys to be taken
seriously, particularly because some of us are unsettled by the
information reported in the Government&#146;s assessment of the
pilots, which said that some local authorities were quite impressed
that the response rates from parents were as high as they were.
Goodness knows what kind of response rates they were expecting if they
think that 4, 6.5 or even 14 per cent. are good response
rates&#151;they are certainly a lot lower than the Government were
suggesting, and we need a clear answer on that.</div>
<a name="10020291000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton has invited us to answer an
equally difficult question: even once we have set the hurdle for the
participation rate, how will we decide whether the requirement that
there should be material dissatisfaction, which is set out on page 8 of
the Bill, has been met? In the spirit of the survey form that was sent
out&#151;or supposed to be sent out&#151;to parents, the hon.
Gentleman has provided his own multiple choice range of possibilities
in amendments 174 to 176&#151;three different thresholds&#151;for
the Committee to choose from. I am not sure why he has not produced as
many different options as the survey form itself, but we are certainly
grateful to him for the range of choice he has provided. It is not
clear whether he thinks the 10, 5 or 25 per cent. threshold would be
the right
one.</div><a name="10020291000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman raises some serious concerns. How do we, if we have five
sets of data for &#147;very happy&#148;, &#147;happy&#148;,
&#147;neither happy nor unhappy&#148;, &#147;unhappy&#148; and
&#147;very unhappy&#148;, decide on the level of material
dissatisfaction that would trigger an intervention? If many people are
neither happy nor unhappy and some people are happy, but there is a
large core of &#147;very unhappy&#148;-ness&#151;if that is
correct jargon&#151;would that be enough to trigger the whole
bureaucratic process; or would it only be enough if the net
&#147;very unhappy&#148;-ness and &#147;unhappy&#148;-ness was
much greater than the &#147;very happy&#148; and
&#147;happy&#148;?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column321" />Column number: 321</div><a name="10020291000087"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10020291000422"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Graham Stuart</b> (Beverley and Holderness) (Con): The hon.
Gentleman is making an amusing speech on the subject of parental
satisfaction surveys. Does he find it odd that the Government are
talking about action after surveys that get low participation rates
already in the pilot areas, and may in future? The hon. Gentleman is
trying to find out at what level the Government will base their
response. However, in the Badman review&#146;s consultation, 95 per
cent. of people who responded said they were opposed, but the
Government&#146;s action following a vast response from that
community was to proceed with the exact proposals that everyone said
they did not want. The hon. Gentleman is right to have a lack of
confidence in whether the Government respond genuinely to what the
people
say.</div><a name="10020291000088"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020291000423"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. I hope the hon. Gentleman will not be
drawn down that particular
road.</div><a name="10020291000089"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020291000424"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes a very effective and
interesting point. As you can see, Mr. Betts, he is champing
at the bit under your chairmanship for us to motor even faster towards
schedule 1. However, he will have to hold himself back for a few more
moments. Serious concerns have been raised. I am sure the Minister has
all the answers to set our minds at rest. It is now time for him to
give those
answers.</div><a name="10020291000357"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11
am</div><a name="10020291000090"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020291000425"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> I thank the hon. Member for Yeovil for that note
of confidence in my answers. I try to answer questions, although
answering them to everyone&#146;s satisfaction is perhaps beyond
me.</div><a name="10020291000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
appreciate the nature of the amendments tabled by the hon. Members for
Yeovil and for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton&#151;they are not only
probing but question some of the meat on the bones. As an aside, I
tease gently the hon. Member and for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton: I
do not believe that he would oppose parental satisfaction surveys, for
obvious reasons. Essentially, notwithstanding the detail, the clause
sets out to give parents a greater voice in how the school system is
operating in their area. This goes back to a point of principle that I
have expressed about other clauses, and which has rightly been
expressed by Opposition Members and my hon. Friends: as always, the
devil is in the detail. It is right to ask how things will work in
practice&#151;what does this or that element mean? It is all very
well for a Minister to talk about regulations, but he needs to give
some indication of what they mean if the Committee is to support the
measure.</div><a name="10020291000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
go back to my first point: essentially, the Government are allowing
parents the opportunity to respond to the local authority and to
comment on the provision, initially, of secondary school places in
their area. That is an important task, and I am sure the hon. Member
for Yeovil would agree that it is an important public policy objective.
He may disagree on the question of how we achieve it, but the context
of empowering parents&#151;giving them a say and involving them in
provision in their areas&#151;is important and is what I start with.
This is an important policy
reform.</div><a name="10020291000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
preparing for the Bill we sought the views of a small group of parents,
piloting in five local authorities with, as hon. Members have said,
mixed results. We 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column322" />Column number: 322</div>brought parents from across the country together in autumn 2009 to
explore whether they would be willing to share their views about school
provision in their areas. The majority said they would be willing to
fill out a questionnaire if they believed they could make a difference
to their children&#146;s school experience, even if improvement took
place over a period of time. As I said, we ran a pilot with five local
authorities&#151;as the hon. Member for Yeovil mentioned&#151;which
found the survey easy to run, although they were concerned about their
capacity to meet parental expectations. We therefore concluded that the
setting of figures for a minimum response rate and the level of
parental dissatisfaction that would trigger the duty for a local
authority to produce a response plan is too important to fix without
first undertaking a full consultation, which we shall
do.</div><a name="10020291000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">Getting
to the heart of the amendments, we expect to consult on the basis of
material parental dissatisfaction, which, for the purposes of the
clause, is defined as a minimum response rate to the survey of at least
51 per cent., with at least 51 per cent. of those responses being
dissatisfied with the provision&#151;two of the thresholds sought by
the hon. Gentlemen through their amendments. We have deliberately set a
high threshold level to overcome particular difficulties. As I said,
and for the avoidance of doubt, we are talking about a minimum response
rate to a survey of at least 51 per cent., and at least 51
per cent. of those responses being dissatisfied with the
provision.</div><a name="10020291000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
figures I have just quoted for a minimum response rate and for parental
dissatisfaction are higher than those proposed in amendments 149, 142,
232, 174, 175 and 176, but I believe that we are right because, in
introducing such a significant reform of public policy, it is important
to tread carefully and to consult widely. In my view, placing a trigger
level in the Bill is too prescriptive. However, I hope that what I have
said makes our policy intention clear.</div>
<a name="10020291000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">As well as
low response rates, another concern is that if we do not have a
reasonably high trigger level, a small group of parents with a
particular perspective could skew the survey results. That would not be
helpful. While trying to give parents the right to respond and to have
a say about secondary school provision, we must ensure we do not cause
other
problems.</div><a name="10020291000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would also like to take this opportunity to clarify an aspect of the
Government&#146;s policy intentions to illustrate why amendment 232
is too prescriptive and would disfranchise parents. The survey will be
sent to all parents of year 6 children as they apply for secondary
school places for their children. They will do that through the normal
admissions process. The survey will ask for parents&#146; views on
school provision as a whole in their area&#151;whether they are happy
with the range and quality of secondary school places available to
them. It is not intended as a route for inviting parental views on
individual schools, and authorities will not be able to name individual
schools in their questionnaires. It will therefore be meaningless to
set a minimum response rate based on the response from parents whose
children attend a particular school. The parents surveyed will have
children attending primary school, but their views will be sought on
the range and quality of secondary school
places.</div><a name="10020291000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
further consequence of amendment 232 would be to disfranchise a broader
group of parents of primary school age children who would most likely
be affected 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column323" />Column number: 323</div>by any response plan that a local authority would be required to
produce. The subsection that the amendment seeks to replace will enable
us to prescribe in regulations the parents we think a local authority
has a responsibility to consult on plans for future secondary
provision. We intend to consult on the basis that local authorities
will need to consult parents of key stage 2 children&#151;year 3 to
6, which is children aged seven to 11. The response plan would go to
those parents, although the initial survey would be for year 6
children, because of their legitimate interest in future secondary
school
provision.</div><a name="10020291000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">Regardless
of the outcome of our consultation and how material parental
dissatisfaction is defined, when a response plan is triggered by the
survey we want local authorities to listen and act. Our intended
definition of material parental dissatisfaction would mean that there
is a strong evidence base for requiring an authority to produce a
response plan. That plan would then be sent to the parents of the wider
age group&#151;age seven to 11&#151;because they have an interest
in future secondary school provision in their
area.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020291000426"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> The Minister has provided two figures&#151;a
figure for the participation rate, and a figure for the dissatisfaction
rates. Is he now going to give us a figure for unhappiness with the
plan?</div>
<a name="10020291000101"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020291000427"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> I was not going to give an actual figure. We will
consult on that. If 51 per cent. respond, and more than half of those
who respond are dissatisfied, the authority will, of course, need to
produce a response plan to give to parents. We will consult on what the
trigger level should be, in terms of the number of parents who feel
that the response plan is inadequate; the response plan can then be
sent to the adjudicator. We will consider that in the consultation. I
would expect a reasonably high figure, because we want to ensure that a
response plan cannot be undermined by a few particularly vociferous
parents.</div>
<a name="10020291000102"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020291000428"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> If it is clear that there is material
dissatisfaction, and the local authority has to give parents in the
area an opportunity to have their view on the response plan, what form
will the consultation with parents take? Will it be another survey, or
will people write
letters?</div><a name="10020291000103"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020291000429"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> We will consult on how that process will take
place. That will be part of the consultation determining what
regulations will come forward. The process might take the form of
another survey; it might take place online; it might be a letter that
is sent out. In the consultation, we will look at the best way for
parents to respond to a response plan, and what level of
dissatisfaction with the response plan would trigger a referral to the
adjudicator. With those comments, I hope that the hon. Member for
Bognor Regis and Littlehampton will withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="10020291000104"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020291000430"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> My hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Dorset and North
Poole suggested mischievously that I ask members of the Committee
whether they were happy, very unhappy or neither happy nor unhappy with
the Minister&#146;s
response.</div><a name="10020291000105"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020291000431"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020291000432"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> A show of hands might be possible. I am both happy
and unhappy, but I notice that there is not a box for such a position.
I am happy because the Minister has been more frank and candid than I
thought he would be. He set out clearly what is in the
Government&#146;s mind with regard to the response rate and defining
material dissatisfaction. He has not set too low a threshold, which
would clearly raise major worries. However, in being so helpful and
clear, and in ensuring that we avoid problems as a consequence of low
take-up, he drew attention to the issue of whether the plan will be an
even bigger waste of money than we
thought.</div><a name="10020291000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
the response rate is set at 51 per cent., and that is the benchmark for
taking the process seriously, it must be extremely worrying that in the
pilots, we had a response rate of only 6.6 per cent. The Minister will
probably say that there are other things that we can do, but that is a
big gap. We often put out our own surveys inviting views of all types
from our constituents, and we know that getting a 51 per cent. response
rate is very difficult. The Minister told us the other day that it was
possible that not all local authorities would be required to implement
the plans; presumably, they would not have to if they were doing well.
However, when we look at the impact assessment and the
Government&#146;s estimates on cost, we see that they presume that
all local authorities are likely to implement the plans. That is the
basis from which the Government derived the
cost.</div><a name="10020291000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
seems that the Government have been moving in a slightly more
pessimistic direction, as regards their expectation of parental
response. The impact assessment was based on a 65 per cent. response
rate; we assume that that was the Government&#146;s best estimate of
the likely response rate at the time. We know that in the pilots, the
response rates have been much
lower.</div><a name="10020291000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">So
although the Minister has made us feel much happier by giving us the
idea that we will not be forced into making all sorts of decisions, and
will not have to go down a very bureaucratic route, on the basis of a
2 per cent. response rate or on the basis of an ambiguous
definition of material dissatisfaction, he has really raised the issue
of whether the Government will end up compelling 153 local authorities
to go through this expensive process, which they estimate will cost
&#163;22
million.</div><a name="10020291000110"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020291000433"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> To be fair, the hon. Gentleman makes a reasonable
point. Does he agree that the response rate will be helped by the fact
that the parental survey satisfaction form will be sent out with the
admissions form? That did not happen in the pilot. I think that that
will help, but it is difficult to
quantify.</div><a name="10020291000111"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020291000434"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> That method might be of help, but it needs to help
by quite a lot. At the moment, we are at a response rate of 6.6 per
cent. None of the local authorities in which the pilots took place had
a response rate greater than 20 per cent. The Minister has some
motoring to do if he is to persuade parents to
respond.</div><a name="10020291000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
what we have before us is the final form that is to be sent
out&#151;there is one question, which asks parents if they are very
unhappy, happy, neither unhappy nor happy and so on, and a blank sheet
is attached for other questions&#151;a lot of parents will consider
it pretty tokenistic, and many will put it in the bin. I am not
convinced that the response rates will be all that high. What will the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column325" />Column number: 325</div>Government do then? If we do not get any response rates above 51 per
cent., how long will we go on imposing a vast cost on local authorities
to achieve responses that we are effectively putting in the bin? In an
environment where we do not have much scope for spending additional
money from the public purse, we need clearer answers about what will
happen even if the Minister gets more than his 51 per cent. threshold,
and even if we end up with 51 per cent. of respondents materially
dissatisfied.</div><a name="10020291000358"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.15
am</div><a name="10020291000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
would then end up in the zone described in proposed section 19L on page
8 of the Bill, where the local authority that has failed to satisfy
parents has to prepare a response plan, on which eligible parents have
to be consulted. The Minister horrified some of us, including perhaps
one or two Labour Members, by saying that the Government had not yet
decided how parents would respond to the plan&#151;whether that would
be in the form of just a few letters or a petition, or whether it might
trigger the requirement to send out yet another ballot paper, with all
the expense that that would involve. All that is in the context of an
impact assessment that forecasts that the cost of carrying out such
surveys will be greater than the benefit that even the Government
estimate.</div>
<a name="10020291000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
another concern that we have is about whether the surveys will be
meaningful. In many parts of the country, people have only one local
secondary catchment school, and when they express their views, it will
be fairly clear which school they are referring to. However, in many
other parts of the country, there may be two, three, four or five
different secondary schools that people could send their children to.
It is possible that parents might have a major concern about one of
them; it might be the catchment school that they would naturally have
sent their children to. They might be dissatisfied with that school,
but very happy with two or three of the other schools. They might send,
or plan to send, their children across a town or city, one or two miles
away, to access a good secondary school.</div>
<a name="10020291000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">One would
have thought that if such surveys, with all the huge bureaucracy and
cost involved, were going to be of any value, they might at least
aspire to pick out circumstances where one school was doing badly, and
others were doing well. However, if I heard the Minister correctly, the
survey will not do that&#151;it will not name any school that is
picked up as a particularly bad performer. The purpose of the survey,
as I understand it, is simply to allow a judgment to be made about
secondary education as a whole. That raises serious concerns about how
parents respond to a survey of the type that we are discussing if they
have a bad local school and anticipate sending their children out of
the catchment area to attend another
school.</div><a name="10020291000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
we are to go through all the bureaucracy involved in the scheme, surely
we want to allow for circumstances where the bureaucracy might find
intense dissatisfaction with one school, but not with some of the other
ones. I do not think that we can do that with the survey. I stick with
my view that although we have had a good and clear answer from the
Minister that set some concerns to rest, our major concerns about the
clause are still in place.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column326" />Column number: 326</div><a name="10020291000117"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020291000435"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> It has been an illuminating debate. The Minister was
clear about his thinking on the participation rate and the
dissatisfaction level that will trigger a requirement to produce a
plan. However, I agree with the hon. Member for Yeovil that 51 per
cent. appears to be a high response rate. If 150 surveys were sent out,
in line with the requirement in the Bill, and none had a participation
rate above 50 per cent., that would be a huge amount of money spent to
no
effect.</div><a name="10020291000118"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020291000436"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> May I just be clear about what the hon. Gentleman
is saying? Is he, as the main Opposition spokesperson in the Committee,
in favour of parental satisfaction surveys, but worried about the
thresholds? Does he think that 51 per cent. is too high, and that the
rate should be lowered? Or should it be
higher?</div><a name="10020291000119"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020291000437"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> I am happy to respond to the Minister. Parental
satisfaction surveys are a good idea, but I am concerned about the
clause because of how the policy is crafted. The system is highly
bureaucratic; the survey triggers a response plan, which has to be
produced and then sent back to parents for consultation. If they are
unhappy, that plan is referred to the schools adjudicator. What has a
schools adjudicator got to do with education policy in local
authorities? I thought the schools adjudicator dealt with admissions.
Such an approach to assessing public opinion seems bureaucratic. Far
better simply to publish the results of the parental satisfaction
survey so that local people can take action as a
consequence.</div><a name="10020291000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am also concerned about the participation rate. I accept that there
needs to be a de minimis to prevent the surveys being hijacked by a
small minority of vociferous parents, although in my view bureaucracies
too often dismiss a group of parents with, &#147;Oh, it&#146;s that
group of parents.&#148; My view is that when 25 parents come to see
me with a concern about a school, that should be taken seriously. Those
25 parents have made the effort to see someone about it, and they are
probably the tip of the iceberg. I do not dismiss such vociferous
groups of parents; I take the opposite view, which is that they
represent an important shade of opinion in the locality. However, 51
per cent. is a high threshold, and I think that it would be better to
use a participation rate nearer 40 per
cent.</div><a name="10020291000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am even more concerned about the dissatisfaction rate of 51 per cent.
It shows a low expectation as regards the standard of education that we
should be happy with in our local authorities. If 49 per cent. of
parents are unhappy with school provision in a local authority area,
that should be a cause of
concern.</div><a name="10020291000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the parental responsiveness trial, we had one local authority in which
48 per cent. of the parents who responded were unhappy, albeit that the
response rate was only 4 per cent. In another&#151;where, again, the
response rate was 4 per cent.&#151;32 per cent. of respondents were
unhappy. Even in local authority No. 4, where the response rate was 20
per cent., a quarter of the parents who responded were unhappy. Even
that is, or should be, a cause of
concern.</div><a name="10020291000123"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020291000438"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> The schools adjudicator has had responsibility for
school admissions and school organisation since 1998. Logically, he is
a reasonable figure to refer a response plan to should a significant
number of parents be dissatisfied with it.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column327" />Column number: 327</div><a name="10020291000124"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020291000439"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> Again, school organisation is not to do with school
standards or school behaviour. Those are the issues that concern
parents, not whether there are six secondary schools in a given area or
five. The standard of a school is the issue, and that is an issue of
policy. I thought that we had passed the policy to local
councils&#151;to the councillors, the representatives of the public
on that council&#151;and/or the Government, with Ministers
accountable to Parliament. To palm off policy matters on to unelected
figures is a dangerous process, which distances the public from
influence over policy. I am not sure that the Government ought to be
travelling in that direction. I am concerned about that 51 per cent.
threshold for
dissatisfaction.</div><a name="10020291000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
parental survey process is very unnuanced in terms of the geographical
location of the parents who respond. The draft form that is being
consulted on has some scope for geography, with a box for the postcode
of the responders, which indicates that the Government are concerned
about geography. When the results are analysed, there may well be
pockets&#151;large pockets&#151;in large local authority areas
where the dissatisfaction rate is more than 50 per cent., but other
pockets where people are satisfied because the two local comprehensives
are very good. In another area the three local comprehensives may be
weak. Some action should be taken if half the population in a certain
part of, say, West Sussex are unhappy with the schools, but people in
the northern part of the county are happy. It does indicate that the
trigger to take action should take into account the three
comprehensives in the southern or eastern part of the
county.</div><a name="10020291000126"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020291000440"></a>Mr.
Purchase:</b> I want to go a little further on the question of
putting down postcodes. The hon. Gentleman understandably speaks of
county matters. In a borough such as mine&#151;8 miles by 8, with
more than 100 schools&#151;there is nothing to stop someone living in
WV7 or WV1 going to a WV13 school and commenting on the school their
children go to rather than the school in their area, making it almost
impossible to identify a serious trend in people&#146;s satisfaction
or dissatisfaction on an area basis.</div>
<a name="10020291000127"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020291000441"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes a good point about densely
populated urban areas. When I discus education policy with people
around the country, they often make the criticism that it is too
urban-centric and that we take too little account of more rural or
sparsely populated parts of the country. I am cognisant of that when
thinking about education issues. An area such as West Sussex has urban
and rural areas; it is a very large local authority. I take the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s point, but there are very large urban and rural
authorities, and there can be different qualities of schools in a large
geographical area. The survey could skate over that by melding the
dissatisfaction rates from one part of the authority with another and
coming up with a figure below the trigger percentage that the Minister
indicated. The dissatisfaction rate of 51 per cent. is high and should
be significantly lower. A rate of 25 per cent. should be a cause for
concern in a local authority. Failing that, we could try to nuance the
response so that dissatisfaction rates take into account different
local
factors.</div><a name="10020291000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
purpose of the amendments was to have this debate. Members of the
Committee have expressed 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column328" />Column number: 328</div>their views on the various percentages. Given that we have had such a

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020291000444"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> Mr. Betts, you are probably wondering
what will happen if there is a parental satisfaction survey, the
participation threshold of 51 per cent. is passed and material
dissatisfaction is expressed by 51 per cent. or more of
individuals. That is what the amendments are about. As the Bill is
currently drafted, a local authority in England will have to prepare a
response plan to address local parents&#146; concerns and then
consult on it. We do not yet know what that process of consultation
will be. The Government do not seem to have decided whether every
parent will be consulted, whether letters will be sent in or whether
there will be some other form of consultation. We know that if parents
are still dissatisfied with the response plan, the local authority will
be required to refer it and the complaints about it to the adjudicator.
The adjudicator&#151;not a democratically directly elected
individual&#151;has to look at the response plan from the local
authority, consider the parental representations and decide what to do.
The adjudicator, as set out on page 9,
can</div><a name="10020291000342"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;approve
the plan...approve the plan subject to specified
modifications...or reject the
plan.&#148;</div><a name="10020291000359"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.30
am</div><a name="10020291000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments would take away some of the compulsion in the Bill in
relation to what must happen if the adjudicator does not like the local
authority&#146;s response to the initial complaints and rejects the
response plan. New section 19N(1) makes it clear that if the
adjudicator is unhappy with the plan and wants modifications, they can
require the local authority to implement them. However, if the
adjudicator decides to reject the plans under proposed new section
19M(2)(c), the local authority is obliged to withdraw the plan and
prepare and publish&#151;one might have guessed it&#151;a further
plan, called a &#147;further response plan&#148;, which it will
have to
consider.</div><a name="10020291000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is not entirely clear&#151;although I hope that the Minister will
make this clear&#151;whether there will be a further process of
consultation with local residents. If the local authority&#146;s
plans are rejected by more than 51 per cent. of parents, the
response plan is unsatisfactory and the adjudicator is not satisfied,
will another form, a further survey of parental views, be sent out to
decide whether to press on? We are concerned because it sounds like an
immensely bureaucratic process, seemingly 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column329" />Column number: 329</div>without end. It may, in some cases, highlight concerns&#151;although
if they are that great, I suspect that the local authority will be well
aware of them anyway&#151;but it may make it difficult for local
authorities to take decisions about reorganising
schools.</div><a name="10020291000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">Proposed
new section 19N will certainly take away from a democratically elected
local authority&#151;even one that has consulted parents, has
published a response plan, has been ticked off by the adjudicator and
is willing to take the flak&#151;the right to stick with the plans
that it wants, which is why we have tabled the amendments. Under the
proposed new section, the local authority &#147;shall make
modifications&#148; to the plan if the schools adjudicator specifies,
and the local authority &#147;shall withdraw&#148; the plan and
prepare and publish a further response plan if the adjudicator decides
to reject the plan in its
entirety.</div><a name="10020291000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">Here,
we are concerned not only about the bureaucracy but about a major
intrusion into the freedoms of local authorities by someone who is not
democratically elected. I do not say&#151;I said this the other
day&#151;that local authorities always get it right; sometimes some
of them have got it badly wrong in the past, and they need to be held
to account. However, by the time that they get to this process in the
Bill, the views of parents will have been clearly highlighted, and they
will have been forced to respond. It would be extremely incautious if
it simply ignored the views of an adjudicator, which would presumably
be made public. If after all that, the local authority still wanted to
press on with its plans, I would allow it to do so. It would be wrong
for an unelected schools adjudicator to be able to dictate to a local
authority, which would have to pay the penalty for being seen to ignore
the views of the adjudicator and, presumably, of parents. That is why
we wish to amend the wording of the proposed new subsections to give
the local authority flexibility to respond to the adjudicator if it
thinks that that is right. However, if a local authority thought that
it was right to ignore the adjudicator, with all the penalties in terms
of public opinion, we think it is the right balance between democratic
accountability and scrutiny by an outside body that is not
democratically accountable that it should be able to do so. I hope that
the Minister will respond on the issues of democratic accountability
and let us know whether the Government envisage that, if a local
authority is obliged to overturn its existing response plan and publish
a further plan, there will be a further survey of parents, and what
form that would
take.</div><a name="10020291000140"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020291000445"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> Just so that I do not forget, the answer is
no.</div><a name="10020291000141"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020291000446"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I assume that the Minister is saying that even he
eventually reaches the end of a process of consultation and decides
that there is no point in going further. I assume that he is saying
that, even if an adjudicator says that the response plan is not good
enough and rejects it, it is possible for a further response plan to be
put together with perhaps a minor tweak. Is that where the process
ends?</div>
<a name="10020291000142"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020291000447"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b>
Yes.</div><a name="10020291000143"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020291000448"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> Will the process really be worth it? The Minister
says that even he will give up on the ludicrously bureaucratic process
at some stage. When the adjudicator 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column330" />Column number: 330</div>has made the momentous decision that the response plan is a load of
rubbish and has to be changed, the local authority will be able to
tweak a minor detail and re-title it as a further response plan, and
nothing will happen even if the parents are still
dissatisfied.</div><a name="10020291000144"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020291000449"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> The hon. Gentleman cannot have it both ways. He
chided me in the nicest possible way about whether there would be
further consultation. I said no, and thought he would be satisfied with
that. Now, he seems to be criticising me because there is not further
consultation.</div><a name="10020291000145"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020291000450"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I shall have it both ways. It is usually a
bureaucratic process. It can just run out in the sands of the
Government&#146;s impatience for consultation. By that time, goodness
knows how much money we will have spent on it, goodness knows how fed
up parents will be of being consulted and goodness knows what their
views will be about why the local authority is not spending money on
improving schools rather than on surveys. Given that schools already
consult parents and parental consultation has to take place at Ofsted
inspections, we are establishing under clause 6 a pretty pointless,
bureaucratic process, which, even in the Minister&#146;s view, will
eventually run out after consuming a huge amount of public
money.</div><a name="10020291000146"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020291000451"></a>Mr.
Purchase:</b> The promoters of the clause have serious
questions to answer. There is some agreement between both Front Benches
that the surveys are desirable and, as a result of that political
connotation, it behoves the rest of us to ensure that they actually
know what they are doing and bring real light on the subject. It is a
vexed question of how we measure what schools are doing. We have tried
many different ways, and the clause might be seen in a benign fashion
as one more way of looking at how to ensure that children receive the
best from the education
service.</div><a name="10020291000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to deal with the democratic mandate of a local authority, and what
is happening seriously to undermine it. The political culture of
Britain is that we vote in people who are charged with fulfilling their
manifesto pledges. We do that at European level, national level, local
and parish council levels. That is our culture. It has worked well for
us. We are not a nation who depend on plebiscites to govern our country
or neighbourhoods. The surveys that have been shown to elicit poor
responses of 4, 3, 5 or 20 per cent. leave some serious doubts in my
mind about the efficacy of the
policy.</div><a name="10020291000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
a democratic matter, I now have the opportunity to correct the record.
I mentioned on Thursday that, when asked about his favourite form of
governance, the director-general of the BBC replied, &#147;Despotism
tempered by assassination&#148;. That is the policy that we are
considering. I suggested that he was being interviewed by Roger
Freeman, who was a distinguished Conservative MP. In fact, the
director-general was interviewed on a programme called &#147;Face to
Face&#148; by John Freeman, who was an equally eminent Labour MP at
the time. He interviewed one of Wolverhampton&#146;s famous
schoolboys, Gilbert Harding, and reduced him to tears many years
ago.</div><a name="10020291000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">Why
not go directly to the adjudicator? Why bother with all the flim-flam
of a 4 per cent. turnout, and say, &#147;Do a plan.&#148; Let us
say that the plan does not suit 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column331" />Column number: 331</div>everyone, so someone complains. Another plan is done, and that is not
very good. The adjudicator says, &#147;Well, I&#146;m going to give
you the final word on this&#148;, followed by, &#147;It&#146;s
okay&#148;, &#147;It&#146;s not okay&#148; or any combination
of those&#151;because we are into alternative vote systems now, are
we not, totting up the responses of what can be and cannot
be?</div><a name="10020291000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is wrong that one person can gainsay the opinion of a local authority,
the members of which have been elected&#151;if perhaps by no more
than 30 per cent. of the electorate. In my city, let me make no bones
about it, 30 per cent. or 25 per cent. would be a good turnout
in a local election. However, should that council then be gainsaid by
one person, who we may or may not have any confidence in? Who is this
adjudicator? What will he or she know? What is their experience? Have
they ever served on such bodies? Are they a parent? Are they a teacher?
It becomes
impossible.</div><a name="10020291000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
suggest that a great deal more work is needed&#151;if the two Front
Benches are to combine in support for the principle, they must get the
detail right. Otherwise, in particular as we have already heard with
the 50 per cent. hurdle, the provision is a dead letter. If 51 per
cent. have to vote before anything can be done, it is a dead letter.
The hon. Member for Yeovil is absolutely right: we can conduct any
number of surveys, all reaching 40 or 45 per cent.
participation, with perhaps even 70 per cent. of those responding not
satisfied with their school, but that is a recipe for real unrest and
disaster. I make a plea to the two Front Benches: for goodness&#146;
sake, we have to get the detail right before we go an inch
further.</div><a name="10020291000152"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10020291000452"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Stuart</b>: It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship,
Mr Betts, and to follow the passionate and well-informed speech of the
hon. Member for Wolverhampton, North-East, who summarised in one phrase
what I want to say. His phrase supports my amendment 190, which seeks
to remove&#151;at least from proposed new section 19L&#151;any role
for the adjudicator. The hon. Gentleman said that it is absolutely
wrong for one person to gainsay the elected local authority. He rightly
expressed passion about how we live in a democracy, in which elected
representatives, whether on parish, town, district or unitary councils,
represent their local people when making decisions on policy matters.
It is entirely wrong for the local authority to be gainsaid in such a
way.</div><a name="10020291000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
put the mind of the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, North-East at rest
on one matter, my Front Bench does not believe that we should have any
such massive bureaucracy. I believe my Front Bench favours parental
surveys: local authorities and schools should use them to ensure that
they listen to parents in the local area. What is not wanted is any of
the paraphernalia&#151;including the adjudicator, in
particular&#151;that will remove local democratic controls. I hope
that, having spoken so passionately and no doubt having influenced his
colleagues as he did me, we might see a serious effort to
defeat those particular aspects of the
Bill.</div><a name="10020291000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
proposal is one further step in enfeebling and infantilising local
authorities. They are there to respond to local demand and not to be
pushed around by an adjudicator, of whatever eminence. When we have
constrained budgets, we shall be spending a fortune on bureaucratic
procedures that are designed to remove the democratic say-so of the
local authority.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column332" />Column number: 332</div><a name="10020291000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">The final
point I would like to look at is how the system will work in particular
places. How will it work in the East Riding of Yorkshire, the largest
unitary council by area in England? At 933 square miles, it stretches
from Goole in one corner up to Bridlington and down to Withernsea.
Those three towns have the greatest pockets of deprivation in the East
Riding of Yorkshire, but there are 933 square miles between those
towns, with Beverley adorning&#151;certainly in my mind&#151;a
central point. How is it possible to get a snapshot across that whole
area from such surveys? Or we could look across the border from the
East Riding to the constituency of the Under-Secretary of State for
Children, Schools and Families, the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull,
North, where the local authority has regularly&#151;I am afraid to
say&#151;been at the very bottom of performance league tables for
GCSE. How will the surveys trigger change? They are surely unlikely to
trigger major change in places such as the East Riding, which I am
proud to say has delivered significant year-on-year improvements in
educational outcomes under Conservative control, despite being one of
the lowest- funded local authorities in the country. In Hull, there has
not been such support. There are pockets of excellence in Hull, there
is a lot of good practice there and lots of good people work there.
None the less, the overall educational performance of the local
authority has been
poor.</div><a name="10020291000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
difference will this proposal make? How will it trigger change? Is the
local authority in Hull not bothered about educational standards? I say
to the Minister that it is bothered about school standards. I struggle
to see how this process, with the paraphernalia of the adjudicator,
will change or improve matters in places such as Hull. If it does not
make a difference in such places, what is the point of
it?</div><a name="10020291000360"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.45

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020291000453"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> I am absolutely amazed by what the hon. Gentleman
just said. He is putting the case for local authorities determining
school places in an area, but the policy of his Front-Bench team is to
free the system up, to allow the market to rip, to let everyone who
wants to set up a school do so and for parents to have a completely
free choice among the schools in their area. That has nothing to do
with the local
authority.</div><a name="10020291000158"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020291000454"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. We are getting very wide of the mark and
moving into a debate about general education policy. Could the hon.
Gentleman concentrate on the amendment in
hand?</div><a name="10020291000159"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020291000455"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> I would like to think that I have kept my focus on
the amendment, Mr. Betts. I do not know why the Minister
wanted to ride
wider.</div><a name="10020291000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
point is that as the democratically elected body, the local authority
should be responsible for providing services, not the adjudicator. To
have a free school system, which I will not go into in too much detail,
would be to pass the power down from the democratically elected local
authority to parents, giving them choice. That would allow communities
in places such as Hull to tackle and challenge the failure and poor
provision of many years. This Front-Bench team is in favour of the
revolution of bringing power closer to the people, whereas the tendency
of the Government Front-Bench team, as 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column333" />Column number: 333</div>we see in the Bill, is always to move power away from people, even away
from democratically elected local representatives, and to put it for
ever in the hands of bureaucrats, doubtless based in
London.</div><a name="10020291000161"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020291000456"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> I apologise if I strayed beyond the amendment,
Mr.
Betts.</div><a name="10020291000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
say to my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, North-East, as I
have said throughout our consideration of the Bill, not only on this
clause, that the devil is in the detail and that we must be careful
about how the detail works out. I will reflect on his concerns. I
understand the point about democratic
accountability.</div><a name="10020291000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
point made by my hon. Friend and the hon. Members for Yeovil and for
Bognor Regis and Littlehampton on determining the response plan will
have to be considered in the consultation. The regulations will have to
address how a local authority should respond to a parental survey with
51 per cent. dissatisfaction. It will have to be considered whether the
51 per cent. is concentrated in one part of the local authority and
what that means for the other 49 per cent. Notwithstanding what my hon.
Friend said regarding postcodes, it will sometimes be possible to
identify pockets of real dissatisfaction and pockets of real
satisfaction. That issue will have to be addressed in the
consultation.</div><a name="10020291000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
matter for the consultation is the point made by the hon. Member for
Bognor Regis and Littlehampton about the 51 per cent. threshold not
being reached. Even with a threshold of 40 per cent., 39 per
cent. of respondents could still be dissatisfied. Whatever the level of
the threshold, a significant minority of people could be dissatisfied
even if it is not reached. If, however, the local authority is used as
the constituency on which to base the survey, as seems sensible, there
is then an issue of what to do if there are pockets of dissatisfaction.
That will need consideration and further thought in terms of the
response plan, even if the threshold is not met.</div>
<a name="10020291000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">The response
plan will be produced by the local authority. I think that most local
authorities will produce a response plan that will command the respect
and support of people in the area, but it is appropriate to discuss
ensuring how, if the local authority produces a response plan that does
not address the concerns raised by the consultation, some independent
voice might consider it and comment on it. As I said in earlier
debates, we need to decide what the trigger point should be for the
response plan, but there should be an independent
voice.</div><a name="10020291000166"></a>

way?</div><a name="10020291000167"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020291000458"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> May I just finish this point?</div>
<a name="10020291000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">On democratic
accountability, the adjudicator will not be able to compel a local
authority to have a particular response plan. We expect that the
independent voice of the adjudicator will lead the local authority and
that, should its original plan be deemed inappropriate or not up to the
standard expected, the local authority will listen to the adjudicator
and change it. However, there is no
compulsion.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column334" />Column number: 334</div><a name="10020291000169"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020291000459"></a>Mr.
Purchase:</b> When the response plan is put together, surely
the local authority must, in recognising the dissatisfaction, have some
idea what that means from the &#147;happy/super happy/absolutely damn
miserable&#148; checklist. Are people unhappy with the results
achieved? Are they unhappy with the discipline in schools? There are 20
different points.</div>
<a name="10020291000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">When the
local authority responds, having worked out that conundrum, it must
identify which schools are not performing to an acceptable standard. If
the case is then referred to the adjudicator, he or she will have to
recognise that certain schools tick every box and others tick none. It
seems almost impossible to write up a generic plan for a city or county
that takes into account the enormous complexities of people&#146;s
decision to vote &#147;ecstatic&#148; or &#147;miserable&#148;.
How on earth will it ever add anything to the education process? It is
totally defeating. I call on the Minister again to recognise that the
detail will be critical if people are not to lose confidence in a
process that might set out with the best intentions but whose
unintended consequences may well undermine a great deal of what is good
in the Bill
overall.</div><a name="10020291000171"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020291000460"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> I will again give my hon. Friend a commitment to
consider the detail. As I have said, the objective is to ensure that
parents can make representations about whether they are satisfied or
dissatisfied with schools in their area. With the adjudicator, we have
tried to build in independence, but democratic accountability will rest
with the local authority, because the local authority will not be
compelled to accept what the adjudicator says. That is why I said that
it will reach an end point.</div>
<a name="10020291000172"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020291000461"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020291000462"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> Will the Minister give
way?</div><a name="10020291000174"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020291000463"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> I will give way to the hon. Member for Bognor
Regis and Littlehampton, if the hon. Member for Yeovil will hang on for
a
minute.</div><a name="10020291000175"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020291000464"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> Does the Minister not think that the whole policy is
very bureaucratic? I refer to the idea that a plan can be produced on a
20-side report that will somehow solve poor school performance in a
local authority area that might have been performing poorly for a
number of years. Such schools might require a very nuanced and careful
approach to policy development, such as replacing the head teacher or
governing bodies, and putting more resources into one school or
another. The plans are more likely to end up being a restructuring of
where schools are located than any real attempt to deliver higher
standards of behaviour and higher academic standards. Should the
Minister not consider putting a local authority into special measures
if 51 per cent. of parents in its area are unhappy with school
provision?</div><a name="10020291000176"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020291000465"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> All sorts of tools can be used. In addition to
restructuring and reorganising, the response plan might try to improve
standards at particular schools or school organisation&#151;it can be
broad. We are trying to give parents a voice. I know that the hon.
Gentleman agrees with that: the issue is how we do it. It does not
necessarily have to be bureaucratic, and we will get the detail right
to ensure that we minimise bureaucracy.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column335" />Column number: 335</div><a name="10020291000177"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020291000466"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> The Minister said three times that there is no
element of compulsion. Will he reflect again on this subsection,
because it is clear that there is compulsion? It states that the local
authority &#147;shall withdraw the plan&#148; and shall
&#147;prepare and publish&#148; a further response plan and
that</div>
<a name="10020291000343"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the authority
shall have regard to the adjudicator&#146;s
determination&#148;.</div><a name="10020291000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">All
of that sounds like compulsion to
me.</div><a name="10020291000179"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020291000467"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> Of course, I will reflect on that. The intent is
not for the adjudicator to compel a local authority to follow a
particular course of action. Rather, it is to require a local authority
to consider what the adjudicator has said. As I have said to the hon.
Gentleman, I will reflect on his point, but it is not the intention of
the
Bill.</div><a name="10020291000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
have no recourse to an adjudicator and simply to leave a matter with
the local authority will mean that there is no independent challenge to
the response of the local authority. In some instances, that response
might not be appropriate or adequate, in which case somebody should be
able independently to challenge a local authority. I do not agree with
the hon. Gentleman&#146;s amendment because it says that a local
authority can ignore the matter if it wishes. On that basis, I hope
that he will withdraw
it.</div><a name="10020291000181"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020291000468"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> As ever, I am grateful to the Minister for his
response to our concerns, but I do not accept his description of what
is in his Bill. At least three times, the Minister claimed that there
was no element of compulsion, that local authorities will not be
compelled to do what the adjudicator says. He says that the adjudicator
will not be able to compel a local authority and that there is no
compulsion. He said that the local authority does not have to do what
the adjudicator wants and that all he seeks to do is to ensure that the
local authority is required to consider the adjudicator&#146;s view.
With respect, that is not what the Bill says. The Bill says that an
adjudicator can look at the matter, make a determination and reject the
plan. If he rejects the plan, proposed new subsection 19N(2) states
that a local authority
shall</div><a name="10020291000344"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;withdraw
the plan, and prepare and publish a further plan  (a
&#145;further response
plan&#146;)&#148;.</div><a name="10020291000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">Proposed
new subsection 19N(3)
states:</div><a name="10020291000345"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
preparing a further response plan, the authority shall have regard to
the adjudicator&#146;s determination within section
19M(2)(c).&#148;</div><a name="10020291000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
could be on an issue that is very clear-cut and on which the local
authority simply cannot ignore the adjudicator&#146;s opinion. If the
Minister is seeking to do what he says&#151;that the local authority
should merely be required to consider&#151;then he can happily sign
up to our amendments, because what we are doing is requiring the local
authority to consider, but we are saying that it may or may not take
action as a consequence. It is clear that the speech that the Minister
has given and the Bill that he is presenting are not compatible. If the
speech that he has given is the Government&#146;s position, he should
support the
amendments.</div>
<a name="10020291000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">At best, this
aspect of the Bill goes nowhere, because the Minister has already
admitted that if the further response plan is published and ignores the
adjudicator&#146;s response, nothing will happen. At worst, however,
it is an extremely centralising and undemocratic measure that says that
the adjudicator will have power to direct a  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column336" />Column number: 336</div>local authority and that makes it clear, in proposed new section 19N(3),
that a local authority shall have regard to that and will have to
withdraw its previous
plan.</div><a name="10020291000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is clear from the comments that we have already made that we will want
to divide on the clause. However, I am encouraged by speeches that we
have heard in support of amendment 143, including from the hon. Member
for Beverley and Holderness, so I am inclined to press it to a
Division.</div><a name="10020291000186"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020291000508"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> May I welcome you to the Committee,
Mr. Betts? This is the Committee&#146;s ninth sitting, but
it is the first opportunity that I have had to make a meaningful
contribution, which is something of a record.</div>
<a name="10020291000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having
motored through clause 6, we now turn to a completely different
subject&#151;special educational needs. It is of great interest to
members of the Committee, as many organisations have lobbied us hard on
the matter. The amendments, which can be divided into three sections,
deal with the quality and appropriateness of inspections.</div>
<a name="10020291000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">At the
outset, and before explaining the purpose of the amendments, may I say
that we welcome this clause and clause 8, which deals with SEN appeals?
This part of the Bill is certainly a welcome addition. Many feel that
it could have gone further, given that it is partly a result of the
Lamb review. Indeed, we thought that Lamb could have gone further; much
uncovered ground needs to be taken into account in future legislation
to get a better deal for parents and children with
special  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column338" />Column number: 338</div>educational needs or physical disabilities within the educational
system. However, I do not wish to be churlish, and we welcome these
provisions.</div>
<a name="10020291000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">These probing
amendments have been tabled to get more detail out of the Minister and
to see whether he is prepared to go further, either at a later stage or
through regulation. The group also includes a Liberal Democrat
amendment that adds a new angle relating to children with disadvantaged
backgrounds, but I shall not speak to that amendment.</div>
<a name="10020291000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
88, 170 and 171 appear to create a bit of a hotch-potch, but that is
because we had to reallocate the phrase &#147;the needs of&#148;.
Their thrust is to ensure that we have suitably qualified inspectors.
Amendments 169 and 172 would add the condition that there should
be</div>
<a name="10020291000346"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;direct
consultation with...pupils and their
families&#148;&#151;</div><a name="10020291000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">we
give some examples of how that could happen&#151;to ensure that
inspections cover the right ground and go into suitable detail, hence
the appropriateness and quality considerations that I mentioned at the
outset. Lastly, amendment 89 would add paragraph (c) to proposed new
subsection (5A), which would provide that the concerns of parents of
pupils mentioned in paragraphs (a) and (b) should be
heard.</div><a name="10020291000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">Several
organisations have lobbied us on this subject. The Special Educational
Consortium states that the new focus of inspections under clause 7
would provide</div>
<a name="10020291000347"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a major
incentive for schools to improve their performance in this area, and
represents a significant step forward in ensuring that effective
provision for children with SEN and disabilities is a mainstream issue
for all
schools.&#148;</div><a name="10020291000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
might be wishful thinking, if only slightly, but it certainly goes in
the right direction.</div>
<a name="10020291000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of course,
the outcome depends on the quality of the inspection which, to a large
degree, depends on the quality of the inspectors and whether they are
suitably trained. Some organisations are worried that many Ofsted
inspectors are not suitably trained or qualified to inspect
appropriately and thoroughly a school&#146;s provisions for children
with SEN and physical disabilities. Much greater knowledge and
experience are required when trying to judge whether a school is doing
its very best to provide for children with special educational needs
and physical disabilities.</div>
<a name="10020291000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">NDCS, the
organisation for deaf children, has made the point
that</div><a name="10020291000348"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;it
is vital that parents are able to make informed choices about how their
deaf child should be educated. However, many parents report that the
information they receive from their local authority is either biased in
advocating one communication approach over another or simply sets out
what provision the local authority has
available.&#148;</div><a name="10020291000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is important that a degree of impartiality is available to those
parents, which they would glean from the inspection reports as well as
from literature from the school itself. It is therefore vital that the
inspector who carries out the inspection is able to provide such
impartiality about the quality and suitability of the
provision.</div>
<a name="10020291000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">The NDCS goes
on to say
that</div><a name="10020291000349"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;many
parents are not provided with support on learning how to communicate
with their deaf
child&#148;,</div><a name="10020291000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">and
many have to go outside schools and pay for it themselves. That should
be covered in an Ofsted inspection. We should know whether a school is
doing a good job of providing just about everything a child with
special 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column339" />Column number: 339</div>needs requires for his or her education, or whether it is doing only
part or half the job. We need qualified inspectors who know what to
look for, what questions to ask, and of whom to ask them, and how to
gauge the
answers.</div><a name="10020291000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
NDCS has given examples of inspections of provision for deaf children
being carried out by people who have no expertise or background in
deafness. Deafness is just one example. Clearly there are complex
requirements for dealing with conditions other than deafness,
particularly around SEN. There can be an enormous spectrum of
requirements, whether due to autism, Asperger&#146;s or other
communication difficulties, that are far more challenging to measure
properly and appropriately than a straightforward physical disability,
as one can talk about disabled access in terms of such things as height
of equipment, which is easier to measure with a tick-box
approach.</div><a name="10020291000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
National Association of Schoolmasters and Union of Women Teachers has
welcomed the provisions to ensure that special educational needs and
disability needs are met in mainstream schools, but it has raised
concerns about allocating responsibility to Ofsted without also
establishing clearly the way in which that should be discharged in
practice. It asks who is scrutinising the scrutineers, and who is
inspecting Ofsted. We could have that bigger argument, but we will not
do so during our debate on this
clause.</div><a name="10020291000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">NASUWT
makes the point that there is</div>
<a name="10020291000350"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;no effective
means of directing the Chief Inspector to resolve issues regarding the
delivery of the provisions of the
Bill&#148;.</div><a name="10020291000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">Even
if we have good-quality inspections carried out by well-qualified and
appropriately trained inspectors who are well versed in inspecting
special educational needs and disability provision, will it lead to a
better deal overall for pupils with
SEN?</div><a name="10020291000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">TreeHouse
is a fantastic organisation that deals with autism education. It points
out
that</div><a name="10020291000351"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;teachers
do not feel confident teaching children with autism... 51
per cent. of Britain&#146;s school teachers have never received
specialist training to help them support children with
autism&#148;.</div><a name="10020291000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
continues:</div><a name="10020291000352"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Only
10 per cent. have received such training in the past 12
months&#148;</div><a name="10020291000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">and</div><a name="10020291000353"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;44
per cent. of teachers do not feel confident teaching children with
autism.&#148;</div><a name="10020291000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
sort of thing needs to come out in inspections. The inspector needs to
know how to look for it and how to interact with teachers to get the
right results so that shortcomings can be revealed and a course of
remedial action recommended to ensure that children with SEN get a
better deal in that school in future. That is why the first three
amendments, although they are probing, place an emphasis on the fact
that these welcome inspections should be carried out by
&#147;suitably qualified
inspectors&#148;.</div><a name="10020291000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will
the Minister assure us about what might be going on with the training
of existing or additional Ofsted inspectors with expertise in this
area? Of course, there is a difference between inspectors who are
inspecting specialist schools and those who are inspecting SEN and
disabled provision in mainstream schools, which have a different
approach.</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column340" />Column number: 340</div><a name="10020291000362"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.15
pm</div><a name="10020291000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
that reason, amendments 169 and 172 stipulate that an inspector cannot
just go in, sit in a classroom, talk to teachers, study some of the
reports and get the data. It is essential that they engage physically
with children and their parents, who are best placed to know whether
pupils are being best looked after. There is no obligation, at the
moment&#151;unless again, the Minister can point me to some
guidance&#151;for Ofsted inspectors to engage with their overall
purpose, which is the pupils and their families, particularly where
communication is difficult for pupils, depending on their level of
special educational needs.</div>
<a name="10020291000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 89
would add that when reporting on the suitability of SEN provision in
mainstream schools, concerns expressed by parents and pupils must be a
consideration. I hope that the Minister will take the amendments as
helpful ones, intended to flesh out the intention and the
ability to deliver what I am sure the Minister wants to deliver by
including the clause in the Bill. I hope that he will be able to assure
us, or, better still, say that he will be delighted to take the
amendments at face value&#151;lock, stock and barrel&#151;and
include them in the Bill. That would receive the enormous aplomb of not
only this Committee, but many people involved and interested in special
educational needs, who are interested in the
clauses.</div><a name="10020291000265"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10020291000509"></a><b class="B">Annette
Brooke</b> (Mid-Dorset and North Poole) (LD): It is a pleasure
to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Betts. I think that we
will have a change of tone in the Committee at this point, as there is
broad agreement across most of the interested organisations and, I
believe, among all parties, that the two clauses are important. We can
argue that they do not go far enough or that there could be more
clauses to give greater support for children with special educational
needs, but what is here is important. I am disappointed that there is
not more here, as the Lamb report called for radical reform. However,
the clauses are two important pieces of the jigsaw&#151;it is just a
pity that the rest is not
there.</div><a name="10020291000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
agree with the sentiments behind the amendments. The hon. Member for
East Worthing and Shoreham is absolutely right to say that the quality
of inspectors is core. Much training is necessary. It is easy to add on
more individual representations, but it is important that we are
looking across the diverse needs of special educational needs. As well
as deaf children, blind and partially sighted children are an interest
of mine, as the Minister will know. The Royal National Institute of
Blind People would like to hear what intentions the Government have to
check that blind and partially sighted children&#146;s needs are
being met through specific inspection standards and that inspectors
have appropriate training and expertise.</div>
<a name="10020291000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am sure
that we could go on and on about diversity of special educational
needs, but it is so important. We have clearly moved on positively to
an inclusive situation with blind and partially sighted children since
the time when nearly all would have gone to special schools, but my
problem with inclusion is the speed with which we have moved to
inclusion without implementing the necessary background structure. For
example, it is only just now that teacher training is addressing SEN
training for all teachers. I believe that the first teachers with extra

<div class="Column"><a name="Column341" />Column number: 341</div>training will not come through until 2011. That seems to be building the
walls rather late in the day, but it is still very
important.</div><a name="10020291000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
representation on inclusivity that I have received is from Allfie, an
organisation that is in favour of total inclusivity. Allfie makes the
point that Ofsted should be required to work with disabled people to
develop inclusive education and inspection guidance. To pick up on
previous points, that will be
all-important.</div><a name="10020291000269"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Conservatives&#146; amendment 169, interestingly, discusses direct
consultation with pupil and family questionnaires in a totally
different context from the one that we discussed during debate on the
previous clause. One thing is for sure: the parents of children with
special educational needs do not have the opportunity to play their
part in the democratic process. They may well vote at local elections,
but their voice is so small in relation to the whole that they cannot
express their views, and it is important to ensure that they
can.</div>
<a name="10020291000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">In our
amendment, my hon. Friend the Member for Yeovil and I suggest that we
should add pupils from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds. From
our visits to schools, we are all aware of what challenges teachers
face first thing in the morning, particularly in year 1 and year 2,
with children who are not equipped to cope with the school day, even
though they might have been to pre-school. A lot of time must be
devoted to what we might see as basic provision, but it is vital that
such children are given the extra support that they need. In this
Committee&#146;s earlier debates, we have discussed the importance of
speaking and listening skills. They are so important for
children&#151;</div><a name="10020291000271"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10020291000510"></a><b class="B">Caroline
Flint</b> (Don Valley) (Lab): I have some sympathy with the
amendment, but I am not sure whether it is the right approach. For many
children, including some in my constituency, the problem is not what
happens in school; it is what happens at home. That is a fundamentally
different discussion from inclusivity in the school curriculum for
children with a disability. The hon. Lady mentioned blindness; other
people have mentioned deafness, and we have discussed autism. Schools
make every effort to ensure that children get the communication skills
that they need, but the problem is that they are coming to school with
a poor vocabulary due to issues at home. I am not sure
whether the clause is the right place to address
that.</div><a name="10020291000272"></a>

Whether it is the right place is debatable, but we are discussing
children who, for one reason or another, need extra support. We simply
suggest that the inspectors could also take on board vulnerable
children who need extra support. It is only a probing amendment at this
stage&#151;</div><a name="10020291000273"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020291000512"></a>Caroline

the inspection? For example, the performance will be looked at, as will
the tests that are done on children entering school and also literacy
and numeracy as we have discussed. Reference is made later in the Bill
to the primary school curriculum being changed. Surely matters are
covered amply.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020291000513"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> I guess that that depends on the weight we put on
particular issues. Liberal Democrats put an awful lot on tackling the
problems of children from disadvantaged backgrounds, which is why we

it.</div><a name="10020291000275"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020291000514"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> I welcome the hon. Member for East Worthing and
Shoreham to a speaking part in our proceedings, along with the hon.
Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole. I want to read out a useful fact
to put the matter into context. The latest statistics that I have to
hand show that, in January 2009, 1,433,940 pupils had special
educational needs without statements and that 221,670 pupils had
statements. I thank the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham for
his welcome to clauses 7 and 8, and the way in which he explained his
proposals. I hope that I can reassure him that the amendments are
unnecessary. I agree with many of his points and indeed many of those
made by the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North
Poole.</div><a name="10020291000276"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman is right to highlight the importance of inspectors who
are suitably qualified for their role. That is why the matter is
recognised under existing legislation on inspection. Paragraph 10 to
schedule 12 of the Education and Inspections Act 2006 requires the
chief inspector to ensure that inspectors have the necessary
qualifications, experience and skills to perform their functions in an
effective manner. Effective delivery is, of course, linked to effective
training, and the Lamb inquiry recommended a strengthening of the
arrangements. I wish again to thank Brian Lamb for his work.
He did not conclude that further legislation was necessary, and we
agreed with
that.</div><a name="10020291000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
assure the hon. Gentleman that Her Majesty&#146;s chief inspector is
committed to enhancing training arrangements for special educational
needs and disabilities. He asked me for examples. Ofsted has recently
updated its training materials for mainstream schools, and inspectors
are currently undergoing training using those new materials. It is also
developing further material&#151;a point to which the hon. Gentleman
referred&#151;for its specialist inspectors. In addition, Ofsted is
committed to providing updated training for inspectors on special
educational needs on at least an annual basis. I hope that that goes
some way to reassuring the hon.
Gentleman.</div><a name="10020291000278"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020291000515"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> It is interesting to have those pieces of
information, but can the Minister back them up with figures in relation
to how many specialist inspectors there are at the moment? Are they
focusing just on SEN provision within mainstream schools? Are they dual
tasking while inspecting special educational needs in specialist
schools, too? Has there been an increase in the number of inspectors?
Clearly there has been an increase in the number of SEN children who
are now included in mainstream schools. We need some reassurance that
the appropriate people are sufficient to be doing the
job.</div><a name="10020291000279"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020291000516"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> I hope that I will receive clarification of the
figures. When I talked about training, I said that Ofsted was
developing material for its specialist inspectors. If I receive further
information on actual figures before this afternoon&#146;s sitting, I
will share it with the Committee. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column343" />Column number: 343</div>The hon. Gentleman makes a fair point. If I cannot obtain the figures by
this afternoon, I shall ensure that we have them available for our
proceedings in due
course.</div><a name="10020291000363"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.30

Ann Cryer</b> (Keighley) (Lab): While my hon. Friend is
finding the facts and figures, can he, at the same time, look at
whether Ofsted can cope with mainstream schools such as those in my
constituency? The biraderi and first cousin marriage system can lead to
one school having some 30 per cent. of children with special needs and,
in addition, children with disabilities due to genetically transmitted
disorders. I know that that is unusual, but many such cases can arise
in one school, and I would like to be assured that the inspectorate can
cope with such a
situation.</div><a name="10020291000281"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020291000518"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> Of course, the inspectorate can cope. The issue is
one of training. The clause says that Ofsted has a specific duty to
report on how well a particular school is dealing with those pupils who
have special educational needs, so it has a specific requirement to do
that as part of its reporting process. Alongside that additional focus,
which is important, there is a recognition that more specialist
inspectors need to be trained so that they can deal with particular
circumstances in schools such as the one that my hon. Friend has
mentioned.</div><a name="10020291000282"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020291000519"></a>Caroline
Flint:</b> Given the wide range of special needs and
disabilities, it seems almost impossible that we can have the perfect
inspector being an authority on every single area. Will my hon. Friend
reassure me about the amount of information that an inspector might
have before they go into a school? They must be able to use
appropriately whatever tools are available to them to find the best
practice, so they can make a comparison and establish how the school is
doing when they do the on-site
inspection.</div><a name="10020291000283"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020291000520"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> That is a very important point. Before any
individual inspection, the inspector is required to gather information
about the education provision of a particular school. They need to find
out not just what the school itself thinks of the provision but what
parents and others think of it. As part of that gathering of
information, the inspectors themselves will reflect on how other
schools across the country are doing to see whether the school they are
going to inspect is dealing with a problem in a better way, or whether
it faces more challenges than other schools. Therefore, they learn what
happens in other schools to help them in their
inspections.</div><a name="10020291000284"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020291000521"></a>Mr.
Purchase:</b> To be honest, the organisation of Ofsted, which
costs &#163;500 million a year, is second only to the Electoral
Commission in terms of an appalling waste of money. Notwithstanding
that, has my hon. Friend estimated the cost of giving this job to
Ofsted, as opposed to going down the more traditional route of social
services, which may be called upon to consider the matter separately
with their own expertise? We could do that, rather than trying to train
hundreds more inspectors in the very important area of recognising
disability and whether it is being met in an educational
sense.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column344" />Column number: 344</div><a name="10020291000285"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020291000522"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> The point of Ofsted is to assess the quality of
provision within a school for children of all abilities. This clause
puts a particular focus on Ofsted&#146;s needing to report on how
well a school is doing regarding pupils with special needs or
disabilities. That is an important part of the process. We would expect
social services to be involved in the support of an individual child
with a disability, alongside the work of the school. I slightly
disagree with my hon. Friend because I think the functions of the two
are slightly different. Ofsted is about inspecting a school to see how
well it does in meeting the needs of pupils with special educational
needs, and this clause contains a requirement to report on that. Social
services are about supporting the individual needs of the child. Ofsted
might say that for a school to perform better and do better for
individual pupils who have special needs, its relationship with
children&#146;s services or social services should be improved, so
that it accesses the support that the child needs in a better way
within the school situation. As I said, our emphasis may be
different&#151;</div><a name="10020291000286"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020291000523"></a>Caroline
Flint:</b> Ofsted has a role in inspecting children&#146;s
services as well these days, I understand, so I hope that some
correlation between what happens in the two Departments would be
obvious. It is important to make it clear that for parents who want
their children to avail themselves of a state education, we have a duty
to provide that education, so it is absolutely right that Ofsted should
ensure it is being provided in a way that makes for the best outcomes
for the child, and that is to the satisfaction of the
family.</div><a name="10020291000287"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020291000524"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> I agree. My right hon. Friend is right that Ofsted
is now responsible for children&#146;s services, as well as
schools.</div><a name="10020291000288"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
170, 171 and 172 remove the reference to &#147;the needs of&#148;
from the main part of the clause and reattach the term in separate
references to pupils with disabilities and special educational needs.
However, the drafting of clause 7 provides for the needs of pupils with
disabilities and special educational needs to be considered in the
inspection reports. The amendments would have no material impact on the
effect of the clause. I hope that is
reassuring.</div><a name="10020291000289"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
169 and 89 concern the engagement of pupils and parents in school
inspection. As drafted, amendment 169 extends only to pupils with a
disability and not to those with special educational needs, which I am
sure was not the intention of the hon. Member for East Worthing and
Shoreham. In any case, I reassure him that there is already a strong
emphasis on parental and pupil views directly informing inspection
under both the existing legislation and the new inspection
arrangements. Section 7 of the Education Act 2005 requires inspectors
conducting a school inspection to have regard to the views expressed by
both parents and pupils. The Bill provides further assurance. The
parent guarantee, which is given force by clauses 1 to 3, includes a
guarantee for parents to have their views considered by Ofsted during
school
inspections.</div><a name="10020291000290"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
amendment 147, I appreciate the intention of the hon. Member for
Mid-Dorset and North Poole in drawing particular attention to the need
for inspection to focus on outcomes and provision for vulnerable
pupils, including those entitled to free school meals, those from
minority 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column345" />Column number: 345</div>ethnic groups, children in care and so on, but those&#151;I assure
her&#151;are key aspects of the new inspection arrangements. My right
hon. Friend the Member for Don Valley made the point about the intent
of the amendment being right, but that provision is already included in
the more general inspection framework. Section 5 of the Education Act
2005 as drafted provides a clear statutory imperative for inspectors to
focus on how well schools deliver for all groups of pupils. It does not
single out particular groups. As a general principle, that is right.
The inspectors are given the flexibility to adjust their focus to
reflect the particular circumstances of individual schools and to avoid
the risk of a particular group falling outside the legislation, as my
right hon. Friend pointed
out.</div><a name="10020291000291"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
thank the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham for how he
introduced his amendments&#151;the support for clauses 7 and 8, and
his reference to the probing nature of the amendments. I hope I have
been able to make it clear that they are unnecessary, and given the
reassurance he needs. We support the intention behind the amendments,
but they are not necessary in the context of the overall framework of
the legislation and I ask him to consider withdrawing
them.</div><a name="10020291000292"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020291000525"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> I am grateful for the positive and constructive
way in which the Minister dealt with what were, as I said, probing
amendments. It would be interesting to have some of the
figures.</div><a name="10020291000293"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020291000526"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> Just to confirm, if I cannot get the figures for
this afternoon, I shall write to the Committee with them, because that
was a fair
comment.</div><a name="10020291000294"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020291000527"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> That is helpful. Without going down the line
pursued by the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, North-East&#151;the
expensiveness and other aspects of Ofsted&#151;I point out that some
serious concerns have clearly been raised about Ofsted&#146;s
capability within children&#146;s social care. He made a point about
social services. Without wishing to make the regulatory framework even
bigger, I have concerns about Ofsted&#146;s ability to inspect
children&#146;s social care, and of course there are aspects of that
within special educational needs provision, albeit within a school
building and school framework. It is a fair point that we need greater
assurances about whether Ofsted has grasped that, and about what
practical measures it is taking to recruit the necessary number of
people and to ensure they are properly
trained.</div><a name="10020291000295"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
reiterate the Minister&#146;s comments about the excellent work done
by Brian Lamb and the contribution that he made to the SEN debate, but
it is only a contribution. Many of us would like the Government to go
much further. There are still a lot of gaps in the provision. There is
a bit of a postcode lottery in many cases. It is essential that the
inspectorate identify where those gaps are and where there is best
practice and poor practice, to ensure that the weak learn from the
strong.</div><a name="10020291000296"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole mentioned, there has
been a speeding toward inclusion, with which I have some problems. It
has been at the expense of 9,000 places in specialist schools. We
should judge the appropriateness in relation to each 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column346" />Column number: 346</div>individual child, rather than being caught up in the move to inclusion,
which in some cases has left individual children lacking the degree of
special education that they
need.</div><a name="10020291000297"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
said at the beginning that these were probing amendments. We have had
some more information from the Minister and he has undertaken to give
us more factual information, which I think will be helpful. I therefore
beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="10020291000298"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020291000530"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> It is me again, so we shall make rapid progress
through this bit of the Bill. I have realised slightly belatedly that
amendment 75 is almost utterly redundant, but it gives me the
opportunity to probe, as was the intention behind the amendment anyway.
I have been racking my brains as to how I can make it slightly less
redundant, and I have alighted on the fact that it uses the phrase
&#147;their&#148; right, whereas the clause refers to
&#147;the&#148; right. I shall talk just about that, if I may. I am
sure that the Liberal Democrats&#146; spokesman will speak to their
three amendments. They lay down some more detailed markers, with which
I have some sympathy, particularly on the need to speed up
determinations, which can drag on too
long.</div><a name="10020291000306"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
welcome the clause, as do organisations involved with special
educational needs. The whole point of the clause is to deal with the
lottery in relation to getting a statement, ensuring that it is
appropriate and being able to change it in the future. In most cases, a
child&#146;s statement of special educational needs should never
remain static. A child&#146;s requirements obviously change as the
child develops, yet there will be many children with a statement of
special educational needs that was granted at primary age who continue
with the same statement, unamended, for many years, even though the
child has physically and mentally developed well beyond 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column347" />Column number: 347</div>the confines of what the original statement was designed to achieve for
the child. It is therefore right that we give greater powers to parents
who challenge and need to challenge the suitability of a statement that
has been attached to their child, because those statements become out
of
date.</div><a name="10020291000307"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
entire statementing process is highly cumbersome, costly, stressful and
adversarial and needs to be overhauled. We have various proposals on
how it could be overhauled. Yesterday, 120 SEN experts assembled in
Westminster Hall with Sir Bob Balchin, my hon. Friend the Member for
Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, myself and others to discuss ways in
which the whole statementing process could be improved and a better
deal for children with special educational needs and their families
achieved. We have a particular interest in this
area.</div><a name="10020291000308"></a><div class="hs_Para">Key
to all this must surely be empowering the parents to challenge
unsuitable or non-existent special provisions for their
children.</div>
<a name="10020291000364"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.45
pm</div><a name="10020291000309"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have all, I am sure, had constituents coming to us who are in a war of
attrition with a local authority to get the required statement and to
make sure that it is adhered to, let alone remains relevant. The
problem with the system is that the local authority is effectively the
judge, the jury, the appeal judge, the commissioner and the provider of
the services. I believe that the system will not materially improve
until we split up those responsibilities so that there are people who
can make an impartial statement assessing a child&#146;s need in more
detail than the current broad-brush approach. Then, with the parents,
they could hold that authority to account to make sure that the
provisions in the statement are
forthcoming.</div><a name="10020291000310"></a><div class="hs_Para">Too
many of our constituents have had their expectations raised that a
suitable statement will be made. They wait a long time for it only to
see those expectations dashed because they do not get remotely the
level of statement that is required for that child. In this clause we
could give a power to the parent to try to ensure that the statement
remains relevant to the requirements of their child. It is a highly
confusing system. This only scratches the surface and the whole system
needs to be completely overhauled. It is a false economy not to be
getting a better deal for parents early on. The number of appeals to
tribunals that are subsequently upheld in favour of the child and his
or her family shows that there is an enormous problem with the system.
A lot of money is being wasted on contesting appeals that could be
better used to provide the services that the children
need.</div><a name="10020291000311"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
was my opportunity to make that broader point about how the system is
not working at the moment. It is vital that we give greater powers of
appeal to the parents, so there needs to be a written notice when an
authority has made a determination and, if it is not the right answer
for the parents, it must be made absolutely clear to them how they can
challenge it. The clause requires the local authority to provide only
the absolute minimum of information. It could be a fact sheet about the
tribunal system.</div>
<a name="10020291000312"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
tries to provide a more helping hand to the parent about how the appeal
could take place and on what grounds it could be launched. The
provision of  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column348" />Column number: 348</div>a helping hand to parents is pretty arbitrary at the moment, with
various outside organisations such as the Independent Panel for Special
Education Advice and others playing that advocate role. But that is not
available to everybody. Within the local authority there could be
rather more dispassionate advice for parents.</div>
<a name="10020291000313"></a><div class="hs_Para">Ultimately it
is in the interests of the local authority as well as the parents to
get the best deal for a child. If that does not happen, the child is
failed, the family is failed and greater stress is placed on them. The
local authority will be failed too because ultimately many children
with special educational needs who do not get appropriate support
require higher level, more intense support later on. They may be rather
less independent than they might have been if given the right support
intensively and early on.</div>
<a name="10020291000314"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
is probing to ensure that that is not just a token exercise that allows
someone to appeal, and that it sets out clearly what an individual
parent should do, based on that individual determination, if the
statement update has been turned down. There might be some local
support they can get to ensure that they put their case in the most
appropriate way and can feel rather more confident about navigating an
intimidating, highly technical and confusing system that currently
works along the line of a war of attrition, I am afraid to say, to
knock people out of the system.</div>
<a name="10020291000315"></a><div class="hs_Para">Too many
local authorities play a game of brinkmanship on the basis that if they
put up a resolute opposition the parent might just get completely
over-awed and over-stressed and drop out. I have heard of some
absolutely disgraceful incidents in which parents have had a prima
facie case and absolutely needed a proper statement for their child, or
needed a statement amended, and the authority challenged it all the
way, only to drop out the day before the appeal was due to take place
on the basis that they knew they never had a leg to stand on but hoped
that the stress on the parent might get them to drop the case. That is
absolutely unacceptable. We need to do more to be on the side of the
parents in difficult circumstances to ensure that their rights of
appeal are properly understood and that they have every support
necessary so that they can make a strong case on behalf of their
children.</div><a name="10020291000316"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020291000531"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> The amendment would be an important adjustment to
the current situation. Equally, I agree that the statementing process
needs a much fuller review. Although I feel, like those who have spoken
before me, that Sir Brian Lamb did an excellent job, he was limited
with the remit he was given. As I recall, I do not think that his remit
went as far as the Children, Schools and Families Committee recommended
at the time.</div>
<a name="10020291000317"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments that my hon. Friend the Member for Yeovil and I have tabled
suggest first that the head teacher of the school could be involved in
the appeal, and secondly, if a case goes to tribunal, that the school
should be involved. We know that many parents of children with special
educational needs need support, and we argue that teachers and the
school will be very much aware if a statement needs amending. We feel
that that could be an important consideration. I do not think that the
school will do anything that might be regarded as frivolous, but it is
the teachers who deal with the children day in, day out, and who will
really understand the needs. I would like the Minister to give those
points serious consideration.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column349" />Column number: 349</div><a name="10020291000318"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 165
arose from some of the comments made by Mr. John Friel in
evidence to the Committee. I would like to read out some of
the points he
made:</div><a name="10020291000354"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
drafting of that particular section needs to set a time limit and
provide for either the parent or the school to request an amendment to
the annual review&#151;if the local authority considers that there
will an amendment, it will of course make it anyway. There needs to be
some tighter drafting on that particular clause, because at the moment,
as it is, there is a great deal of complaints...about refusal to
amend statements. The local authorities answer, &#145;Well,
there&#146;s no time limit.&#146;&#148;
<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report, Children, Schools and
Families Public Bill Committee, </i>19 January 2010; c. 44,
Q57.]</div><a name="10020291000319"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment has perhaps found the most convenient place in the Bill to
suggest a time limit, and the Minister might tell me that there is in
fact a time limit in which local authorities must respond to an appeal,
but I would like to raise the issue of time limits generally in the
whole process.</div>
<a name="10020291000320"></a><div class="hs_Para">We want to
make a change that is significant, but we all know that local
authorities lacking resources will drag things out. We need time limits
on when the appeal is determined, on when the change is made to the
statement and on the implementation period. I would be grateful if the
Minister would respond to those points.</div>
<a name="10020291000321"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020291000532"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> This is another important group of amendments. The
clause was widely welcomed by everyone and was introduced in response
to Sir Brian Lamb&#146;s recommendations. The hon. Member for East
Worthing and Shoreham explained his amendment. The proposals in
amendment 75 are already in proposed new subsection (5),
which states that a notice to parents informing them of the local
authority&#146;s decision not to amend a statement must also inform
them of their right of appeal. The notice does need to go a little
further, and, as well as their right of appeal, it will tell parents
about the Parent Partnership Service, which is available to them and
can provide help and advice.</div>
<a name="10020291000322"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020291000533"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> Sir Brian Lamb mentioned that pupil-parent
partnerships need improving, as I have mentioned on many occasions,
because they are either not independent or not seen as independent.
Does the Minister plan to follow through on Sir Brian Lamb&#146;s
recommendations?</div>
<a name="10020291000323"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020291000534"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> We will obviously look at all of Sir Brian
Lamb&#146;s recommendations to see how we can take them through. The
Parent Partnership Service is well thought of generally and we will
consider any recommendations that Sir Brian
makes.</div><a name="10020291000324"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham said that the information
given to parents ought to include a little more than just saying that
there will be a right of appeal. I agree with him on that and I am
trying to reassure him that it will include more. The tribunal also
provides advice and guidance to parents, and there is a video
available. That is an important step to support parents through the
process.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column350" />Column number: 350</div><a name="10020291000325"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendments
would add further safeguards into clause 8, which proposes a new right
to appeal to the first tier tribunal where a local authority has
determined not to amend a statement of SEN following a review. The
clause was warmly welcomed and is a direct result of Brian
Lamb&#146;s recommendations. I assure hon. Members that the
amendments are
unnecessary.</div><a name="10020291000326"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
amendment 75, I want to reiterate that subsection (5)
already provides notice to parents. Amendment 157 would extend the
right to appeal to the tribunal to the head teacher of the school
attended by the child. Again, the measure is unnecessary. The Education
Act 1996 provides that parents have the right to appeal to the tribunal
if they are not happy with the authority&#146;s decision on the
review. It is right that parents should be able to challenge the local
authority if they consider that their child&#146;s needs are not
being met, rather than head teachers of schools where pupils with
statements are
placed.</div><a name="10020291000327"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Lady may be concerned that where the head teacher&#146;s report
recommends amendments to the statement and they are not made, the head
teacher has no right of appeal. A school may feel that the statement
does not provide the resources it requires to meet the child&#146;s
needs, but a statement is a contract between the local authority and
the parents, not the school. We consider that a parent&#146;s right
to appeal should not be cut across by giving the right to the head
teacher as well. Head teachers&#146; concerns about the support
provided through statements should be addressed in discussion with the
local authority. We do not want to introduce a formal procedure into
that relationship. A school in such a situation can, in any case, ask
for a statutory reassessment of the child&#146;s SEN with a view to
amending the

233 would delete proposed new subsection (4) and substitute
extending the right to appeal to the tribunal to the school at which
the pupil is registered as well as to the head teacher, which was the
subject of amendment 157. That may be prompted by a concern that the
right should be exercised by the governing body, as the legal body in
charge of the school. The arguments as to why the extension is
unnecessary are similar to those set out in response to amendment
157.</div>

provides that where the parents have submitted an appeal to the
tribunal, the tribunal must make the determination within eight weeks
of receipt. However, I believe that the hon. Lady is attempting to
introduce an eight-week deadline for a local authority to conduct a
review after receiving the head teacher&#146;s report. If that is the
case, then the amendment is
unnecessary.</div><a name="10020291000330"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
share the hon. Lady&#146;s desire for parents not to be left waiting
for a long period following an annual review meeting to receive the
authority&#146;s decision on whether a statement can be amended. The
annual review cycle already has statutory time limits. Section 324 of
the Education Act 1996 requires the review to be completed before the
end of a 12-month period.</div>
