To continue the meteorological theme, I must say that it is good

Robertson</b> (Glasgow, North-West) (Lab): Thank you, Michael
Fish.</div><a name="06110286000012"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110286000192"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I thank the hon. Member for Glasgow, North-West
(John Robertson) for that
comment.</div><a name="06110286000013"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
is designed to address an issue that my hon. Friends and I, as well as
other hon. Members, regard as important. Its purpose is to provoke a
discussion about single room rent, which the Bill will convert to a
shared room rate under the new local housing allowance, although the
effect of the two is pretty much the same. The Bill will provide
tenants under the age of 25 with a considerably lower rate of housing
benefit than everyone else. It is my contention that shared room rent
should be abolished and that everyone, no matter what age, should have
access to housing benefits on the same basis. The single room rent is
unfair: it is discriminatory; it causes hardship, poverty and
homelessness; and it should be
abolished.</div><a name="06110286000014"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
note that early-day motions 816 and 2573 on the subject have between
them attracted the support of 169 hon. Members, including, I am pleased
to say, the hon. Members for North-East Derbyshire (Natascha Engel) and
for Daventry (Mr. Boswell), who are members of the
Committee. I hope they will contribute to the debate, because the issue
is important for the long term.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column411" />Column number: 412</div><a name="06110286000015"></a><div class="hs_Para">Since its introduction in
October 1996, the single room rent restriction has limited the maximum
amount of housing benefit that a single private sector claimant under
the age of 25 can receive for the average cost of a room in a shared
property, regardless of the property occupied. In contrast, single
people aged over 25can receive housing benefit for
one-bedroom, self-contained properties or shared accommodation. Anyone
aged under 25 and reliant on housing benefit who chooses to live, for
example, in a self-contained bedsit or self-contained, one-bedroom
accommodation will find that their benefit does not in any way cover
their costs. In fact, even the amount that people receive to rent a
single room in shared accommodation is usually insufficient to pay for
what is available
locally.</div><a name="06110286000016"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
restriction has been carried out in the local housing allowance
pathfinder areas where the new benefit has been piloted, and we shall
no doubt discuss it in more detail in our clause stand part debate.
Unless the Under-Secretary tells us otherwise, it seems that the
restriction will be continued under the new title of the shared room
rate in respect of the local housing allowance roll-out proposed under
the Bill.</div><a name="06110286000017"></a><div class="hs_Para">Revisions to
the definition of the single room rate have been found to have little
impact on the problems that young people face because of the current
restrictions.</div><a name="06110286000018"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06110286000193"></a><b class="B">Adam
Afriyie</b> (Windsor) (Con): Does the hon. Gentleman share my
concern about the implications with regard to age discrimination
legislation?</div><a name="06110286000019"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110286000194"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> That is a relevant point,
which perhaps the Under-Secretary will address. I welcome the positive
tone of the intervention, because I know that when the single room rate
was introduced by the Conservative Government in 1996, it was strongly
opposed by Labour Members. It may interest the Committee to know that
among those who voted against its introduction were the current Prime
Minister, Chancellor of the Exchequer and Secretary of State for Work
and Pensions. In fact, I think that any member of the Cabinet who was
elected to the House before 1997 voted against it. The Ministers
present in Committee today have no parliamentary record on the subject,
as they had not then been
elected.</div><a name="06110286000020"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110286000195"></a>John
Robertson:</b> And they were certainly not in the
Cabinet.</div><a name="06110286000021"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110286000196"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> Indeed. However, I know that the Minister of
State was actively involved in student union politics at the time when
the single room rent was introduced, and I should be very surprised if
he was not actively involved in campaigning against
that.</div><a name="06110286000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
make these points because I hope that there are still Labour Members
who continue to hold the view held by their hon. Friends in 1996 that
the idea that under-25s should receive a lower rate of housing benefit
is wrong, discriminatory and unfair, and that it causes hardship to far
too many young people. In previous sittings of the Committee,
Conservative Members have frequently shown off their new credentials
and the new approach by which they are trying to set aside their
history and turn over a new leaf. The amendment is a test for them, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column412" />Column number: 413</div>too, because it is a chance for them to show whether their conversion is
real or skin deep&#151;whether it is a matter of presentation, or
whether it affects the substance of policy. I hope, therefore, that if
the amendment goes to a Division, Conservative Members will support the
abolition of single room
rent.</div><a name="06110286000023"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06110286000197"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Jeremy Hunt</b> (South-West Surrey) (Con): To clarify matters,
is the hon. Gentleman saying that all that we have said to date in
Committee would go only skin deep, if we were not to support the
amendment?</div><a name="06110286000024"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110286000198"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I do not want to try the Committee&#146;s
patience, but what I am saying is that the substance of policy is the
ultimate test of political conviction. The amendment is about policy
substance, so I look forward to hearing the Conservative response,
although I do not know which Front-Bench spokesman will make
it.</div><a name="06110286000025"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06110286000199"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Tim Boswell</b> (Daventry) (Con): I hasten to disabuse the
hon. Gentleman of the idea that I shall be making a substantive
response to the debate, but as I almost certainly voted for the
provisions in 1996, I shall take a moment of the Committee&#146;s
time to remind him&#151;I am sure that he was coming to
this&#151;that it would assist the Committee if he were to identify
the likely cost of the change. As the amendment is also signed by the
hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Laws), who is, or who sets
himself up as, a pillar of fiscal rectitude, perhaps he will explain
how the cost will be
met.</div><a name="06110286000026"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110286000200"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> The hon. Gentleman has raised an important
point, which I shall come to, because the question of cost has been
specifically identified in written answers over the past year or
so.</div> <a name="06110286000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">Specific problems
that are caused to young people by the current single room rent rules
will, I believe, continue under the Bill. Eighty-seven per cent. of
single room rate claimants experience a shortfall between the housing
benefit that they receive and the rent that they pay. According to
Shelter&#146;s calculations, that shortfall averages &#163;35.14 a
week, which is
substantial.</div><a name="06110286000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
last written answer that I have seen on the subject dates from May 2005
and states that 11,990 people were in receipt of the single room rent.
There is a severe shortage of accommodation available to people under
25 that meets the single room rent or the shared room rate definition.
That causes a real problem for those charities that are working with
young homeless people, because it is often hard, if not impossible, to
move those people on to accommodation that is appropriate to their
needs.</div>
<a name="06110286000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">At a seminar
on this matter hosted by a coalition of charities including Shelter, I
attended a presentation by young people who were in YMCA hostel
accommodation because they had been unable to meet their rent due to
the shortfall in the single room rent. The current arrangements for
housing benefits for under-25s can be a real disincentive for young
people to leave supported accommodation, as those young people know
that they will face a shortfall. In 2005, YMCA England surveyed 23
local YMCAs, and it identified the single room rent as a significant
barrier to people moving on from YMCA accommodation. Some 35 per cent.
of young people in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column413" />Column number: 414</div>YMCA accommodation were ready to move on but were unable to find
anything affordable to rent, given the benefit
situation.</div><a name="06110286000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">Affordability
is not the only barrier facing young people. There is substantial
evidence that landlords are unwilling to let to under-25s on benefit
because they know about the benefit situation and the fact that many of
those young people will face shortfalls. They know that that may cause
debt, hardship and an inability to meet rent payments, which from the
landlords&#146; point of view can cause severe difficulties. Shelter
has carried out research which shows that while 46 per cent. of
one-bedroom properties were affordable to those entitled to the
one-bedroom rate for over-25s, only 26 per cent. of properties that
matched the shared room rate definition were at or below the shared
room rate of housing
benefit.</div><a name="06110286000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">That research
related to the local housing allowance pathfinder areas, which is where
the Government have been trying out the new system proposed in the
Bill. The Minister may seek to allay my fears by saying that under the
new system there will be an improvement in the position of under-25s,
but Shelter&#146;s research found that even under the new system only
26 per cent. of accommodation in the pathfinder areas was affordable to
those people in receipt of the shared room
rate.</div><a name="06110286000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
single room rent also applies to pregnant women. Once the baby is born,
the restriction no longer applies, so more housing benefit is
available. However, it is particularly difficult for a young person to
find and manage a move to more suitable accommodation with all the
extra costs and changes at that time. The Minister of State rightly
made great play of the importance of tackling child poverty during our
deliberations on part 1 of the Bill. I would argue that these
provisions have a damaging impact on child poverty for all the reasons
that I have just
described.</div><a name="06110286000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will not go through the various case studies, although they are
instructive. I am sure that all members of the Committee will have been
supplied with briefing material and information that gives detailed
case studies of people under 25 who are in severe hardship as a result
of these restrictions. I shall simply highlight a couple of extra
points. The single room rent or the shared room rate is particularly
problematic for people for whom shared accommodation is not suitable
and would create difficulties, for example, people, who are undergoing
rehabilitation for an alcohol or drug
problem.</div><a name="06110286000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Daventry raised an important point about the costs of
abolishing single room rent and extending the housing benefit
provisions to people under 25. In April 2006, in a parliamentary answer
to the hon. Member for City of York (Hugh Bayley), the Under-Secretary
of State for Work and Pensions, the hon. Member for Warwick and
Leamington (Mr. Plaskitt), said that to abolish the single
room rent would cost</div><a name="06110286000155"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;at
least &#163;20 million per year&#148;.&#151;[<i class="I">Official
Report</i>, 18 April 2006; Vol. 445, c.
407W.]</div><a name="06110286000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">Other estimates have
suggested &#163;60 million a year. It may be somewhere between those
two figures.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column414" />Column number: 415</div><a name="06110286000036"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110286000201"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> The hon. Gentleman suggested that many landlords
are reluctant to make such lettings at present. Does he appreciate that
there could be a dynamic effect if the proposal were accepted, because
more young people would take that opportunity and the cost would be
upwards in the spectrum rather than the somewhat conservative estimate
of
Ministers?</div><a name="06110286000037"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110286000202"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> The hon. Gentleman is right to refer to the
dynamic effects, but there would be at least as powerful a dynamic
effect, or an even greater one, in the opposite direction. After all,
these young persons are trapped in hardship, their debts are building,
they are moved between temporary accommodation and they may be living
in a hostel. Finding employment, the subject of part 1 of the Bill, is
harder and making ends meet is harder. It is possible to foresee
dynamic effects in the opposite direction. Making provision that allows
young people to have a more stable footing in life means that the
majority of young people who need the assistance of housing benefit can
afford to live without having a dramatic shortfall in their benefits.
That may well lead to much more positive economic benefits, which would
more than counteract the effects that the hon. Gentleman, legitimately,
described.</div><a name="06110286000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman asked where the money would come from. Abolishing the single
room rent is Liberal Democrat policy, as it was at the last election
and will be for the foreseeable future. The policies were set out in a
carefully costed manifesto. He rightly referred to my hon. Friend the
Member for Yeovil, who is indeed a pillar of fiscal rectitude, a
characteristic that I try to emulate.

small, and the Government could send a significant signal that they do
not wish to trap in poverty young people who require the assistance of
housing benefit, to fuel such young people&#146;s debts or to force
such young people out of rented accommodation into hostel accommodation
or, even worse, homelessness. For a relatively small amount of money, a
positive signal could be sent.</div>

Penrose</b> (Weston-super-Mare) (Con): Will the hon. Gentleman
clarify one point about the principle underlying his amendment? Is he
objecting in principle to a single room rent being set at some level,
if it is sufficient to cover the genuine costs? In other words, is he
objecting in principle to people of a certain age living in houses in
multiple occupation of adequate quality, or to the fact that the system
is not working in practice because the single room rent is set too low?
If that is the case, and if the new arrangements are correctly executed
and the local housing allowance is set at the right level, his
objection would vanish and there would be no need for his
amendment.</div><a name="06110286000049"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110286000212"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> The hon. Gentleman has made a thoughtful point.
I do not see any justification for discrimination on grounds of age in
the housing benefit system. People of all ages might well wish to live
in shared accommodation, but the fact that people under 25 are
effectively told, &#147;You will only get housing benefit if you live
in shared accommodation; it is the only acceptable form of
accommodation for you for which we will provide housing
benefit,&#148; is wrong. That is what I object to, and I have
explained my reasons at some
length.</div><a name="06110286000050"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110286000213"></a>John
Penrose:</b> If that is the case, does that not mean that the
hon. Gentleman would not back any notion of a local housing allowance
for HMOs and that HMOs would therefore vanish as a type of housing
provision for anybody of any
age?</div><a name="06110286000051"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110286000214"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> Currently, 87 per cent. of all single room rate
recipients face a shortfall. That shortfall averages &#163;35.14 a
week, but if one looks at written answers throughout the history of the
single room rate, one sees that the number of recipients has fallen
dramatically from 35,000 in 1996&#151;that is from memory, as I do
not have the written answer before me&#151;to just over 11,000 today.
The effect that the hon. Gentleman has described may already be taking
place.</div> <a name="06110286000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am making a
point about treating young people fairly in relation to housing
benefit. What sort of accommodation they live in should be a matter for

<div class="Column"><a name="Column416" />Column number: 417</div>them, and housing benefit should be available on that basis, and not on
its current discriminatory basis. I hope that the Committee will
support the amendment and bring that injustice to an
end.</div><a name="06110286000053"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06110286000215"></a><b class="B">Mr.
David Ruffley</b> (Bury St. Edmunds) (Con): This is
undoubtedly an important issue. The groups that have examined the Bill
have briefed many Committee members from all parties. Undoubtedly, very
many people under 25 are in hardship, so we must take the matter
extremely
seriously.</div><a name="06110286000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of the
key criticisms made by Shelter, citizens advice bureaux and others is
that there is a lack of accommodation that meets the SRR definition and
housing benefit levels. Recent figures from the Association of
Residential Letting Agents suggest that the multiple sharer market is
decreasing, which it almost certainly is. For instance, houses in
multiple occupation make up only 6 per cent. of the rental market
compared with 9 per cent. in the previous two quarters prior to this
autumn&#151;the figures are from the <i class="I">Estates
Gazette</i>.</div><a name="06110286000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">Shelter&#146;s
research into rent levels in the local housing allowance pilot areas
found that while 46 per cent. of one-bedroom properties
advertised&#151;in other words, properties outwith the SRR
market&#151;were affordable to those entitled to the one-bedroom
rate, only 26 per cent. of properties matched the shared room rate
definition or were below the shared room rate levels in those pilot
areas, which is a startling
disparity.</div><a name="06110286000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
exploring the reasons behind the decline in houses that meet the SRR
levels in the pilot areas, the Council of Mortgage Lenders has
highlighted the growing burden of Government initiatives and
regulations in the private rented sector. That is not support for the
landlord class, if I can lapse into Marxist terminology, which I know
that the Minister will remember from his
youth.</div>

a distinguished head of the National Union of Students, and we all like
reading his early musings on the nature of political life&#151;I
often read them late at night just to cheer myself
up.</div><a name="06110286000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is not only the modern Conservative party that has moved on&#151;we
have conceded that our opposition to the minimum wage was the wrong

in ways that are unhelpful to our
proceedings.</div><a name="06110286000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
comments made by the Council of Mortgage Lenders are important in this
key issue, on which I hope that we have a decent debate today. Supply
is not just about benefit levels, and it is not just a welfare problem,
because it is also a problem for Ministers in the Department for
Communities and Local Government. The Council of Mortgage Lenders has

although the introduction of the LHA has not resulted in a substantial
reduction of lettings overall to claimants ...The LHA comprises a
distinguishable factor in the reduction of lettings to claimants with
landlords and lettings agents being particularly concerned about the
accrual of arrears...Inevitably, the current plans to roll out the
LHA nationally will cause some review of lending policies in this area
to reflect the higher financial risks for landlords and this will
contribute to a reduction in the level of
investment&#148;</div><a name="06110286000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">in the

point in this section of the final evaluation report is troubling, and
it has been backed up by the British Property Federation, which has
stated that</div><a name="06110286000159"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;many of our
members are reluctant to let to under 25s because of the inadequacy of
their HB payments to meet the rent required. This is reflected in the
DWP statistics which show that the number of claimants assessed under
the SRR rules has fallen from 31,600 in 1997 to 11,990 in
2005.&#148;</div><a name="06110286000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is an amazing
statistic, and I would be grateful if the Under-Secretary of State for
Work and Pensions, the hon. Member for Stirling (Mrs.
McGuire) were to comment on it. It prompts the question: where have all
the claimants
gone?</div><a name="06110286000066"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110286000219"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> The Under-Secretary can answer that question, if
she catches your eye, Mr. Hood&#151;I have due respect for
your office, as indeed we all
do.</div><a name="06110286000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would be
interesting to know why the number of claimants has fallen. If it is
because under-25s are going for better properties because they can
afford higher rentals, it is a good thing. However, that statistic
needs to be explained, and I will be interested to hear the
Under-Secretary&#146;s
response.</div><a name="06110286000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">The YMCA
said that 35 per cent. of young people in its accommodation wanted to
move into their own accommodation but were unable to find anything
affordable to rent. In the spirit of consensus that I am going to lurch
back into, I imagine that that figure would not have been dissimilar
before 1997. However, the Government have been in office for nine
years, and I wonder whether they recognise that YMCA statistic and what
they want to do about
it.</div><a name="06110286000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">Bearing in mind
the trends highlighted by Shelter, citizens advice bureaux, the British
Property Federation, the Council of Mortgage Lenders and others, what
assurances can the Under-Secretary give that the further roll-out of
the LHA will not be accompanied by a decline in stock suitable for SRR
claimants? We also welcome what I believe is an overall decline in
demand for discretionary hardship payments, although the problem is
that it relates to the number of applications across the board. My 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column418" />Column number: 419</div>understanding is that the number of applications from under-25s remains
unchanged in the pilot areas, so is it correct that nothing has
changed?</div><a name="06110286000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">Shelter and
CAB have picked up on three DWP reports on the evaluation of the LHA.
The reports specifically highlight the position of under-25s in
relation to rent officers, which is another important issue. One of the
reports
states:</div><a name="06110286000160"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Rent
Officers in some of the areas were facing particular difficulty in
gathering evidence in order to set the shared room
rate.&#148;</div><a name="06110286000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Under-Secretary and the Government should be given credit for piloting
an innovative scheme. The LHA has had success and Conservative Members
are not challenging that. However, the data in the evaluation report
raise many unanswered questions. The report
continues:</div><a name="06110286000161"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;This
could mean that as a result the rate is a less reliable reflection of
the market, thus compounding claimants&#146;
problems.&#148;</div><a name="06110286000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">That suggests
a lack of truly reliable evidence from the pilot areas. Will the
Under-Secretary assure us that she and her officials will look
carefully at the findings of rent
officers?</div><a name="06110286000074"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110286000220"></a>John
Penrose:</b> Will my hon. Friend accept that it looks strongly
that there is an argument for saying that rent officers have for some
time been getting this wrong in that the levels are being set too low,
and we know that that causes hardship. That is having a knock-on effect
on the supply of housing in multiple occupation, about which he has
been talking. Ever since the idea was first introduced, it has had the
unintended effect of the progressively worse shortfalls that have been
mentioned. That indicates that rent officers are clearly getting things
consistently
wrong.</div><a name="06110286000166"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.45
am</div><a name="06110286000075"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110286000221"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> My hon. Friend makes an excellent point. The
Under-Secretary will be able to say whether rent officers are getting
things wrong consistently and on a widespread basis, but the issue has
been flagged up in the evaluations of the pilots. Much good has come
from those pilots. The point bears specifically on the amendment and on
the plight of the under-25s.</div>
<a name="06110286000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon. Friend the Member for
Weston-super-Mare (John Penrose) and I are drawing attention to a
particularly important point. The issue is not just one relating to
benefits; it is a housing supply issue too. We all know about the
limits of government, and the issue is not one that any Government of
whatever political persuasion can tackle by waving a magic wand.
Nevertheless, I should like the Under-Secretary to explain her
understanding of the policy response to the supply shortage&#151;for
the kind of property with which those subjected to the SRR have to
deal.</div> <a name="06110286000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">The treatment
of claimants who are under 25 is widely argued to be no fairer and just
as inequitable under the pilot schemes as under existing housing
benefit regulations, which cause great difficulty for that age group.
The LHA rates in most pilot areas are 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column419" />Column number: 420</div>believed to be fair, across the piece. In general, it appears that
objections to the rates that have been set are not widespread, but the
rates for shared rooms&#151;which apply to under-25s&#151;are an
exception. That is a very large
&#147;but.&#148;</div><a name="06110286000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
questions that I have raised are not about the principles so much as
about the mechanics. Will the Under-Secretary say what discussions her
Department has had on the supply side with the Secretary of State for
Communities and Local Government? Parenthetically, I should like to
endorse the points made by the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn,
Badenoch and Strathspey (Danny Alexander), and by Shelter, Crisis, and
many others about the particular position of pregnant women in relation
to single room rate.</div>
<a name="06110286000079"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06110286000222"></a><b class="B">Alison
Seabeck</b> (Plymouth, Devonport) (Lab): Single room rate has
been a cause for concern ever since it was introduced in 1996, and
those of us who have been involved in the housing world behind the
scenes at Westminster have felt that there are issues about it.
Abolition may be one
solution.</div><a name="06110286000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
should like to put the amendment into context. The rationale given by
successive Governments was that the measure encourages young people on
benefit to follow the example of those who are in work. Figures have
suggested that 60 per cent. of under-25s share accommodation in the
private sector, and it was therefore thought reasonable to expect
benefit claimants to do the same. As well as anticipated savings in
Government expenditure, there would be an incentive to people on
benefit to look towards obtaining work.</div>
<a name="06110286000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">The measure introduced in 1996,
which many of my hon. Friends thought was flawed, was changed pretty
quickly after the Labour party came to power in 1997. It was tweaked,
making it a little fairer, but still the restriction affecting
under-25s remained. Under continuing pressure from groups such as
Shelter and Crisis, the Government undertook reviews of the single room
rent, none of which came down firmly on the side of abolition. None the
less, they expressed concern and were in part critical of the current
arrangements, which we are now considering as we debate the
amendment.</div> <a name="06110286000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
research report No. 243 by the Department for Work and Pensions,
entitled &#147;Research into the Single Room Rent
regulations&#148;, concluded that the SRR had not been effective in
encouraging claimants into shared accommodation. That, in part, is why
I am tempted to speak to the amendment, and to probe the
Under-Secretary a little further. The report showed that the number
moving into such accommodation fell. If the aim was to encourage those
on benefit to share, as those in work appear to be willing to do, the
approach has not been a huge success.</div>
<a name="06110286000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is evidence to suggest
that those who are in work and who choose to move into shared
accommodation often do so because they are moving in with friends. That
is not a luxury often afforded to someone on benefit, who may not have
such extended choices, and therefore it is not an encouragement to move
into shared accommodation. The report also acknowledges that, because
of the slightly more generous SRR post-2001, a small number of housing
benefit claimants opted for self-contained properties. However, on the
whole that option is not open to them. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column420" />Column number: 421</div></div><a name="06110286000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">Perhaps I may touch
here on the point made by the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds
(Mr. Ruffley), when he mentioned the concerns of the
Associationof Residential Letting Agents about landlords and
houses in multiple occupation, and the additional burdens that are
being faced. ARLA is a highly reputable organisation and has been very
constructive in supplying evidence to the Committee. However,
Iam not entirely sure that the hon. Gentleman seriously means
that regulations on houses in multiple occupation, which bring those
houses to a safe,clean standard, would be inappropriate, given
that most of the people who enter them are in receipt of the
SRR.</div><a name="06110286000085"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110286000223"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> I was quoting a reason why
landlords in commercial business were not expanding their business, and
why the housing stock was not growing. Certainly, as to the point that
the hon. Lady was more than hinting at, we do not want Rachmanism or
poor-quality housing. I was merely suggesting a possible reason for a
shortage of appropriate property; but I also say that it is for
landlords to get their business model right and to make sure that they
let good property. However, there is a problem and that is part of
it.</div>
<a name="06110286000086"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110286000224"></a>Alison
Seabeck:</b> Given that there is potentially a market for
shared accommodation of the type in question, for people in work or out
of work and on benefit, a better quality product might mean increased
demand; the effect is not necessarily wholly negative.</div>
<a name="06110286000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to return to the point
that the SRR does not have a wholly desirable effect as far as
encouraging young people into work. I recently listened to two young
men who were living at the YMCA because, despite having been keen to
work, and having found jobs, they could not meet the shortfall between
their benefit and their rent, and were evicted from their homes. They
subsequently lost their jobs and got into further difficulty. Both are
now back in work but are still unable to afford a place to live, and
are still at the YMCA. The whole process is deeply unsettling and we
are, indeed, pushing young people into low-level mental health problems
because of the stress that results. That, in turn, makes it more
difficult for them to get access to the labour market. The circle needs
to be broken, and I am not sure that the SRR assists with
that.</div> <a name="06110286000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">In this
context, will the Under-Secretary comment on concerns raised in the
&#147;Care Matters&#148; Green Paper about care leavers&#146;
fears of homelessness? Many young people who come out of care are
likely candidates for SRR; the uncertainty and the shortfall in their
rent are clearly not helpful.</div>
<a name="06110286000089"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06110286000225"></a><b class="B">Natascha
Engel</b> (North-East Derbyshire) (Lab): I asked a
parliamentary question in May about the same issue and the DWP report.
It states that all care leavers and disabled people should be exempt
from the single room rent restrictions. Will my hon. Friend deal with
that issue in her question to the
Under-Secretary?</div><a name="06110286000090"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110286000226"></a>Alison
Seabeck:</b> I should very much like the Under-Secretary to
consider that. It is one of the issues that would lead me, if the
amendment were pushed to a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column421" />Column number: 422</div>vote, not to vote for it. There are several questions to which I should
still like full answers.</div>
<a name="06110286000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">I wish to read out to the
Committee a couple of brief case histories that were published in the
magazine <i class="I">Roof </i>this month, because they highlight the nature of
the problem for young people who are trying to move into work. The
first case touches on the availability of accommodation. A young man
from Newcastle said that only three places were
available</div><a name="06110286000162"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;out of loads
of ads&#148;.</div><a name="06110286000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">He said that
they were asking for &#163;450 a month, but that he could claim only
&#163;180. He was clearly unable to access
accommodation.</div><a name="06110286000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
second case concerns a young women called Tamara who left short-term
accommodation at the YMCA when she got a job. However, she was forced
back after seeing that restrictions on her benefit meant that she could
not survive in the private rented sector. She even spent time, because
she had no accommodation, in a mother and baby unit despite the fact
that she did not have a baby. I am sure that Ministers do not intend
such circumstances to arise.</div>
<a name="06110286000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
continues to be tension within the Government about the view that to do
away with the single room rent or the shared room rate would encourage
young people to live on benefit and not seek employment. Furthermore,
it is felt that those on benefit would seek better accommodation than
those who had found work and that that would result in
unfairness.</div><a name="06110286000095"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110286000227"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> The hon. Lady referred to employment, which, in
part, is the subject of the Bill. Does she agree that young people in
the circumstances that she has described will often find it harder to
find work because employers sometimes require evidence of where a
person lives? If people are moving between accommodation, such details
can be harder to provide. In many cases, the fundamental objective of
welfare reform, which is to get more people off benefit and into work,
is being undermined by the single room
rent.</div><a name="06110286000096"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110286000228"></a>Alison
Seabeck:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes a fair point. The
importance of an address has been raised by organisations that are
involved in housing and homelessness. Some employers know the
whereabouts of shared room accommodation and houses in multiple
occupation and are therefore more reluctant toemploy young
people in those circumstances. I shall come back to those on benefit
who seek better accommodation than those in work, and the resulting
unfairness. The latter argument was put forward frequently in
1996.</div><a name="06110286000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of the other
reasons that has been cited for the ongoing need for the regulations is
that to remove them would lead to abuse. Many organisations involved in
housing and homelessness say that most people on benefit are not
renting homes that are larger or more luxurious than they need. In
fact, the opposite is usually the case. I suspect that most of those
who are eligible for housing benefit, especially young people, are not
looking to manipulate the system in that way, just as the majority of
taxpayers are not seeking to avoid paying
tax.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column422" />Column number: 423</div><a name="06110286000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is difficult to get away from
the evidence that, in the local housing allowance evaluation areas, the
fall in the number of people experiencing a shortfall between their
benefit payments and housing costs is small and that the shortfall
remains stubbornly high with an average gap of about &#163;27 a week.
I must say in fairness that such figures are not those of the DWP, but
of the citizens advice bureaux. Within the evaluation areas, there were
variations in the reduction, too. I welcome the
Under-Secretary&#146;s comments on the reasons for that. Was it down
to the type of advice that was being offered? Was it down to the
response of
landlords?</div><a name="06110286000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have touched on the role of landlords and their becoming increasingly
unwilling to let to those who are claiming single room rent. The supply
issue has been well discussed by the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds.
I accept that such matters genuinely exercise Ministers and I
appreciate that it is unlikely that total abolition will be possible,
but has any work been done in the Under-Secretary&#146;s Department
on the breakdown of the age group of those claiming that particular
benefit? How does the age breakdown relate to whether or not the young
people are in employment? There might be a case, for example, for
lowering the top age end of the benefit. Are young people who are
affected by the regulations more likely to be in the world of work if,
say, they are over the age of
21?</div><a name="06110286000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">If getting young
people into work is one of the key factors in keeping the regulations
in place and if the evidence shows that a significant proportion of
young people over 21 or 22 are in work, perhaps the regulations are
inappropriate and fears about benefit abuse are less founded. I should
be grateful if the Under-Secretary could look into such matters. If the
evidence is not available, perhaps there can be further consideration
in another place of the thorny issues raised by the amendment. I
question whether the age restrictions can be tweaked further to meet
the genuine cost, outside organisations&#146; concerns and the
Government&#146;s concerns about risk of
abuse.</div><a name="06110286000167"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110286000229"></a>John
Penrose:</b> I should like to pick up on some points,
particularly those made by my hon. Friend the Member for Bury St.
Edmunds about the mechanics of the process. We have heard a great deal
about the real hardship caused by the single room rent restriction. It
sounds like we are in a vicious circle. Shortfalls in rent mean that
people cannot find places to live of adequate quality and plenty of
landlords are unwilling to make places available, because they know
that they will not get as much financial return from such rentals as
developing a house for another form of
occupation.</div><a name="06110286000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">Has the
Under-Secretary of State considered, and can she offer some reassurance
on, the financial implications? We have heard a lot about fiscal
continence and the implications of the amendment. What calculation has
the Under-Secretary done to work out what would happen if the new
system started to get it right in terms of rent officer determinations
and the single room rate started to rise in those areas of the country
where there was a supply shortfall? If that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column423" />Column number: 424</div>happened, the supply of places would increase and come on to the market,
more landlords would be creating high-quality houses in multiple
occupation and fewer people would be suffering from the shortfalls that
are the cause of the hardship we are talking
about.</div><a name="06110286000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
assumption that the Under-Secretary has thought long and hard about the
financial implications, I presume that those will have been built into
the Government&#146;s figures and estimates of the cost of the total
package. Will she say what she expects that cost to be? I am sure that
it is not revenue neutral. If rent officers start to get it right and
set a more realistic level in areas of the country where it is
important that they do so, much of the hardship could be sorted out
through the natural operation of the new proposals. Subsequent
amendments on transparency of rent officer determinations may help in
that
regard.</div><a name="06110286000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
the Under-Secretary tells us what the financial implications are, that
may go a great way towards reassuring Committee members that the
majority of the shortfall, and therefore the financial hardship, will
be dealt with, whether or not the amendment is agreed
to.</div><a name="06110286000105"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110286000230"></a>Mr.
Hunt:</b> Will the Under-Secretary clarify
one point about which I am concerned? She will know that one of the
most important sections of &#147;Improving the life chances of
disabled people&#148;, the report by the Prime Minister&#146;s
strategy unit, was about improving transition planning for disabled
people between childhood and adulthood. Such planning is often poor. In
particular, the transition between children&#146;s and adults&#146;
services is not carefully managed. Adults&#146; services often only
find out a few months in advance that they will have to look after X
number of disabled people, and the crucial planning does not
happen.</div><a name="06110286000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given that the
disability agenda is moving strongly and firmly towards independent
living, is the Under-Secretary concerned that the single room rate for
people under 25, as it applies to disabled people or those with limited
capability for work&#151;the subject of earlier
discussions&#151;might make it more difficult for people to get the
independent accommodation that they need if they are to live
independently? If that is so, harking back to our earlier discussions,
disabled people may find it more difficult to get into part-time or
full-time work, which is the next step after being able to live more
independently than they have been able to
previously.</div><a name="06110286000107"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110286000231"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> I am pleased that we have had such a wide-ranging
debate. In a strange way, although I will ask the hon. Member for
Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey to withdraw the amendment, I
welcome that fact that it was tabled because it will allow us to go
through some of the specific concerns that have been raised by
Opposition Members and my hon. Friends. I hope that I can thereby
reassure them about the new shared room rate and the way in which it
will operate.</div><a name="06110286000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">Can I
say at the outset that this is not primarily about tackling abuse in
the system? It is part of a package that is intended to make housing
benefit more transparent and more understandable to people. All of us
who have constituency issues relating to housing 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column424" />Column number: 425</div>benefit will know that in some situations it can appear almost Byzantine
in its operation. So it is part of our simplification process. It is a
simplification not just for the professionals involved, but for the
benefit recipients who find it almost impossible to know in advance
what they will receive in housing benefit or, as we will call it, local
housing allowance for those in the private sector. I hark back to our
short debate on Tuesday evening: the new local housing allowance
applies only to those in the private rented
sector.</div><a name="06110286000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey&#151;I like to
say that at least once a sitting. Those of us who know about the wolf
of Badenoch know why it is important now and again to mention Badenoch.
We might otherwise wake up in the middle of the night with nightmares
about the wolf of Badenoch. For the benefit of those who come from
south of the border, we can explain that little piece of Scottish
history later. [<i class="I">Interruption.</i>] Perhaps it might have been more
appropriate for Hallowe&#146;en rather than 2 November.</div>
<a name="06110286000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me put the whole issue in
context. The hon. Gentleman got the numbers almost exactly right. The
improvement on the single room rent will impact on 12,000 single young
people under the age of 25. That 12,000 is out of some 800,000
recipients. The general concerns are about whether it will impact to
the disadvantage of young people who are in the private rented sector,
so it would be appropriate if I put on record the changes and
improvements that we are making.</div>
<a name="06110286000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">Previously under the single
room rent there had to be shared accommodation. When setting the single
room rent, a rent officer had to take into account that while the
individual had exclusive use of a bedroom, they had shared use of a
living room, a bathroom, a toilet and a kitchen. Our improvements will
mean that, under the new shared room rate, the tenant has the exclusive
use of one bedroom and the shared use of either a kitchen, a bathroom,
a toilet or a living room. There is only one shared element, which I
think is a significant change in the way that we currently
operate.</div><a name="06110286000112"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110286000232"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> The Under-Secretary is quite fairly describing
the changes that the Government are making to the shared room rate and
the access to a shared living room. Would she, on grounds of fairness,
also refer to the research that was commissioned by the DWP itself to
explore the impact of that change? It concluded that
it</div><a name="06110286000163"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;made no appreciable
difference to the supply or quality of accommodation to young claimants
or their ability to access
it&#148;.</div><a name="06110286000113"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110286000233"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> I obviously recognise that piece of DWP research.
Although the hon. Gentleman is perhaps using it in a negative sense, it
answers some of the concerns raised this morning. There has been no
negative impact on the amount of accommodation available to young
people under the new
system.</div><a name="06110286000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall pick
up on a point that my hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Devonport
(Alison Seabeck) made on the impact of the new allowance for single
room rent on working and non-working individuals. I think that that is
an important issue, which is why we have linked it into the Bill. She
mentioned that there could be a disincentive to move into
employment.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column425" />Column number: 426</div><a name="06110286000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall paint
a couple of scenarios&#151;sometimes I think that it is easier to
understand when we imagine what might happen in practice. Currently, if
a young, unemployed person claiming jobseeker&#146;s allowance is
passported on to housing benefit, as a single under-25-year-old, they
would be entitled to a shared room rate, which let us say is &#163;80
a week. If the weekly rent for his room is &#163;70, it would be
covered by his housing benefit. That young person shares with someone
in employment who is earning &#163;250 a week and therefore not
entitled to housing benefit, but who can meet the &#163;70 a week
rent within his or her income.</div>
<a name="06110286000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us imagine that we accepted
the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch
and Strathspey and abolished the shared room rate. Person A would be
entitled to a one-bedroom, self-contained accommodation, which for that
area might cost &#163;100 a week. Those costs would be met through
housing benefit or local housing allowance because it is in the private
sector. However, let us imagine that person B&#151;the flat
sharer&#151;is still employed at &#163;250 a week and has to move
out of the shared accommodation. He still earns too much to be eligible
for housing benefit and so has to find that &#163;100 a week. In that
scenario, the single under-25-year-old in employment would be the only
person disadvantaged. We are trying to strike a balance, not undermine
young people and their ambitions. We want the allowance, linked in with
other elements in the Bill, to ensure that young people have the right
incentives to think about moving into employment.</div>
<a name="06110286000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall deal,
however, with some of the special cases raised by hon. Members. My hon.
Friend the Member for Plymouth, Devonport asked about young people in
care and the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey
and other Opposition Members raised similar issues about those facing
difficulties. I can confirm again for the record the kinds of tenants
who are currently exempt from the single room rent and who will be
exempt from the new allowance: local authority and many housing
association tenants, as we have confirmed already; tenants in supported
accommodation, which might reassure the hon. Member for South-West
Surrey (Mr. Hunt); and customers entitled to the severe
disability
premium.</div><a name="06110286000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">Furthermore,
certain care leavers under the age of 22 will also be exempt. As most
people come out of care between the ages of 16 and 18, they will have
four years to make the necessary adjustments. Even when specific issues
are not dealt with under those categories, local authorities have the
discretionary housing payment scheme that allows them to give
additional financial support when a person&#146;s situation is not
covered by the local housing
allowance.</div><a name="06110286000168"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.15

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110286000234"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> Would that cover ex-offenders, whose need for
decent accommodation is extremely important in their
rehabilitation?</div><a name="06110286000120"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110286000235"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> I do not want to go into categorisations, because
a specific issue would then become general policy. However, I highlight
the fact that a discretionary element is available to local
authorities. The discretionary element is co-funded by 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column426" />Column number: 427</div>local authorities and the Department to ensure that there is a support
blanket in case the local housing allowance does not cover the more
difficult situations. I hope that that allays the concern of the hon.
Member for South-West
Surrey.</div><a name="06110286000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">All hon.
Members who have spoken have said that they are concerned about the
supply of shared accommodation. I confirm that in the pathfinder areas
the supply of shared accommodation has not changed in any
respect.</div><a name="06110286000122"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110286000236"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> The Under-Secretary has made the point for us.
The under-supply is potentially driving up rents, which is leading to
shortfalls for the under-25 target group. The point is not that supply
has stayed the same, but that it is not going
up.</div><a name="06110286000123"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110286000237"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> There are all sorts of reasons why the market
makes adjustments. The concerns that have been raised this morning are
not just about increasing supply. We have had extensive discussions
with the Department for Communities and Local Government, because we
recognise that there is a wider agenda on housing
supply.</div><a name="06110286000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">Hon. Members
are worried that the new approach will depress supply, but that is not
the case. We estimate that the introduction of the median approach to
calculation will ensure that instead of 26 per cent. of shared
accommodation being available under the single rent, about 50 per cent.
of accommodation will qualify for the new
allowance.</div><a name="06110286000125"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110286000238"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> Does the Under-Secretary agree as a matter of
logic that if the supply of SRR standard accommodation goes up,
shortfalls will
decrease?</div><a name="06110286000126"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110286000239"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> I think that I agree with that point, but I am
not sure whether I should, because it came from the hon. Gentleman. I
think that the issue concerns supply and demand. As a historian, my
economics are pretty
shaky.</div><a name="06110286000127"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110286000241"></a>Mrs.

reputation.</div>
<a name="06110286000129"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110286000242"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> The Under-Secretary has once again betrayed her
close understanding of the operation of markets. The position that the
hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds has outlined may be correct in terms
of economics, but can the Minister explain how the proposed change will
lead to a substantial increase in the supply of appropriate
accommodation? Is it a change that has not been made in the pathfinder
areas but that will be made as a result of the roll-out? In other
words, will the policy that has been pursued in the pathfinder areas be
amended? The Shelter research that I quoted refers directly to the
pathfinder areas, where only 26 per cent. of SRR accommodation is
affordable.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column427" />Column number: 428</div><a name="06110286000130"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110286000243"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> We can all bandy around statistics and various
approaches to economics. We are in the presence of the Minister for
Employment and Welfare Reform, who is at pains to tell me that his
views have not radically changed since he was not only a National Union
of Students activist, but its president, who is well remembered from
all those years ago.</div>
<a name="06110286000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">Returning to supply and demand,
we should not say that the housing market is uniform across the whole
country, because it is not. There are different types of markets in my
hon. Friend the Minister&#146;s constituency, my constituency and the
constituency of the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and
Strathspey. There is a danger that we will start to look at the housing
market as a homogenous market in which the levers of supply and demand
work in uniformity. The increase in supply, if I remember my economics
correctly, could mean that rents become lower rather than
higher.</div><a name="06110286000132"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06110286000244"></a><b class="B">Kali
Mountford</b> (Colne Valley) (Lab): I want to ask the
Under-Secretary about the medians that she has referred to and lay down
a marker for the clause stand part debate in which I hope to speak, if
the Chair allows. Is it not right to look at the median as the total
amount of rent payable in an area rather than the median of the rent
decided upon by rent officers, which often excludes the extremes of the
lowest and highest rents and changes the median
point?</div><a name="06110286000133"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110286000245"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> I am glad that my hon. Friend gave me advance
warning of that question. We will return to it in the clause stand part
debate rather than discussing it now, because it is slightly off our
discussion, although it is adjacent to it.</div>
<a name="06110286000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">I appreciate that time is
limited before we have to adjourn, so may I give one or two other
reassurances? On age discrimination, it is a long-standing principle of
the benefit system that different benefits are paid for different
purposes at different times in a person&#146;s life. I have a couple
of other points which I hope will give some comfort, particularly to my
hon. Friends, who I know from their backgrounds and campaigning
activities may still have some
concerns.</div><a name="06110286000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">We will
continue to consider the detailed aspects of the local housing
allowance shared room rate as we look at the final evaluations in the
pathfinder areas and develop the regulations. Having said that, I will
be frank with the Committee that the core principlesfor
retaining the shared room rate&#151;challenging dependency and
encouraging young people to think about their future job
prospects&#151;link in with some other aspects of the welfare reform
Green Paper, which is about supporting people into work.</div>
<a name="06110286000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">Ending on a positive note, I am
delighted to be able to say in response to the refrain of the hon.
Member for Bury St. Edmunds, who asked where have all the young people
gone, that they have gone to jobs, 1 million of them,
everywhere.</div><a name="06110286000137"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110286000246"></a>Danny

response did not reassure me on the grounds of principle or practice.
Her argument seemed 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column428" />Column number: 429</div>to be that things would not get any worse under the new system, but I
