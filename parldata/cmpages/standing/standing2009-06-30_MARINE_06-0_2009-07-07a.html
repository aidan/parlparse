<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070791000345"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural
Affairs (Huw Irranca-Davies):</b> I am glad to return to the
Committee to pick up where we left off this morning on shellfisheries.
It might be helpful at this juncture to pick up on one point raised
about the timeline. A genuine concern was aired about the nature and
extent of the discussion and dialogue. Not many of us had a lot of time
to see the word-by-word detail of the amendments, but the fundamentals
of what is being proposed have been around for some time, and I will
sketch them out
briefly.</div><a name="09070791000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Shellfish Association of Great Britain was working in 2007 on a
memorandum of understanding with the Crown estates that featured most
of the elements now contained in these clauses. The association has had
a lot of opportunity, with my officials and others, to shape the
proposals that have ended up in the Bill. Officials from the Department
for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs have met on numerous occasions
to discuss potential solutions to the Crown estate problem. However, it
was only with the resolution of a court action, which concluded on 14
May, that negotiations could commence in earnest and in detail with
interested parties, in particular the Crown and the shellfish industry.
After that point, we could move from the entrenched positions that had
had to be adopted while the court case
proceeded.</div><a name="09070791000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
solutions proposed in the Bill&#151;I shall turn to them in a moment,
as I want to explain in detail how the package works&#151;aim to put
the relationship between the shellfish industry and landowners on a
more commercial footing that is based on agreements, with mechanisms
for developments to take place, but with compensation and the removal
of consent, which everybody has wanted. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column194" />Column number: 194</div>Those proposals all come from the industry. If the Committee will bear
with me, I will sketch exactly how the process will work in
practice.</div><a name="09070791000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">Government
amendments 56, 57 and 62 will amend the Sea Fisheries (Shellfish) Act
1967 to remove the need for consent of the Crown estate or the duchies
to be given before an order affecting any part of the sea shore on
their land can be granted. Removing that requirement will give the
Secretary of State the power to grant shellfish orders without Crown
consent, removing a potential obstacle to granting new orders. Such a
measure is sought by all parties, and I hope that it will be welcomed
by all parties.</div>
<a name="09070791000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">The removal
of that procedure, which all parties consider to be outdated, will thus
allow us to overcome the current impasse, in which a number of several
and regulating orders are not being given. At the moment,
shellfisheries cannot obtain certainty for long-term investment,
despite the best efforts and good will of all parties. The amendments
will allow us to overcome the impasse and start granting new several
and regulating orders. Both the Crown estate and the shellfish industry
support the
proposal.</div><a name="09070791000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
the amendments all link together and come as a package, I will turn to
amendment 58, which requires the appropriate Minister, when considering
an application for a several and regulating order, to have regard to
the powers and duties of the Crown Estate Commissioners. That is
important because those powers and duties come from the Crown Estate
Act 1961. The Sea Fisheries (Shellfish) Act 1967 already contains a
statutory duty to consult the commissioners as land owners when
considering an application for an order that will affect Crown
land.</div>
<a name="09070791000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
important that we recognise that the Crown Estate Commissioners have
specific powers and duties that require them to act in a particular
way. I must make it clear that the amendment does not grant the
commissioners any extra powers, nor does it give them anything with
regard to shellfish orders that they do not currently have. Having
regard to the Crown estate&#146;s powers and duties simply means that
we must take account of them when arriving at a decision on whether to
grant an order. We are not bound to accept any objection that they
raise, just as we are not bound to accept any objection from any other
landowner. The commissioners are constrained in what they can do with
regard to the Crown estate in a way that other landowners are not. Our
proposal merely acknowledges that
difference.</div><a name="09070791000034"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09070791000346"></a><b class="B">Mr.
David Jones</b> (Clwyd, West) (Con): Before I put my question,
I declare an interest: by an extraordinary coincidence, the legal firm
of which I am a director represents one of the parties in the Menai
strait action to which the Minister referred. I understand the thrust
of his proposed solution to this difficulty, but the amendment states
that Ministers
should</div><a name="09070791000284"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;have
regard to the powers and
duties&#148;.</div><a name="09070791000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will
he expand on that? To which powers and duties should they have regard,
and how will they have regard to them? What will they do when they have
regard to
them?</div><a name="09070791000036"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070791000347"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> I shall return to that very pertinent
question in a moment, but first I want to flesh out the other parts of
the proposal.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column195" />Column number: 195</div><a name="09070791000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 5
will insert powers to vary shellfish orders, which is important because
it acknowledges the fact that landowners cannot always foresee what
development opportunities might arise over the lifetime of an order,
which is potentially 60 years. The new clause will allow an order to be
varied when landowners, including the duchies and the Crown estate,
want to develop land on which an order is in place and when that
development would make it impossible, or impracticable, to exercise the
right conferred on the fishery. The power to vary an order reflects our
desire to put the relationship between the grantee and the landowner on
a more commercial footing, with the use of commercial contracts or
memorandums of understanding clearly to define the relationship and the
system for dealing with future developments. In earlier discussions
with the Government, both the Shellfish Association of Great Britain
and the Crown estate supported such a
measure.</div><a name="09070791000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
69 sets out the issues to which the licensing authority must have
regard in determining applications for marine licences. Under
subsection 1(c), those issues
include</div><a name="09070791000285"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
need to prevent interference with legitimate uses of the
sea&#148;,</div><a name="09070791000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">which
in turn include fishing and shellfisheries. Thus the licensing
authority is well able to have regard to fisheries&#146; interests
and to reach a balanced view on the merits of an application.</div>
<a name="09070791000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">We do not
intend to interfere with this marine planning process by insisting that
fishing interests should automatically override all other needs or uses
of the sea. If the order is varied, the landowner could be liable to
pay compensation to the grantee of a several order for the loss of
part, or all, of the order. It will be open for the grantees and
landowners to agree a level of compensation, either when the order is
varied or right from the outset. We believe that the ability to
consider such outcomes at the outset of the making of an order will
help to put the relationship between the two parties on a much more
commercial footing. It will also make the agreements more transparent.
That idea was previously supported by the shellfish industry as well as
the Crown estate. The new clause will provide certainty to grantees of
shellfish orders and landowners and signal a new relationship allowing
the industry to develop and move
forward.</div><a name="09070791000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Clwyd, West asked about Crown powers. Those powers will
be as set out in the Crown Estates Act, section 1(3) of which states
that the commissioners will have a duty &#147;to maintain and
enhance&#148; the value of the estate</div>
<a name="09070791000286"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;but with due
regard to...good
management.&#148;</div><a name="09070791000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
letter from DEFRA to the Shellfish Association of Great Britain dated
26 June
stated:</div><a name="09070791000287"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Having
regard to the CE&#146;s powers and duties simply means that we must
take account of them in arriving at a decision as to whether to grant
an Order. It does not mean that if the CE object to the creation of an
Order that we are bound to accept their objection as valid and reject
any applications to grant an Order in these circumstances. But it would
be open to the CE to challenge the SoS as to how their view has been
taken account of in our decision making
process.&#148;</div><a name="09070791000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is important that I read this next part into the
record:</div><a name="09070791000288"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Similarly,
we would be bound to explain to any consultee how their view has been
taken account of in our decision making processes; the difference is
that the CE have explicit statutory  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column196" />Column number: 196</div>powers and duties and our proposal reflects that point. If as you hinted
you have legal or other advice which contradicts this view, I would be
grateful if you could share it or summarise it&#148;.</div>
<a name="09070791000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">We concur
with that
view.</div><a name="09070791000045"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09070791000348"></a><b class="B">Andrew
George</b> (St. Ives) (LD): So that I can better understand
the background, I would be grateful if the Minister could clarify that
the Crown estate is answerable to the Treasury and to Parliament and
that, under the 1961 Act, one of its primary objectives is to produce a
surplus for the Treasury. Does that not create a potential conflict
between two separate Government Departments, one of which is there to
create financial surpluses for the Government, while the other surely
seeks to maintain the responsible management of the marine resource?
There is a clear conflict between two Government Departments, and I do
not understand how the Minister&#146;s proposals are going to resolve
it.</div><a name="09070791000046"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070791000349"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> As I pointed out, the amendments have been
subject to long discussions. They have been supported by the Shellfish
Association of Great Britain and the Crown estate, and they resolve
that situation. There will always be a question of the need to resolve
different interests across Whitehall. There needs to be close dialogue,
whether one is thinking of the Infrastructure Planning Commission,
marine planning or most aspects of Government.</div>
<a name="09070791000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
might be worth explaining how the Crown estate works. As the hon.
Gentleman rightly points out, the Crown estate manages Crown land on
behalf of the Government, and the surplus revenue goes to the Treasury.
In return, the monarch receives a fixed annual payment&#151;the civil
list. The Crown estate is responsible to Parliament, but is run
independently of the Government by a board of appointees. Let me give a
brief history lesson of why we have got to where we are today. In 1955,
a Government committee under the chairmanship of Sir Malcolm Trustram
Eve recommended that to avoid confusion between Government property and
Crown land, the latter should be
renamed&#151;<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> I am sorry,
Mr. Gale, I have been slightly distracted by the hon. Member
for Broxbourne bringing what seems to be a weapon into the
Committee.</div>
<a name="09070791000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
avoid the confusion between Government property and the Crown, the
latter was to be renamed the Crown estate and managed by an independent
board. Those recommendations were implemented by the Crown Estate Acts
1956 and 1961. Under the 1961 Act, the estate is managed by a board,
which has a duty to maintain and enhance the value of the estate and
the return obtained from it, but with due regard, as I pointed out
earlier, to the requirements of good management. The Crown estate must
report to Parliament once a year, providing accounts and information
about Crown estate activities for the year, including future
activities.</div>
<a name="09070791000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
England and Wales, the legal presumption is that the sea bed and the
foreshore are owned by the Crown, and that presumption extends to the
bed of all tidal rivers and to all islands in tidal rivers and coastal
waters. The presumption also applies in the absence of any evidence of
a grant by the Crown to any private individual. It is estimated that
the Crown estate owns about 50 per cent. of the UK
foreshore.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column197" />Column number: 197</div><a name="09070791000316"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.15
pm</div><a name="09070791000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
cannot use the Marine and Coastal Access Bill to ride roughshod over
the Crown estate&#146;s rights as set out in the Crown Estate Acts.
To say that shellfisheries, for example, are more important than the
Crown estate&#146;s duty is not an argument that would make the
running, and it would be very hard to get cross-Government agreement to
amend either the Crown Estate Acts or this Bill in a way that would
limit its rights.</div>
<a name="09070791000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">Does the
group of amendments deliver emphatically what everybody wants? The
amendments contain the fundamentals of the discussions that have gone
on for a long time to resolve problems, especially those between the
Shellfish Association of Great Britain and the Crown estate. We have
taken the fundamental areas of agreement in principle with those
parties and incorporated them into five amendments that work
together&#151;not separately. As was debated to some extent in the
other place, by considering the amendments today as a
package&#151;not one by one&#151;we have a golden opportunity to
have several and regulating orders back up and running, to give
certainty to the shellfisheries industry, to recognise the rightful
regard that we must also have to the Crown estate, to recognise
variance where it is needed in long contracts, and to recognise that in
some situations there might also be a need for
compensation.</div><a name="09070791000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments do all those things, and although I appreciate that their
details have not been seen for long by many people, their fundamentals
have been discussed ad nauseam in meetings with my officials, with me,
and with many other people, including representatives of the Shellfish
Association of Great Britain and the Crown estate. There is good will
to make this happen, and I urge Committee members to take the
opportunity.</div><a name="09070791000053"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070791000350"></a>Andrew
George:</b> My point is about something that might be a detail
within the Government amendments. The Minister refers to the role of
the Duchy of Cornwall and the Duchy of Lancaster. Their interest, as I
understand it, applies only to the foreshore. In Cornwall and the Isles
of Scilly, the foreshore is owned by the Duchy of Cornwall separately
from the Crown&#151;I do not know which bits are owned by the Duchy
of Lancaster. Therefore, presumably all that the Minister has just
explained in relation to the Crown estate cannot apply in the same way
to the duchies, and certainly not to the Duchy of Cornwall, which is
not as answerable to Parliament and does not operate with the intention
of producing a surplus for the Treasury. It is, in that sense, a
different operation to the one that the IFCAs and the MMO will be
negotiating.</div><a name="09070791000054"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070791000351"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> Although the duchies perform much the same
function as the Crown estate, and their land is affected by the
creation of a shellfish order, it is not possible to express their
rights clearly in primary legislation. I am assured that even though
the duchies do not have an Act of their own that sets out their duties,
as the Crown estate does, the amendments apply equally to them and the
Crown estate. Therefore, the measure would equally apply to the duchies
and to shellfisheries on those estates, and that has to be good
news.</div><a name="09070791000055"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09070791000352"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Richard Benyon</b> (Newbury) (Con): There is a perception that
the Minister has bowled us a fast ball. I am grateful to him and his
officials for providing me 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column198" />Column number: 198</div>with background information, which I received relatively recently, and I
have been endeavouring to understand what we are trying to achieve. The
Minister makes a laudable effort to resolve a long-standing problem.
However, strong concerns remain among shellfish fishermen and owners of
shellfish rights around UK waters. We need to put their concerns on
record, and the Minister needs to address them and, if it is his
belief, point out that their perceptions are
unfounded.</div><a name="09070791000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those
involved in the Menai strait case have made an impassioned plea that
the matter not be dealt with at this stage, because they believe that
that would &#147;undermine the foundations&#148; of their business.
They believe that such an approach would be a laudable attempt to deal
with the disease, but that doing so would kill the patient. We need a
careful explanation of what the Minister is seeking by trying to solve
the impasse between the Crown Estate Commissioners and DEFRA.</div>
<a name="09070791000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some involved
have for years defended their businesses against the proposals to build
a marina within the Menai strait fishery. The proposal, in their view,
would have crippled the UK&#146;s biggest mussel-producing area,
which produces &#163;5 million of mussels a year. They have just
celebrated a Court of Appeal ruling, but now feel that it is being
reversed by the Minister at the eleventh hour. I hear what the Minister
says about the length of time that he has been in negotiations, but the
Bill has seemingly been going through Parliament for an interminable
time, and it is strange that we have reached this clause and are keen
to tackle other elements of the Bill, but we are suddenly faced with
Government amendments that are causing great
concern.</div><a name="09070791000058"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070791000353"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes a good point. It
is worth reflecting on the fact that we originally did not conceive of
addressing the matter in the Bill. However, in the other place,
Baroness Wilcox and Baroness Miller identified a valid concern that we
in the Department and others had been wrestling with for some time and
wanted the opportunity to address. Such opportunities are rare, and now
we have one, even though it was not originally conceived that we could
do anything about the matter in the Bill. The hon. Gentleman is right
that this is the eleventh hour, but the other 10 hours and
59 minutes have been spent in some very detailed
discussions.</div><a name="09070791000059"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070791000354"></a>Mr.
Benyon:</b> I know that the Minister has consulted Baroness
Wilcox among others. I confess that I have not, but I must do so before
long because she has a great understanding of the matter. She might be
broadly happy with what the Minister is doing, and she speaks for a
sizeable group of people in the industry, but others are concerned. It
has been put to us that if</div>
<a name="09070791000289"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the Committee
makes the amendments, it will be paving the way for the
destruction&#148;</div><a name="09070791000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">of
legitimate businesses,</div>
<a name="09070791000290"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;hastening the
demise of a sustainable marine cultivation industry worth &#163;22M a
year to the UK
economy.&#148;</div><a name="09070791000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
should like to talk about the concerns of the Shellfish Association of
Great Britain.</div>
<a name="09070791000062"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070791000355"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> I just want to make it clear to the hon.
Gentleman and the Committee that I have not spoken recently to either
Baroness. As far as I know, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column199" />Column number: 199</div>they are as exercised about the measure as some in the Shellfish
Association of Great Britain, as some in the association want the
measures.</div>
<a name="09070791000063"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070791000356"></a>Mr.
Benyon:</b> I am sure that that is the case. The more I get
involved in coastal Britain, the more I know that one can never give an
authentic voice for any particular industry, only for aspects of
it.</div>
<a name="09070791000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Shellfish
Association is keen to put across the fact that the Government did not
inform the industry&#146;s national trade association of the wording
of the proposed amendments until after the Committee had begun. It
strongly believes that the proposed amendments to the Sea Fisheries
(Shellfish) Act 1967 will severely undermine the legal protection that
it and its successor provide to shellfish farmers, which they have done
for a great length of time.</div>
<a name="09070791000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
association would like the Minister to address three things: the
criteria for any consideration by Ministers, the scope for any
compensation payments, and the need for greater consultation. In the
short time that I have had the information from the association, I have
not been able to assess the amendments that it would propose or to put
them to the Minister. I am asking for breathing space and for us to
return to the matter on Report. He and I can work together
constructively to ensure that the problem is solved quickly. However,
at this stage, with the main industry body having very serious
concerns, it would be wrong to make the
amendments.</div>
<a name="09070791000066"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070791000357"></a>Andrew
George:</b> I rise to support the hon. Gentleman and his plea
for the Minister to give the issue a further rethink. It was as a
result of my coming into possession of the Government amendments at the
weekend and, shortly thereafter, learning of the complaints and strong
expressions of concern from the Shellfish Association of Great Britain,
that I tabled a measure relating to the Government&#146;s proposals,
which of course could not be selected because of the time factor. That
further underscores the difficulty of our eleventh-hour
debate.</div>
<a name="09070791000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">I appreciate
the pressures under which the Department has been operating, and I do
not doubt that there have been lengthy and complex negotiations. Like
the hon. Member for Newbury, I find that trying to get my head around
the confluence of different legislation about the Crown estate and
shell fisheries, as well as trying to bolt that on to the Bill, is a
significant challenge. I appreciate the Minister&#146;s argument
about the industry not necessarily having one concerted and harmonious
voice on this or any other issue&#151;such a claim is a matter for
debate and can perhaps be tested outside the Committee&#151;but I
believe that we are being asked to consider the issue rather
quickly.</div>
<a name="09070791000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">The industry
has seen the Minister&#146;s amendments and it has proposed
alternatives. The right and proper thing to do is what several members
of the Committee have done so far: table amendments, listen to the
debate and then consider the consequences of rushing things through
when we might have the opportunity to resolve issues on Report. The
honourable course for the Minister in such circumstances is to accept
that although important progress has been made in recent weeks, it is
not sufficient to make me comfortable with the Government&#146;s
present position. I would support the Minister more if he were to
reflect on the concerns that have been expressed, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column200" />Column number: 200</div>withdraw the amendments and return with well worked-up amendments on
Report, following further negotiations with the
industry.</div>
<a name="09070791000069"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070791000358"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> We have had a useful discussion. My hon.
Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland and I have probably
shown ourselves to be willing to listen to and engage with the
Committee, as well as to adjust, when necessary, and reflect on what
has been said.</div>
<a name="09070791000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me
address the impasse and the challenge of getting any agreement between
the parties that had been to the High Court on the matter of
shellfisheries. We were able to engage with them properly only after
14 May, when the action concluded. However, prior and
subsequent to that, we have been fully engaged on a way forward. I can
honestly say that if we were to take time to reflect over the summer
and return on Report, the amendments before hon. Members would be no
different. The detail is fresh to many of us, including me, but the
amendments have come to fruition over a long time, and the fundamentals
of this issue will not vary over the
summer.</div><a name="09070791000317"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.30
pm</div><a name="09070791000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will tell the Committee, quite honestly, what my concern is. Despite
the fact that, as I have said, we are usually quite sympathetic to the
idea of going away and reflecting on matters, my concern is that we
will get to the end of the summer and one or other of the parties will
walk away from the position where we are now. We have taken this long
to get to a point where we have something that is broadly acceptable,
even if some people are completely up in arms about it&#151;we have
to acknowledge that.</div>
<a name="09070791000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
there are sections of the shellfish industry that currently do not have
several and regulating orders. There are companies now that are
struggling to make business and to take commercial decisions; there are
companies that are faced with taking decisions about whether or not to
continue investing in shellfisheries.</div>
<a name="09070791000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me turn
directly to two of the points that were raised about the Menai strait
case. <i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> I will just deal with those
points and then I will come back to other points, because I have a
little more detail to flesh out here.</div>
<a name="09070791000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">In respect of
the Menai strait, which is where this proposal effectively came to
fruition from, a question has been asked. If these amendments were
accepted, would the marina on the Menai strait have been built? Could
that have gone ahead? It is true that there is a chance that the marina
would have been built, but I must say that it is far from certain.
First, the developers would have had to apply for permission relating
to the development under the new regime that is set out in the Bill, to
request that the order be varied, and it is unclear whether that
permission would have been granted. If the developers received
permission, Welsh Ministers would still have to consider the request to
vary the order. What is clear, however, is that the new variation
process would have provided the grantees of the Menai strait order with
a means of obtaining adequate compensation and the opportunity to vary
the order, potentially to provide them with a new area to cultivate
shellfish in. So I understand the concerns about the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column201" />Column number: 201</div>Menai strait, but I want to make it clear that we are not talking only
about the Menai strait. We are talking about a very important, highly
sustainable UK industry, which at the moment has no certainty to
invest.</div>
<a name="09070791000075"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070791000359"></a>Mr.
Benyon:</b> I entirely accept what the Minister says. However,
the fact remains that, given that the industry has these very serious
concerns, even if we were to approve these amendments today in
Committee, that would not speed up the ability of shellfisheries
elsewhere in the country to get those several rights. That will happen
at Royal Assent. Consequently, we can sort this matter out on Report,
everybody can feel that they have been consulted and unless I am
missing something&#151;I admit that I am relatively a new boy to this
House&#151;it can be resolved in exactly the same time scale as it
would be if we accepted these amendments
today.</div>
<a name="09070791000076"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070791000360"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> Let me return to that issue in a moment,
because there is a job to be done on working with the industry, the
Crown estate and others who are potentially affected by this change;
that is the job that needs to be done. Having said that, I maintain my
position that what we have in front of us here are well crafted
amendments that will do the job that many people have been asking us to
do so for so long.</div>
<a name="09070791000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will come
back in a moment to how I think we should take that matter forward.
Before I do so, let me address one of the other issues that was raised
by the hon. Gentleman, about how compensation would be worked out. We
see two possible ways in which compensation can be worked out. First,
in commercial agreements between the landowner and the grantee of an
order, the variation order can refer back to those agreements, which
will either set the amount of compensation or how it is to be
determined. Secondly, when considering a variation the Secretary of
State can appoint an independent inspector to assess the appropriate
level of compensation. That process would look at the value of
shellfish that are landed and at any moneys paid to the grantee for the
right to fish on the landowner&#146;s land.</div>
<a name="09070791000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to
address the crux of the matter and the potential way forward. I
recognise that our amendments are detailed and, moreover, that they
have caused some concern; I also must say that they have gained some
support out there from parts of the shellfish industry and others. In
fact, we are pleased to note that we have the acceptance of the clauses
by the Crown estate and the duchies, and a potential applicant for a
major order in Morecambe bay supports these amendments. We note that
the recent briefing note from the Shellfish Association of Great
Britain to the Committee focuses on the technical detail of the
amendment and states that while accepting the thrust and aim of the
proposed amendment and that it does serve as an effective mechanism to
break the current logjam, it is suggested that the following amendments
be made to the
amendment.</div><a name="09070791000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our
amendment is written in such a way as to allow more detailed
discussions about the criteria that Ministers would use before an order
was varied and about how compensation would be calculated. We do not
believe that it would be helpful now to limit those issues in the Bill.
We need to consult and engage with the industry in detail on them. It
is possible that a lot of what is being sought and what the hon. Member
for Newbury raised 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column202" />Column number: 202</div>can be achieved. I am more than willing to work with the hon. Gentleman,
as I will work with the Shellfish Association of Great Britain and
others&#151;there are disparate interests within the shellfish
industry&#151;to bring forward the notes and guidance, which we need
to draw up in full consultation with the industry, the Crown estates
and the duchies. We have the summer to get on with it.</div>
<a name="09070791000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">In consulting
with the industry, we will also ensure that individual grantees of
orders, in addition to the Shellfish Association of Great Britain, are
allowed the opportunity to comment and provide input. I am more than
happy to get on and continue that dialogue to flesh out with hon.
Members how this will work, to identify where we can improve the
operation of the new processes for varying orders and to bring forward
the notes and guidance. That is what we need to get on with in the
summer, because ever since I have been in this Department this issue
has been a roadblock to investment in shellfisheries. We now have in
front of us&#151;here, now, today&#151;a way forward. Over the
summer, we can engage in constructive dialogue, which I invite hon.
Members to get involved in, to flesh out where we
are.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070791000361"></a>Andrew
George:</b> The Minister&#146;s arguments are becoming
inconsistent. Earlier he told us that by making a decision here today
and not waiting for Report to make the amendments, the industry could
make commercial and investment decisions over the summer that would not
be possible if we waited and withdrew the current amendments. Now he is
saying that it will take all summer to negotiate a lot of the other
conditions attached to the orders that back up the amendments. Surely
these things can be negotiated simultaneously over the summer. Given
the clear concern in the industry at present, surely the Minister must
accept that his argument about making commercial and investment
decisions over the summer does not stand. We can come back and consider
everything together in a co-ordinated fashion on
Report.</div>
<a name="09070791000082"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070791000362"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman for that
intervention, but he might have misunderstood me, which might be my
fault. We have the opportunity to send a clear signal based on the long
and arduous discussions that we have had over quite some time. Over the
summer, we should get on with fleshing out the detail of how we put the
process into practice, not looking at revisiting amendments. Frankly,
what is in front of us is based on the principles that many of those
involved have been calling for. This is a very good set of amendments.
We can delay and see if we can come back with something else, but I say
to the hon. Gentleman seriously, if we substantially alter the
amendments, one or other grouping will walk away from the table. I
appreciate the lateness of seeing the detail, but the amendments are on
areas where there has been consistent agreement on what needs to be
done. We have the opportunity to signal today that we are now minded to
deliver on this issue and to get on with the notes and
guidance.</div>
<a name="09070791000083"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070791000363"></a>Mr.
Benyon:</b> While I respect the Minister&#146;s desire to
proceed, I still have not got an answer on the time scale and why it is
different. If he can give an assurance that the industry&#146;s
concerns will be listened to this summer, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column203" />Column number: 203</div>and that, if those concerns are valid, he will introduce amendments on
Report, I will go quietly. I do not think that this is a good way of
doing business. There has been fantastic consultation on the Bill with
a range of organisations, none of which will be entirely happy, but
most of which will be content. The issue under discussion is an
exception, because a key coastal industry feels left out. If the
Minister gives an assurance that, if the amendments are made, a proper
consultation will take place, and that valid concerns that can be
accommodated on Report will be listened to, I will go along with
him.</div><a name="09070791000084"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070791000364"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> That is a good suggestion. The whole
thrust of the Committee has been to listen solidly to opinions. I can
honestly say that the provisions, even if they are analysed over the
summer, will be shown to be right. I hear what the hon. Members for
Newbury and for St. Ives have said; we need to discuss how we will
implement the provisions with the industry. I do not think that we will
get a set of amendments that will satisfy everybody&#151;that is the
history of the issue&#151;but if, during the summer, the amendments
are suddenly shown to be defective, I will not close my mind to
revisiting them. However, I am 99.99 per cent. certain that they are
right.</div><a name="09070791000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
all need to engage with the industry and implement the solution to the
impasse that is on offer. We will then consult properly over the
summer. I hope that the hon. Member for Newbury will engage with that
and recognise that we are balancing the issues of a highly viable
future for shellfisheries&#151;although, without the several and
regulating orders, their future is terribly uncertain at the
moment&#151;with the absolute necessity to have due regard to the
Crown Estates and their powers.</div>

Salter</b> (Reading, West) (Lab): Very good chairing,
Mr. Gale, and frighteningly quick. Clause 221 amends section
212 of the Water Resources Act 1991. I have been persuaded not to table
an amendment to the clause. I am not having second thoughts, but I am
slightly queasy having looked at the issue again. Section
212 of the 1991 Act gives fishery owners who are affected by certain
byelaw changes the right to claim compensation. That is clearly
outdated. Sea fishermen have no right to claim compensation if a
decision on quotas is made for sound conservation reasons. Why on earth
should owners of inland fisheries, such as a put-and-take rainbow trout
fishery in which the hon. Member for Broxbourne might recreate with his
fishing rod, be able to claim compensation if such a decision is made
by the Environment Agency or other competent body for good scientific,
environmental or ecological reasons?</div>
<a name="09070791000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
221(2), which amends the Water Resources Act 1991,
states:</div><a name="09070791000291"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
subsection (1), for the words from &#145;the claim&#146; to the end

I would rather delete the subsection altogether. The Joint Committee
considered evidence that led us to conclude that there are times when
the Environment Agency is nervous about making the right byelaws, or
taking the right decision for fisheries and the environment, because of
the threat of compensation. What I want to know from the Minister is
exactly how the phrase &#147;as it considers appropriate&#148; will
be interpreted. If &#147;appropriate&#148; means a big fat zero,
that is very appropriate from where I stand, as there needs to be a
level playing field. If the word &#147;appropriate&#148; is going
to continue to raise doubts in the minds of officials, particularly in
the EA&#151;I have praised them this morning, but they can be
risk-averse at times&#151;and if it will hinder them from taking
decisions that will benefit the environment, I remain
concerned.</div><a name="09070791000318"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.45
pm</div><a name="09070791000096"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09070791000366"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Charles Walker</b> (Broxbourne) (Con): The hon. Gentleman will
recall the spring salmon conservation measures that the EA introduced
to protect scarce spring runs on many rivers in England and Wales. A
number of fishery owners and fishermen were very nervous about those
conservation measures, but by and large the measures have been hugely
successful. They have started to increase spring salmon runs, and they
have started to ingrain the culture of catch and release among game
fishermen. That started with spring salmon, but has extended throughout
autumn and summer
runs.</div><a name="09070791000097"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070791000367"></a>Martin
Salter:</b> The hon. Gentleman strengthens the point. Indeed,
my next address to the nation, in a moment, will be on precisely those
issues&#151;fish steps, catch and release, and the new byelaw-making
powers that we propose to grant to the EA. There is no doubt 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column205" />Column number: 205</div>that the conservation measure he mentions was successful, and he is
right to say that we have ingrained into game fishing&#151;game
fishermen have been a little slow on the uptake regarding the benefits
of catch and release&#151;sensible conservation
measures.</div>
<a name="09070791000098"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070791000368"></a>Mr.
Walker:</b> One of the original responses from such fishermen
was, &#147;Well, if I can&#146;t keep the salmon I catch,
I&#146;m not going to bother going fishing for them,&#148; and many
fishery owners were concerned that they would lose revenue, but that
threat never materialised. Indeed, more fishermen are now pursuing
spring salmon, because there are a few more of them
around.</div><a name="09070791000099"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070791000369"></a>Martin
Salter:</b> The hon. Gentleman will know that we are anglers,
not fishmongers. Frankly, given the cost of salmon fishing, most of the
people who can afford to do it can afford to go to Waitrose or
somewhere else for their fish. The argument that we fish only for the
pot belongs in a bygone age.</div>
<a name="09070791000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">To conclude,
I should like some assurance from the Minister regarding what exactly
is meant by the phrases in subsection (2). Does he share my concern
that one interpretation of that wording could continue to make some
agencies risk-averse when we want people to be bold on behalf of the
environment?</div><a name="09070791000101"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070791000370"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> Yes, I do share those concerns, and I have
given the matter considerable thought. The phrase &#147;as it
considers appropriate&#148; in clause 221(2) takes us to the meat of
this debate. I agree with my hon. Friend that the obligation to pay
compensation to an owner or occupier of any fishery that is injuriously
affected by a fisheries byelaw has at times discouraged the EA from
proposing byelaws that are necessary for the conservation of fish
stocks. Let me give my hon. Friend some assurance by stating quite
clearly that I consider that compensation should not be paid in
circumstances in which the byelaw in question was made for the express

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070791000371"></a>Martin
Salter:</b> I want to flag up an issue of huge concern to
recreational anglers, and certainly coarse anglers, who form the vast
majority of those who fish for pleasure, rather than for a living: the
outmoded and arcane system of byelaws currently in place in this
country. Those byelaws are probably not legally enforceable when it
comes to the taking of fish. It is perfectly 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column206" />Column number: 206</div>possible for someone to go fishing in the Thames area under a regime
that allows two fish of certain species to be taken, provided that they
are over a particular size, and then to cross the road into the Anglian
region, where totally different byelaws are in place.</div>
<a name="09070791000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
impossible for those of us who have fished all our lives to know
whether we are on the right side of a regime boundary and what its
particular byelaws are. It is totally impossible for eastern Europeans,
many of whom are keen fishermen, to understand those byelaws and know
where they apply. The Poles are particularly keen recreational anglers
and help boost the number of people who go fishing in this country, but
sadly they have a culture of taking fish for the pot, which has caused
problems in my constituency and in the constituency of the hon. Member
for Newbury. I can understand that, because in their culture the
Christmas delicacy is carp, Britain&#146;s single most popular
fish.</div>
<a name="09070791000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">Carp is worth
millions to the economy because of the livelihoods it sustains in the
fishing tackle industry and the fisheries, and the diversity from which
farmers have been able to generate additional income. It is a hugely
valuable recreational resource, but it is perfectly possible for
someone to fish in the Thames at Reading, Pangbourne or Goring and
catch a prize, 30 lb carp&#151;a fish for which anglers would wait
years in the hope of catching&#151;and barbecue it legally on the
bank. That does not do much for community relations. It is the result
of a clash of cultures, and it is not illegal. As my party
spokesman&#146;s on angling, I am bombarded with letters from anglers
from all over the country asking why we are not going after those
people and prosecuting them, but the practice is legal, because our
byelaws are unenforceable, unintelligible, vary from region to region
and need radical overhaul.</div>
<a name="09070791000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">To touch upon
a point raised by the hon. Member for Broxbourne, we need a
comprehensive system of catch and release. I am pleased to announce
that, in response to lobbying by yours truly and the excellent new
Angling Trust, the governing body for angling, the Environment Agency
has not waited for Parliament to conclude its deliberations on the
Bill: consultation is now running parallel to our deliberations in
Committee. The consultation was launched on 22 June and closes on 14
September. I encourage all of Britain&#146;s 3 million anglers to
participate in that, because it is a radical overhaul of a system that
is, frankly, unworkable and indefensible.</div>
<a name="09070791000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">We also need
to decide who owns fish and to determine which fish swim in public
water. Fish in a river can never be owned by anyone and therefore need
the protection of workable byelaws. Fish in an enclosed pond or lake,
however, are different. I occasionally fish in a lake not far from a
house owned, I believe, by the family of the hon. Member for Newbury,
and those fish belong to the Englefield estate, but the 30 lb carp I
mentioned, if swimming up the Thames, belongs to no one. If I were to
remove a fish from the hon. Gentleman&#146;s lake on the Englefield
estate, he would undoubtedly, if so inclined, call the police, and I
could be prosecuted under the Theft Act 1968, although the schedule of
penalties is low and not a huge disincentive&#151;I would probably
get more money selling carp than I would ever have to pay in
fines.</div>
<a name="09070791000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
may correct me if I am wrong, but I understand that the changes in the
amendments would increase the schedule of fines. The matter can be
resolved, and there is legislation in place, which needs to be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column207" />Column number: 207</div>improved. Until we address the byelaws and until we encourage the
Environment Agency to bring forward a coherent system of regulation, we
will still have the problem of people taking fish for the pot, illegal
movement of fish, and fisheries legislation that makes no sense to the
angler who pays &#163;25 or &#163;26 for their rod
licence.</div><a name="09070791000111"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070791000372"></a>Mr.
Walker:</b> I hear what the hon. Gentleman says and
I support him wholeheartedly. However, he will be aware that a number
of trout streams across England have a tradition of removing a limited
number of fish for the pot. Catch and release is growing, but there are
some streams that are so populated with small trout that there can be a
sustainable take from them. What does he propose to do in those
circumstances?</div><a name="09070791000112"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070791000373"></a>Martin
Salter:</b> That is why a consultation has been launched by
the Environment Agency. That is why it is right and proper that we seek
not to prescribe the matter in the Bill, but to give the Environment
Agency the byelaw-making powers. There is a world of difference between
a river that is primarily a coarse fish river where one would expect
fish to be returned, and a stream where one can generate a sustainable
harvest. There is a world of difference between people stealing fish to
reseed and populate other fisheries in a way that could spread
diseases, particularly KHV&#151;koi herpes virus, which could
decimate carp stocks in the UK if unchecked&#151;and sensible
fisheries management.</div>
<a name="09070791000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
the Environment Agency will use the powers we give it to bring forward
byelaws that will deliver a national catch and release policy with
exceptions. Those exceptions could include the trout stream of the hon.
Member for Newbury, or sensible, well-organised clubs such as Newbury
angling club, or the Reading and district or Thatcham angling
associations&#151;to give the clubs in our constituencies a
plug&#151;which could apply to the relevant Environment Agency
fisheries officer for an exemption. Until we bring in a framework that
is coherent, understandable and enforceable, we will not make sense of
the issue.</div>

Irranca-Davies:</b> This has been another good discussion
about the Bill and what is happening outside it too. My hon. Friend is
right to point out that currently fish theft carries a maximum penalty
of &#163;200 during the day and &#163;1,000 at night, and,
potentially, imprisonment for three months. Clause 222 amends paragraph
2 of schedule 1 of the Theft Act 1968, raising the penalty for
committing the offence of taking or destroying fish to level 5 on the
standard scale&#151;&#163;5,000. Some such fish, not least carp,
change hands on the black fish market for &#163;1,000 a piece and
more.</div><a name="09070791000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
hon. Friend referred to the consultation recently launched by the
Environment Agency. I am pleased that the Angling Trust and others are
fully engaged in the consultation, on how many fish, if any, might be
taken from fisheries and rivers. The byelaws will be drafted based on
the public response to the consultation, using the powers in the Bill.
Those byelaws will deal with fish theft, and the EA has been
constrained to act before the amendments give it the power, once the
Bill has received Royal Assent. I also draw my hon. Friend&#146;s
attention to powers that we have given the EA, under clause 218, to
make byelaws to set maximum size limits on fish that may be removed
from a fishery.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column208" />Column number: 208</div><a name="09070791000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
schedule 16(8) would remove the current exemption for owners of certain
private fisheries to permit anglers to remove freshwater fish during
the close season, as that would undermines any catch and release
byelaws that the agency may introduce to address fish theft. My hon.
Friend&#146;s points are well
made.</div><a name="09070791000117"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070791000375"></a>Martin
Salter:</b> I thank the Minister. I am sure that the Committee
will be grateful to him for addressing a number of issues in subsequent
clauses, which will save me from seeking further stand part debates.
Can I push him on the broader powers of the Environment Agency? He will
be aware that I recently convened a meeting of recreational anglers to
find out what they were looking for in a marine Bill. Concern was
expressed over whether the Environment Agency&#146;s current duty to
improve, develop and maintain fisheries, and enhance the social and
economic contribution of fisheries, would continue. I see no sign that
it will not, but I invite the Minister to put that on the record
because reassurance would be much appreciated by Britain&#146;s 3
million
anglers.</div><a name="09070791000118"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070791000377"></a>Martin
Salter:</b> I beg to move amendment 52, in
schedule 16, page 283, line 22, leave
out &#145;21&#146; and insert
&#145;22&#146;.</div><a name="09070791000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
amendment relates to section 22 of the Salmon and Freshwater Fisheries
Act 1975. The Minister will be aware that I raised the issue briefly on
Second Reading. I noticed a bit of a mismatch between the Bill and that
Act. Basically, section 22 has been left unrepealed, unlike the
provisions relating to proceeds. We have proposed legislation to ban
the sale of rod-caught salmon, as the hon. Member for Broxbourne
pointed out, but missed the opportunity to ensure that the same
provision follows through within the marine Bill. We now have the
chance to put that right.</div>
<a name="09070791000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">The dates
when sale of salmon and trout is prohibited no longer correspond to the
close seasons for those species. We are giving the Environment Agency
complete flexibility to set close seasons through byelaws. That can
only result in confusion on the riverbank. Section 22 is
redundant and should be repealed. I know that that is the opinion of
the Atlantic Salmon Trust, the Salmon and Trout Association and other
fisheries specialists. Therefore, the Minister has the opportunity to
accept this minor and technical amendment to ensure consistency across
the piece.</div>
<a name="09070791000125"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070791000378"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Ann
McKechin):</b> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for raising the
issue, and he makes a strong case for the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column209" />Column number: 209</div>section&#146;s repeal given that one of the key drivers is the repeal
of old and obsolete legislation. However, the amendment does not quite
do the trick, as the repeal of section 22 also needs to be reflected in
part 5(B) of schedule 22 to the Bill. I have also been advised by my
officials that that section of the 1975 Act applies to both England and
Wales, and also to the Scottish side of the border at the River Esk.
Accordingly, as the remit of the Environment Agency covers neither
Wales nor Scotland, it would be appropriate for us to consult with the
devolved Administrations as to how the section would affect their own
domestic legislation.</div>
<a name="09070791000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon.
Friend&#146;s amendment could leave us in a confusing situation in
which it could be unclear whether section 22 is repealed. I am sure
that he will want to avoid that situation. Accordingly, I should like
him to withdraw his amendment on the basis that we will consult, as
appropriate, with the devolved Administrations about the repeal of the
section, and come back to the matter on
Report.</div><a name="09070791000127"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070791000379"></a>Martin
Salter:</b> I am not as comforted by the Minister&#146;s
assurance as I should like to be. All I am hearing is a commitment to
consult. The arguments against accepting the amendment as it appears on
the amendment paper will result in technical adjustments to a schedule
and the need to consult with devolved Administrations. I am not sure
whether I am in order, but I invite the Minister to intervene on me to
give me a slightly stronger assurance than a commitment to consult
because, frankly, the cats in the streets could commit themselves
to
consult.</div><a name="09070791000128"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070791000380"></a>Ann
McKechin:</b> With respect to my hon. Friend, when we make
legislation that affects devolved Administrations it is important that
we do not give undertakings in Committee on their behalf, but consult
them before making changes. I have made it clear that we will carry out
that consultation between now and Report. I am sure that the outcome
will be positive, and that we will be able to come back on Report with
an appropriate amendment, but the amendment might not be in the exact
terms that my hon. Friend has sought, as it might not be appropriate in
Scotland or Wales, where the Environment Agency&#146;s remit does not
extend.</div>
<a name="09070791000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also take
this opportunity to clarify a statement made in the House on Second
Reading by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State. He may have
implied that part 7 of the Bill would give responsibility for managing
marine fisheries to the Environment Agency. He wishes it to be known
that the new and more flexible powers given to the agency in
that part of the Bill are exercisable only in respect of fisheries for
migratory and freshwater fish.</div>
<a name="09070791000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have been
told that the Environment Agency&#146;s remit does in fact cover
Wales and the Scottish borders at the River Esk, so I apologise for any
confusion, but we have not had the chance to discuss the amendment with
the devolved Administrations, so my points about the need to consult
them remain. We will consult on the matter and come back to it on
Report.</div><a name="09070791000131"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070791000381"></a>Martin

understand it, is to repeal what the Department considers to be
obsolete or spent enactments. I agree with the spirit of what is
proposed, which is a clear cross-party commitment to reduce regulatory
burdens on the private, public and voluntary sectors through the
conclusion of the Davidson review, as the explanatory notes supporting

<a name="09070791000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am particularly interested in the most ancient of the enactments, the
White Herring Fisheries Act 1771. I am told by those engaged in the
industry that the Act was not so much about regulation or control as an
enabling piece of legislation, which I am given to believe has aspects
that are still extant and operational, particularly in Scotland, and
that enable access to the white herring fisheries industry that might
not otherwise apply if the Act is repealed. For that reason, I would
welcome any advice&#151;via any channel of inspiration&#151;that

Minister explain the interrelationship between the MMO&#146;s
operational area and enforcement officers and the IFCAs? To what extent
can different enforcement officers co-operate with each other?
Currently, sea fisheries committees have their own enforcement
arrangements. Presumably, the purpose behind MCZs is to have internal
integrity even when their boundaries extend beyond the six-mile limit.
A common sense approach would be for enforcement to be seamless across
the six-mile zone. I looked for such an approach in the Bill, but did
not find it.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column212" />Column number: 212</div><a name="09070791000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">The six-mile
limit is a contentious issue, especially for those in the inshore
industry. In particular, those who lay static gear in, or around, the
six-mile zone, often find that their gear has been towed away by
foreign vessels fishing up to, and
sometimes&#151;illegally&#151;beyond that zone. Without a very good
understanding and working relationship between enforcement officers,
the six-mile zone will be less well policed than almost anywhere else.
That remains a particularly contentious issue. Many engaged properly
and responsibly in the industry believe that the law is being regularly
flouted. I look forward to the Minister&#146;s
response.</div>

now through close co-operation at an operational level in England and
through the Environment Agency&#146;s and the MMO&#146;s seats on
each English IFCA. There will also be statutory consultation and a duty
on IFCAs to co-operate with the EA. Cross-warranting of enforcement
officers will enable the MMO and EA officers to enforce IFCA byelaws,
and vice versa, thereby making the best use of expensive enforcement
assets.</div>

pm</div><a name="09070791000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
want resources to be used well and people and organisations to work
together. The clause allows marine enforcement officers to be appointed
by the MMO and Welsh Ministers. Such officers could include
commissioned officers of the Royal Navy. In fact, anyone in the Royal
Navy, RAF or Army in charge of an aircraft or hovercraft will
automatically be marine enforcement officers. The clause also allows
for the Secretary of State to appoint marine enforcement officers in
advance of the establishment of the MMO, so that we can get on with
business. It is also worth saying in passing, because it did not have a
lot of debate in the other place, that marine enforcement officers will
also receive training to ensure that they use their powers properly and
safely. We expect that the first MEOs will be existing British sea
fisheries officers who have already received MEO training. He is right
to make that observation. We want to make best use of collaboration and
co-operation and the Bill allows that to happen and to build on
existing best
practice.</div><a name="09070791000148"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070791000386"></a>Mr.
Benyon:</b> I beg to move amendment 41, in
clause 290, page 186, line 28, at
end insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(6A) Where
excepted land described in paragraphs 3 and 11 of Schedule 1 to the
CROW Act (excepted land for purposes of Part 1) becomes land
which is not excepted land for the purposes 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column213" />Column number: 213</div>of coastal margin by virtue of an order made under section 3A of the
CROW Act, in discharging the coastal access duty in relation to the
creation of new rights of way Natural England and the Secretary of
State shall use their best endeavours to treat such land as excepted
land unless they are satisfied that there are no practicable
alternatives.&#146;.</div><a name="09070791000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have reached a milestone in our deliberations. We have completed the
really important area of the Bill and we are now dealing with something
that has been bolted on. Before the Minister rolls about in laughter,
what I am actually saying is that this is a very important part of the
Bill, but I would have liked it to have been considered separately.
What we have discussed up until now is something that has been long
called for by a great many people. Coastal access is equally important,
but to perhaps a different group of people.</div>
<a name="09070791000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">When I say
that I am extremely supportive of increasing access to our coastline,
Members on the Government Benches might be waiting for me to say
&#147;but&#148;. When I say &#147;but&#148; I believe that the
legislation can be tightened and improved, but I would like to put on
the record that I have always been a supporter of providing greater
access to our countryside. There are a variety of different ways of
doing that and this is, perhaps, a noble objective, but there are areas
where it can be improved.</div>
<a name="09070791000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
seeks to address an issue that was picked up in the Countryside and
Rights of Way Act 2000 and should be reflected in this legislation;
that is, to secure the privacy and protection from members of the
public for certain types of building. I will describe why this is
extremely important. The new section 3A of the Act states that the CROW
Act protection for dwellings and for buildings used for livestock where
the public do not have a right of access within 20 m will be moved in
relation to the coastal
margin.</div><a name="09070791000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
justification for that, I am sure, is that a coastal path will, by its
nature, in places require closer access to certain
buildings&#151;whether they are people&#146;s houses, agricultural
buildings, or any other type of building. That really needs some
serious thought. Existing rights of way that will become part of the
coastal route and already come within 20 m of dwellings or livestock
buildings are no argument for saying that this proximity should be
visited on any other dwelling or livestock building on the coastal
strip.</div>
<a name="09070791000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
provides that where land close to dwellings or livestock buildings has
had its excepted protection removed by virtue of a new section 3A
order, Natural England and the Secretary of State should none the less
be under a statutory duty to treat such land as if it were excepted
land. I will put in a caveat there. There may be certain
circumstances&#151;very few&#151;where the Secretary of State needs
some leeway. An example might be where a promontory or salient of land
is squeezed in really narrow terms, in the unlikely event of there
being a building there. In other words, in designing and approving the
coastal access scheme, Natural England and the Secretary of State
should be obliged to avoid creating new rights of way which are
positioned in close proximity to human dwellings, or buildings used for
farm livestock.</div>
<a name="09070791000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">Many
residents who live on or very close to the coastline view the coastal
access scheme with great concern. Therefore it is reasonable that they
should be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column214" />Column number: 214</div>assured that every effort is being made by the authorities to avoid
invading their privacy and the enjoyment of their properties, wherever
it is practicable to do so. More importantly, in respect of farm
buildings, there is a serious issue of farm biosecurity to be taken
into account. As well as the day-to-day management of livestock and
agricultural activities, safety for walkers, as well as for livestock,
is paramount and must be
considered.</div><a name="09070791000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
must learn from foot and mouth and other farm diseases. We require a
much higher level of biosecurity than we have been happy to accept in
the past. I know that the Minister will say that, in the event of a
foot and mouth outbreak, farmers and landowners will be allowed to
close areas around farm buildings containing livestock. That may be so,
but it will probably be too late to do that in many areas. A simple
amendment, such as this one, requiring what is already accepted in the
Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 to be applied in this Bill will
prevent walkers from walking up to a lambing building, for example,
looking over the fence, contaminating the animals and carrying disease.
There are some important points to be made on biosecurity and, equally,
on
safety.</div><a name="09070791000163"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070791000387"></a>Martin
Salter:</b> The hon. Gentleman is making a strong, powerful
case. He talks about the powers available to the Secretary of State for
the closures of footpaths and rights of way in an emergency, such as a
foot and mouth outbreak, but of course in the countryside&#151;he
will know this as a landowner and a farmer&#151;if people have got
used to using a certain route and there are no people on the ground to
enforce closures, perhaps the best thing is to ensure that that
footpath does not run in a potentially dangerous place in the first
instance.</div><a name="09070791000164"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070791000388"></a>Mr.
Benyon:</b> That is precisely what I am trying to achieve
here. I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for putting that point so
eloquently.</div><a name="09070791000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
problem with the Bill is that, as with the CROW Act, there can be all
sorts of exclusions. However, the majority of people who want to walk
in the countryside are not the sort who sit down and look at the local
authority website, buy a map, find out where exclusions exist and know
when they are leaving farmer A&#146;s land and moving on to farmer
B&#146;s and what exclusions and constraints are in place there. So
we have to work with the grain of human nature and that means, at the
basic level, having an exclusion zone around farm buildings and
dwellings where people live. I hope that the Government will accept
this important
amendment.</div><a name="09070791000166"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070791000389"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> I welcome Committee members&#146;
welcoming this part of the Bill, albeit the hon. Member for Newbury
regards it as something of a bolt-on. We regard it as an integral part
and parcel of what we propose, because the demand for responsible
access to the coast is huge. We are now making more than 70
million trips to the undeveloped coast every year. Recent research
shows that walking is the single most popular activity along the coast.
The thrust behind this part of the Bill, which is on improving access,
is to give people the confidence and the certainty that, when they
arrive at the coast there will be clear, well-managed access in either
direction and they will be able to enjoy a rich, varied natural
environment that many people take for granted.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column215" />Column number: 215</div><a name="09070791000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under the
legislation the Secretary of State and Natural England will be given a
new duty to secure two objectives. The first objective is to do with
the long-distance route or routes around the whole of the English
coast, accessible to the public for journeys on foot. The second
objective is that there be a wider margin of recreational land
accessible by foot that the public can enjoy in conjunction with the
route. Both aims gained broad support during pre-legislative
scrutiny.</div><a name="09070791000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the other place, Lord Taylor of Holbeach
remarked:</div><a name="09070791000294"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
fully support the establishment of the coastal route and we also see
the value of the second objective in Clause
286,&#151;</div><a name="09070791000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">which
is now clause

Greaves also welcomed the coastal access and quoted the Hobhouse report

1947:</div><a name="09070791000296"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The

March 2009; Vol. 709, c.
877.]</div><a name="09070791000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">These
proposals have to be sustainable and workable. One of the themes that
we will draw out in the discussion is the input from local people and
organisations to bring the routes forward. That underpins
amendment 41, which refers to two categories of excepted
land under schedule 1 to the CROW Act:</div>
<a name="09070791000297"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Land
within 20 metres of a
dwelling.&#148;</div><a name="09070791000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">and</div>
<a name="09070791000298"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Land
covered by pens in use for the temporary reception or detention of
livestock.&#148;</div><a name="09070791000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">Proposed
new section 3A(4) of the CROW Act, which is set out in clause 297(5),
will allow the Secretary of State by order to modify the provisions of
part 1 of the CROW
Act</div><a name="09070791000299"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;in
their application to land which is coastal
margin.&#148;</div><a name="09070791000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
recognise the concerns and questions about what changes may be made to
the categories of excepted land, as they affect land that is coastal.
We published a paper on the order and excepted land, which set out the
main measures we expect to be contained in the
order.</div><a name="09070791000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have said that land within 20 m of a dwelling will not be excepted land
for the purposes of coastal margin because that would not be
appropriate where access would be limited to a margin of land next to
the sea. In many cases on the coast, there is already access closer
than 20 m from a dwelling and it does not cause problems. Further
protection is provided by paragraph 2 of schedule 1 to the
CROW Act, which excepts buildings and
curtilage.</div><a name="09070791000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have no intention of changing the category under paragraph 11 of
schedule 1 to the CROW Act, which is mentioned in the
amendment:</div><a name="09070791000300"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Land
covered by pens in use for the temporary reception or detention of
livestock.&#148;</div><a name="09070791000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
we have said that we are minded to remove paragraph 10 to schedule
1:</div><a name="09070791000301"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Land
within 20 metres of a building which is used for housing
livestock&#148;.</div><a name="09070791000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Newbury rightly raises concerns over biosecurity.
However, there are safeguards in the excepted land category because we
believe
that</div><a name="09070791000302"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;buildings
or the curtilage of such land&#148;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column216" />Column number: 216</div><a name="09070791000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">would include farmyards
that are associated with farm buildings. There is also a power in the
CROW Act to apply for a restriction or exclusion of access for land
management reasons, so those powers are already in place. The hon.
Gentleman rightly said that I would refer to the Animal Health Act
2002. Should there be an outbreak of animal disease, there are powers
under that Act to close land where
appropriate.</div><a name="09070791000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
think that we can deal with the issues raised by the hon. Gentleman
with the provisions of the CROW Act, particularly the exception for
buildings and their curtilage, and the powers in the 2002
Act.</div><a name="09070791000181"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070791000390"></a>Mr.
Benyon:</b> I want to get this absolutely right. The Minister
believes that it is possible within this legislation to have the 20 m
around a building as excepted
land.</div><a name="09070791000182"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070791000391"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> Within the CROW Act, there are safeguards
in the excepted land category. I have referred to the category of
buildings and their curtilage, which we believe would include farmyards
that are associated with farm buildings. Under the CROW Act, there is
also that ability to apply for a restriction or exclusion of access for
land management reasons, which I suspect would serve the purpose the
hon. Gentleman is trying to satisfy. There are already provisions that
can lead to curtailment of access for such reasons so the amendment is
not
needed.</div><a name="09070791000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
will have a further opportunity to debate and discuss the categories of
excepted land during the consultation and the debate that we will need
to have on the affirmative resolution order under proposed new section
3A of the CROW Act. On that basis, it is not appropriate to accept
amendment 41. It would prejudge the results of the consultation on a
section 3A order. I understand why the hon. Gentleman has raised the
issue, but there is an opportunity to contribute to the consultation on
the 3A order, and it should not be prejudged in the Bill. His rightful
concerns can form part of the consultation and shape the sort of access
that we want. He raised genuine concerns, but I do not think that
stamping the measure hard and fast into primary legislation here and
now is required. What is required is engagement with the existing
powers and consultation on under a 3A
order.</div>
<a name="09070791000321"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.30
pm</div><a name="09070791000184"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070791000392"></a>Mr.
Benyon:</b> So much of this is going to depend on Natural
England. In our discussions, the Minister and his team sounded very
emollient and understanding of the needs of those who live and work
along the proposed route. However, <i class="I">The Sunday Telegraph</i>, which
has made enjoyable reading for hon. Members in recent weeks, had a
supplement this week that identified some coastal walks. Importantly,
the walks incorporate existing rights of way and voluntary access
provision. When one looks closely at the maps of some of the
walks&#151;they are around the country and some are in
Scotland&#151;one notices that they do not stick dogmatically and
rigidly to a route purely on the grounds that it has to provide coastal
access. The walks take in the needs of the walker and access and egress
points from the coastal route. They also take in the needs of the land
user, and routes are deliberately devised to avoid important buildings
and access to them. The routes also offer the best views.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column217" />Column number: 217</div><a name="09070791000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">We can learn
from voluntary access agreements in framing the Bill. A lot of work
could have been done to expand and fulfil the Minister&#146;s
manifesto objectives to increase access to coastal Britain using a
voluntary approach. I lay down a marker: where the Bill is too dogmatic
and where it allows a simple-minded approach from certain authorities
in how they progress the plan, we will seek to amend it. I hope, with
the Minister&#146;s assurances, that we can address the very
important issue of farm buildings.</div>
<a name="09070791000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have one
more important point to make. Many existing footpaths go through farm
yards, but the direction of travel on footpath designation in the
countryside is moving them out of farm yards, for safety and
biosecurity reasons. Some farm yards in my constituency are the
convergence point for four different footpaths. During the foot and
mouth outbreak, enforcing exclusions was a nightmare for those farmers.
One of the great values of the Bill is that it will improve tourism in
certain areas, which is why it has been welcomed by many people who
live in coastal areas, and why it is important that we get it right.
Some farm houses will seek to benefit from the Bill by opening bed and
breakfasts. By excluding the route from the vicinity of a farm house
whose owners want to benefit from tourism, we could be damaging a
legitimate and important part of their business. It is perfectly
possible to access the dwelling house without accessing the farm
buildings. Perhaps the Minister will assure me that those concerns will
be carried through the
Bill.</div><a name="09070791000187"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070791000393"></a>Martin
Salter:</b> The hon. Gentleman and I are neighbours
politically, and a project that runs through both our constituencies is
a testimony to the value of an effective voluntary agreement. The
Sustrans cycle path along the Kennet and Avon river and canal had the
potential to generate serious conflict between different users, but we
had the good sense to sit down and consider whether the towpath route
would get in the way of fishermen, bird watchers, walkers or boaters,
and reconfigured the route so that all stakeholders were happy. The
voluntary approach worked well, and I think neither he nor I had a
single complaint during our time as public representatives as a result
of that approach. Surely that should inform how we deal with coastal
access wherever
possible.</div><a name="09070791000188"></a>

route, the desirability of the route being close to the sea and
providing views of the sea and, as far as reasonably practicable, they
must ensure that interruptions to the route are kept to a minimum. That
is clearly stated in subsection (2). They must also aim to strike a
fair balance between the interests of the public in having rights of
access over land, and the interests of any persons with a relevant
interest in the land. That means that a balance would be struck
regarding the particular piece of land&#151;not that the interests of
the relevant person should be set against the interests of the public
in the route and in coastal access as a whole. However, the coastal
access duty requires Natural England to propose a route, and it must
bear that in mind when trying to strike a fair balance. The body is
under a duty to consider all options for the route, between the public
interest in having the route and the interest of the landowner in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column219" />Column number: 219</div>having it cross his or her land. That will necessarily involve a
balancing exercise between different landowners&#146;
interests.</div><a name="09070791000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is our intention that Natural England and the Secretary of State do
everything that is reasonably practicable to achieve a fair balance. I
cannot support the amendment, as requiring that Natural England and the
Secretary of State &#147;aim to&#148; strike a fair balance is a
strong inducement for them to do so, and we provide additional
protection by making the Secretary of State jointly responsible with
Natural England for making that decision, which should reassure those
with an interest in the land. If they failed to do so, a person with a
relevant interest in the land could object to the route under the
procedure set out in schedule 19. We hope that consensus can be
achieved in most cases, as my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State
for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has indicated. That balance
lies at the heart of our proposals, and I believe that the correct
balance has been struck. I urge the hon. Gentleman to withdraw his
amendment on the basis of those
reassurances.</div><a name="09070791000198"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070791000402"></a>Mr.
Benyon:</b> The amendments seek to ensure that those who own
sporting rights, separate from being the owner or occupier of land, are
included in the statutory provisions for the consultation and in all
rights that go with that status. In the Bill, the definition of a
person with a relevant interest in affected land who would have
particular statutory rights in the consultation process, as well as in
the implementation of coastal access, covers only those who own a
freehold title or a leasehold title, or are persons in lawful
occupation of affected land. Unlike the definition in the CROW Act,
that completely neglects those with sporting rights, who have a
legitimate legal interest in
land.</div><a name="09070791000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">Sporting
rights are granted by type of lease, licence or agreement, and
constitute a separate property right. It is vital to understand that
they are capable of being owned entirely separately from the land
itself, and can be bought and sold. As a legal right, they can be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column220" />Column number: 220</div>enforced against all parties, including the owner or the occupier of
land. Bizarrely, the current definition of a person with a relevant
interest in affected land gives full statutory recognition and rights
to a person with a simple permission to graze cattle, for example,
which in law is an unenforceable right entirely at the discretion of
the owner or occupier of the land, while owners of sporting rights have
been excluded, despite sporting rights constituting in some cases a
valuable property right that can be enforced against all parties,
including the owner-occupier of land. If the coastal path, and in
particular the additional spreading room, includes land that is used
for shooting, that interest in the land will be directly affected by
the path, and therefore those who own a sporting right to carry out
shooting on the land should be consulted, and that right should be in
the Bill. That is important from the public safety perspective, as much
as any other. Owners of sporting rights need to be fully consulted and
informed as to where members of the public may go, so that they can
take the necessary measures to prevent any risk to the public
exercising their right of
access.</div><a name="09070791000205"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070791000403"></a>Martin
Salter:</b> The hon. Gentleman will be aware of starred
amendment 65, which seeks to achieve the same objective; it was tabled
in my name and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Test.
Does the hon. Gentleman recognise that it is not just shooting
interests that are concerned about this issue and that it could impact,
in certain circumstances, on recreational sea fishing? He quite rightly
raises the matter of public safety. Of course, the casting of heavy
leads or weights from the shore is something that is potentially
dangerous and sea fishermen do not want to do that if there is any
chance of causing injury to innocent passers-by. There is a wider
sporting interest at stake here than just shooters and I support that
interest.</div>
<a name="09070791000322"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.45
pm</div><a name="09070791000206"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070791000404"></a>Mr.
Benyon:</b> I entirely agree with the hon. Gentleman. It is
for that reason that we used the words, &#147;sporting
rights&#148;, rather than just the word, &#147;shooting&#148;.
When we have this route in mind, we must not think simply of particular
areas of the coast that may be relevant to Members in this room. There
may be a very narrow area of land between the sea and, for example, a
cliff, or there could be much more open land. We have to bear in mind
the needs and legitimate rights of all relevant sporting organisations
and their supporters.</div>
<a name="09070791000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">I believe
that owners of sporting rights should be included in the definition of
those who have a relevant interest in land, as they are under the CROW
Act. The failure to include owners of sporting rights in that way means
that they are, for example, not covered by the fundamental principle
and statutory obligation behind the coastal access provisions that
Natural England and the Secretary of State
must</div><a name="09070791000304"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;aim
to strike a fair balance between the interests of the public in having
access over land and the interests of any person with a relevant
interest in the
land.&#148;</div><a name="09070791000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
come back to that important phrase again&#151;&#147;aim to&#148;.
This issue comes down fundamentally to that point.</div>
<a name="09070791000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">In addition,
there are provisions that enable those with a relevant interest to make
an objection to a coastal access report under schedule 1A to the
National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1959, which is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column221" />Column number: 221</div>introduced by schedule 19 to the Bill. Hence, those provisions enable
those with a relevant interest to have access to the independent
appeals process. It should be noted that the need for access to a right
of appeal has been clearly demonstrated by the CROW Act. Under that
Act, there have been approximately 3,000 appeals to date, of which
about two thirds have been successful. Clearly, those responsible for
implementing access do not always get it right. Clause 296 states that
those with a relevant interest in land are persons whom Natural England
must</div><a name="09070791000305"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;take
reasonable steps to
consult&#148;.</div><a name="09070791000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
further area of concern is sporting rights on existing CROW access land
and what happens when land is reclassified as &#147;coastal
margin&#148;, especially in respect of spreading room. The owners of
those existing sporting rights have certain rights under the CROW Act.
Under section 22, for example, they can close land at their discretion.
The Government propose that that right will not apply to coastal
margin, with no distinction being made between the route and additional
spreading room. If such rights are to be lost, owners of those rights
should have full statutory rights to object to proposals to reclassify
land where existing rights are at stake.</div>
<a name="09070791000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">That issue
does not seem to be addressed anywhere in the Bill, or in any
supplementary guidance, which means that owners of sporting rights will
only have the limited rights of any member of the public where land
with existing CROW protections is reclassified. It is worth recalling
that the Joint Committee on Human Rights stated, in respect of the
absence of an independent appeals process from the Bill as it was
introduced and happily later amended, that that rendered the Bill
incompatible with article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights.
The Joint Committee
noted:</div><a name="09070791000306"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
all comparable legislation providing for the designation of public
rights of access over private land there is provision for a right of
appeal by those affected to an independent court or
tribunal.&#148;</div><a name="09070791000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Joint Committee went on to
say:</div><a name="09070791000307"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Secretary of State&#146;s decision approving the coastal access
scheme will amount to the determination of the &#145;civil
rights&#146; of those with an interest in the land affected, within
the meaning of Article 6(1)
ECHR&#148;.</div><a name="09070791000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is the right to a fair hearing. The Joint Committee recommended that
the Bill be amended to provide a right of appeal to an independent
body, saying that an
amendment</div><a name="09070791000308"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;would
remove the incompatibility with Article 6 ECHR that we have
identified&#148;.</div><a name="09070791000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
led to the introduction of an independent right of appeal, which is
greatly welcomed.</div>
<a name="09070791000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a
key group of people who do not have the same status as those listed as
having a relevant interest, which does not sit comfortably with the
reasoning of the Joint Committee, which specifically refers to the
determination of the civil rights of those with an interest in affected
land. The position appears to be all the more arbitrary and unjust,
given that the Bill gives greater protection to those with no legally
enforceable rights than to the owners of sporting rights who do have a
legally enforceable property right.</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column222" />Column number: 222</div><a name="09070791000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government&#146;s arguments in another place on this issue do not
stand up to scrutiny. The Minister, Lord Hunt, argued that land under
CROW included a number of grouse moors that made shooting interests
particularly pertinent and that Natural England&#146;s involvement
with local authorities would ensure that shooting interests were
properly represented because local
authorities</div><a name="09070791000309"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;will
have an in-depth knowledge of local interests, such as shooting
interests, and will be able to advise Natural England on the proper
persons who should be consulted.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report,
House of Lords,</i> 1 June 2009; Vol. 711, c.
31.]</div><a name="09070791000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">First,
the CROW Act makes specific provision for grouse moors. Obviously that
is not particularly relevant here, but that provision applied only in
respect of dogs under section 23, which the Government intend to
exclude under the proposed section 3A order. That is understandable in
the context of the current proposals with regard to such matters as
grouse moors, although it does not address the other part of the
measure, which deals with lambing. I believe that that could be of
great concern to farmers in certain parts of coastal England and Wales.
It also fails to take account of the fact that shooting takes place on
all types of land, and especially in coastal areas. Some 59 leases are
granted by the Crown estate to wildfowling clubs covering around
500 miles of the foreshore. These are very ad hoc
arrangements enabling people with a great love of the countryside to
contribute to conservation. It is hard to see how their rights will be
properly secured under this
provision.</div><a name="09070791000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
there is no reason to suppose that local authorities have an in-depth
knowledge of the complex nature of land ownership in their areas. They
understand certain aspects of it, but I would not expect my local
authority to have an in-depth understanding of the wide variety of
sporting rights that exist in an inland area like mine and I am sure
that the same would be true in coastal
areas.</div><a name="09070791000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thirdly,
the Government propose to disapply section 22 of CROW under
the proposed section 3A order, which allows the closure of land for a
limited number of days at the discretion of owners or those with an
interest in the land, and is vital to those exercising sporting rights.
Section 22 of CROW would continue to apply to spreading room, which is
the coastal margin other than that over which the route passes, but
section 24 can now be used by owners of sporting rights to
obtain closures or restrictions to enable them to exercise their
rights. There is an essential difference between people who own the
land, and who could live many miles away and not have much interest in
it, and those who are on the land all the time and could have an
interest in the sporting potential that it
offers.</div><a name="09070791000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">Section
24 relates to applications for closures or restrictions in respect of
land for land management. Is the activity of shooting by a person
owning sporting rights separate from the land in fact land management
for the purposes of the Bill? In correspondence, DEFRA has stated
that</div>
<a name="09070791000310"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;land management
reasons... can include management for shooting.&#148;</div>
<a name="09070791000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">Does that only cover
management activities preparatory to shooting but not the actual
shooting, or does it cover both? We need to know the answer.
Furthermore, the  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column223" />Column number: 223</div>process of having to apply may be impractical in cases in which the
decision on whether to shoot has to be taken at short notice,
particularly in pest control.</div>
<a name="09070791000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">We want sea
anglers to be able to go and enjoy their activity at a moment&#146;s
notice. That is part of the joy of activities in the countryside: one
does not have to sit down and plan or spend endless hours on the
internet trying to find out where exclusions exist. We should be trying
to work with the grain of wishes of users of the countryside. If a
request is denied, there is no guarantee of a swift appeal under
section 30 of the CROW Act. Rights could be rendered meaningless by
burdensome bureaucracy and delay. It should also be noted that the
application of section 30 won during the Bill&#146;s passage in
another place could be rendered meaningless by the use of a future
section 3A order by which the remaining CROW protections could be
disapplied in respect of coastal margin.</div>
<a name="09070791000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">How can
owners of sporting rights take comfort from any assurance if they are
not even covered by the statutory duty in the Bill under which Natural
England and the Secretary of State must aim to strike a fair balance
between the interests of the public in having access and the interests
of a person with a relevant interest in the land? According to the
Bill, they have no relevant interest greater than any other member of
the public. That is clearly nonsense. As a look at the CROW Act or the
basic principles of property law in this country will confirm, the
arguments advanced to date by the Government have produced no good
justification for what some must see as an attack on a fundamental
right where the proper relationship between citizen and state are at
risk.</div><a name="09070791000224"></a>

<a name="09070791000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">I agree with
the hon. Member for Newbury, but I must tease him gently. He referred
to local authorities having an in-depth knowledge of who owns what and
what sporting rights exist. I am sure that he will not mind if I reveal
that when he was preparing for a speech the other day for the
&#147;save our rivers&#148; campaign, which he and I both support,
he required a list of all the angling clubs from my constituency to
his. I was happy to provide it, as I am a member of most of them, but
the irony was not lost on me that some of those angling clubs rent
water off him, so there are cases where even the landowner is not
entirely sure which parcel of land is leased to which particular
sporting interest. I mean that in a most affectionate and friendly
way.</div>
<a name="09070791000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would also
like to put on record my slight surprise that although this is a hot
issue, particularly among wildfowling and fishing interests, the

opened up its usual channels of communication with the Conservative

well.</div>
<a name="09070791000323"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6
pm</div><a name="09070791000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is correspondence on record from the Minister to the British
Association for Shooting and Conservation that is clearly drafted by
civil servants and is, frankly, nonsense. It needs to be deconstructed.
I know that the Minister, as a reasonable man, will have a way forward
for us, but I will read into the record the response to the initial
concerns about why the arguments hold very little water, like the roof
of the House of
Commons.</div><a name="09070791000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Department&#146;s response to BASC can be summarised as follows:
shooting is not pertinent to coastal access issues. The letter mentions
only wildfowling, and ignores game shooting, pest control&#151;an
issue raised by the hon. Member for Newbury&#151;fishing and stalking
interests. The Department claims that coastal land is more complicated
and has more interests, and that it believes that shooting tenants and
holders of sporting rights should be excluded from those able to appeal
against the route. That is on the record as a response from the
Department to shooting interests, so there is clearly a conflict which
needs to be resolved. DEFRA goes on to sweeten the pill by saying it
will give Natural England the power to exclude tidal land from
spreading room. However, Natural England had already planned to do
that. It is not going to help a lot of the shoots, pest control,
fishing or stalking interests on the coast.</div>
<a name="09070791000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">Here is the
irony. A Labour Government have given more rights to the tenants of
grouse moors than to wildfowling clubs. My hon. Friend the
Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs
understands country pursuits. Wildfowling is a pretty ordinary
down-to-earth pursuit&#151;a down-in-the-mud pursuit. People spend a
lot of time up to their waist or neck in water. How ironic it is that
those who can afford expensive grouse moor shooting appear to be given
rights in the appeal process, rather than Joe Soap participating in the
centuries-old activity of
wildfowling.</div><a name="09070791000238"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070791000413"></a>Mr.

made in my intervention. Wildfowling is not the sole pursuit of the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070791000415"></a>Mr.

backgrounds and that is something we need to focus on in the
amendment.</div><a name="09070791000241"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070791000416"></a>Martin
Salter:</b> This is obviously the Marxist-Leninist amendment.
The problem revolves around the definition of &#147;relevant interest
in land&#148; in the Bill. It clearly differs, as the hon. Member for
Newbury said, from the Countryside and Rights of Way Act, by excluding
tenants and holders of sporting rights. They are not able to make the
same formal representations to Natural England against the proposed
route, so we end up with the ridiculous situation that a golf club may
appeal because it owns the land but a wildfowling or fishing club
cannot. I fail to see how that can be justified in any sense.</div>
<a name="09070791000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
about 200 wildfowling clubs around the coast. An awful lot more people
are involved in those clubs than are ever going to be involved in
grouse moors or the specific proposals that would be picked up under
the appeals process allowed in the CROW Act. The last point I want to
make is that the current position conflicts with Natural
England&#146;s draft scheme for the implementation of pathways. Clear
guidance has been drafted, in consultation with DEFRA advisers, to
avoid ports, industry, crops, livestock and military use but no
consideration is given to the tenants of sporting rights. I have a huge
amount of respect for officials in DEFRA, but this particular measure
seems to have been drafted by people with a poor understanding of
sporting interests on the coast. That is something in the Bill that
needs to be
resolved.</div><a name="09070791000243"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070791000417"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> I welcome the opportunity to follow two
good contributions to the debate. I concede that there is genuine
concern among sporting interests of all sorts&#151;shooting,
wildfowling or fishing&#151;and that this is important to our coastal
areas, not only as an activity or pastime but by providing economic and
social benefit. To put it in context, I understand that sporting
interest cases under the CROW Act provisions amount to 43 per cent. of
the current live restrictions on applications from landowners. That
effectively covers 3.5 per cent. of the total restrictable area of open
access land, excluding Forestry Commission, under the CROW Act. Those
interests therefore have a sizeable impact. Those figures include
lowland shooting&#151;and thus moorland shooting&#151;live-quarry
shooting, including rough shoots; deer shooting; and, of course,
fishing. Putting that into context, it is worth noting that the right
of access to the coastal margin will be the CROW Act right of access,
and that is why I am prefacing some of my comments by saying that the
CROW restrictions and exclusion systems will apply to such land. It is
important to say that at the outset, because there is more than one way
to skin a cat, and I hope to explain how the provisions in the Bill and
in the CROW Act will work to maintain the valid interests and pastimes
of people and organisations who are not landowners but who have a long
and often historic interest in an area of land.</div>
<a name="09070791000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me deal
with some of the issues that have been raised. I want to correct a
misunderstanding by making it clear that section 22 of the CROW Act,
concerning 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column226" />Column number: 226</div>discretionary closures, does not apply to those with sporting interests,
and that it applies only to the owners of land. In respect of section
22, we propose to remove the landowner&#146;s right to make
discretionary restrictions. We are doing that for several reasons,
including for the availability of a coastal route that allows people
access along the coast. That is central to the Government&#146;s
vision, but it has to be done sensitively and in line with the duties
in clause 291(3) to</div>
<a name="09070791000311"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;aim to strike a
fair balance between the interests of the public in having rights of
access over land and the interests of any person with a relevant
interest in the
land.&#148;</div><a name="09070791000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall expand on that in a
moment.</div><a name="09070791000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
want landowners and others to talk to Natural England from the outset.
The whole basis of the consultation and what has been introduced in
Natural England&#146;s draft scheme on coastal access is predicated
on the idea of real engagement and consultation, and it builds on what
has been done under the voluntary provisions. We recognise that
although 70 per cent. of the coast is open to access at the moment,
that leaves 30 per cent. to which there is no access, not
even through alternative paths.</div>
<a name="09070791000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another issue
that has been raised, in respect of the Bill and the CROW Act, is land
management. I want to be emphatic about this point: land management can
include shooting and fishing&#151;sporting interests&#151;as well
as actions that are preparatory to those activities. The whole gamut of
sporting interests, including preparation and the activities
themselves, therefore come within land management. Finally, a point was
made about bureaucracy and delay in appeals against the refusal of
applications for sporting interests. Restrictions can be applied well
in advance of the shooting activity for a period of time, so there is
time for an appeal to be heard. There are genuine concerns with which
we need to deal, but there is more than one way of dealing with
them.</div>
<a name="09070791000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments 34
and 43 seek specifically to extend the definition of those with a
relevant interest in land that is affected by proposals to include
those with sporting rights. Amendment 46 would amend the description in
clause 296 of what is a relevant interest to add those with a legal
interest; that would include those with a sporting right, as well as
those with an easement or a right of common. That is relevant, because
Natural England and the Secretary of State must aim to strike a fair
balance between the interests of the public in having a right of access
and the interests of persons with a relevant interest in the land.
Persons with a relevant interest in the affected land may also make
that objection to Natural England about a coastal access report under
the procedure for hearing objections that we introduced in the Bill in
the other place.</div>
<a name="09070791000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">The CROW Act
definition of interest in land includes rights of common, as well as
grazing and sporting rights. I reiterate the comments that Lord Hunt
made on Report in the other place about those interests being
particularly relevant to the land types involved in the CROW Act. CROW
land&#151;open country, including mountain, moor, heath and
down&#151;includes a number of grouse moors, as has been mentioned,
which makes shooting interests particularly pertinent. Rights of common
were also particularly important, as the mapping process involved
mapping areas of registered common
land.</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column227" />Column number: 227</div><a name="09070791000250"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070791000418"></a>Martin
Salter:</b> The Countryside Alliance, the Country Land and
Business Association and the British Association for Shooting and
Conservation are not ill-informed bodies. Will the Minister explain
why, despite the assurances given by Lord Hunt of Kings Heath in the
other place, the fears and concerns do not appear to have been allayed?
How much progress does he hope to make in allaying those fears and
concerns if he is merely repeating what was said in the other
place?</div><a name="09070791000251"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070791000419"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> I think that those bodies have genuine
concerns. Certain interests have taken place for many years, if not
generations, in some places, and those bodies want not only assurance,
but to know that there is a way through this and that they can make
their representations and be heard. I will flesh this out a little bit,
and I will not only repeat what was said in the other place. I have a
proposal, because although I am not a fisherman and do not engage in
shooting, I recognise that somebody who takes part in such activities
and has genuine concerns whether the Bill will end such activities will
not only want to hear assurances, but will want proper access to engage
in the process. Those people will say, &#147;Show me, Minister. How
can I have an impact on this?&#148; I will come to that in a moment.
To deal with my hon. Friend&#146;s point, those concerns are still
out
there.</div><a name="09070791000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me state that, as I said at the beginning, I recognise the role that
sporting interests such as shooting and angling play in the rural
economy, but all interests&#151;I stress all interests&#151;will be
taken into account when Natural England draws up proposals for the
coastal route and margin. It is important that I mention that that will
not be an arbitrary line or a coastal margin drawn on a map by a man in
Whitehall. The Bill provides for extensive preliminary work and
consultation before Natural England draws up its recommendations. The
work that is done on the ground, with the local interests and with
regard to the duties contained in the Bill, means that the people doing
the work will have to go out and listen to all the various concerns and
try to reconcile some of the competing interests out
there.</div><a name="09070791000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">Natural
England said, in its draft guidance that I mentioned earlier, that it
will work with shoot managers when considering the best alignment for
the trail. So it has said on the record that it intends to do that and,
as a Minister, I will hold it to that. I have no doubt&#151;I have
seen it working on the ground&#151;that it intends to do that. This
will be a coastal route built upwards from the ground with local
interests.</div><a name="09070791000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">Natural
England has also said that it will draft proposals that will include
information on any exclusions and restrictions on access that it
considers necessary. Again, those will be based on what it has heard on
the ground, working not only with local landowners, and so on, but
those with interests, including sporting interests. Natural England
will have to advertise the proposals and invite comment, providing the
opportunity for absolutely anyone, whether an individual or a sporting
interest organisation, to make their views known, so that those can be
taken into account by Natural
England.</div><a name="09070791000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are the safeguards, if those with other interests feel that Natural
England has not taken their views into account adequately in the final
proposals. Paragraph 7 of schedule 19
states:</div><a name="09070791000312"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Representations
about a coastal access report may be made by any person to Natural
England&#148;,</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column228" />Column number: 228</div><a name="09070791000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">whether a legal entity,
person, individual or organisation, including those with historical
sporting interests along a part of the coast. Those representations
will go, in summary, to the Secretary of State, along with Natural
England&#146;s comments on them. My right hon. Friend the Secretary
of State will read the comments to see whether they have been taken
into account properly, in line with clause 291(3), which refers
to</div><a name="09070791000313"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a
fair balance between the interests of the public in having rights of
access...and the interests of any person with a relevant interest
in the
land.&#148;</div><a name="09070791000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
includes representations by certain organisations specified in
regulations.</div>
<a name="09070791000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Secretary
of State must take representations into account when making a
determination on the route. As Lord Hunt said in the other place, we
expect to include in the list the Country Land and Business Association
and the National Farmers Union, and we are open to including other
organisations, such as the British Association for Shooting and
Conservation, which I met recently, and representatives of fishing
interests. We shall consult on the regulations in due course, which
will provide the opportunity to decide which organisations we should
include. I am sure that Committee members have strong views about which
organisations should be included in the
regulations.</div><a name="09070791000324"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.15
pm</div><a name="09070791000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Secretary of State must consider such information when reaching his
determination on any proposal in Natural England&#146;s coastal
access report. Obviously, the Secretary of State will take particular
note of representations made by anyone with important and valuable
interests, such as sporting rights. I am convinced that the extensive
consultation process that Natural England will undertake before drawing
up its report, along with the right to make representations on the
report, which must be considered by Natural England and the Secretary
of State in reaching a determination, will ensure that all interested
parties have opportunities to express their views. That bottom-up,
consultative approach and preliminary engagement with people&#151;the
advertising and invitation for comments&#151;is quite different from
what has come before.</div>
<a name="09070791000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given this
very different approach to coastal land, and the consultative nature of
the process, we do not believe that the definition of those with a
relevant interest has to be the same as under CROW. We have therefore
identified in the Bill the people whom it is appropriate to include in
the definition of those with a relevant interest in affected land. They
are set out in clause 291 and proposed new section 55J in clause 296,
and they comprise landowners, leaseholders and those in lawful
occupation of the land. That is the most appropriate approach for
coastal
land.</div><a name="09070791000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall give one final safeguard. Those with relevant interests, as
defined by section 45 of the CROW Act, which includes sporting rights,
will have the same rights as they do on CROW land. In other words, they
can apply for restrictions and exclusions of access for land management
reasons. That takes me back to my original comment that sporting rights
fall within land management. That can include the management of a
sporting activity, the activity itself and the holding of commercial
events associated with the activity. Such sporting activities might
well include shooting and fishing. Those with 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column229" />Column number: 229</div>rights enabling them to carry out such activities on access land can
apply for restrictions or exclusions if necessary. That process, with
its propensity towards exclusions for sporting rights under CROW, has
worked very well. We have made it clear that the Government do not
intend to make changes to the categories of people who can make an
application for restrictions and exclusions under section 24 of the
CROW Act, and that ability remains in place.</div>
<a name="09070791000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">I said at the
outset that the concerns expressed are genuine, but my hon. Friend the
Member for Reading, West has asked why those fears have not been
allayed. Genuine concerns remain, but it is not appropriate to accept
the amendments, because&#151;I am sorry to repeat this&#151;there
is more than one way to skin a cat. Those representations can be heard
and those exclusions and exemptions can be applied for&#151;in fact,
it has worked very well under
CROW.</div><a name="09070791000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">Perhaps
the Committee will support me in another matter. I am interested in
convening a summit or conference of those with an interest in sporting
rights&#151;anglers, shooters and others&#151;so my very good team
of officials and I can sit down with them and seek not only to clarify,
expand and reassure, but, where necessary, to introduce additional
guidance to explain how representations can be heard under both CROW
and this Bill and how their interests can be protected. That should
provide the proper reassurance that perhaps they have not yet
received.</div><a name="09070791000264"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070791000420"></a>Martin
Salter:</b> I do not think that any Committee member believes
that it is the Government&#146;s intention to restrict or disrupt the
legitimate activities of wildfowling clubs or sea fishing in such
locations. Most of us who picked up that baton and ran with it would be
satisfied if the wildfowling clubs and the British Association for
Shooting and Conservation were reassured that their appeal rights will
be as robust as the Minister has indicated. What is the time scale for
bringing the Bill back on Report? That will tell us how long we have to
engage in that consultation and clarification
process.</div><a name="09070791000265"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070791000421"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> I cannot anticipate the permutations that
go through the usual channels, but we hope to be back in October,
subject to any subsequent delays, which I hope will not occur. That
will give us time over the summer. I am more than willing&#151;if I
say this on the record, it might actually get out there&#151;to come
back here in the recess and bring together, with the assistance of my
hon. Friend and others, the right group of people to talk about how to
explain and clarify how best they can protect their interests. I am
also willing, where necessary, to bring forward supplementary guidance
to clarify that, because those organisations and people have genuine
and valid concerns, and I think that there are valid and genuine ways
to ensure that those concerns are
heard.</div><a name="09070791000266"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070791000422"></a>Martin
Salter:</b> That will certainly be sufficient for now,
provided that the hon. Members who have raised the issue, particularly
the hon. Members for Broxbourne and for Newbury and my hon. Friend the
Member for Southampton, Test, have an opportunity to attend that summit
on shooting and sporting interests, because we all need to be assured
before we come back on Report that the issue has been sorted
out.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column230" />Column number: 230</div><a name="09070791000267"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070791000423"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> I welcome that, because I know that hon.
Members on both sides of the Committee have a good feeling for the type
of organisations and stakeholders&#151;to use that horrible
term&#151;that would be relevant for such a meeting, including those
who would want to be involved during the summer.</div>
<a name="09070791000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">On that
basis, I urge the hon. Member for Newbury to withdraw the amendment and
to engage fruitfully and constructively with us over the summer, so
that we can work with those people who have sporting interests not only
to give them clarity and reassurance, but to show them what they can
use in the Bill and the CROW Act, because they have actually already
made use of the CROW Act successfully to
date.</div><a name="09070791000269"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070791000424"></a>Mr.
Benyon:</b> The problem with that element of the Bill is that
it relates to a theme that runs through the whole of part 9, which is
quite a woolly piece of legislation. It might have been deliberately
designed in that way because the Minister wants it to be flexible, but
my worry about keeping it woolly is that it allows for interpretation.
That might be from Natural England, in consultation with the local
authority, but although that might work supremely well for 95 per cent.
of the 30 per cent. yet to be accessed, the remaining 5 per cent. could
militate against legitimate sporting
bodies.</div><a name="09070791000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">Whatever
the Minister says, access to the objections provisions secured in
another place will be weaker under that arrangement. It is perfectly
simple to add that one category under clause 291(4). I am sure that his
officials are saying to him, &#147;If you concede this, you will open
the flood gates to every conceivable organisation.&#148; I counsel
him that that will not happen. I have sat up in the watches of the
night trying to contemplate the interested bodies that will beat down
his door saying, &#147;We deserve exactly the same access to
consultation as the sporting bodies, so what is so special about
us?&#148; But for the life of me, I cannot think of
any.</div><a name="09070791000271"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070791000425"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> I hope that the hon. Gentleman is right. I
do not want my door being beaten down&#151;at least no more than
currently happens. I think that we have a way forward, but one
reservation, which I have not referred to, is that the amendments would
bolt certainty into the Bill, which is not needed, but they do not
identify the costs of the representations or objections that might be
made. There are serious concerns over the effect of passing the
amendments in this shape, when we do not know the cost implications.
The economic assessment of our current proposals is that they will cost
about &#163;1.5 million, but I have no idea what the
amendments will cost, and I suspect, as well intentioned as they are,
the hon. Gentleman does not know either. Therefore, if there is an
alternative route forward, we should work with those with sporting
interests to make it work.</div>
<a name="09070791000272"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070791000426"></a>Mr.
Benyon:</b> There are colleagues who are always the voices in
my head on costs. I suspect that the Minister is applying the 43 per
cent. of objections under CROW that came from sporting interests to his
thoughts about costs. I submit that there would be a much smaller
number of objections for this than there are under CROW&#151;a very
small number indeed. CROW encompassed elements of moorland, where there
are substantial high-income areas, so I do not agree that the issue
would apply.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column231" />Column number: 231</div><a name="09070791000273"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070791000427"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> To clarify, the 43 per cent. that I
referred to earlier is a measure of the success of the existing CROW
provisions. Of the live applications in place, 43 per cent. concern
sporting interests. A propensity not to object, but to apply for
exemptions and exclusions based on sporting interests is a singular
measure of the success of the CROW provisions&#151;they have
worked.</div>
<a name="09070791000274"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070791000428"></a>Mr.
Benyon:</b> I take the Minister&#146;s point, but I am not
sure whether I agree with him on cost.</div>
<a name="09070791000275"></a><div class="hs_Para">My other
point relates to liability. We should consider the interests of the
sporting groups that we have been talking about, such as wildfowling.
Wildfowling rights have developed over a great many years, and those
involved tend to be esoteric individuals who understand and know the
foreshore, the marshes and the adjacent land. If they have to be
concerned with liability, it will be a huge cost to them and may
require different liability insurance. The cost should reflect their
status as consultees.</div>
<a name="09070791000276"></a><div class="hs_Para">Natural
England&#146;s draft scheme, page 33, section 7.6.7,
specifically mentions shooting and makes some helpful indications of
its approach:</div>
<a name="09070791000314"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Shooters
should assume at all times that members of the public may be present
and take all necessary precautions to ensure their safety, in line with
voluntary codes of
Practice&#148;</div><a name="09070791000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">&#147;At
all times&#148; could include hours of the day when there is
half-light or little light, and this measure will impose new concerns
for shooters close to a path. While the guidance mentions specifically
that marshes may not be included as part of the spreading room, a
person could still be on a marsh close to the 4 m path and worry about
public safety.</div>
<a name="09070791000278"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070791000429"></a>Martin
Salter:</b> I do not disagree with a word that the hon.
Gentleman has said&#151;his amendment is similar to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column232" />Column number: 232</div>my starred amendment&#151;but we now have four amendments seeking the
same thing, so there is a drafting issue about what each would achieve.
The Minister has agreed to hold a summit with relevant interests and to
write in and amend the guidance. Bottoming out this issue with the
people who have been lobbying me and him, before we determine it in
Committee, makes immense sense. Will the hon. Gentleman take my
guarantee that I will join him, if the issue is not resolved
satisfactorily when we come back on Report? I will have no hesitation
in joining him and other hon. Members who are concerned about the
matter in the Division Lobby at some future point. On that basis, is he
more
reassured?</div><a name="09070791000279"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070791000430"></a>Mr.
Benyon:</b> Having drawn lines in the sand, I am about to
cross them by saying that I sense that the hon. Member for Reading,
West feels that the Minister is moving in his direction. I am happy to
take part in a summit with the Minister&#151;he is good
company&#151;but he is a very busy man, and I would like to resolve
the matter now and save him the bother. Given his assurance to the hon.
Member for Reading, West that we can deal with the matter, and given
the understanding that I have gained from meetings with the Minister
and his officials, I believe that it is a front-loaded
consultation&#151;I think that was the expression&#151;and that
interested parties, such as those with supporting interests, can be
given a triple-lock assurance that their interests will be understood
at an early stage. With that provision, I beg to ask leave to withdraw
the amendment.</div>
