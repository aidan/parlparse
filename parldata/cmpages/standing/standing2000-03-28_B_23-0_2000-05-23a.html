<H4><center>Commencement</center></H4>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`Part III (apart from section 67(2) and (3)) and Schedules 9, 10, and 11 and Parts III and IV of Schedule 12.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
The amendment addresses the timing of the introduction of provisions in part III, with the exception of those on the enforcement of wildlife legislation. They mainly affect sites of special scientific interest, but in some respects-such as limestone pavements, which I think are important-they go wider. The provisions introduce important measures to improve the protection and management of nationally important sites. We want to ensure that they are introduced quickly so that we can deliver those benefits.

<P>
Guidance will be published to accompany and explain the effect of the provisions, first, in relation to new financial guidelines on management agreements and, secondly, in relation to a code of guidance for English Nature. The National Assembly for Wales will produce guidance on the same issues. The amendment will secure the introduction of the new provisions in England and Wales within two months of Royal Assent.

Amendment agreed to.

<P>

<B>Mr. Gordon Prentice:</B> I speak in the spirit of the times; the new clause and new schedule reflect the consensus that exists on this issue.

<P>
It is an astonishing omission for the Bill not to refer areas of outstanding natural beauty. There is wide backing-[
Interruption.]

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am not sure whether that noise is coming from the side of my good ear or my bad ear, but I distinctly heard it. We will have no more of that.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gordon Prentice:</B> As I was saying, the new clause and new schedule have wide support. I have a marvellous area of outstanding natural beauty on my doorstep. It extends from Pendle deep into Ribble valley. There is also the Forest of Bowland in north Lancashire. Lancashire county council does a good job, but that is not true of all local authorities.

<P>
The new clause and new schedule are supported by the Countryside Agency, which is actively promoting them, and the Association for Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty, which brings together district authorities that have areas of outstanding natural beauty on their patch. The Local Government Association speaks with one voice on the issue. The Countryside Council for Wales, the Council for the Protection of Rural England-the tent gets even bigger-and the Campaign for the Protection of Rural Wales also support them. Indeed, I received a National Farmers Union briefing today and we are ad idem with it on this matter, which is a first for me.

<P>
The new clause lays a duty on relevant authorities to have regard for areas of outstanding natural beauty when carrying out their functions. It also requires them to promote their management of areas of outstanding natural beauty and to produce and adopt a management plan for them. Where appropriate, it allows for the creation of statutory conservation boards to take over that management role if that is supported by the relevant local authorities. It also lays a duty on people who manage areas of outstanding natural beauty to foster the social and economic well-being of local communities.

<P>
<B>Mr. Damian Green </B>(Ashford): I congratulate the hon. Member for Pendle (Mr. Prentice) on having a good morning. He did not move amendments or new clauses that were wrong, but he is moving those that are right. The Opposition are happy to join him in the big tent of those people and organisations that support the new clause and new schedule. We agree with the Wildlife and Countryside Link that
<P>
the failure of the  Bill to include measures for more effective management and protection of Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty  is a missed opportunity for the Government to deliver on its commitments.
<P>
The group welcomes new clause 4 and new schedule 1 as an attempt to prevent the Government from failing to fulfil yet another commitment. We are happy to support the Minister for the Environment in fulfilling it.

<P>
The Minister for the Environment told the Labour party conference in September 1999 that he would shortly provide details of a new series of measures to ``conserve and enhance'' areas of outstanding natural beauty,
<P>
which are equal in terms of landscape importance to the National Parks.
<P>
We are happy to help him to live up to those words and hope that the Government will therefore accept the new clause and new schedule, which provide an appropriate and workable approach to the future management and protection of areas of outstanding natural beauty and would place them on a more secure footing.

<P>
We all owe a tribute to my noble Friend Lord Renton of Mount Harry, since the new clause and new schedule are closely based on a Bill that he presented in another place a couple of years ago. It received wide cross-party support and relevant early-day motions have been signed by hon. Members of all parties. It is one of the less contentious areas of policy relating to the Bill. We have consistently said that we wanted a good, wide-ranging wildlife protection Bill. Too much has already been added to the Bill, although not, fortunately, some of the more damaging excrescences that hon. Members have thought up. At the heart of the Bill should be measures to improve the protection of all areas that are important for wildlife conservation. Those include areas of outstanding natural beauty as well as sites of special scientific interest. The new clause and new schedule are a good stab at improving their protection and we are happy to support them.

<P>
<B>Mr. Huw Edwards </B>(Monmouth): I support my hon. Friend the Member for Pendle and am pleased at the cross-party support for the new clause and new schedule. I am grateful for the work of the Association for Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty. My constituency consists of half of the Wye valley area of outstanding natural beauty. The other half is in the constituency of the hon. Member for Forest of Dean (Mrs Organ). The Wye valley area of outstanding natural beauty is well managed, with an AONB officer, representatives of the local authority on its board, and few problems, except for those that were clearly exposed a few months ago when I was informed about a fax showing a tiny advertisement. It stated that Chepstow Park wood-a central and beautiful part of the AONB, including ancient woodland-was up for sale by Forest Enterprise. It wanted to sell the wood for a potential holiday village operation. No one had been informed and there had been no consultation. That exposed the weakness of the present legislation on management of AONBs.

<P>
The conduct of the matter by Forest Enterprise was appalling. I obtained an adjournment debate on the issue and a superb campaign, called ``Save our Wood'', was started. Anyone who knows my constituency will know that Chepstow Park wood lies in a triangle between three beautiful villages of Devauden, Itton and St. Arvans. The campaign was incredibly successful. Forest Enterprise eventually decided, through embarrassment, I believe, not to proceed with the sale. It is absurd that part of an area of outstanding natural beauty could have been turned into a holiday village with no consultation. Forest Enterprise's argument that consultation would be part of the planning process was not good enough. Areas of outstanding natural beauty have special protection-but not, apparently, against having holiday villages established on them.

<P>
I hope that the Government will accept the new clause and new schedule, or introduce something similar. I was delighted with the commitment in the Labour party manifesto to the conservation and enhancement of areas of outstanding natural beauty and the introduction of management plans and I hope that the spirit of the new clause and new schedule will be accepted.

<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. David Heath </B>(Somerton and Frome): I support the new clause and the new schedule. Many of the arguments have already been put. An effective statutory underpinning for areas of outstanding natural beauty-dealing not only with the reasons for designating the land, but with the people living in the area, who need ways of going about their business-is essential. The balance in the provisions is absolutely right.

<P>
The hon. Member for Ashford (Mr. Green) was right to pay tribute to the work of Lord Renton. Clearly, there is the nearest thing to consensus in the Committee on this matter, and the Minister will be in difficulty if he opposes the new clause and new schedule because there is an absolute majority in their favour. That is not to predict how things will turn out, but I hope that he will note the strength of feeling from all parties and the commitments that the Labour party has previously made, and, if he will not accept the provisions, give an absolute assurance that a suitable new clause will be tabled on Report. I am sure that that would receive overwhelming support in the House.

<P>
<B>Mr. Elfyn Llwyd </B>(Meirionnydd Nant Conwy): I, too, agree with everything that has been said by hon. Members on both sides of the Committee. Areas of outstanding natural beauty by definition have delicate environments-otherwise they would not be designated. In a regime that will allow greater access to them, it is appropriate to re-examine the statutory safeguards for those areas. I welcome the comments of the hon. Member for Pendle and others. The new clause and schedule would provide a strengthened statutory base for AONBs. That is vital, because many of the relevant areas will be mapped as open countryside under part I of the Bill.

<P>
In the past, areas of outstanding natural beauty and management areas have been plagued by difficulties with respect to co-ordination between local authorities and the securing of adequate policy and financial priority. A duty on local authorities, as set out in paragraph 3 of the new schedule, to
<P>
seek to foster the economic and social wellbeing of communities within the aonb
<P>
is crucial. The provisions are extremely helpful although, as the NFU has pointed out, a doubt might be raised about the words
<P>
without incurring significant expenditure in doing so.
<P>
That sounds like a Treasury-driven phrase.

<P>
Like other hon. Members I hope that the Government will accept the new clause or table something similar.

<P>
<B>Mr. Nicholas Soames </B>(Mid-Sussex): I support the new clause and schedule.

<P>
Lord Renton of Mount Harry was my predecessor as Member of Parliament for Mid-Sussex for many years and has played an invaluable role, in particular in the south downs. He has great knowledge of the matter. The clause is drawn from the private Members' Bill that he presented in 1998.

<P>
I am sure that the Minister will want to accept the measure in its entirety and in its virgin form. Perhaps, having done so, he will, back at the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions, try to persuade his right hon. Friend the Secretary of State that with the additional safeguards there is no need to proceed with the lunatic plan, supported only by a socialist administration in Brighton, to turn the south downs into a national park. With the AONBs strengthened, it might now be possible for the Minister to retreat gracefully and for there to be a return to a more sensible proposition.

<P>

<B>Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown </B>(Cotswold): I, too, rise to support new clause 4 and new schedule 1. The AONBs have come of age. The National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949 put them on a par with our great national parks and gave them their current status. They are more than 50 years old. I pay tribute to the Government: the Bill will be on a par with the 1949 Act and the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, provided that it completes its remaining stages unscathed by more extreme measures. It would be a missed opportunity if AONBs were not strengthened.

<P>
I pay particular tribute to the new partnership that was established to look after the Cotswold AONB. It is working extremely well. Local authorities, local communities, conservation bodies and all those with an interest in managing the area have come together and are doing a good job. The problem is that they do not have adequate funding to carry out that job. We must consider the issue carefully. Some of the better-known AONBs have greater funding then the Cotswold AONB, which faces many of the same pressures. There is increased traffic, which every AONB faces. There are pressures on farming, especially in the Cotswolds where there are difficulties with diversification. If we are not careful, large areas of the Cotswolds could return to scrub, and that would be a pity.

<P>
Immediately outside the Cotswold AONB is the Cotswold water park, which should be included in the AONB. It is the largest area of inland water in England and Wales, but we are being besieged by hundreds-shortly to be thousands-of wooden holiday lodges, which are being built as second homes. The development is singularly inappropriate. The Minister has responsibility for planning and I ask him to consider in his quasi-judicial role whether the water park should be included in the AONB and in planning generally. We are losing one of the nation's great assets. People may not think that ex-gravel pits can be good for conservation and nature but, as the Minister knows from experience, the former pits of the Cotswold water park have settled down. Some of the rarest bird species in Europe come to visit. It would be a pity if that great national asset were not properly managed in future.

<P>
<B>Miss Anne McIntosh </B>(Vale of York): I support new clause 4 and new schedule 1. I could not let the opportunity pass without adding my congratulations to the hon. Member for Pendle. His proposal puts him on the side of the angels with the countryside bodies. That might put a new twist on his career that will not go unnoticed by his Front Bench. We might see a rise in his career yet.

<P>
I pay tribute to the work put in by the hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friends in drafting new schedule 1, which is based on the proposal of my right hon. and noble Friend Lord Renton. The AONBs and, in particular, their future management and the need for local authorities to be given a statutory duty to manage them and the ability to carry out core functions, have been omitted from the Bill. Conservation board finances, which part VI of new schedule 1 covers, will play a role in the debate.

<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> The debate is important and is probably unique in bringing together Labour and Opposition Members. This is a heart-warming occasion. I also pay tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for Pendle, who should be careful, given all the honorific references from Opposition Members. He has raised an important issue and I want to respond to it as positively as I can and to make it clear that the Government take the matter extremely seriously and are considering it closely. Of course, we fully recognise the importance of areas of outstanding natural beauty in terms of their nationally important landscapes, their contribution to biodiversity, their cultural diversity and the opportunities that they provide for a great many people to enjoy the countryside. We also recognise that many people live and work in AONBs, which are part of a wider, living countryside.

<P>
We have a great deal of sympathy with the aims of those who want to strengthen support for AONBs and to improve their administration, conservation and management. Those are not just the words of a Minister in response to the pressures of the new clause, because we are living up to our aims. The Countryside Agency budget for work in AONBs has been increased almost three-fold since we came into office, from £2.1 million in 1998-99 to £5.9 million this year. The hon. Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown) spoke about the availability of funding. I can consider funding further in relation to the Cotswolds, but I remind hon. Members that the budget has been significantly increased and that that is a measure of our support. Conservation and management of AONBs could undoubtedly be further improved, and we have been giving careful consideration to the advice that was originally prepared by the Countryside Commission.

<P>
Hon. Members will be aware of the pressure on parliamentary time and legislative space which has meant that it has not been possible to include in the Bill all the potentially deserving subjects of countryside legislation. I am aware that the proposals before us have had a long genesis; in the light of this week's events, I am not sure whether that is a new gynaecological term, but I think that we all understand my meaning. They have been supported by the Countryside Agency, and are also based on the Bill introduced in another place by Lord Renton, to whom I am happy to pay tribute.

<P>
Lord Renton was the predecessor of the hon. Member for Mid-Sussex (Mr. Soames). I should perhaps take this opportunity to respond, as I always do, to the hon. Gentleman's pleasant and friendly admonishments. I shall decline his invitation to withdraw a widely popular change in the status of the south downs. I recognise that it is not without its opponents, but it has overwhelming support. The combination of the two national parks and the AONB proposals constitute an important package that is widely supported.

<P>
The Government are currently pursuing a number of related issues which need further careful legal scrutiny. We are not prepared to support the new clause and the new schedule, and I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Pendle will ask leave to withdraw the motion. I undertake, without commitment, to consider these matters further and to consider carefully tabling Government amendments to allow the improved conservation and management of AONBs. I stand by that commitment.

<P>
In the light of my assurance-I hope that all hon. Members will trust my words on this-that we are giving the matter serious consideration, I suggest that the substantive debate that I am sure all hon. Members seek would more profitably occur when the Government have reached conclusions. All of us want to make progress in ensuring that the right arrangements for AONBs are in place. I therefore ask my hon. Friend and all those who support the new clause to withdraw it against the commitments that I have made.

<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I am grateful for the Minister's commitment. We look forward to his proposals. I do not entirely follow his reasoning. He said that the Government have not had time to develop their proposals. However, as he knows, we debate such Bills once in every 20 years. The Bill was promised in the Labour party's election manifesto three years ago. He is now promising to table amendments-presumably during the next fortnight. The time scale is not convincing. If the Government are not ready with credible amendments to improve the protection of AONBs, even though they have had many years to think about the matter, what happens during the next two weeks will not radically change the situation. I hope that I am wrong; I hope that he means what he says and that the Government will propose some sensible, practicable and credible ways to protect AONBs. If he fulfils those criteria, we shall support the changes.

<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I certainly mean exactly what I said. I was not saying that the Government have not had time to make proposals; we have been considering them for a long time. As the hon. Gentleman knows, there is intense pressure on parliamentary time and legislative space during this Session. There is a limit to how far I or my Department can secure in one Bill everything that we might wish for. It was implicit in my response that the Government will take account of the strengths and widespread nature of the positive demands and requests being made of the Government-not only from my hon. Friends but from all parts of the Committee. It is important to note that hon. Members were speaking unprompted by me; they were expressing their personal and party-political position. The Government will, of course, take that into account during the next fortnight.

<P>
<B>Miss McIntosh:</B> Will the right hon. Gentleman guide the Committee by telling us how he hopes to improve the new clause and new schedule, not only for new AONBs, but for existing ones such as the Howardian hills and the Cleveland way in the Vale of York? How will the new clause and new schedule be improved, particularly the management and funding aspects and the giving of a statutory duty to local authorities?

<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> The hon. Lady can be assured that we are considering the matter carefully. I have here three pages of detailed comment on the precise drafting of the new clause and new schedule. However, it would not be profitable now to go into a lengthy exegesis, explanation or criticism of the text. In the light of this morning's discussions, the Government will come forward with proposals that fully take account of the drafting considerations already stated.

<P>
<B>Mr. David Heath:</B> I make it clear on behalf of the Liberal Democrat party that if the Government table amendments on Report that broadly cover the area encompassed by the new clause and new schedule, we should not wish to delay their progress. That may be a problem for business managers, but members of the Committee clearly have the will to make it happen.

<P>

<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that contribution.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I want to draw the Minister's attention to one thing that I failed to mention in my speech. When he undertakes the review, will he take full account of parish councils? Parish councils represent the level of democracy that is closest to the people, and it is their perception that they are not welcomed in such forums. Will the Minister consider how parish councils can be closely involved in the initiative?

<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I am happy to consider that. As a stream of utterly misleading and fabricating articles have appeared recently in certain newspapers, suggesting that the Government are threatening parish councils, I shall take this opportunity to say that nothing could be further from the truth, as hon. Members will discover when we produce the rural White Paper. However, in general, I am happy to assure the hon. Gentleman that relevant authorities, including parish councils, will be involved because that is necessary to ensure that there is proper management, with a duty of care and support.

<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> I have no doubts about the right hon. Gentleman's bona fides in the matter, but, given the lack of time, I wonder whether it would be possible for him to put his notes into letter form, so that Committee members could read them before debating the newly drafted schedule and clause. I believe that that would inform our debate.

<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I shall consider that if pressed because I want to be as helpful as possible. However, I am uncertain about the purpose of that request because I have made the position abundantly clear in my remarks and would only repeat what I have already said. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman did not intend this, but there is an implication or innuendo in his suggestion that a letter from the Department somehow carries greater credibility than the Minister's remarks in Committee. If I feel that something additional could be gained by sending a letter to members of the Committee, I shall ensure that all members receive such a letter promptly, but I am doubtful about that.

<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> I apologise if the Minister thought that I was casting aspersions. That was not my intention. This is an important part of the Bill and, because time is short, I thought that it might inform the debate if hon. Members could read the information that is available to Mr. Llwyd<P>
the Minister. If more time were available to the Committee today, I have no doubt that the Minister would have elaborated on those points, most of which are, presumably, for public consumption.

<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I do not believe that I can add to what I have already said, but I accept the hon. Gentleman's remarks and will consider them.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gordon Prentice:</B> The Opposition have made a real meal of this. We trust the Minister, who has given cast iron assurances that the Government will table appropriate amendments in due course. In the light of those assurances, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.

<P>
Motion and clause, by leave, withdrawn.

<H4><center>Power to extend riverside and woodland<p8>`.-(1) The Secretary of State (as respects England) or the National Assembly for Wales (as respects Wales) may by order amend the definition of ``open country'' in section 1(2) to include a reference to riverside and woodland of any description.</center></H4>

<P>
Brought up, and read the First time.

<P>
<B>Mr. Prentice:</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.

<P>
In the absence of my hon. Friend the Member for Brighton, Pavilion (Mr. Lepper), I rise to speak to new clause 5, a modest clause that gives the Minister power to extend by order access to riverside and woodland. Many people get hot and bothered about this issue, especially members of the angling fraternity. I do not wish them ill in any way, but the fact is that anglers, walkers and people who enjoy paddling about in the river co-exist in many parts of the country. The Leeds-Liverpool canal runs right through the middle of my constituency and, on a summer's day, one can see cyclists cyling carefully, walkers walking along the towpaths, barges moving slowly past and anglers sitting, hour after hour, trying to catch fish. So it is possible for those various interests to co-exist. We have all received a briefing paper from national angling and fisheries organisations, which predict some sort of Armaggedon if the clause is agreed to. We must have a common-sense perspective on the issue, and I hope that when people read the briefing paper, they will bear in mind what I have just said. I am told that statutory provision for access to the riverside already exists in section 16 of the Countryside Act 1968. However, I am told that, for reasons of which I am unaware, no access orders have been made under that Act. Perhaps that provision does not go far enough. I would be grateful to hear what the Minister has to say about that.

<P>
The second leg of the new clause refers to access to woodland. Again, there is already plenty of access to woodland, but it is perfectly possible to extend the law in that way and it will not make much difference. In its latest volume, ``State of the Countryside 2000'', the Countryside Agency-that splendid organisation to which we constantly refer in Committee-says that there is already access to 1,900 sq km of Forestry Commission land and 690 sq km of land owned by English Nature. So people can already traipse through some woods in the country.

<P>
This is a modest new clause. It is unfortunate that my hon. Friend cannot be here to speak to it, but I commend it to the Committee.

<P>
<B>Mr. James Paice </B>(South-East Cambridgeshire): I am afraid that the consensus achieved by the Minister for the Environment in relation to the previous new clause does not extend to this one. I hope that the Government will resist the new clause, not least because the Countryside Agency itself has said that it does not constitute a sensible approach. The Government consulted the agency after the original White Paper was published. That was the origin of the coastal land provision that we discussed earlier, but such a provision in relation to woodland and rivers was not considered appropriate. Someone from my office spoke to the agency in the past few days, and the agency remains of the opinion that such a provision would not be appropriate in relation to woodland or rivers. Some issues are common to both of the two options. The issue of mapping is important, and we have discussed that at length, but woodland can constitute a small parcel of trees of half an acre or less, sometimes in the middle of a field, or it can cover thousands of acres of conifer plantation on the side of a hill. There is also the problem of what comprises a woodland area, the density of trees and so on. Equally, the mapping of rivers would be a very difficult exercise, partly because many different owners are involved, but also because there is a problem in defining a river. I can do no better than describe a situation in my constituency, where we have rivers and lodes, man-made rivers made when the fens were drained in the 16th and 17th century or even earlier, by the Romans.

<P>
The hon. Member for Pendle referred to canals. Dykes are waterways in some parts of the country and embankments in others-the term has different uses. The same can be true of rivers. The River Snail, which runs through my village, ceases to be a river, runs into a lode and eventually joins the Ely Ouse. There are serious issues of definition.

<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
The hon. Member for Pendle referred to instances in which there was already access, and to the remarks of national angling and fishing organisations, including the National Federation of Anglers, that have written to all members of the Committee. It was a pity that the hon. Gentleman was so disparaging about the federation's representations. It clearly has a considerable membership because it represents several organisations, including some with many members. It made the point that 3.4 million people go angling in England and Wales. Those people are becoming fully aware that their sport is under threat. If the hon. Gentleman succeeds in banning fox hunting, angling will come even more under the spotlight among country sports. Angling is estimated to generate £3.8 billion.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman referred to a canal where all activities happened in close harmony. That might be true there, but it need not be the case everywhere. Our line in Committee has been to try to use a voluntary approach. There will be locations where such activities are acceptable and where different user groups can arrive at an arrangement under which all can utilise the riverbank. However, it might not always be possible to reach such an agreement. That is why we argue that it would be wrong to enable the blanket provision that the new clause provides.

<P>
Safety is one of the most important areas. There is a serious risk to public safety, especially in fly fishing, in which casting is a constant procedure; the bait is left in the water for longer in angling.

<P>
The other aspect concerns conservation. It is becoming widely recognised that many of our rivers-be they large, small or little more than a stream-have been seriously damaged by erosion caused by livestock treading the banks and destroying the natural vegetation, and by reduced water flows due to greater extraction for domestic and industrial use. Much work is being done, especially by the Game Conservancy Trust, to demonstrate the way in which natural fish stocks can be re-established in rivers by managing the banks. The work entails fencing off areas a few metres back from the bank and allowing the vegetation to re-grow and to develop naturally. The issue has been taken up by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food through its stewardship schemes, under which farmers are encouraged to fence livestock between 3 m and 6 m away from riverbanks to prevent the erosion than can so damage river ecology. There is a significant conservation reason why it would be wrong to provide the wholesale right that the new clause would enable.

<P>
The same situation can apply to woodlands. The big difference is the issue of open access as opposed to rights of way. As the hon. Member for Pendle said, many square miles of forestry commission land and other woodland are open to the public, but access is managed. The difference is that a right to general access to woodland can become unmanaged and unmanageable. That is when such sites run into public safety difficulties, not only in relation to obvious activities such as forestry, but because of deer control, which is a major activity in forests. The rifles that people are required by law to use against deer are high powered and have a long range. In a woodland area, one cannot see whether a hunter is standing 100 yd away with a rifle, as one could on an open moor. Many serious issues must be taken into account. The voluntary approach of managed access in woodland and river banks is fine when it is sensible for the area in question and when all the users can work in harmony. However, it would not be sensible to enable the Government to create in woodland areas a blanket unmanaged access similar to that which applies on open country. I therefore hope that the Government will not agree to the new clause.

<P>

<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> I agree entirely with the hon. Gentleman's remarks. The new clause seems to run parallel to clause 3, which relates to coastal land. My understanding is the same as that which the hon. Gentleman expressed. I understand that the Government's official advisers opposed the extension of access to riverside and woodland areas when they were consulted on the matter by Ministers. I understand also that the Forestry Commission expressed strong reservations about access, for obvious reasons. English Nature and the Countryside Council for Wales also expressed concerns about the potentially damaging environmental effects of extending access to the banks of every river.

<P>
<B>Mr. Prentice:</B> Does that extend to the Yorkshire Dales national park? Last weekend, I was at Burnsall, where I visited the River Wharfe. Anglers were fly fishing from a path along the riverside. What is the position of the national park and the National Trust in respect of such activities?

<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> If I knew about their position, I would have informed the Committee of it. With respect to the hon. Gentleman, I am referring only to matters about which I have some knowledge.

<P>
I am concerned about open access to river banks, although I have no general objection to people walking along them. I have as much experience of walking along rivers as anybody else, as I was born on the banks of the River Conwy, in Betws-y-coed, where thousands of people walked up and down the riverside every day. However, that was a different situation, as the walking was managed. Furthermore, by and large, fish did not bury in those areas and were not fished for during the fishing season.

<P>
There would, however, be intense pressure upon many areas if the new clause were agreed to. If somebody disturbs a salmon that is burying, that is it for that year and there will be no more progeny from the eggs. Walking past a burying salmon is often enough to put it off, and once that happens, it is all over. That is how dangerous the problems are, and we should consider them carefully. Native salmon stocks are under huge pressure and are almost extinct in some areas. We might be hammering the final nail into their coffin. I declare an interest, as I am a fisherman and I know a little bit about these matters. With respect, I remind the Committee that some hon. Members may not have such knowledge. I am extremely concerned about the matter. If we are to spend time trying to conserve native fish stocks in the United Kingdom, we must reconsider provisions such as those which are before us, as they will undoubtedly be damaging.

<P>
The hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire also spoke about fencing off areas near river banks. Fencing is put in place for good and specific reasons; it can allow nature to retake the banks and stop cattle from polluting rivers. If fences are trampled over or trodden down, as we expect that they will be, pollution will continue, as will the cycle of further degradation of rivers, fish stocks and so on. Bird life will also be threatened. I am not averse to further access, but, for the reasons that I have given, I do not think that the new clause is sensible.

<P>
The new clause might also open up many thousands of woodlands, some of which had managed access, some of which did not. There is, of course, a fire problem. I am not saying that anyone would intentionally start a forest fire, but access of itself raises the stakes. I shall not refer again to my uncle in the Forestry Commission, lest he is accused again of being a Tory. I told him about that last week, and he was very upset. He is under the doctor as direct result of what the hon. Member for Mid-Sussex said.

<P>
Woodlands are fine if access is practicable, but blanket access to all woodland is not practicable and problems will occur. I ask the Minister whether those woodlands would encompass commercially cultivated areas? If not, how will it be managed? Regrettably, there will be a higher risk of fire as a direct result. I entirely agree with the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Paice). A voluntary approach would be far better, so that individuals, companies or farmers could allow access, but to allow blanket access would be dangerous. I have no doubt that it will lead to friction. In my opinion, the new clause is not worthy of our support.

<P>
<B>Mr. Soames:</B> I support my hon. Friend the Member for South-East Cambridgeshire and the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd). The latter spoke a great deal of sense. I declare an interest. I am a keen and regular fisherman, and I know a little about it.

<P>
I reject the new clause for reasons that have mainly been dealt with by my hon. Friend the Member for South-East Cambridgeshire. The conservation question is important. The hon. Member for Monmouth (Mr. Edwards) said that part of the Wye valley was in his constituency. He knows that the Wye was probably the greatest salmon river in England and Wales and that the salmon population has declined in the most dramatic and terrifying way, for reasons that are not yet fully understood.

<P>
Those interested in conserving the Wye fisheries have fenced off some of the up-river streams where, as the hon. Member for Meirionnydd nant Conwy told us, the salmon breed. All who have seen the process that the hen fish goes through to lay her eggs, which she digs into the river for the cock salmon to fertilise, are amazed. It is one of the wonders of nature. The salmon parr make their way down to the river, and at a certain stage the call of the sea becomes so great that the salmon migrate to the Atlantic. They later return to the same river and the same pool in which they were born. It is one of the most remarkable life cycles.

<P>
Conservation is a serious problem. In the old days in west Sussex, there was a tremendous sea trout run in the Ouse and the Adur. Volunteers and the Environment Agency are undertaking important work there, but, in a disgraceful act, the Department for the Environment, Transport and the Regions wickedly cut the agency's budget so that its work on sea trout conservation can no longer take place.

<P>
I know that the hon. Member for Pendle regards the Bill as a precursor to the anti-hunting, anti-toff revolution. It is an absurd proposition that people should be allowed to tramp up and down river banks throughout the country that others are trying to restore. He made a good point about the national parks, however, and I have been trying to work out a suitable answer. I know the stretch of water that he was talking about. I suppose that it is a matter of custom and practice that people co-exist. However, one must be careful when fly fishing. As my fly zings past my ear, I always look around hopefully in case a fellow in a yellow mackintosh is standing behind me, but so far I have failed to hook anyone. A fly is dangerous. It has a hideous barb which, if sunk into the softer parts of someone's body, would cause great pain, which could easily lead to the High Court.

<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
It is important for Ministers to understand that areas of riverbank are often set aside to restore the special plants and undergrowth that encourage insect life. That provides more food for the fish, which will help them to flourish and return to that spot. The riverside is a sensitive environment. Angling is a popular sport, as my hon. Friend the Member for South-East Cambridgeshire said. More people go fishing every Saturday than go to football matches by a factor of millions. A journalist once asked me what I thought of when I was fishing. Well, all one thinks of is trying to hook whatever one is trying to catch, which might be shocking to the Under-Secretary.

<P>
People like to fish in peace and quiet. Anglers would, if they were able, be solitary animals. I remember watching a lot of people fishing in a competition on a canal in Lancashire and it was possible to hear a pin drop. There was no noise, only deep concentration. People who fish, whether it is coarse fishing, trout fishing or salmon fishing, pay for that privacy and the right to conduct their sport in silence. The sport also allows the fish to flourish in quiet and undisturbed waters.

<P>
The Countryside Alliance conducted a survey at the Chatsworth angling fair in May, which was attended by 25,000 fishing maniacs. Three of its findings were of particular interest. First, there was overwhelming concern that an extension of access to watersides would cause irreparable damage to wildlife, which would be a loss to us all. A great deal of work has been done to encourage fish and improve riverbanks, especially for the habitat of the otter. I am incredibly fortunate to have been able to see the otter several times in the wild. It is the most shy and sensitive animal that one is likely to encounter. Work is taking place throughout the south of England-and I am sure elsewhere-to encourage the otter to return, but people trampling up and down the riverside will put those animals off. The second finding revealed grave concerns about the damage that can be caused by uncontrolled dogs off leads. Thirdly, the respondents felt strongly that any increase in access should be coupled with responsibilities.

<P>
As for woodlands, my hon. Friend the Member for South-East Cambridgeshire dealt with that matter most effectively. There are important issues that relate to game management in many woodlands. It is not possible to rear, nourish or nurture game in woods where there is a constant stream of people. People must understand that much of the countryside is laid out because of the sporting interest. It would be an act of folly to allow a right of general access to woodlands. That would disturb game and make it difficult for gamekeepers to hold a good head of game. In particular, there is the problem of disturbance by uncontrolled dogs which will be a serious one on moorland. Secondly, predator control would be hampered. I do not know whether you are aware, Mr. Stevenson, of the excellent trap for magpies-a Larsen trap. Quite often, people travelling through the country see the magpie that is caught and let it out. Magpies do untold damage in the countryside to nesting birds and eggs. That kind of predator control could become much harder. Snaring, although I do not like it, is inevitably used for control of foxes and rabbits in some places. The predation of game birds and their eggs by uncontrolled dogs would be a serious problem for many.

<P>
Shooting is conducted in this country, rightly, under a strict code of conduct, by people who are extremely conscious of safety and all that goes with it. It is important for the safety of the public that they should not intrude where shooting is happening, however much trouble shoots take-and they take great trouble-to warn people that shoots are going on. Disturbance on shooting days would be a great nuisance.

<P>
I want to mention stalking and deer management. Stalking has become, for many landowners and properties, particularly in Hampshire, Dorset, part of East Anglia and Wales, and increasingly in places such as Sussex that are more and more overrun with deer, an important source of income to the local economy. As has been mentioned, stalking must by law be undertaken with a rifle which generates a muzzle velocity of about 1,700 ft per second and which has a calibre of about .240. Those are powerful weapons, with a range of more than 2 miles. It is folly to allow access to woods where there is stalking, so that someone can be tramping around where a stalker is trying to carry out a legitimate and important aspect of conservation control and sport.

<P>
Disturbance in woodlands is a very important factor in the conservation of game and in the carrying out of duties by keepers and other people charged with similar work. I hope that the Committee will see that the clause, however well meant, is not acceptable.

<P>

<B>Miss McIntosh:</B> I was very moved by what my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Sussex had to say about the wonders of fishing. I am put at ease by the fact that the hon. Member for Pendle has reverted to his former self in tabling the provision. I assume that he knows less about fishing than I do and I have the impression that he did not consult the organisations most concerned in the matter, which would have been in order. Perhaps there was a good reason for that, which he would like to share with the Committee.

<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> This is another important debate and it has been a good one-well articulated on both sides and impassioned in parts. We are always entertained by the speeches of the hon. Member for Mid-Sussex, who displayed his undoubtedly considerable knowledge of management and sporting procedures in the country and who treated us with the delicacy that he always reserves for us. I was interested to know what he thought of in the silence of fishing. I had assumed that it was eating, but I am glad to know that his mind rises to higher things on such important occasions.

<P>
The background to the new clause is in the definitions of open countryside in the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949 and the Countryside Act 1968. Those included cliffs, foreshore, woodlands, rivers and canals. When we published our consultation paper, ``Access to the Open Countryside'', two years ago, we said that our priority was to extend access to mountain, moor, heath, down and registered common land, but that access to other types of open countryside was also important.

<P>
As the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire rightly said, we therefore asked the Countryside Agency, the Countryside Council for Wales and the Forestry Commission to report to us on the extent of access to other types of open country, especially rivers, foreshore and woodland. The agencies delivered their recommendations to us in October last year, and we have also received formal views from English Nature and the Environment Agency.

<P>
There was consensus that the Government's plans for a new statutory right of access, which we announced in our ``Framework for Action'' document last year, should not be extended to watersides or woodlands. The agencies noted that such areas of countryside were often very popular with the public-a point that has been made repeatedly this morning. However, they concluded that improved access to such land would best be delivered by the creation of new rights of way, using the powers of path creation agreements and orders available to highway authorities under the Highways Act 1980.

<P>
Hon. Members will remember that, under clause 53, highway authorities will be required to draw up rights of way improvement plans. We shall expect authorities, when drawing up their plans, to consider the need for creating new and better access to riversides. Indeed, guidance to be issued by the Department under the clause will cover precisely such issues.

<P>
On access to woodland, the agencies advised us that such access was also important as a resource for informal public recreation, but that it did not offer the same sense of openness and wilderness as mountain, moor, heath and down. Woodland, especially, often Mr. Meacher<P>
occurs in isolated pockets, is frequently inaccessible from public highways, and can often be found adjacent to otherwise intensively farmed land. Were we to create a general right of access to all woodland, the problem of inaccessible islands would be much greater, and there would be an increased risk of interference with day-to-day land management activities. Furthermore, we should not forget that the Forestry Commission already has a policy of freedom of access on foot to its estates, where they cover more than 250,000 hectares of publicly-held woodlands.

<P>
In the case of improving public access to coastal land, the Countryside Agency and the Countryside Council for Wales recommended different approaches. While the Countryside Council for Wales was not persuaded that a right of access should apply to coasts, the Countryside Agency considered that there was a strong case for new rights of access over coastal land that is uncultivated and undeveloped. Those recommendations are reflected in the Bill, which does not directly apply the new right to coastal land but provides powers to do so. We have, therefore, concluded that we should not provide for the compulsory extension of the statutory right of access to riverside and woodland in the Bill. However, let me reassure my hon. Friends the Members for Pendle and for Brighton, Pavilion that there is every likelihood that the Bill will result in more access rights to woodland.

<P>
Clause 16 contains new powers for landowners to dedicate access over their land. That will empower owners of woods, especially those that already welcome the public-such as the Woodland Trust-to ``opt-in'' to the statutory right of access. The Forestry Commission will consider the possibility of dedicating the national forest estate in the same way. The Forestry Commission and the Countryside Agency have recommended more vigorous use of existing voluntary mechanisms-to use the word that is favoured by the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy and Opposition Members in general-for improving access to the private woodland estate. The Forestry Commission will develop proposals for a package of new incentives to encourage landowners to provide access to woodlands. Similarly, we will seek more vigorous use of existing mechanisms to secure more and better access to riversides.

<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
Although the Bill may not go as far as my hon. Friend would like, I hope that he understands the reasons for the Government's decisions not to extend further a blanket statutory right of access, and is reassured by our commitment to see more and better access to riversides and woodlands, to be secured through the new power of dedication or more effective use of existing mechanisms. I am convinced that that is the right way forward.

<P>
<B>Mr. Prentice:</B> In the light of the Minister's comments, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.

<P>
Motion and clause, by leave, withdrawn.

<H4><center>New Clause 6</center></H4>
<H4><center>Maps in conclusive form to be receivable in evidence</center></H4>
<p8>`.-(1) A map in conclusive form shall be conclusive for the purposes of determining that the land so shown is access land as defined in this Act and for the purposes of determining the said boundary at the relevant date.

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(2) A document purporting to be certified on behalf of the appropriate countryside body to be a copy of or any part of a conclusive map shall be receivable in evidence and shall be deemed, unless the contrary is shown, to be such a copy.'.-[Mr. Gordon Prentice.]<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
Brought up, and read the First time.

<P>
Motion made, and Question proposed, That the clause be read a Second time.

<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (Mr. Chris Mullin):</B> Subsection (1) of the new clause proposes that a map in conclusive form should be conclusive for the purposes of determining access land, and the boundary of access land, at the relevant date. I understand why my hon. Friend has raised that point, and can offer him some reassurance. Clause 14 places a duty on countryside bodies to produce maps of open country and registered common land. Those maps will be consulted on, and issued in conclusive form, before the new right comes into effect. Clause 1 provides that access land is land that is shown as open country or registered common land on a map used in conclusive form. That has the effect that is sought by subsection (1) of the new clause, which is therefore unnecessary.

<P>
Subsection (2), however, raises an issue that merits further consideration. It would ensure that a copy of the conclusive map, which is certified by the countryside body, could be accepted as evidence unless the contrary is proved. That would put to rest potential difficulties that could arise from disputes about access land that require copies of the conclusive map to be produced in court. It could be helpful in dealing with prosecutions that follow from cases of putting up misleading notices under clause 14 or of obstruction of means of access under clause 37. Subsection (2) of the new clause would clarify beyond doubt the status of maps that are tendered to the court. We are therefore willing to consider it further with a view to tabling an amendment at a later stage.

<P>
<B>Mr. Prentice:</B> Another famous victory. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.

<P>
Motion and clause, by leave, withdrawn.

<H4><center>New Clause 8</center></H4>
<H4><center>Power of arrest</center></H4>
<p8>`.-In section 19 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, in subsection (1) there is inserted:

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``(e) arrest that person where the constable has reasonable grounds to believe that failure to do so would result in the concealment, alteration, loss, damage or destruction of anything which may be evidence of the commission of an offence or may be liable to be forfeited under section 21.''.'.-[Mr. David Heath.]<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
Brought up, and read the First time.

<P>
<B>Mr. David Heath:</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.

<P>
The new clause deals with the power of arrest of constables in the area of activity of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. The difficulty at the moment is that partial powers of arrest were included in the 1981 Act, but were amended or removed in the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, with the result that there is currently no power of arrest in wildlife legislation, with some minor exceptions. I understand that the power of arrest in the Protection of Animals Act 1911 remains in the 1984 Act if a police constable has reason to believe that someone is guilty of an offence under the Act which is punishable by imprisonment without the option of a fine-that is, for the deliberate infliction of unnecessary suffering.

<P>
The difficulty for the police and inspectors is that when they believe that a crime against wildlife legislation has occurred, there is no immediate power of arrest, so the suspected person can simply run out of the back door, race through woods and so on to where the traps are laid and remove the evidence before the police can identify it. That has occurred in several incidents recently. In one, a suspect drove around an estate on a quad bike removing set pole traps for trapping birds of prey before the police arrived because a colleague had telephoned to say that they were on the way. On another occasion, the police were interviewing a suspect when he jumped on a bike and drove off to destroy the evidence. At the moment, the police have a power of arrest only if they have reason to believe that someone has not provided an accurate name or address on an application, which is an incomplete power.

<P>
The problem with the current legislation is that it encourages police officers to arrest for the wrong reasons, which none of us wants to encourage. In one recent incident, some egg collectors were held on a pretext until a warrant could be applied for and executed. They were held on suspicion of theft of a telephone directory that was found in the boot of their car. That may have been a legitimate reason for holding the suspects, but it was not the primary reason, which was that the police needed a warrant to establish the evidence of illegal egg collecting. In another incident, an egg collector was apprehended and arrested on suspicion of car theft because the car that he was driving was not registered in his name. That was probably a pretext for holding the suspect until a warrant could be applied for and executed.

<P>
There is a lacuna in the law and it is appropriate for the police to have some power of arrest, if not for the full panoply of offences, at least for the most serious. That is missing, perhaps as the result of an omission when the Police and Criminal Evidence Bill was being considered in 1984. This is an opportunity to put right that omission.

<P>

<B>Mr. Green:</B> The hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath) has made a good case. The fact that police officers who want to make an arrest may have to go to tortuous lengths to do so suggests that the current enforcement powers are unsatisfactory and that the new clause, or a similar provision, should be added to the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> We are all concerned to ensure that wildlife law is enforced as effectively as possible. I am sympathetic to the aims of the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome but our difficulty is that it is important for police powers in this regard to be consistent with those that apply in the criminal law in general. The Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 codified and rationalised powers of arrest and established a structure that aimed to match police powers and penalties to the seriousness of the offence. The 1984 Act states that only those offences that justify a maximum penalty of up to five years in prison are automatically arrestable.

<P>
The Bill provides for higher penalties-in most cases, a prison sentence of up to six months will be possible but some offences can involve a sentence of up to two years. That falls some way short of what would normally be expected for powers of arrest to be available. Although I acknowledge some of the difficulties to which the hon. Gentleman drew attention, that is why we have not been able to include such provisions in the Bill. I am afraid that I must ask him to withdraw the motion.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> Obviously, I am disappointed by the Under-Secretary's response. It is somewhat perverse that the police have powers-I gave examples earlier-to deal with the heinous crime of removing the telephone unit from a telephone kiosk but that they do not have proper powers to arrest someone who has offended against wildlife protection legislation. If one steals a telephone directory, one should expect the due force of the law to be applied, but if one steals eggs, that does not matter-at least, it does not matter in the sense that the law is powerless to hold one on suspicion while the evidence is ascertained. There is obviously a difficulty here.

<P>
I hope that the Under-Secretary will at least consider applying appropriate protections to species of the highest conservation value, namely, those species that are listed in schedules 1, 5 and 8 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. If not, frankly, people will continue to make a mockery of the legislation. It is absurd to have races across open countryside to see who can get to a trap first when a police officer is trying to secure an arrest but cannot do anything until a warrant arrives-and by the time that it arrives, it will be too late.

<P>
I appreciate that dealing with legislation from another Department is not easy, especially when tariffs are involved. Tariffs make sense in relation to the 1984 Act-they make certain offences subject to certain arrangements. However, there is a gap in this context. If a change in the maximum sentence that applies in relation to the most important protected species is needed, so be it. That would be one way to get round the conundrum.

<P>
The fact that the Under-Secretary nodded in assent at various points during my speech gives me hope that he will at least reconsider the matter.

<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> The hon. Gentleman has fairly acknowledged the difficulty in that regard. We have explored the difficulty but we cannot see a way round it. PACE was introduced specifically to rationalise powers of arrest, so it would be difficult to create exceptions to it whenever one encountered a problem of this sort. I shall give the matter further thought, but I do not promise an easy solution.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for that comment. I understand the problem, having looked long and hard at the Police and Criminal Evidence Act in a previous incarnation.

<P>
There is clearly a mismatch here. The glaring truth is that theft is the indivisible crime that gives the police these powers. However, a crime that might be considered theft, but is in fact a wildlife offence because it is not theft from a person but from the environment, will not be punishable in the same way. That is the fundamental difficulty. However, the Under-Secretary has reassured me that the Department will give the matter serious consideration, and on that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.

<P>
Motion and clause, by leave, withdrawn.

<H4><center>New Clause 9</center></H4>
<H4><center>Town or village greens</center></H4>
<p8>`. In section 22 of the Commons Registration Act 1965, for the definition of ``town or village green'' there is substituted-

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`` `town or village green' means-

<P>
(a) land which has been allotted by or under any Act for the exercise or recreation of the inhabitants of any locality;

(b) land on which the inhabitants of any locality have a customary right to indulge in lawful sports and pastimes;

<P>

<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Ms Chris McCafferty </B>(Calder Valley): I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.

<P>
The Commons Registration Act 1965 insists that, for an open space to qualify as a green, most of the people who use it must live nearby. Villagers and locals wanting to register a green-a status that protects it from development-must show that a recognisable community lives close to the land. In urban areas, that can be difficult to achieve. As a consequence, many areas of much-loved open space are threatened by developers and their bulldozers.

<P>
Registering land as a town or village green will protect it from development. However, people can apply to register the land only if it has been used for informal recreation for more than 20 years. That is how we saved Steep Field, an area of land in Hebden Bridge where I live, 10 years ago. A great deal of work was put into establishing that the land had been used for local recreation for much longer than 20 years.

<P>
Many other applications for the registration of village greens have been less fortunate, however. The problem is that, if those using the green have not come from a defined area-callaed a locality in registration law-the registration authority may reject the application. With the expansion of urban communities, it is often difficult to define ``locality''. It is easier in a small village, but much more difficult, for example, on the outskirts of Oldham-the Minister's constituency. In an urban area, it is difficult to define who lives in the locality from which the users of an open space are drawn.

<P>
The new clause would alter the legal definition of a green so that, provided that some of the people using it came from that area, the land would still be capable of being registered. It would remove the need to define the precise locality from which the users came. It is not quite so far-reaching a provision as it might appear, because section 22 of the Commons Registration Act 1965 already contains the provisions set out in subsections (a) to (c) of the new clause. The only change is contained in subsection (d). The existing legislation is not laid out in the same way as the new clause. I believe that listing the various types of green as the new clause does would make them clearer and easier to refer to in legal documents. That would help people to establish that they form a community that uses such a green. The new clause is urgently needed, and I hope that the Minister accepts that it would help to prevent the destruction of many of our open spaces.

<P>
<B>Mrs Helen Brinton </B>(Peterborough): I support the new clause, and should like to cite a couple of examples from Cambridgeshire that reinforce the need for it.

<P>
Yesterday, Cambridgeshire county council, on senior legal advice, rejected an application to register Spring common in Huntingdon as a new green. One of the main reasons for its decision was that the 20-year period of use that had been claimed by local people did not run right up to the date of the application. The new clause would make it clear that greens can be used for any period of 20 years from 1 August 1970. The application for Spring common was thrown out purely on a technicality, and Barratt Homes is already building on the site. If that much-loved land could have been registered in the manner proposed by my hon. Friend the Member for Calder Valley (Ms McCafferty), it would have been saved from destructive development.

<P>
Another example is that of Glebe field in Stocks Hill at Castor, which adjoins my constituency of Peterborough. The land, which was originally glebe land, was subject to a compulsory purchase order by the Commission for the New Towns. Local people want to see the land protected as a village green. The original application specified too vague an area as the locality. It needed to be much more precise, but that is difficult for residents of such a fast-expanding area.

<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> The purpose of the new clause is laudable. The Government recognise that green spaces in towns and villages are precious. Areas of land that are used by people for lawful sport and recreation-especially in urban areas, but also in rural villages-are often under the threat of development, as my hon. Friend the Member for Peterborough (Mrs Brinton) described. The new clause aims to provide a definition of greens that can be more easily satisfied in today's context by an applicant seeking registration of such land. At present, applicants who wish to establish a case for the registration of a new green must satisfy three criteria. The use of the land must: constitute activities that are lawful sports and pastimes; be shown to have continued without significant interruption for not less than 20 years; and be shown to have been by the inhabitants of a specific locality.

<P>
A decision made last year in the other place slightly relaxed the third element, but still required proof that use was predominantly by inhabitants of a locality. As my hon. Friend the Member for Calder Valley said, defining a locality in the traditional context can be rather difficult nowadays, and has been the root cause of failure in several applications to register greens.

<P>
Supporters of the new clause are no doubt aware that in February this year the Government launched a consultation paper entitled ``Greater Protection and Better Management of Common Land in England and Wales'', which contained many proposals for the reform of the complex legislation affecting common land and town and village greens. They will also know that the new clause closely mirrors proposals in that paper.

<P>
However, it is the Government's responsibility to take all interests into account, and the purpose of the consultation exercise is to ensure that we can arrive at a balanced view based on the opinions expressed by all interested parties. Although we support, in principle, the proposal that it should be easier to register land as green, it raises difficult issues-for example, where land is already subject to planning consents or there have been other types of investment. The suggestion in the new clause that qualifying use could be any 20-year period since 31 July 1970 would mean that such use could have ended many years before the application to register was made. That could create significant difficulties in terms of legitimate land use and planning.

<P>
I sympathise with the purpose of the new clause, but it would be better to consider the issues in the context of wider reform of commons and greens legislation and for any necessary changes to form part of a cohesive package aimed at improving protection of those areas. We hope to announce our conclusions on the consultation exercise later in the year and I must ask that the new clause be withdrawn.

<B>Ms McCafferty:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary for his response. I am pleased to hear that the new clause will be considered as part of a package later this year, but I want to press him on that. The consultation document contains many excellent proposals, but no promise of time for legislation. The matter is urgent and on the understanding that it will be included in the Government's proposals, I shall withdraw the new clause, but I should be grateful for clarification of the time scale.

<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> My hon. Friend is probably aware that Governments do not announce legislation off the cuff. I should be in great difficulty were I to do so and I am sure that she does not want that. I can only repeat that the conclusions of the consultation exercise will be announced later this year and the document to which I referred already contains proposals along the lines that my hon. Friend wants. I cannot go further than that.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gordon Prentice:</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.

<P>
The new clause refers to the Norfolk and Suffolk broads and has the support of the Council for National Parks. It is straightforward and would put the broads on the same footing as the national parks. It would require relevant authorities to have regard to the purposes of the broads: conservation, enjoyment and navigation. Section 62 of the Environment Act 1995 confers a duty on any relevant authority to have regard to the purposes of the other 10 national parks. The Department suggested that it would be sympathetic to such an amendment and I hope that it finds favour.

<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> My hon. Friend the Member for Pendle is on a roll today and I hope that it does not go to his head.

<P>
My right hon. Friend the Minister for the Environment said that at a later stage he would consider, without commitment, amendments concerning areas of outstanding natural beauty. We are prepared to consider my hon. Friend's amendment on the same basis and I should be grateful if he would withdraw it.

<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I beg to move that the Clause be read a Second time.

<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take new schedule 3-Riding or Leading of Horses on Cycle Tracks-
<P>
Highways Act 1980 (c.66)
<P>
1. In section 329(1) of the 1980 Act (further provision as to interpretation) in the definition of ``cycle track'', after ``1972'' there is inserted ``and a right of way on horseback or leading a horse,''.
<P>
Cycle Tracks Act 1984 (c.35)
<P>
2. In section 3(1) of the Cycle Tracks Act 1984 (conversion of footpaths into cycle tracks) after ``vehicles)'' there is inserted ``a right of way on horseback or leading a horse''.'.

<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> New clause 13 and new schedule 3 would allow horses to be ridden on cycle tracks. It is a straightforward, reciprocal proposal. Under section 30 of the Countryside Act 1968, cyclists have been allowed to cycle on bridleways for many years. The argument that it is not safe for cyclists and horses to mix is thus destroyed, because the law already permits it. We propose a reciprocal arrangement whereby horse riders are able to ride on cycle ways, and countless organisations support that proposal.

<P>
I remind the Government that it is their policy to encourage horse-based activities in the countryside. In the action plan for farming-the result of the Prime Minister's summit with the farming industry at the end of March-horses are mentioned on three separate occasions. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>One significant rural-based industry centres upon horses; it provides important opportunities for diversification for farm-based activities. The Government has assigned the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food responsibility for working with the horse industry to help develop its potential for rural-based employment.

<P>
The Government will revise planning guidance to give clear encouragement to diversification  and to encourage small-scale horse enterprises on working farms 

<P>
The Government will consult publicly on proposals to extend rate relief to other horse enterprises linked to farm premises.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
None of those points relates directly to cycle paths, but it is clear that the Government want to encourage equestrian enterprises. As sure as night follows day, if one is to encourage equestrian enterprises, one must find more places where people can ride horses.

<P>
That is the basis of our argument, but I should also like to stress the issue of safety. We all know that traffic on our roads is increasing, and that includes country roads. Moreover, there is a tendency for vehicles to travel faster on country roads than in the past. Few bridleways are more than two miles long, and that is not a great distance when one is on horseback. That is why increasing numbers of horse riders, as well as cyclists, are taking to the roads for recreational purposes.

<P>
The British Horse Society estimates that there are eight horse and car-related accidents every day. That is a serious problem, and any attempt to alleviate it should be welcome. The Government acknowledge that such hazards exist, and have promised to increase rights of way for riders and cyclists, but the Bill offers little opportunity for that.

<P>
The Minister will be aware that we have received many letters from people in the equestrian world who feel neglected and are unhappy about the lack of proposals for additional horse-riding areas. I shall not pretend that allowing horses to use cycle tracks will constitute a quantum leap forward, but it would certainly be a step in the right direction. It is only fair that, if one is to allow cyclists to use bridleways, one should allow horse riders to use cycle paths. That would be a logical step forward.

<P>
A letter from Mrs Stephanie Wheeler, who is chairman of the access advisory committee of the British Horse Society, makes it clear that she agrees with me. She says that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>it is only fair that we should be able to ride on cycleways.

<P>
In the run up to this Bill, I have been involved with a lot of meetings with cyclists, and have had no disagreement with this proposal.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Many members of the British Horse Society have written to me making similar points, including a Mr. White, from Uckfield in East Sussex. We have all-including you, Mr. Stevenson-received a copy of a long letter from Sarah Bucks, who lives in London. She writes:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I would like to see the following incorporated into the bill:

<P>
Horse riders and cyclists to have reciprocal rights on bridleways and cycle paths. The government has created routes to protect the cyclist, but not the horse rider.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That underlines our concern. There have been many such letters of support, but perhaps the most important support that I can give is a document produced by the Byways and Bridleways Trust and the National Federation of Bridleway Associations. The British Horse Society, the Cyclists Touring Club and the South Pennine Packhorse Trails Trust contributed to the document and, I stress, support it-so cyclists were also involved. That group of organisations submitted the suggestion that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Consideration should be given to introducing ``reciprocal rights'' for horse riders to use cycle tracks in the same way that s.30 of the Countryside Act 1968 allows bicyclists on to bridleways.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
They go on to say that the right
<P>
could be qualified by the requirement that horse riders must give way to cyclists.
<P>
That would, probably, be better handled in a code of practice.

<P>
A new clause and a new schedule of this kind would be supported by many organisations representing the horse world and those who are involved with bridleways, as well as by the Cyclists Touring Club. Despite the fact that the new clause has been on the amendment paper for some time, I have received no correspondence from any cycling organisations-or, indeed, any others-who are against the proposal. For more than 30 years we have had an arrangement that has worked one way but not the other, and we seek to put that right.

<P>
<B>Mr. David Heath:</B> I support the new clause and the new schedule. The hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire has a good point. I had intended to raise it, but felt no need to do so once I had read the new clause and schedule. They seemed to do the job, without any further assistance from me.

<P>
I have said several times that there is a significant deficiency in the rights of way provisions, from the point of view of riders. The hon. Gentleman said that he has received a great number of letters on the subject-so have I and, I am sure, many other hon. Members. He also said that horse riders feel neglected. They feel more than neglected: they feel let down by the Bill. They expected-with good reason, as the hon. Gentleman said-that the Government would do something to extend provision for recreational riding, but there is nothing in the Bill. The only change is the restricted byway category, but that does not extend the opportunities for riding; it simply changes the status of roads that are already available to riders.

<P>
Why should it be that bridleways-such as they are-are available for cycling, but cycle tracks are not available for riding? One argument that is always used is that there is a safety issue, but as the hon. Gentleman said, it does not seem to matter when cyclists are using bridleways, which happens frequently. Another argument is that some cycle tracks are unsuitable for horses. Of course they are, just as some bridleways are unsuitable for cycling and anyone who used them might descend into a rut and might not emerge unscathed. People can make sensible decisions about whether a park in the vicinity is suitable for riding or cycling-they do not need the Government to tell them. The problem is that blanket prohibition prevents riders from using paths that might be a useful addition to the network for recreational riding.

<P>
I hope that the Bill will introduce a new provision relating to riders and that there will be a new realisation among rural local authorities and urban local authorities-riding takes place on the fringes, and sometimes in the middle, of urban areas-that we need to extend a proper network for riding. Safety issues are, quite properly, relevant-they involve not whether bikes and horses can co-exist but, as the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire said, the safety of riders who use even the smallest rural road nowadays and who are in competition with traffic. Even in the most rural areas, it is hard to find rides that are safe.

<P>
Our constituents would benefit greatly if we extended the opportunities for recreational riding, and I hope that the new clause involves an appropriate approach. The Under-Secretary may say that we need to take additional action in relation to cycleways-if so, that would be unfortunate, because I do not think that it is necessary. Some cycleways are perfectly usable as bridleways-they have simply been classified differently under earlier legislation. In a similar manner, roads used as public paths have sometimes been downgraded unnecessarily to footpaths, and are not available for use as a bridleway. If we cannot get this matter right, we shall fail a significant section of our population, who want to enjoy opportunities that are not currently available to them.

<P>

<B>Mr. Soames:</B> I warmly support the new clause and I very much agree with the comments of the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome, especially those about safety on roads. I live in West Sussex, which is an overpopulated part of the countryside, and I ride a great deal, but I can think of no road on which it is still safe to ride without extreme caution and without a view to getting off the road as quickly as one can.

<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for South-East Cambridgeshire started his speech by discussing the contest between horses and bicycles. In that contest, my money is firmly on the horse to win hands down-

<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I am trying to envisage the hon. Gentleman on a bicycle, but I am struggling with the concept.

<P>
<B>Mr. Soames:</B> I agree with the Under-Secretary-it is not the sort of conveyance that I am used to. I always prefer someone else to do the work for me.

<P>
It is clearly bonkers to exclude horses from cycleways. I hope that Committee members will take seriously the many representations that all of us have received from people who ride and from riding groups across the length and breadth of the country. A very sensible lady, who lives in Lindfield, which is in the heart of my constituency, came to see me in my surgery last Friday. She said that she finds it very difficult to find somewhere where she can go for a long ride.

<P>
I warmly welcome the fact that riding is such an enormously popular sport-hundred of thousands of people ride-and I strongly recommend it. The farming summit at No. 10 produced a new plan that involves encouraging farmers to diversify into horses. I am extremely leery of that plan, incidentally, because a horse is not an animal that one can take on board, like another crop-horses need to be looked after and handled carefully. Where possible, riders of horses should have the same facilities accorded to them as those who cycle.

<P>
I strongly recommend riding. Is there anything that the Under-Secretary can do to strengthen the Highway Code, or whatever other mechanism might be appropriate, to make motorists more aware that, in rural areas, they are highly likely to meet adults and children riding horses and ponies? They need to drive more carefully, with respect for the other people who use the roads, whether in cars, on bicycles, on horses or on their flat feet. I support my hon. Friend's new clause, and I hope that the Committee will give it a fair wind.

<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> It is not quite true that the Bill does nothing for horse riders. It deals with rights of way for horse riders and cyclists by ensuring that roads used as public paths will carry rights of way for horse riders. More bridleways will be created through the rights of way improvement plans in the Bill.

<P>
I understand the broad proposition that the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire is making, that if cyclists can use bridleways, horse riders should be allowed to use cycle tracks. However, the argument is not entirely symmetrical. There would be practical difficulties associated with the granting of such a general power. The hon. Gentleman is a reasonable man and I am sure that he can envisage them.

<P>
The new clause would provide for horse riders to use all cycle tracks. Cycle tracks tend to have a smooth surface and be of a light construction. The passage of horses over them would, in many cases, damage or break up the surface, making them dangerous or impassable for cyclists. Where width is constrained, there could be conflicts between users which do not occur on bridleways, where cyclists are required to give way to other users. Some cycle tracks might be appropriate for joint use, and we would have no problem with that. However, local authorities already have the power to replace a cycle track with a highway for shared use by horse riders, cyclists and walkers, should that be appropriate in any given circumstances. That could be either a bridleway, or an all-purpose highway from which motor vehicles were prohibited.

<P>
The Government are sympathetic to the needs of those on horseback. However, the right solution is often not to impose those needs on others, but to make separate provision. Local knowledge and judgment are vital in ensuring that the provision for cycling, horse riding and walking is appropriate to the demand that exists, and to the physical circumstances. We believe that decisions on appropriate highway use can best be taken locally by individual highway authorities. They should not be determined by a blanket provision such as the new clause.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> Given that the reason for designating a piece of land as a cycle track is, principally, to segregate cyclists from motorised traffic, and given that a new category of restricted byway has now been introduced, would it be possible under the Bill for a local authority to upgrade cycle tracks, where appropriate, to restricted byway status? That could provide the flexibility that everyone needs.

<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I am advised that that would not be possible. However, if further information appears during my remarks, I shall share it with the hon. Gentleman.

<P>
I have learned, during the course of the Bill, that many demands are made by different leisure groups, which are all reasonable in themselves and all things that we want to encourage, yet they are sometimes absolutely irreconcilable. Allowing horses to use cycle tracks with a soft surface would sometimes, but not always, render them impassable for cycles. The other day, I cycled with my daughter from Beamish to Consett, along the cycle track that has been developed there. Some parts of the track have a hard surface, but much of it is soft, and if horses were allowed to use those parts, it would become impassable by bicycle. I have been on holiday to west Sussex for the past four years, and, in the course of extensive walks around local footpaths and bridleways, have come across footpaths-never mind cycle tracks-that are impassable to pedestrians in places because of heavy use by horses.

<P>
My point is that, sometimes, two perfectly reasonable kinds of leisure activity conflict, and a choice has to be made. In some cases, it will be appropriate for local authorities to make provision for horse riders, and we do not rule that out, but the problem with the new clause is that it would apply to all bridleways. As I have explained, local authorities already have the power to create highways shared by horse riders, cyclists and walkers, and shared use facilities are not the right solution in every case. I therefore hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the new clause.

<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I am disappointed. The Minister did not listen to my arguments, nor to those of other hon. Members. As the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome said, not every cycle way is ideal for horses, but, equally, not every bridleway is ideal for cyclists. Cyclists are able, if they wish, to use a bridleway-however rutted, churned up or impassable it may have become as a result of horses' hooves-but there is no reciprocal arrangement.

<P>
I remind the Minister that the new clause gained support from the Cyclists Touring Club, which has, I am sure, thought through its potential impact. The horse riding world will be extremely disappointed by the Government's response. I concede his point about rights of way improvement plans: I was aware of the existence of that power. However, the new clause would have been a simple and entirely logical way of extending opportunities for horse riding, and I therefore wish to press it to a vote.

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(2) In paragraph 3(2), at the end there is inserted ``or the Secretary of State may cause a public local inquiry to be held following the publicity for orders having been undertaken as prescribed in paragraph 3 of Schedule 15 pursuant to a direction from the Secretary of State to the authority.''.'.-[Mr. Paice.]<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
Brought up, and read the First time.

<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss new clause 15-Notification of local inquiries-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`. In paragraph 7(2)(a) of Schedule 15 to the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, after the words ``to be held'' there is inserted ``and notify the applicant in writing of the date, time and venue of such an inquiry at least 28 days prior to the opening of that enquiry''.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> The new clauses have the same provenance as the previous one. They originate from representations made by organisations such as the Byways and Bridleways trust, the National Federation of Bridleway Associations, the British Horse Society and the Cyclists Touring Club, and are intended to help the Government to implement the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. New clause 14 would provide an extra, fast-track approach, in that the Secretary of State could proceed to a public local inquiry without needing to fulfil local authority obligations laid down in paragraph 3 of schedule 14 to the 1981 Act. If the Secretary of State believed that a particular issue needed proper examination, he could speed up the process by proceeding rapidly to such an inquiry. New clause 15 would amend schedule 15 to the 1981 Act by ensuring that applicants were notified
<P>
in writing of the date, time and venue of  an inquiry at least 28 days prior to the opening of that enquiry.
<P>
The Minister will probably say that applicants would be notified in any case, but such a fundamental obligation ought to be included in the Bill.

<P>
I stress that the new clauses are designed to improve the operation of the 1981 Act. They are supported not only by the organisations to which I referred, but by the Country Landowners Association. The association
<P>
broadly supports this initiative to speed up these procedures, while respecting the interests of all of the parties involved.<P>

<P>
The association continues by making a particularly telling point:
<P>
Rights of Way sections in local authorities are often not given priority-
<P>
we all recognise that-
<P>
and delays in processing applications result. Applications should be dealt with as speedily as possible to establish clarity and certainty about the rights that exist for users, owners and prospective purchasers of land alike.
<P>
That is an extremely important statement in support of new clause 14.

<P>
 As I said, new clause 14 is designed to be helpful. We all recognise that local authorities are under immense pressure, and this debate has made it clear that rights of way take second place to other matters for which authorities are responsible. Delays occur when a challenge is made to a right of way, and it is right and proper to try to find a way to speed up the process. If the Secretary of State is convinced by a particular issue, he should be able to proceed quickly to a public local inquiry. On that basis, I ask members of the Committee to accept the new clauses.

<P>

<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> New clause 14 would empower the Secretary of State to cause a public local inquiry to be held when he has received a request for a direction that requires an authority to determine an application for an order that modifies the definitive map. It would also requrie that, before such an inquiry is held, the publicity requirements under paragraph 3 of schedule 15 to the 1981 Act be followed.

<P>
The applicant for a definitive map modification order may request a direction requiring that a determination be made, if the authority to which the application was made has not determined it within 12 months of receipt. It is not necessary to hold a public inquiry to establish why an authority has not reached a decision within that period because that would lead only to further delay. I hope that I have understood the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire correctly in this regard. We have not introduced powers to hold inquiries when requests are made for similar directions under the provisions in new schedule 12, which relate to applications for closures or diversions. I appreciate the good intentions that lie behind the hon. Gentleman's proposals, but I am afraid that I must ask him to withdraw the new clauses.

</UL></FONT>

<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
Brought up, and read the First time.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gordon Prentice:</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a second time.

<P>
The new clause refers to access to Crown land. Although it looks complicated, it is pretty simple. The general principle is that legislation applies to Crown land only if that is specified in legislation. The definitive map provisions apply to Crown land because the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949 said that they should, but the Highways Act 1980 and the Town and Country Planning Acts do not have such provisions. It follows that it is not possible to claim a public right of way over Crown land on the basis of 20 years of use.

<P>
I discussed that matter with my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Norfolk (Dr. Turner), whose constituency contains the Sandringham estate. I do not know whether there are particular problems about access along permissive paths on the Sandringham estate-the Under-Secretary may clarify the situation.

<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> We wholeheartedly support the principle of providing better access to Crown land, which underlies the new clause, but we are not convinced by the proposed means of achieving it.

<P>
First, Departments and Government agencies are already doing much to encourage access. That does not mean that we are satisfied with the present position-we recognise that more needs to be done.

<P>
We are not against the idea of codes of practice-we already use them. For instance, the Environment Agency for England and Wales is guided by a code of practice on conservation, access and recreation It guides the agency about how it should make its land available to the public for recreational use. That is done on many sites, notably at lock sites on the River Thames, and at numerous others, including flood banks beside rivers and coasts. The new clause appears to focus primarily on permissive linear access. In some cases, the access that is provided by the agency has been secured by dedication of new rights of way across structures or land.

<P>
We doubt whether placing a statutory duty on the Countryside Agency to draw up a general code is the best way to ensure that more access is delivered. First, there could be duplication and confusion with other codes. For example, the Countryside Agency and the Countryside Council for Wales will draw up codes of practice for landowners and walkers because the legislation sets out their respective rights and responsibilities. It is difficult to see the case for another general code specifically targeted at Crown land.

<P>
Secondly, the code would apply to different Departments. The land management requirements of the Ministry of Defence, the Forestry Commission and the Duchy of Cornwall are all very different, but each of them, in their own way, seeks to encourage access. The Ministry of Defence is taking its responsibilities in that regard very seriously. It would be even more complicated if Government agencies, such as the Highways Agency, British Waterways and NHS Estates, were included. In drawing up a single code to cover all Government land, it would be difficult to prevent the content from being dictated by the lowest common denominator-which I am sure my hon. Friend the Member for Pendle does not have in mind-or too complicated to be useful.

<P>
We need to bear in mind that the code would have to cover a range of land uses. A better and more flexible approach would be for Department and agencies to draw up their own codes, tailored to their own circumstances. They could do that in consultation with other relevant organisations, including the Countryside Agency and the Countryside Council for Wales.

<P>
I share my hon. Friend's wish to promote public access to Crown land, but, for the reasons that I have outlined, I am not sure that another code, produced by the statutory countryside bodies is, necessarily, the best way to achieve that. I must, therefore, ask him to withdraw.

<P>
<B>Mr. Prentice:</B> Given what the Minister has said, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.

<P>
Motion and clause, by leave, withdrawn.

<B>Ms McCafferty:</B> The Countryside and Rights of Way Bill is an excellent Bill. It increases the protection of our wildlife, and no one should be in any doubt about that.

<P>
My concern, which is shared by many wildlife groups, is that many of the species that are in decline do not live in sites of special scientific interest-they are not that bright. Although the Bill does a great deal for our best SSSIs, help is needed for those species, such as the dormouse, the vole and the skylark, who do not live there.

<P>
Hon. Members will be aware that the water vole-the lovely Ratty from ``The Wind in the Willows''-was once common throughout England, but is now in serious decline. It is particularly serious in my own county, Yorkshire. We have lost 97 per cent. of our voles, and, unless something is done about it, they will be extinct within 10 years, not only in Yorkshire, but throughout Britain. Too many species are becoming rare.

<P>
The Bill gives us an opportunity to reverse the decline, and biodiversity action plans-species rescue plans, as it were-for endangered animals and plants are the way forward. Such plans already exist, but they are voluntary; there are no legal powers to support them. I know that the Government-this Minister, in particular-are committed to them, but another Government may not be. That may be an unkind thing to say, but we need an insurance policy. The new clause would provide that.

<P>
The new clause would, perhaps, persuade local authorities to undertake and support the plans. My aim is to get the Government to give the proposal legal backing. There is a legal precedent: section 352 of the Greater London Authority Act 1999 requires the mayor-our new mayor of London-to prepare and publish a biodiversity action action plan for London. Why should London get all the best things? I want to see a legal requirement on my local authority and all the others in Britain, and I would like the Secretary of State to place such a duty on all local authorities. That is the way forward, and I hope that the Minister will take a sympathetic view of the matter.

<P>
I know that we are in a hurry, Mr. Stevenson, but I beg your indulgence. The Minister has a copy of the special edition of ``The Wind in the Willows'' that was ``revised in 2005''. He will note that poor old Ratty is missing from the story because, by 2005, all the water voles had disappeared. The jacket contains the following quote:
<P>

<P>
``If only that good old Mr. Meacher had included measures on species recovery programmes in his otherwise splendid Countryside Bill'', said Mole.

<P>
``Perhaps Ratty would still be with us now''.<P>

<P>
If the action plans were included in the Bill, the book would doubtless become particularly valuable.

<P>
<B>Mr. David Kidney </B>(Stafford): New clause 20 also recognises that SSSI status has proved a success under previous Labour and Conservative Governments. The Bill intends to strengthen protection of precious species and habitats in SSSIs. However, a considerable amount of damage and loss is occurring outside SSSIs, and species and habitats in such outside areas deserve recognition and protection as well.

<P>
Which member of the ministerial team could possibly be the rat who would turn down new clauses 18 and 20? Throughout the country there are a number of Mr. David Kidney<P>
local sites-often called wildlife sites-that contain important wildlife worthy of recognition and protection. Local sites have proved successful on the basis of good will and co-operation between local authorities, wildlife trusts and others, but it is in such sites that the greatest loss and damage has occurred. In Burton, which neighbours my Staffordshire constituency, local site status was conferred on the Stretton cement works in August 1996. By April 1998, it had been totally destroyed by site clearance works for a new development. Some 26.5 hectares of willow and hawthorn scrub, swamp and marshy grassland were lost.

<P>
Stafford common, which is in my constituency, is an area of semi-improved grassland that totals 58.5 hectares, and is home to bulbous buttercup, knapweed and pig-nut. It has wetland areas that contain many species of rush, cuckoo-flower, marsh arrow-grass and nesting waders, and is supposedly the only site in Staffordshire where the rare strawberry clover grows. We were told that Stafford common resisted an application for housing development that would have undoubtedly resulted in great loss and damage. For example, an access road for such a development would be likely to pass through the wetland area.

<P>
The loss of local sites was mentioned in the consultation paper that preceded the Bill, and the Government recognise the importance of the issue. In response to the concerns that were expressed, they set up the local sites review group, which this year published a report containing a number of recommendations. Those recommendations included establishing national guidelines; providing information, support and advice for site owners: targeting help from existing grant schemes such as countryside stewardship; conducting research into problems arising on sites; imposing a duty on local authorities to identify sites and maintain local sites systems; and imposing a duty on English Nature and the Countryside Council for Wales to report on the status of such sites.

<P>
I am not seeking the level of protection for local sites that SSSIs enjoy, but we need to raise their profile and increase appreciation of the value of the wildlife that they contain. I am keen to see greater recognition and protection of local sites, and the new clause is the best way in which to achieve that. It would legislate with a light touch, but result in a tangible conservation gain.

<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> As fans of ``The Wind in the Willows'' will know, the serious question that Ministers must answer is which of them is to play Mr. Toad.

<P>
I rise to speak in favour of new clause 18, to which I and several of my hon. Friends have been happy to put our names. As has been said several times, the protection of wildlife and endangered species outside the SSSI network is as important as the strengthening of SSSIs themselves. Given that we all agree that such Bills appear once every couple of decades or so, it would be neglectful-

<P>
