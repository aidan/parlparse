<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06072035000226"></a>The
Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to discuss the
following: clauses 541 to 592 stand part, Government new clauses 45 to
160, Government new clauses 162 to 240 and Government new clauses 412
to
416.</div><a name="06072035000020"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06072035000227"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs (Vera
Baird):</b> Good morning, Mr. Illsley. We propose
that parts 18 and 19, which deal with the allotment of shares and share
capital generally, should be completely replaced as part of the
restatement exercise. Assuming that the Committee agrees to the
changes, I intend to oppose clause 540 standing part, and similarly to
oppose the Question on clauses 541 to
592.</div><a name="06072035000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government
new clauses replace clauses 540 to 592, with the following exceptions:
those elements of clause 583 relating to the allotment of debentures
and the transfer of shares in debentures; clause 584, which will be
restated in the new clauses dealing with debentures and transfer of
securities; and clause 585, which is being restated in the new clause
dealing with
distributions.</div><a name="06072035000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
addition, the new clauses restate various provisions of the Companies
Act 1985. Without exhaustively listing them, they relate to the
allotment of shares, alterations to a company&#146;s share capital,
variations of class rights, reductions of share capital, shares no bar
to damages, serious loss of capital, general rule against acquisition
of own shares, financial assistance, redeemable shares, purchase of own
shares, Treasury shares, capital redemption reserves and various
associated provisions, and provisions relating to the persons who may
be appointed to conduct valuation of non-cash
assets.</div><a name="06072035000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">As we
explained when debating clause 675 stand part, this restatement
exercise has necessarily resulted in some reordering and restructuring
of parts 18 and 19. In some cases, the new clauses are different in
structure from their counterparts in the Bill, but our starting point
is the restatement exercise. We are not making substantive changes in
the law unless they are needed to ensure that the restated provisions
are compatible with the other provisions of the Bill. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column837" />Column number: 838</div>However, a small number of changes to provisions that are restated have
been required to ensure compatibility with European Union law. A very
small number of changes are also required to give effect to what would
have been Government amendments to existing clauses had the clauses in
question not been restated in the new clauses in this group. I shall
turn to those and take hon. Members through
them.</div><a name="06072035000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">First, we have
removed the requirement imposed in clause 582 for a private company
that makes a purchase of own shares out of capital to file a statement
of capital with the registrar. It is unnecessary because such a company
is already under an obligation to file a statement of capital when
buying its own shares; there is no need for an additional
requirement.</div>
<a name="06072035000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, we have taken the
opportunity in the restatement of what are currently clause 561 about
the reconversion of stock into shares and clause 589 concerned with the
form of notice that must be given to the registrar, when a company has
redenominated its share capital, to clarify that the requirement
applies only to limited
companies.</div><a name="06072035000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
clauses 414 and 415 restate the law on the independence of persons
required to value non-cash assets, for example in connection with an
allotment of shares by a public company. The new clauses have the same
effect as section 108 of the 1985 Act, but spell out the full statutory
auditor qualification requirement rather than cross-referring to the
statutory auditor provisions to be restated in part 35 of the
Bill.</div><a name="06072035000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are seeking
power to make changes to some of the restated provisions in the group,
in particular the provisions on capital maintenance, which have been
foreshadowed in debates in the other place. I shall say more about that
when we debate clauses 161, 241 and 306. It is the largest group of
restated provisions and we are clearly not expecting members of the
Committee to consider the issue in detail now. As we said during the
debate on clause 675, we shall be consulting interested parties on the
new clauses during the summer with the limited purpose of making sure
that we have not made any unintended changes to the law. None the less,
it is an important job that must be done and we are grateful that the
Law Society, in particular, has offered its
assistance.</div><a name="06072035000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the basis that there will be further opportunities to amend the
restated provisions, if necessary, will members of the Committee lend
their support to our approach to the restatement exercise and vote in
favour of the amendments in new clauses 45 to 160, 160 to 240 and 412
to 416 when we reach them? On the assumption that that will happen, I
ask them to oppose clause 540 and clauses 541 to 592 standing part of
the
Bill.</div><a name="06072035000029"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06072035000228"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Jonathan Djanogly</b> (Huntingdon) (Con): We have now reached
part 18 and the Minister has set out how the Government intend to deal
with the new clauses. I have set out our party&#146;s position and I
shall not repeat our general stance. It will, in effect, equate to our
abstaining on the votes on the basis that we shall need the summer to
consider the new clauses and take advice on their
implications.</div> <a name="06072035000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">As for
part 18, of all the various parts, consolidation is as welcome there as
anywhere. There is no doubt that, when practitioners complained about
the lack of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column838" />Column number: 839</div>consolidation it was often the fact that the allotment provisions would
be in one piece of legislation and the pre-emption provisions would be
in another piece of legislation that was the upsetting aspect of
non-consolidation. To that extent, the general move is welcomed and we
can discuss some more specific aspects as we
proceed.</div><a name="06072035000031"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06072035000229"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Quentin Davies</b> (Grantham and Stamford) (Con): On a point
of order, Mr. Illsley. I am confused about how we are to
proceed this morning. If the Government intend to vote against clauses
540 to 592 standing part, are we to debate the amendments to them first
and then vote on the clauses standing part in a block at the end? Is
that to be the
procedure?</div><a name="06072035000032"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06072035000230"></a>The

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06072035000233"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> We now move on to commissions, discounts and
allowances. The clause deals with companies paying commission, and
states that the payment must be authorised in the articles and must not
exceed 10 per cent. of the share issue price. In practice, the
provision, which seems to have been around for ever and a day, has
little purpose in this day and age. If a company wants to get round it
in its commission arrangements with, say, an investment bank on a
placing, in addition to the 10 per cent. commission a corporate finance
fee could be charged, effectively topping up the amount paid to the
stockbrokers doing the placing.</div>
<a name="06072035000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">More to the point, if there is
to be a cap on commission, what is the relevance of the figure
of 10 per cent? In the Lords Grand Committee, Lord Sainsbury
simply said words to the effect that the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column839" />Column number: 840</div>provisions had been around for 100 years and the Government were not
persuaded to change them. I see some merit in making it necessary for
commission payments to be authorised in a company&#146;s articles,
but not in making it necessary to operate a cap on the amounts payable.
On that basis, we have tabled our preferred amendment No. 528, which
would delete the requirement for a cap on commission. As a second
preference we have tabled amendment No. 532, which provides for the cap
to be overruled with the specific approval of the company&#146;s
members. In such circumstances we see no reason why a cap should apply.
</div><a name="06072035000044"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06072035000234"></a>Vera
Baird:</b> As the hon. Gentleman said, the clause restates the
existing rules in sections 97 and 98 of the 1985 Act, which limit the
amount of commission that a company can pay to those who subscribe for
its shares to 10 per cent., or such lower amount as may be specified in
the articles. Amendments Nos. 528 530 and 528 would relax the provision
by removing the 10 per cent. cap, and by allowing commission at any
level as long as its payment was authorised by the articles. It would
thus create a way round the prohibition on issuing shares at a
discount. That prohibition is part of the capital maintenance rules,
the purpose of which is to protect creditors. When a company is new,
creditors can assume that it has raised at least the value of its
nominal capital. Allowing deep discounting, even if that is disguised
as a large commission, enables the unscrupulous company promoters to
create an empty shell that has the appearance of a well funded company
but which in fact is not one. That can be a particular disadvantage for
longer-term creditors.</div>
<a name="06072035000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">The other amendments in the
group would marginally tighten the rules, enabling members to approve a
rate of commission that would be effective as a limit if it was smaller
than 10 per cent. I am not sure whether that is intended to be an extra
element of the authority given to directors under clause 542, but the
option of a provision in the articles and a 10 per cent. maximum are,
in our view, sufficient. Setting the rate in the articles also has the
benefit of increased transparency. Given that explanation, I hope that
the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="06072035000196"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.15

Djanogly:</b> I accept the Minister&#146;s explanation, but
the purpose of the clause would be to stop unscrupulous companies
charging high commissions. As I explained, one could drive a coach and
horses through that in any event by charging fees rather than
commissions. I feel that my point is still valid, but I hear what the

certainly helpful. We welcome the reform of authorised share capital,
or what one legal commentator called the &#147;tedious
fiction&#148;. It has become meaningless, so on its abolition it will
not be missed. However, will the Minister explain the transitional
arrangements for existing companies&#151;for instance, those whose
authorised capital is stated in their memorandum and articles of
association? Will that simply be ignored once the Act comes into force,
and will companies be required to make
changes?</div><a name="06072035000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 558
deals with the alteration of the share capital of limited companies,
and relates to section 121 of the 1985 Act. That section refers to a
company limited by shares or by guarantee, whereas clause 558 refers
only to a limited company. Under section 121, a company can alter its
share capital in accordance with the section only if so authorised by
its articles. Clause 558 does not contain the same restriction or
include a provision to cancel shares, as section 121 does.</div>
<a name="06072035000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">In debates in the Lords, the
Opposition wanted a statutory framework for the conversion of one class
of shares into another with the same nominal value. The
Government&#146;s view was that the clause does not deal with rights
attached to shares but with the level and value of the share capital.
The Government did not want a company to allow for the alteration of
rights by way of an ordinary resolution, but there was a strong
practitioners&#146; request for a mechanism to convert classes of
shares.</div> <a name="06072035000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Law
Society&#146;s June 2005 paper suggested that there should be a
provision for a procedure to convert one class of shares into another
in which the nominal value of the shares into which they were converted
was greater. The Law Society wanted a mechanism to deal with the
difference in nominal value, so that there was no unauthorised
reduction in capital.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column841" />Column number: 842</div><a name="06072035000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">I appreciate that it is a very
technical matter, but it is an important one in practical terms,
especially when a company has not been doing well and needs fresh
capital. That often initiates a reorganisation of share capital,
sometimes with an intake of venture capital. Venture capitalists
normally require preferred shares of one form or another, and the share
capital problem often arises as a result of the conversion of existing
shares. Amendments Nos. 465 and 466 would reflect that by providing
that a conversion does not constitute a variation of
rights.</div><a name="06072035000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 468 and 469 deal with clause 564 and the variation of class rights
of companies with share capital. Section 125 of the 1985 Act deals with
the same issue, saying that the rights attaching to a class of share
can be altered in accordance with any provision of the company&#146;s
articles. Clause 564 states that there must be at least 75 per cent.
agreement between the shareholders within a class before their share
rights can be varied. However, it is questionable whether the clause as
drafted sets a statutory minimum. Clause 564(3) simply
says:</div><a name="06072035000189"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;This is
without prejudice to any other restrictions on the variation of the
rights.&#148;</div><a name="06072035000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is nothing to say that the restrictions must be more onerous, which
seems to be the Government&#146;s intention as stated in the notes to
the Bill. Could not such restrictions therefore be less onerous?
Furthermore, why did the Government decide to abolish the 1985 Act
right to allow class rights to be varied with less than 75 per cent.,
if the articles so provide, in what we thought was meant to be a
deregulatory Bill? Those provisions are reflected in amendments Nos.
468 and 469.</div><a name="06072035000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 470 deals with clause 565, which is a more specific addition to
section 125 of the 1985 Act relating only to companies with no share
capital. The same issues in clause 564 apply here. The Government seem
to be trying to introduce a statutory minimum level of agreement
between members of the same class. A similar amendment, No. 470, has
been tabled to clause
565.</div><a name="06072035000064"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06072035000239"></a>Vera
Baird:</b> As the hon. Gentleman said, amendments Nos. 465 and
466 would expressly permit a company to convert its shares from one
class to another by passing an ordinary resolution. That is expressed
to be subject to the caveat that such a conversion would not amount to
a variation of class rights. The driver is clearly a desire to
facilitate the re-designation of shares&#151;for example, where a
company wants to convert As to Bs&#151;without changing the rights
enjoyed by the holders of those
shares.</div><a name="06072035000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">The matter was
debated in Grand Committee, and my noble Friend Lord McKenzie
subsequently wrote to Lord Hodgson on 2 May 2006. The letter is in the
Library of the House, and I expect that the hon. Gentleman has had the
opportunity to read it. Having discussed the point with the Law
Society, we concluded that what Lord Hodgson described as the
conversion of shares from one class to another, which has implications
for minority shareholders and is therefore subject to a more
restrictive statutory regime than that envisaged by the noble lord,
appears to amount to no more than the re-designation of a class of
shares.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column842" />Column number: 843</div><a name="06072035000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">Section 128(4) of the 1985 Act
clearly envisaged a company assigning a name or other designation to
any class of shares, as it requires a company to give notice to the
registrar. However, the Government do not see the need for the Bill to
regulate how the company takes that
decision.</div><a name="06072035000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 468 and 470 concern how class rights may be varied under the Bill.
Clauses 564 and 565 will insert new sections 125 and 125A into
the 1985 Act to prescribe the minimum requirements for
variation of class rights: either the consent in writing of three
quarters of the holders of the class or a special resolution of that
class. However, if and to the extent that a company has adopted a more
onerous regime for the variation of class rights, it must comply with
the more onerous regime.</div>
<a name="06072035000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendments would enable a
company&#146;s members to make provision for less onerous as well as
more onerous conditions to apply to variation than those prescribed in
statute. Variation of class rights might reduce the relative power of
one class of shareholders vis-Ã -vis another, and might amount in
the worst-case scenario to a fraud on the minority. That is clearly
undesirable, and it is only right that stringent conditions should
apply to a proposed variation of class
rights.</div><a name="06072035000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No.469 to clause 564 concerns the transitional arrangements that must
be made for existing companies that have sanctioned the variation of
class rights under section 125 in circumstances in which the variation
has not taken effect at the date that the Bill comes into force. As we
have said before in Committee, the Bill is not the place to make such
transitional
arrangements.</div><a name="06072035000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">Section
125 provides that, in certain circumstances, a variation provision in
the articles will prevail, notwithstanding the fact that it is less
onerous thanthe statutory regime&#151;and we accept that.
The circumstances in which this exception to the general rule applies
are constrained under section 125(4) depending on where the rights are
attached to the shares&#151;whether in the memorandum or
elsewhere&#151;and when the provision with respect to their variation
was included in the articles.</div>
<a name="06072035000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is also understood that
companies rarely make use of the current flexibility to have less
onerous conditions for a variation of class rights. We therefore took
the view that a minimum requirement for a 75 per cent. majority of the
class in question should be imposed to simplify the provisions on
variation, as recommended by the company law
review.</div><a name="06072035000072"></a>

Baird:</b> The amendment relates to information that is to be

<a name="06072035000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">We take the approach that it is
unnecessary in the context of the statement of capital to draw a

reference in clause 560(3)(d) to amounts paid up is, therefore,
intended to apply not only to amounts paid up in cash but to amounts
paid up by the transfer to the company of a consideration other than

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06072035000253"></a>Mr.
Davies:</b> It would be remiss of the Committee to pass new
company legislation without considering in detail two important
matters. One is a theoretical problem of long standing, an issue of
principle that underlies not only this clause but a number of others.
The other is a very practical problem in relation to which people
outside this place will look to Parliament to produce a solution. In
the two amendments and the new clause I am trying to bring together
both those problems with a view to trying to solve the practical
one.</div> <a name="06072035000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">The theoretical
problem concerns what constitutes equity capital, and to what extent
equity capital should constrain the payment of dividends. Although it
is theoretical, it has enormous practical significance and it relates
directly to this clause, which deals with the ability of companies to
reduce their capital.</div>
<a name="06072035000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">All Committee members with
business experience will have been brought up with the notion that
equity capital, shareholders&#146; funds and net worth are all
equivalent expressions. It is divisible into four categories: paid-in
nominal share capital, the share premium account, reserves and the
profit and loss account. We were all also brought up on the principle
that dividends are paid only out of reserves or those reserves that are
distributable&#151;I do not have time to go into the distinction
between distributable and non-distributable reserves&#151;or the
profit and loss and account, in other words the current profit for the
year. </div><a name="06072035000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paying a
dividend out of reserves is an exceptional thing to do. It requires
some justification and explanation. It would be deeply shocking to pay
dividends out of any other aspect of capital, out of the share premium
account or out of nominal share capital. That is a principle that
everyone has been brought up on and I am not sure that everybody has
thought it through very
clearly.</div><a name="06072035000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">If one thinks
about it&#151;we owe it to ourselves and others to think about it
quite carefully&#151;these distinctions make no conceptual sense and
no economic sense either. They are merely semantic distinctions. They
are a matter of the conventional use of language. It actually does not
matter at all whether a company issues a million shares at &#163;1 at
par and then has a nominal share capital of &#163;1 million and no
share premium account or whether it issues 500,000 shares at &#163;2
and ends up with &#163;500,000 of nominal share capital and
&#163;500,000 of share premium account. It makes no economic
difference at all.</div><a name="06072035000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me go further. It actually makes no economic difference whether a
company retains a substantial amount of its earnings, or perhaps all
its earnings, and never pays a dividend and thereby accumulates
substantial reserves, but maybe has no share premium account as all it
did initially was to issue its shares at par and it has never raised
share capital since and is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column846" />Column number: 847</div>entirely dependent upon retained profits for its increase in shareholder
funds, or whether a company has done the exact reverse.</div>
<a name="06072035000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">By doing the exact reverse, the
company would have distributed a large proportion of its profits by way
of dividend and then, from time to time, when it needed to replenish
its share capital, issued rights issues. In that case it would have a
substantial share premium account because it would not have been able
to go to the market successively to raise capital in that way unless
the share price had performed well and gone well above the par value.
It would have a substantial share premium account and perhaps small
reserves. It has absolutely no significance in terms of the value of
the company and its operations which of those two options the company
chose.</div><a name="06072035000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us take a
company that has been around for 100 years. I cannot think of
one offhand but I can think of companies that have been public-quoted
companies for 80 years, such as BP or what remains of ICI. Who cares
whether in 1938 or 1953 BP or ICI did a rights issue or whether at that
stage in their life they retained a large amount of their earnings? It
is not even a matter of historical interest as the phrase
&#147;historical interest&#148; implies some causal significance.
It is a matter of merely antiquarian curiosity at best.</div>
<a name="06072035000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">If that is the case, we have to
look again at the whole issue of the extent to which the payment of
dividends should be restrained not by share capital as a whole, but by
the amounts of specific share capital that are defined as being nominal
capital or share premium account or reserves or whatever. Of course,
equity capital as a whole is extremely important. The total to which
those four categories amount is extremely important in the life of a
company, but the artificial categories into which the equity capital is
traditionally divided are not. In fact, the only economic interest is
twofold: in a company&#146;s total equity capital in relation to its
financial liabilities&#151;in other words, its gearing and financial
risk, which we all know is important&#151;and in its equity capital
in relation to its trading risks. We all know that a well-managed
company will match and balance the two. If a company has, by the nature
of its activities, a high degree of trading risk and a high volatility
of earnings, it would be wrong for it to add financial risk to that
operational risk through high leverage. If, on the other hand, a
company has a very low volatility of earnings, it may be not only
responsible but desirable for it to increase its debt to bring the
weighted average cost of capital down to the minimum level. The total
amount of equity capital is enormously important, but the rather
curious distinctions that we traditionally make are of no importance
whatever.</div><a name="06072035000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second
matter that I wish to raise is a practical problem that we must
address. Under the European directive&#151;I think that it is the
fourth accounting directive, but someone will correct me if I am wrong,
for instance my hon. Friend the Member for Putney (Justine Greening),
who is an expert on such matters&#151;international financial
reporting standards have been introduced throughout the European Union
for all quoted companies in their consolidated accounts. That came in
last year, so this year is the first in which every such company has
had to produce consolidated accounts according to IFRS. Some of them
will have 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column847" />Column number: 848</div>been doing so for a year or two. The provision applies only to
consolidated accounts of quoted
companies.</div><a name="06072035000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">IFRS is a
form of so-called true value accounting. In other words, it is intended
to show the real value of a company much more accurately than did
previous general accounting principles. It therefore requires that
companies mark to market their liabilities and assets, including
derivative liabilities and assets&#151;derivative finance may be an
asset or a liability, depending on whether a company is in the money.
Companies must market, for example, non-realised real estate assets
that might previously have been carried at historic costs with some
adjustments. Importantly, it also requires companies to market
long-term liabilities such as pension liabilities. It is no longer
possible for companies to understate or smooth those liabilities, as
they could under the previous system of general accounting
principles.</div><a name="06072035000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">The effect
of IFRS, true value accounting, marking to market and the full force of
the provisions is an inevitable increase in the volatility of a
company&#146;s earnings. They also have the effect, of which public
companies are conscious, of an increase in the risks and volatility of
earnings derived from factors beyond the control of a company&#146;s
directors. It is often beyond the ability of directors to make clear
and comfortable predictions about the risks involved. Such risks can
be, for instance, an actuary&#146;s decision to revalue a pension
deficit or what happens in the markets to the value of derivative
liabilities or assets carried in a company&#146;s balance sheet, and
they can be difficult to predict. In many cases such volatility has
meant that a company with constant or growing trading earnings from its
normal operations has found itself unable to pay a dividend from its
profit and loss account because that account has been wiped out by the
provisions in
question.</div><a name="06072035000198"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.45
am</div><a name="06072035000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second
aspect of IFRS is that it has involved the introduction of new, much
stricter rules in the important matter of taking profits out of
acquisitions. Pre-acquisition profits must be accounted for as a
reduction in the net cost of an acquisition rather than as a dividend
from the company concerned. I do not want to go into the merits or
demerits of that. Some interesting intellectual arguments can always be
had about all those accounting rules and conventions. That is a fact;
it is the way in which IFRS has determined that one should account for
profits of acquired subsidiaries. That again substantially reduces the
ability of certain companies to show profits from those dividends and
therefore to declare a dividend.</div>
<a name="06072035000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is extremely undesirable
that companies should, as a result merely of the change in accounting
standards, have to change their distribution policy, in other words
that they should have to decide that they can no longer pursue what
they otherwise would pursue by way ofa pay-out of dividend,
whether by use of a dividend, a share-buying programme or other ways of
giving a current return to shareholders. Why is it undesirable? It is
undesirable in principle because it reduces capital mobility in the
economy and is likely over time to reduce the average return on capital
employed in the economy, which is a serious matter for us all. It is
undesirable for certain types of shareholder, such as 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column848" />Column number: 849</div>investment trusts, which can pay out by way of dividends only what they
receive by way of dividends, and, indeed, pension funds, which require
dividends in order to pay pensions. We have every interest, I think, in
maintaining the viability of pension funds to the extent to which we
can as they have faced a lot of threats, challenges and handicaps in
the past few years, as we all know. I do not need to go into
that.</div> <a name="06072035000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">The application
of IFRS is introducing a degree of artificiality. I do not wish to
challenge IFRS, as much of it is well conceived. I most certainly do
not wish to challenge the EU accounting directors, because it is highly
desirable that we should have the same rules and playing field
throughout the single market. It is very important for the operation of
the single market and the integrity, comprehensibility and transparency
of our financial markets that that should be the case.</div>
<a name="06072035000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">We face a practical problem.
Over the past year or two, companies facing that problem have been able
to find a particular way round it. The directive in question&#151;I
see that my hon. Friend the Member for Putney has come back and perhaps
she can remind me whether it is the fourth directive&#151;to which I
have already referred, provides that from this year public quoted
companies must present their consolidated accounts according to IFRS.
They do not have currently to present their subsidiary accounts,
including their holding company accounts, according to IFRS. They will
have to do that in three years&#146; time, in 2009, in relation to
the 2008 trading year. I believe that that is the year in which it will
come in.</div> <a name="06072035000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">That means,
since it is not the consolidated companies, or the consolidated group,
but the holding company that pays the dividend, that it has been
possible for companies to continue to account in their subsidiaries and
their holding company according to the previous generally accepted
accounting principles, or GAAP, and then to present their consolidated
accounts according to IFRS. Within the area covered by GAAP, they
simply have their subsidiary companies declare dividends, pass them up
the chain to the holding company and the holding company decides to
declare a dividend to shareholders on the basis of the stream of
dividends that it has itself received from the operating subsidiaries
of the group. One might say that that is fine, but there are two
problems.</div> <a name="06072035000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">First, I do
not think that any of us should be satisfied with a situation in which
companies essentially account according to two different sets of
principles within the same group. There cannot be good transparency and
it is impossible for shareholders to follow what is going on because
they cannot relate the dividend that they receive, which is related to
the holding company&#146;s profit, to the profit that appears in the
consolidated accounts that they are sent. That is an undesirable
situation in the first place.</div>
<a name="06072035000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, such accounting is
expensive, particularly in this country where, unfortunately, companies
have to produce a separate set of accounts for the Revenue.
Essentially, companies will undergo the costs of preparing in parallel
three different sets of accounts according to different accounting
principles&#151;as we know, the Revenue has its own accounting
principles, with taxable profit defined separately from accounting
profit. Of course the change will be good for the accounting profession
and I will lose a few friends in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column849" />Column number: 850</div>that profession by saying this, no doubt, but I do not believe that it
can be in the country&#146;s interest to impose statutory levels of
additional, gratuitous and unnecessary compliance costs on companies
that have that particular system.</div>
<a name="06072035000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">The other problem with that
solution is that it is coming to an end. The party is coming to an
end&#151;we are going to run into the bumpers in three years&#146;
time, and companies will quite rightly no longer be able to account
according to different principles in their operating subsidiaries and
holding companies. They will have to apply IFRS throughout the
groups.</div><a name="06072035000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">How will
dividends be paid out in those circumstances? That is the practical
problem. There is also the philosophical problem&#151;the problem of
the principal, and the problem of the definition of equity capital and
of the extent and modalities according to which it should define the
ability of a company to pay a dividend. The practical problem is the
problem imposed by the introduction of IFRS on companies continuing to
pay dividends at the present
time.</div><a name="06072035000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">I brought those
two problems together and produced two separate solutions. One solution
is included in my amendments Nos. 357 and 358, and a quite different
one is set out in my new clause 437. Even if we were not in the
peculiar situation of everybody voting against their own clauses, I
would still not put amendments Nos. 357 and 358 to a vote, for reasons
that I will explain. However, they would provide a solution, in the
sense that they would permit public and private companies, as well as
quoted and unquoted companies, to pay dividends out of their capital,
provided that the directors made a solvency statement in accordance
with clauses 570 and 571.</div>
<a name="06072035000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">That would solve the problem.
In that situation, the directors could decide what would be a
responsible level of payout to make to their shareholders. They could
make that payment as long as the money was there, whether it was in a
share premium, reserves, a nominal capital or a profit and loss
account. The money could all come out of the equity capital, in which
case the directors would have to make the statement as set out clause
571 as it is, in which they say that the company, having paid that
money out, will nevertheless be able to meet its debts and remain as a
going concern for 12 months.</div>
<a name="06072035000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">Is that a solution? Well, it is
a theoretical solution, which we have to consider, and that is why I
brought it forward in the way I did. However, I will not put the
amendment to the vote, and if anybody else did so, I would vote against
it. I shall explain why. The solution is not adequate, nor is it right.
I would not follow it if I was a director of a company, as it is not
sufficiently prudent. The solvency statement provides that the
directors take the view that the company can continue to meet its
liabilities for the following 12 months, which might give some comfort
to the creditors. Of course, it is not reasonable to expect directors
to take a view beyond that period.</div>
<a name="06072035000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">I can see why the solvency
statement is defined as it is in both the 1985 Act and the Bill, but it
does not provide a responsible way to manage a company. There is no
concept at all of the sustainability of the company or of the company
retaining the resources required to ensure that it has the capacity to
create value in the future, which is a short-termist concept. What
happens 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column850" />Column number: 851</div>after 12 months? Who cares what happens after 12 months? That kind of
attitude is not acceptable. No responsible company director would want
to declare a dividend in normal circumstances in that situation. If a
company was going to be wound up&#151;part of clause 571 provides for
that eventuality&#151;different considerations would apply.</div>
<a name="06072035000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">The proposed solution is
therefore not satisfactory from that point of view, and it is not
legally possible in any case, because it would conflict with the second
company law directive, which says that companies cannot pay dividends
out of their share capital, which the jurisprudence interprets as
nominal share capital. I am therefore not putting forward that
solution.</div><a name="06072035000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having
rejected that solution, I had to think of a better one, which is set
out in new clause 437. At first sight it might look complicated, but it
is not complicated at all. I simply propose that, in so far as a
company pays a dividend out of its operating cash flow&#151;that is,
its cash flow from trading operations&#151;after depreciation, so
that it takes account of the need to renew its existing fixed or other
assets and maintain them at least at the same level of productive
capacity, that company can pay a dividend to shareholders out of the
remaining sum. I define that in what is actually a simple linear
equation, although it might look slightly intimidating. I only do
linear equations; I do not do differentials. Such things are not
difficult to follow.</div><a name="06072035000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have set out a standard definition of operating cash flow: sales
amounts costed with sales, minus general administrative expenses, minus
the interest and tax charges, minus the difference in the working
capital requirement. Anybody can know what those quantities amount to
for any company, because they are all declared in the profit and loss
account. If there were changes to the working capital requirement, two
successive balance sheets would be required. That is simple. One takes
the sum of those calculations&#151;a company&#146;s operating cash
flow&#151;and then provides for the depreciation charge. An
accountant may say, &#147;I am mixing cash-flow quantities with an
accruals item and I should not be doing that. But I am deliberately
doing so, because I am taking the operating cash flow and saying that
one provision that a company must make is to renew its capital
equipment and keep going as a capital concern.&#148; A company may be
investing in addition to the depreciation charge, which is normally
healthy. That is fine; it can borrow or raise new equity capital for
that purpose, because that is outside the operating cash flow
area.</div><a name="06072035000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">I take the
operating cash flow, minus the depreciation charge, which could be
defined as the operating profit, and say that a company can responsibly
pay a dividend out of that. However, it is fine if that eats into the
capital and reserves&#151;currently regarded as
non-distributable&#151;or into the share premium account. I
understand that that situation applies elsewhere in the European Union.
The second company law directive has been interpreted
elsewhere&#151;certainly, in France&#151;to allow companies to pay
a dividend out of the share premium
account.</div><a name="06072035000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have a
proposal that stands up in terms of financial theory and good business
practice and also stands up against the current requirements of EU law.
That is my contribution to resolving this
problem.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06072035000254"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> My hon. Friend spoke eloquently about what he
believes to be the relevance of the share premium account and the UK
anti-capital reduction laws. I have some sympathy with what he said,
although his amendments deal with rather more specific points than the
overall share capital laws. If we were to consider this matter in more
detail, we would need a full debate on the value of the share premium
account, which he came round to in his closing
remarks.</div><a name="06072035000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">Perhaps
something happened during the consultation at some point; I should be
interested to hear if that was so. However, today we are considering
whether a public company should have the same carve-outs from the
protection of capital rules that a private company current has. That
applies to my hon. Friend&#146;s amendments Nos. 357 and 358 in
relation to the reduction of share capital and to the amendment tabled
in my name and the names of my hon. Friends the Members for Reigate
(Mr. Blunt) and for Hornchurch (James Brokenshire), dealing
with the power of a company to redeem or purchase the same shares out
of capital.</div><a name="06072035000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">These
probing amendments are useful in finding out the extent to which the
Government reviewed the existing law in introducing the relevant
clauses. If a public company undertook a statutory declaration and the
resolution and complied with all the other requirements, why should it
not be permitted to do the same as a private
company?</div><a name="06072035000129"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06072035000255"></a>Vera
Baird:</b> The hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford advanced
an excellent and hugely impressive analysis. First, on his new clause
437, he advanced an issue of principle, or a theoretical problem, by
asking what equity capital is and how it should constrain the payment
of dividends. We acknowledge that the distinction between nominal share
capital, share premium account, equity reserves and so on, does not
make a great deal of conceptual sense. The hon. Gentleman puts forward
an arguable case and is right to say that that complex matter requires
more
thought.</div><a name="06072035000199"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10
am</div><a name="06072035000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the hon.
Gentleman rightly said, our public arrangements are constrained by
Europe, which makes it difficult to propose radical reform. We do not
think it would be right to make piecemeal reform of the kind proposed
here. In essence, that is why we want to take the powers proposed later
in the Bill. That will allow for a good deal of further thought on that
complicated analysis, and for broader reforms, rather than piecemeal
ones such as those proposed
here.</div><a name="06072035000131"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06072035000256"></a>Mr.
Davies:</b> I am most grateful for those kind remarks about my
suggestions, but the remedy that the Minister is proposing is not
satisfactory. In relation to the matters I have raised this morning,
how can we have a serious discussion in a statutory instrument
Committee on to which people are press ganged at the last moment and
without preparation, that has a time constraint and in which no one can
propose amendments? Such parliamentary scrutiny is an affront to
democracy&#151;it happens every day and, frankly, it is a scandal.
She is suggesting that those complex issues, on 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column852" />Column number: 853</div>which she acknowledges the importance of preserving real discussion and
debate, should be treated in such a dismissive
fashion.</div><a name="06072035000132"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06072035000257"></a>Vera
Baird:</b> It is not dismissive and it is folly to make such a
fuss about a procedure that has been used for an extraordinarily long
time. I have cogent views on how statutory instruments are taken
through the House. The point has less to do with the procedure and more
with the consultation that comes before it.</div>
<a name="06072035000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was seeking to indicate that
the hon. Gentleman has put forward a complex and persuasive
case&#151;indeed, at one time he almost persuaded me to accept the
amendments that he then was not sure would suffice. I cannot
overestimate the extent to which he has made a persuasive case for
having a close look at those two issues. This is a question not of
procedure, but of having help to alert us to the need for a further
look at those matters and the consultation that will follow, which will
be substantial.</div><a name="06072035000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of
course, we looked at those issues in the company law review and,
realistically, that is as much as I can say about new clause 437. It
is, on the face of it, a cogent proposal to address the theoretical
criticisms and problems that the hon. Gentleman presented, but we are
not satisfied that thought has gone into it sufficient for us to accede
to his request.</div><a name="06072035000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I
said, the hon. Gentleman persuaded me practically that his amendments
Nos. 357 and 358 meet what I think he referred to as the
&#147;practical problem&#148;&#151;we acknowledge, the
potentially major problem&#151;but there is no easy solution.
Clearly, the detail and complexity of his analysis and his obvious
experience and expertise led him to believe that the two amendments
would meet that problem. The fact that he now argues away from
them&#151;for a second time, convincingly&#151;demonstrates the
immense complexity of the matter that he rightly
raised.</div><a name="06072035000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">We need to
look at that matter, although there is no simple solution, as I said.
If the hon. Gentleman is prepared to assist us to reach a better
solution than even he has yet arrived at, we would be immensely
grateful. However, I think he can appreciate, from the
generous&#151;not overgenerous&#151;way in which I addressed his
arguments, that we take the point that this is a major issue requiring
further
thought.</div><a name="06072035000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">Altogether
simpler to deal with is the question that the hon. Member for
Huntingdon asked about the extent to which we have considered the
import of the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Grantham and
Stamford, those being about the extension to public companies of the
solvency statement preceding a capital reduction, which would mean that
they did not have to apply to court to reduce their share
capital.</div><a name="06072035000138"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06072035000258"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> On the conclusion of the Minister&#146;s
remarks on the point made by my hon. Friend, is she saying that she
intends to initiate such a
review?</div><a name="06072035000139"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06072035000259"></a>Vera
Baird:</b> I shall carry on dealing with those points, if I
may, and find out the procedure that we intend to follow, having
acknowledged that the point is serious.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column853" />Column number: 854</div><a name="06072035000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the point about extension of
solvency statements to public companies, the company law review
recommended that the solvency statement procedure for capital reduction
should be available, and we developed that recommendation in the 2002
White Paper, &#147;Modernising Company Law&#148;. However, to meet
unavoidable EU requirements that apply to reduction of capital by
public companies, it would have been necessary to build substantial
additional safeguards into the procedure. In particular, it would have
been necessary to give creditors of public companies the right to
object to the court. The proposed procedure would therefore of
necessity have been significantly more complicated than that for
private companies.</div>
<a name="06072035000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">The response to the
consultation was mixed. Although many respondents were in favour of
simplifying the procedure for capital reductions for public companies,
it was felt that the required additional safeguards would make the
solvency statement procedure significantly less attractive and that
very few public companies would be likely to want to use the
procedure.</div><a name="06072035000142"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06072035000260"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Is that because the procedure applicable to
private companies, combined with the requirement to go to court, would
have been more complicated than the existing system for public
companies, which involves going to court
anyway?</div><a name="06072035000143"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06072035000261"></a>Vera
Baird:</b> Yes. It seemed that there was not much of an
advantage, given that the issue would be bound to end up in court. The
Government therefore concluded that there would be little point in
extending the solvency statement procedure for capital reductions to
public companies.</div><a name="06072035000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
return to the question whether the Government intend to initiate a
review on the point raised by the hon. Member for Grantham and
Stamford, we will have further discussions with interested parties. In
light of those discussions, the European position, and the
international accounting laws to which the hon. Gentleman referred, we
shall look keenly for a solution to what are complex problems. I
acknowledge that the problems have not been solved by this discussion,
but they have been expanded on and elucidated&#151;certainly for me.
We shall proceed as I have indicated and I invite the hon. Gentleman
not to press the
amendment.</div><a name="06072035000145"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06072035000262"></a>Mr.
Davies:</b> I am certainly grateful for the Minister&#146;s
kind and, more importantly, considered and reflective response. I am
delighted that she will now be launching a discussion and a
consultation. If the remark that she made just now was an invitation to
participate in such a consultation&#151;other than in the context of
a statutory instrument Committee, which I consider an insulting waste
of time for any parliamentarian on any subject, particularly a
complicated one like this&#151;I would be delighted to do so. In any
event, in light of the Government&#146;s response, I shall not press
the
amendment.</div><a name="06072035000146"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06072035000263"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I am impressed with the Minister&#146;s
response and her offer of further consultation will be well received. I
understand and agree with what she 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column854" />Column number: 855</div>said about procedures for public companies being more complicated if the
amendments were
made.</div><a name="06072035000147"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06072035000264"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06072035000267"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> We come to the provisions on financial
assistance. As every practitioner will know, this is one of the more
complex and difficult provisions in the 1985 Act. It is the bugbear of
many a corporate lawyer, and causes bewilderment to many a company. The
basic premise of the Government&#146;s approach is therefore
welcome.</div><a name="06072035000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 574
will replace section 151 of the 1985 Act with proposed new sections 151
and 151A&#151;I presume that those numbers will change on
consolidation. The prohibition on the giving of financial assistance by
private companies for the purchase of shares is to be abolished.
Proposed new section 151(1) retains the prohibition on public companies
giving financial assistance, and extends the provision on
post-acquisition assistance. The latter is prohibited for public
companies if they are public at the time the assistance is given. That
will be hugely welcomed by companies and practitioners, who have to
spend a lot of time dealing with such
matters.</div><a name="06072035000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments, which were suggested by the Law Society, are designed to
make it clear that the financial assistance rules do not apply to the
purchase by a company of its own shares on the basis that a statutory
regime applying capital maintenance to the purchase of own shares
already exists.</div><a name="06072035000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
prevailing legal view is that the financial assistance rules do not
apply to the purchase of own shares, but although section 155(3)(d) of
the 1985 Act provides specifically that section 151 does not prohibit 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column855" />Column number: 856</div>the redemption or purchase of shares in accordance with that Act, there
is some doubt, reinforced by comments made in the Chaston case, as to
whether the financial assistance rules have no application in those
circumstances, or whether anything done for the purpose of enabling a
purchase of own shares to take place might nevertheless contravene the
financial assistance
rules.</div><a name="06072035000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">A typical
example is when, to finance the purchase of own shares, a company
borrows money or gives security. Considerable additional legal costs
and expenses are being incurred by companies and their financiers on
that
point.</div><a name="06072035000164"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06072035000268"></a>Vera
Baird:</b> The prohibition is on the giving of financial
assistance to a person acquiring shares in a company when the financial
assistance in question is by the company. The amendments would mean
that references to &#147;person&#148; did not include the company,
and anything that the company did to buy back its own shares would
therefore not constitute unlawful financial
assistance.</div><a name="06072035000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman has acknowledged the predominant view, which is that
construing references to &#147;person&#148; to include the company
is not commonly accepted. It is at odds with article 23 of the second
directive, implemented by section 151, which envisages a
&#147;person&#148; as being a third party. In our view, references
to &#147;person&#148; do not include the company
itself.</div><a name="06072035000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman might say that we should put the matter beyond doubt by
accepting the amendments, but he, like all lawyers, knows the risk of
amending existing statutory provisions; it implies that the existing
provisions meant something else&#151;for instance, that references to
&#147;person&#148; included the company before the change occurred.
In the long run, that might lead to more
difficulties.</div><a name="06072035000200"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.15
am</div><a name="06072035000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
353 is consequential to the other amendments, so I shall not argue them
separately. I hope that the hon. Gentleman agrees that the proposed
change is unnecessary and the ever-present danger that I have pointed
out makes it undesirable.</div>
<a name="06072035000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Gentleman will be
amused to hear that I have read the case of Chaston&#151;the first
company law case that I have read since I was a 19-year-old
undergraduate. I am massively impressed by the learned reasoning of
Lady Justice Arden, who seems to be the ultimate company lawyer. If it
is helpful&#151;I know that the case was raised in the Law
Society&#146;s submission&#151;I shall do my best to take him
through what I have concluded her paragraph 47 refers to. I have been
immensely assisted by the advice of officials.
</div><a name="06072035000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph 47 of the
judgment of Lady Justice Arden on Chaston <i class="I">v.</i> SWP Group plc could
appear to contemplate that a company could provide assistance to
itself. It has to be read in context. Lady Justice Arden explains why
the reasoning of Mr. Justice Davis in paragraph 14 of
Chaston&#151;he referred to it as the second reason for his
finding&#151;which Lady Justice Arden and her colleagues were
overturning was wrong or too strongly expressed. Mr. Justice
Davis, the first instance judge, had pointed to the words &#147;by
that or 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column856" />Column number: 857</div>another person&#148; in section 151(2) in support of his view that a
liability incurred bona fide in what the directors believed was the
best interests of the company was not directly or indirectly for the
purpose of acquisition of its shares. With respect to the learned judge
at first instance, that seems to be an over-broad view to take. Lady
Justice Arden points out that if Mr. Justice Davis&#146;
construction&#151;that the liability being referred to could not be
that of the company&#151;was correct, it would have the result that
even liabilities incurred by the directors in the name of the company
in breach of duty would be outside the reach of section 151. That would
be both undesirable and nonsensical, so she shows that the reasoning of
Mr. Justice Davis was defective by going beyond what was
needed for his finding.</div>
<a name="06072035000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having conceded the possibility
that, as a matter of statutory construction, &#147;person&#148; in
section 151(2) could include the company&#151;we have already argued
that for reasons of consistency with EU law that is not the way in
which it should be read&#151;Lady Justice Arden goes on to refer to
the grant of a security by an unlimited company. She contextualises it
pretty effectively in paragraph 47 of her judgment, in which she says,
referring to the first instance
judge:</div><a name="06072035000191"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
judge&#146;s second reason was based on section 151(2). I agree it
would be an unusual case where a company provides assistance to itself.
On the other hand, it is possible that an acquisition of shares may be
an acquisition of shares by the company
itself.&#148;</div><a name="06072035000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">She compares the
use of the word acquire in that instance to its use in other sections
of the 1985 Act and
continues,</div><a name="06072035000192"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
those circumstances, the liability referred to in the opening clause of
section 151(2) may be a liability incurred by the company itself in
order to purchase shares in itself, for example, the grant of security
by an unlimited company to secure a borrowing raised to purchase its
own shares.&#148;</div><a name="06072035000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of
course, unlimited companies are not subject to the general prohibition
on companies acquiring their own shares and it follows that there is no
need for unlimited companies to be subject to the special rules
enabling limited companies to purchase their own shares in particular
circumstances. If Lady Justice Arden thought that a purchase of own
shares in accordance with the special rules applying to limited
companies could fall foul of section 151, there would have been no
reason for her, extraordinarily, to refer to unlimited companies, which
are relatively rare and are not subject to those rules at all. She
seems to have set up an argument in order to show that Mr.
Justice Davies was wrong and then posited very unusual
circumstances&#151;the only way in which her argument could apply.
She sets the case up only to undermine it and knock it down; at the
same time she very successfully demonstrates the flaw in Mr.
Justice Davies&#146;s argument. It seems pretty clear to us, although
it is a complicated process of reading and following to arrive at it,
that the hon. Gentleman has nothing whatever to worry
about.</div><a name="06072035000173"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06072035000272"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The purpose of the amendment is to make it clear
that the prohibition does not apply to financial assistance given by a
foreign subsidiary of a UK company. The amendment is designed to give
statutory effect to the decision in Arab Bank plc<i class="I">v.</i>
Mercantile Holdings Ltd 1994 in which it was held that the statutory
prohibition on a company giving financial assistance for the purpose of
acquiring shares in the company or its holding company does not apply
to the giving of assistance by a subsidiary incorporated in an overseas
jurisdiction to a person acquiring shares in its British parent
company, not least because we are now revising the law and would not
wish to leave room for this to be interpreted again. It would be
helpful if the decision were reflected in the statute. The textbooks
have that position as stated law and the amendment is a belt-and-braces
provision.</div><a name="06072035000178"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06072035000273"></a>Vera

what we can to address the

15.</div><a name="06072035000182"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06072035000276"></a>The
Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to discuss
amendment No. 472, in
clause574,page280,line11,leave
out &#145;twelve&#146; and insert
&#145;six&#146;.</div><a name="06072035000183"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06072035000277"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The purpose of the amendment is, first, to query
the appropriateness of criminal sanctions for offences under the
clause. I thought that there were proposals to change them to civil
penalties. It would be helpful if the Minister told us how many
criminal charges there have been in this respect. I imagine it is not
many. Secondly, if the offences are to remain criminal offences, why is
the sentence half as long if the crime is committed in
Scotland?</div><a name="06072035000184"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06072035000278"></a>Vera
Baird:</b> Amendment No. 471 would completely remove the
penalty that attaches to the offence of a public company providing
prohibited financial assistance. Obviously it would be pointless to say
that something is unlawful if there is no sanction for doing it. Should
the penalty be imprisonment or some lesser penalty? We believe that a
constraint must be kept for public companies and that it would be most
effective if associated with a criminal penalty at the proposed
level.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column858" />Column number: 859</div><a name="06072035000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Gentleman is asking why
the offence is a criminal offence, but I think that I have summed up
our view. Comment has been made on proportionality in relation to the
law reforms that we are making. The Hampton review and the company law
review considered decriminalising some regulatory offences and giving
greater emphasis to administrative penalties. However, consultation and
evaluation found that the use of criminal offences was the more
proportionate and efficient way to enforce regulatory requirements.
Offences are less likely to be committed if they are backed up by
criminal penalties. Criminal sanctions are 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column859" />Column number: 860</div>appropriate, proportionate and essential for effective enforcement of
breaches, but the underlying threat of prosecution enables authorities
to exercise a progressive approach to enforcement that secures
compliance without prosecution. The element of criminality behind the
provision enables that
approach.</div><a name="06072035000186"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">It being
